  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how full-term and pre-term infants' brains relate to
      their movement and development throughout the first two years of life. All infants who
      participate in this study will have a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain prior to
      discharge from the hospital. Infants will then have follow-up appointments every 3-6 months
      at home or at the Infant Motor Behavior Laboratory at the University of Delaware. The
      follow-up sessions will test how infants change their movements to respond to interesting
      objects or sounds in their environment. It is hoped that the results of this study will
      assist clinicians in developing better testing and treatment methods for those infants at
      risk for developmental problems.
