  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the amount of anxiety and pain felt by children
      during procedures that require a needle stick after using a topical anesthetic or placebo
      cream.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients frequently receive eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) or other
      anesthetic medications prior to venipuncture. However, the time for the anesthetic to take
      affect is approximately 60 minutes. Another anesthetic medication besides EMLA is lidocaine
      4% topical anesthetic cream (LMX4), which has a shorter acting time (30 minutes) compared to
      the EMLA, making it a more desirable medication when urgent labs are required. This
      medication is being evaluated to assess the anxiety and pain associated with venipuncture in
      15 minutes versus the approved 30 minutes of pediatric patients treated as an inpatient or
      outpatient in the local Emergency Department, compared to standard care (no prior treatment).

    <measure>Pain From Venipuncture</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain was measured immediately after venipuncture.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was measured immediately after venipuncture by the participant using the six-point FACES scale. &quot;FACES&quot; in not an acronym, but rather a description of a pain scale that uses pictures of faces in various states of pain. The FACES pain scale is a common scale used to measure pain with scores on a scale. The scale we used had six points from zero (0) to five (5) indicating different levels of pain. Lower scores indicate lower levels of pain, and higher scores indicate higher levels of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety of Venipuncture</measure>
    <time_frame>During venipuncture</time_frame>
    <description>Participant anxiety was measured by the study participant and the objective observer before (anticipatory), during (venipuncture) and after (recovery) venipuncture using a validated visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a validated scale that is used to detect small changes in many types of observations. The scale ranges from 0-100 scores on a scale, and here the higher scores indicate higher anxiety levels. Only the participant's mean venipuncture (during venipuncture) anxiety scores are presented in outcome measure results here.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at one site of a multi-site, academic, community emergency department. Children between the ages of five and 18 years of age were considered for enrollment into the study if they were seen in the emergency department (ED) and a physician order was placed for intravenous cannulation or labs to be drawn by venipuncture.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A convenience sample was utilized due to the availability of the research study coordinator who completed the enrollment from 7 am to 5 pm Monday through Friday. One participant was excluded from analysis due to ineligibility.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Anxiety of Venipuncture</title>
        <description>Participant anxiety was measured by the study participant and the objective observer before (anticipatory), during (venipuncture) and after (recovery) venipuncture using a validated visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a validated scale that is used to detect small changes in many types of observations. The scale ranges from 0-100 scores on a scale, and here the higher scores indicate higher anxiety levels. Only the participant's mean venipuncture (during venipuncture) anxiety scores are presented in outcome measure results here.</description>

        <title>Pain From Venipuncture</title>
        <description>Pain was measured immediately after venipuncture by the participant using the six-point FACES scale. &quot;FACES&quot; in not an acronym, but rather a description of a pain scale that uses pictures of faces in various states of pain. The FACES pain scale is a common scale used to measure pain with scores on a scale. The scale we used had six points from zero (0) to five (5) indicating different levels of pain. Lower scores indicate lower levels of pain, and higher scores indicate higher levels of pain.</description>
