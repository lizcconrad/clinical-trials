  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We would like to test the effect of opioid medication on pain sensitivity in subjects who
      have been diagnosed with a sleep disorder called Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) compared to
      other subjects without OSA. Patients with OSA may have an altered sensitivity to the
      sedative, analgesic, and respiratory depressant effects of opioids.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients who suffer from
      moderate-to-severe OSA have increased pain thresholds and are more sensitive to the analgesic
      effects of opioids compared to patients with normal sleep-related breathing physiology. We
      will evaluate the effect of remifentanil, a short acting mu-opioid receptor agonist, on pain
      using an experimental heat and cold-induced pain tests, and compare it between volunteers
      with and without a polysomnography (PSG)-based diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.

    <measure>Experimental Cold-induced Pain - IGFBP-1</measure>
    <time_frame>2 to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of insulin growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), a serum hypoxia marker, on the change of cold-induced pain thresholds under remifentanil was estimated using a mixed linear regression model. The results were expressed by the estimated beta (95% CI), indicating how much the change in the cold pain threshold (expressed in seconds) under remifentanil, was altered per unit of change in the IGFBP-1. For example, for every 1-pg/mL increase in the serum level of IGFBP-1, cold pain threshold will additionally increase by 0.0025 seconds for every 1-mcg/mL increase in the plasma level of remifentanil.</description>

The results were expressed by the estimated betas (95% CI), indicating how much the change in the heat pain threshold (expressed in C') under remifentanil, was altered per unit of change in the IGFBP-1. For example, for every 1-pg/mL increase in serum level of IGFBP-1, the heat pain threshold will additionally decrease by 0.0001 'C for every 1-mcg/mL increase in the plasma level of remifentanil.</description>

The results were expressed by the estimated betas (95% CI), indicating how much the change in the cold pain threshold (expressed in seconds) under remifentanil, was altered per unit of change in the SaO2. For example, for every 1-%-absolute decrease in the nadir SaO2, the cold pain threshold will additionally increase by 0.9694 seconds for every 1-mcg/mL increase in the plasma level of remifentanil.</description>

          <title>Experimental Cold-induced Pain - IGFBP-1</title>
          <description>The effect of insulin growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), a serum hypoxia marker, on the change of cold-induced pain thresholds under remifentanil was estimated using a mixed linear regression model. The results were expressed by the estimated beta (95% CI), indicating how much the change in the cold pain threshold (expressed in seconds) under remifentanil, was altered per unit of change in the IGFBP-1. For example, for every 1-pg/mL increase in the serum level of IGFBP-1, cold pain threshold will additionally increase by 0.0025 seconds for every 1-mcg/mL increase in the plasma level of remifentanil.</description>
