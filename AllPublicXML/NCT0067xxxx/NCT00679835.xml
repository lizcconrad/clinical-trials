    <textblock>
      This is a research study designed to look at the pharmacokinetics (distribution, breakdown,
      and removal) and tolerability of a single dose of daptomycin in patients aged 2 to 6 years
      who have infections that are caused by a specific group of bacteria (called Gram-positive
      bacteria).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written parental (or appropriate legal representative) informed consent prior to any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care;

          -  Male or female between the ages of 2 and 6 years old, inclusive;

          -  Able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study;

          -  Clinically stable with no evidence of hemodynamic instability (defined as a
             requirement for pharmacological intervention to manage blood pressure) in the 72 hour
             window prior to enrollment, and no history or evidence of renal or hepatic compromise;

          -  Suspected or diagnosed Gram-positive infection for which the subject is receiving
             standard antibiotic therapy;

          -  A calculated creatinine clearance rate (CLcr) â‰¥ 80 ml/min/1.73m2 as determined by the
             Schwartz equation at baseline;

          -  Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels less than 2X ULN (upper limit of normal) at
             baseline.

          -  Presence of two patent intravenous lines (or comparable means of venous access) prior
             to dosing on Study Day 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigational drug use (including daptomycin) or participation in any experimental
             procedure in the 30 days preceding study entry;

          -  Known allergy/ hypersensitivity to daptomycin;

          -  History of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, pulmonary
             (well-controlled asthma is acceptable), gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic,
             autoimmune disease or primary immune deficiency;

          -  Pneumonia as sole Gram-positive infection being treated with standard antibiotics;

          -  Subjects with clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results [including
             electrocardiograms (ECGs)], as determined by Investigator;

          -  Administration of rifampin within 7 days of study drug administration;

          -  Body mass index (BMI) that is outside of the 5th to 95th percentile;

          -  Subjects in whom collection of the required blood volume would put them at risk of
             hemodynamic disturbance (at the discretion of Investigator);

          -  History of or current clinically significant (at the discretion of the Investigator)
             muscular disease, nervous system or seizure disorder;

          -  Administration of intramuscular injection between baseline and study drug
             administration or expected intramuscular injection within 24 hours following dosing;

          -  Expected surgical procedure(s) within 24 hours prior to and following dosing;

          -  Unexplained muscular weakness, history of peripheral neuropathy, Guillian-Barre or
             spinal cord injury;

          -  History of or current rhabdomyolysis.
