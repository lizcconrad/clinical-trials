  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective :

      To demonstrate the superiority of the oral fixed - combination of a muscle relaxant,
      thiocolchicoside (TCC) to a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ketoprofen, over oral TCC,
      on average pain within the last 24 hours in adults suffering from acute non specific low back
      pain with an episode of recent onset

      Secondary Objective :

      To compare the safety of the oral combination to that of oral TCC alone
