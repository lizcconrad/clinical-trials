    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the diagnostic yield with endoscopic mucosal
      resection (EMR) in hirschsprung's disease versus that of standard rectal suction biopsy. In
      order to compare EMR versus rectal suction biopsy, patients' diagnostic specimens will be
      analyzed by tissue size, the presence of submucosal tissue, and positive acteylcholinesterase
      staining. Additionally, the proportion of patients who would have required subsequent full
      thickness surgical biopsy with each technique will be compared. Biopsy results will be
      compared with clinical data including history, Bristol stool scale, anorectal manometry
      results and SITZ markers studies. Finally, the estimated costs that would have been incurred
      with each method will be evaluated.

    <description>EMR is a common procedure in gastroenterology. The technique involves placing a band around a piece of mucosa in the GI tract. The band and the tissue are then removed using a cautery snare. The technique can be used to obtain tissue for diagnostic purposes or to remove lesions for therapeutic purposes.</description>
