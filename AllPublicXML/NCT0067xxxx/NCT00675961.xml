      The primary goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of two alcohol interventions
      administered singly or in combination as an integrated component of TB care provided to
      patients with co-occurring TB and AUDs in Tomsk, Russia. Here we propose two parts of this
      study:

      First, a pilot study to provide Naltrexone to TB patients will be conducted. If feasibility
      and safety are demonstrated, then we will conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the
      following four study arms:

        1. A Behavioral Counseling Intervention (BCI) plus treatment as usual (TAU) (i.e. standard
           referral to and management by an addictions specialist);

        2. Naltrexone/ Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET) plus TAU

        3. BCI + Naltrexone/BBCET plus TAU

        4. TAU The RCT will be conducted only if Naltrexone use proves safe and feasible in the
           pilot study. However, because the pilot does not have a control group and nor is it a
           Phase I clinical trial, we define &quot;safety&quot; here as demonstration of appropriate adverse
           event management and adequate safety monitoring procedures, all of which will also be
           used in the RCT.

      The specific aims of the pilot are:

        1. To determine the feasibility of administering Naltrexone to patients receiving TB
           treatment, and

        2. To assess the safety of administering Naltrexone to patients receiving TB treatment.

      The investigators aim to test the following hypotheses for the pilot: co-administration of
      Naltrexone with TB treatment is feasible and safe in a population of TB patients with AUDs.

      The specific aims of the RCT are:

        1. To compare TB treatment outcomes among patients in each of the three intervention arms
           with the control arm of treatment as usual, and

        2. To compare the change in mean number of heavy drinking days in last month of study
           period compared with baseline among patients in each of the three intervention arms with
           the control arm of treatment as usual.

      The investigators aim to test the following hypotheses for the RCT: Individuals receiving one
      of the three interventions (Naltrexone, BCI or the combination of Naltrexone/BCI) will
      experience better TB outcomes and a greater change in the mean number of heavy drinking days,
      compared with individuals receiving treatment as usual.

      An important aspect of the delivery of these alcohol interventions will be their
      incorporation into TB care and delivery by non-alcohol specialists, i.e. TB physicians. In
      this study, we propose to exploit the strengths of the TB care delivery paradigm (DOTS) by
      linking to this care system the provision of alcohol interventions. In order to develop this
      integrated system, we propose the following innovative approaches to AUD management among TB
      patients:

        1. The Behavioral Counseling Intervention (BCI) will be adapted through iterative
           collaboration of an interdisciplinary team of local and international specialists to
           derive a protocol that is easily integrated into routine patient care by TB physicians.
           This process will include assessment for feasibility and cultural acceptability within
           the Tomsk clinic and the evaluation of TB physicians for adherence to the BCI protocol.

        2. Secondary interventions, incentives and case management, will be implemented to maximize
           the primary BCI intervention delivered by the TB physician and increase patient
           motivation to change drinking behavior. These will be designed to capitalize on similar
           case holding strategies already in place in the Tomsk TB services.

        3. Naltrexone will be delivered in the context of DOTS, administered under direct
           observation administration along with TB medications.

      To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the feasibility of alcohol care when
      delivered as part of routine TB care and to assess this treatment model's impact on both TB
      and alcohol outcomes. If proven feasible and effective, this treatment model could be adapted
      for patients with AUDs and co-occurring medical conditions in other settings. First, this
      model could be used anywhere co-occurring AUDs adversely affect TB outcomes, including the
      United States. Second, this strategy could integrate alcohol treatment with medical care of
      other chronic conditions that are affected by poor adherence due to alcohol use. In
      particular, the greatest global challenge to treating HIV infection in populations with high
      rates of substance use is the successful management of substance use to ensure adherence to
      antiretroviral therapy.
