    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-arm, Phase I, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability and to determine the optimal tolerated regimen(OTR) of pazopanib in combination
      with gemcitabine (Arm A) or pazopanib, gemcitabine, and cisplatin (Arm B) in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 to receive escalating doses
      of pazopanib and gemcitabine or pazopanib, gemcitabine and cisplatin. Dose escalation schemas
      for each study arm are described in the protocol. For each arm, the OTR will be defined as
      the highest dose combination of the agents where no more than one out of six patients
      experiences a dose-limiting toxicity. Six to twelve additional patients in each arm will be
      studied with the OTR to evaluate toxicity and pharmacokinetics. This will allow an assessment
      of potential drug-drug interactions. Antitumor activity will be assessed using RECIST
      criteria.

    <description>Dose Escalation - Patients will be entered into dose cohorts of three patients. Each cohort will be assigned to a dose level for the duration of the study. There will be no intra-patient dose-escalation. The starting dose will be 400 mg daily of pazopanib, and 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine. Intermediate dose levels may also be explored. Intravenous gemcitabine will be given on Day 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 and each subsequent cycle.
Cohort expansion phase - patients will receive gemcitabine alone, at the OTR dose starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Pazopanib will be administered at the OTR beginning on Day 2 Cycle 1 after the last blood sample for gemcitabine analysis is collected, and pazopanib administration will continue for the duration of the study. Patients will return to the clinic on Day 8 of Cycle 1 for simultaneous administration of gemcitabine and pazopanib. On Day 1 of Cycle 2 patients will receive the simultaneous administration of gemcitabine and pazopanib</description>

    <description>Dose Escalation - Patients will be entered into dose cohorts of three patients. Each cohort will be assigned to a dose level for the duration of the study. There will be no intra-patient dose-escalation. The starting dose will be 400 mg daily of pazopanib, 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin. Doses of gemcitabine may range from 600 to 1250 mg/m2. Doses of cisplatin may range from 60 to 80 mg/m2. Intermediate dose levels may also be explored. Pazopanib administered starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, gemcitabine co-administration on Day 1 and 8, and cisplatin on Day 1 in each 21-day cycle.
Cohort expansion - patients will receive gemcitabine and cisplatin alone, at the OTR doses, starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Pazopanib will be administered at the OTR dose beginning on Day 2 of Cycle 1, and pazopanib administration will continue for the duration of the study.
