  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary care physicians can play an important role in reducing tobacco smoking in the
      population. The general practice is a suitable setting for implementing proactive smoking
      interventions, because a large proportion of the population can be regularly reached in a
      favorable psychological state. Further, a trustful interpersonal relationship between the
      practitioners and their patients is supposed to increase the susceptibility to preventive
      measures. However, currently general practitioners are not capitalizing this advantage
      although evidence based treatments are available, which are effective and cost-effective.
      Outreach programs combining educational and practice-based measures have been found to be
      effective in engaging practitioners in screening and in giving advice. Computer expert-system
      and brief counseling interventions, which are based on the Transtheo-retical Model of
      behavior change (TTM), are promising approaches for the entire population of practitioners
      and smoking patients. For large scale implementation, data are needed about the degree of
      integration in every day routine clinical practice that could be achieved by implementing
      such interventions. Objectives: Evaluating different strategies for the implementation of
      proactive smoking interventions in general practices. Methods: In a randomized controlled
      trial, 150 randomly selected general practices of a defined German region will be included.
      The procedure comprises the implementation of 1) an on-site computer expert-system
      intervention, 2) a counseling intervention provided by the practitioner, or 3) the computer
      expert-system plus the counseling intervention. During an implementation phase of one month,
      two on site training sessions and support by phone will be provided. Routine use of the
      interventions will be monitored for the following 6 months. Main outcome measures are the
      number and rate of identified and treated smokers. A follow-up assessment will be realized 12
      months after practice attendance to determine the smoking status of the treated smokers.
