      The trial was designed to demonstrate the comparability of the overall success rate in the
      OP-1 Putty treatment group to the autograft treatment group.

      A controlled, open- label, blinded radiographic assessment, randomized, prospective,
      multicenter, multinational pivotal study in which patients with single level (L3-S1)
      degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (Grade 1 or 2) with spinal stenosis underwent
      decompression and spinal fusion and received OP-1 Putty or autograft. This study was a
      one-sided, non- inferiority trial comparing the overall success between the OP-1 Putty group
      and the control autograft group.
