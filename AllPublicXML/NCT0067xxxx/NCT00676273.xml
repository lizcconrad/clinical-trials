  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TVT-Secur (TVT-S) (Hammock method) and
      TVT-Obturator (TVT-O) suburethral sling procedures have equivalent patient satisfaction and
      clinical efficacy in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence alone or the stress
      component in mixed urinary incontinence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction will be measured by symptom quality of life questionnaires
      (pre-operatively, 3 months and one year) and patient pain will be measured by verbal analogue
      rating scale (post-operative day 1 and day 7). Clinical efficacy will be measured by a cough
      stress test pre-operatively and post-operatively at 3 months and 1 year. A Q-tip test will
      also be performed pre-operatively and at 3 months and 1 year post-operatively. Subjects will
      be followed for a minimum of one year to evaluate recurrence of symptoms and complications,
      including the rate of mesh erosion, time to normal void in the post-operative period, the
      rate of sling revision, post-operative pain, voiding dysfunction and de novo urgency.
