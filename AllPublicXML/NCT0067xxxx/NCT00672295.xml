      Primary objective to determine the maximal tolerated (MTD) of dasatinib in combination with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin during the first cycle of treatment.

      Secondary objectives to describe the toxicity of this combination of therapy; to describe the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters related to this combination; to describe the
      clinical activity as defined as the response rate (complete and partial response rate) and
      progression-free survival &gt; 6 month; to compare the SRC pathway microarray signature in pre
      and post-treatment cancer specimens; to evaluate SRC pathway downstream substrates, FAX,
      paxcillin, and CRK-L in pre and post-treatment cancer specimens.

      This is a phase I multicenter study designed to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD)
      and toxicity of dasatinib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin during the first
      cycle of treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, and tubal
      carcinoma. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6 evaluable
      patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) due to the combination of dasatinib,
      paclitaxel,and carboplatin during the first cycle of treatment.

    <description>Dasatinib will be administered as an oral dose (tablet) as per the dose escalation (50 mg everyday - 250 mg everyday)continuously on days 2-21 in the first cycle (3 weeks) therapy and continuously (days 1-21) throughout the remainder of therapy.
Paclitaxel will be administered on a 21-day schedule. Paclitaxel (150-175 mg/m^2) IV infused over 3 hours on day #1 of each cycle.
Carboplatin (AUC=5-6 mg/,l/min) will be infused over 30-60 minutes every cycle via IV on day 1 of every cycle following the paclitaxel administration.
All patients will be followed until disease progression or study withdrawal. In addition, following disease progression, patients will be monitored for delayed toxicity and survival for a period of 5 years and data entered into eDC, unless is withdrawn.</description>
