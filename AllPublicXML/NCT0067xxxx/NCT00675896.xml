  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy of Quetiapine SR versus placebo over 8 weeks in unipolar
      non-psychotic adult outpatients depression and comorbid fibromyalgia. This will be measured
      by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) mean change from baseline to week 8 on the
      Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) total score.

      For the purposes of this study, response regarding improvement in depressive symptoms will be
      defined as a 50% decrease in HAM-D scores over 8 weeks. Furthermore, proportion of patients
      achieving remission is defined as an HAM-D total score of 7 at end of treatment. The anxiety
      comorbid symptoms often associated with major depression will be assessed with the HAM-A (14
      items) scale. Proportion of patients responding and achieving remission of anxiety symptoms
      are defined respectively as a reduction of 50% in the HAM-A total score from baseline and a
      HAM-A total score of 7 at the end of treatment.

      Secondary Endpoints include

        -  Change from baseline to week 8 in Brief Pain Inventory (short form) total score.

        -  Changes from baseline to week 8 in HAM-A total scores Changes from baseline to week 8 in
           CGI Severity of illness scores. Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) score
           from randomisation to Week 8 Change from baseline in the Fibromyalgia Impact
           Questionnaire (FIQ). Change from baseline in the Sleep Scale from the Medical Outcome
           Study (MOS). Change from baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Change from
           baseline in the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire- Short Form
           (Q-LES-Q-SF).

      Change from baseline in the Patient Health Questionaire-15 (PHQ-15). Change from baseline in
      the Global Assessment Scale (GAS).

      The side effects and the tolerability profiles of Quetiapine SR at the dose range used in the
      study will be assessed at every visit following the initial visit.
