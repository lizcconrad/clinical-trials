      The main objective of the trial is to document the safety of NGR-hTNF administered at low and
      high doses in combination with a standard oxaliplatin based regimen in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer not amenable to any clinical improvement by current standard
      treatments

      Phase II, open-label, non-randomized study that will be conducted in two sequential cohorts
      of patients. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer not amenable to any clinical
      improvement by current standard treatments are planned to be enrolled.
