      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of doxorubicin hydrochloride
      liposome and to see how well it works in treating women with ductal carcinoma in situ
      undergoing surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To demonstrate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant intraductal pegylated liposomal
           doxorubicin hydrochloride in women with ductal breast carcinoma in situ undergoing
           surgery.

        -  To demonstrate the ability to identify and cannulate the duct demonstrating precancerous
           disease in these women.

        -  To integrate the Humboldt Community Breast Health Project into the planning and
           execution of this study.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo identification of the intraductal lesions via cannulization.
      Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLD) intraductally through
      the inserted cannula. Some patients are randomized to receive saline instead of PLD. Within
      4-6 weeks, all patients undergo surgery.

      Patients undergo tissue and ductal fluid sample collection at baseline and at surgery for
      correlative laboratory studies. Tissue samples are assessed for histomorphology,
      proliferation (Ki67), cell death (apoptosis index), genetic markers, necrosis, inflammation,
      and loss of heterozygosity by HE stain, IHC, TUNEL, and PCR. Nipple aspirate and ductal
      lavage fluid samples are analyzed for cytomorphology (cellular atypia), proliferation (Ki67),
      cell death (TUNEL), differentiation (G-actin), and genetic markers (FISH) by quantitative
      fluorescence image analysis. Samples are also analyzed for bFGF and CEA by ELISA, and
      methylation by PCR.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 months for at least 2 years.
