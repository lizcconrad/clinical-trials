    <textblock>
      While parents are considered essential for the effective treatment of adolescents with
      anorexia nervosa, the most effective manner to involve parents in treatment is unknown. Given
      reports of high caregiver burden among parents of this clinical group, finding treatments
      that minimize parent burden while improving the child's eating disorder symptoms is
      essential.

      This investigation will examine the preliminary effectiveness of a parent skills group and
      adolescent skills group compared to family therapy for the treatment of adolescent anorexia
      nervosa. The target of this intervention is the improvement of eating disorder symptoms in
      the child and improving self-efficacy, emotion regulation, and perceived burden in the
      parent.

      The effectiveness of this experimental treatment group (Group Parent Training for the
      parents/Adolescent Skills Training for the adolescent) will be compared to the Maudsley model
      of family therapy. The effectiveness of the group program will be examined by exploring
      changes within individuals over time as well as via comparisons across treatment conditions.
      Results from this investigation will be used to calculate treatment effect sizes in the
      design of a larger, fully powered, randomized clinical trial.
