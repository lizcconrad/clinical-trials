    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand tuberculosis (TB) and the risk of infection
      with TB, in Peru. TB is a disease that is caused by bacteria and transmitted through droplets
      in the air that come from the lungs of an infected person. The risk of infection will be
      compared between two groups: household members, who live with people having TB that does not
      respond well to treatment and household members, who live with people having TB that responds
      well to treatment. Study participants will include 4,500 TB infected people and 22,500 of
      their household contacts. Study procedures include answering a questionnaire, TB skin tests,
      blood samples, and a chest x-ray. Individuals with symptoms indicating TB will be asked to
      provide sputum samples. Individuals with TB will be involved in the study for up to 48
      months; household contacts will be involved in the study for 12 months. The knowledge gained
      from this study will be used to improve tuberculosis control.

      The emergence of drug-resistant and multi-drug resistant Mycobacterium (M) tuberculosis poses
      a significant threat to global tuberculosis (TB) control strategies. The prospective design
      of this study will allow the direct study of infection risk, because the population among
      which the TB cases arise will be identified and monitored over the course of the study. This
      study design will permit the characterization and comparison of TB strains with differential
      success in causing new infections. The study will be conducted within a well-established
      public health TB control program in a region of Peru, where drug-resistant strains already
      account for about 20 percent of new TB cases. This study protocol will be implemented in
      collaboration with the 52 Ministry of Health outpatient health centers in 4 districts of
      Lima, Peru. This will be a prospective cohort study with an enrollment period of 36
      consecutive months. Two types of study subjects will be enrolled: patients found to have
      active TB disease by routine testing (TB index subjects), and the individuals living in the
      households of these patients (household members). Study participants will include 4,500
      subjects with active TB and their approximately 22,500 household members. Ages will range
      from less than 1-100 years. The tuberculin skin test will be used to diagnose latent TB
      infection in the household members. This product is used routinely by health center staff in
      household members who are children in the age group less than1-15 years. In this study
      protocol, it will also be used in all household members age 16 years and older. Each TB index
      subject will remain in the study for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum 48 months. Each
      household member will remain in the study for 12 months. The primary objective of the study
      is to measure the risk of infection in household members of index cases with drug-resistant
      TB compared with the risk of infection in household members of subjects with drug-sensitive
      TB. This refers to household members who are tuberculin-skin-test negative at the beginning
      of follow-up. Secondary study objectives are: to assess the impact of sociodemographic and
      clinical confounders and risk modifiers such as age, sex, comorbidity, human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) infection, nutritional status, and Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination on
      the association between risk of infection and exposure to a drug-resistant or a
      drug-sensitive strain; to measure associations between specific mutations associated with
      drug resistance in M tuberculosis and phenotypes including resistance profile, clinical
      presentations, and transmissibility; to measure the rate of true relapse versus reinfection
      in drug-resistant and drug-sensitive TB subjects using molecular-epidemiologic methods; and
      to measure the rate of reversion (to negative) of the tuberculin skin test among household
      members with a positive tuberculin skin test result. The primary study outcome measure is the
      relative risk of TB infection (by tuberculin skin test) in household members of subjects who
      are sick with drug-resistant M tuberculosis strains compared to household members of subjects
      with drug-sensitive strains. Secondary study outcome measures are the rate of relapse and
      rate of reinfection among TB subjects treated with routine TB therapy by outpatient health
      centers; and the rate of reversion (to negative) of the tuberculin skin test among household
      members with a positive tuberculin skin test result.

        The study population includes two categories of subjects: (1) the 4,000 TB index subjects
        and (2) their approximately 18,000 household members. All of these individuals live in
        Lima, Peru, in the catchment area of the participating public health centers.

        Approximately 50% of study participants will be female. According to the ethnic and racial
        categories used by NIH, all of the study population would be classified as &quot;Hispanic or
        Latino&quot; (Mestizo). None of these participants live within a tribal indigenous culture; all
        speak Spanish while some also speak the indigenous (Quechua) language of their birthplace
        in Peru. At least 75% of this population has some &quot;Amerindian&quot; heritage. Less than 1% of
        individuals are either Asian-Peruvian or Afro-Peruvian in descent.

        Apart from the age restriction (at least 16 years old) for the TB index subjects only,
        there are no other restrictions on participant selection

        Inclusion Criteria:

        TB index subjects

          -  During the enrollment period, the participant is found to have characteristic
             acid-fast bacilli shown by the Ziehl-Neelsen stain on a smear of sputum indicating
             active disease due to M. tuberculosis.

          -  Participant is at least 16 years old at the time of enrollment.

          -  Participant lives in one of the study districts.

          -  If age 18 years or older, participant provides informed consent to participate. If age
             16 or 17 years, a guardian provides informed consent for minor to participate, and the
             minor also provides assent.

        Household members

          -  Participant lives in the same household as an index subject at the time the index
             subject is enrolled in the study.

          -  If eligible participant is age 18 years or older, participant provides informed
             consent to participate. If participant is younger than 18 years, a parent or guardian
             provides informed consent for minor to participate. If eligible participant is age
             10-17 years, the minor also provides assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Apart from the age restriction (age 16 years and older) for the group of TB index
             subjects, no other exclusion criteria apply.

          -  Previous diagnosis with TB disease will not be considered a reason for exclusion from
             the study.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will be eligible to participate in the study.

          -  Prior to beginning routine TB treatment, health center workers provide women with
             routine counseling about the use of contraceptive methods during TB treatment; this is
             not a study activity.

          -  Subjects who live alone will be included in the study and will contribute to
             addressing the third and fourth study objectives.
