      Objective: To compare the effects of the EPAP and the incentive spirometry flow-oriented in
      the pulmonary function after bariatric surgery.

      Method: Twenty-eight women, non-smokers, with no lung disease and BMI of 35-49,99 kg/m2,
      undergoing bariatric surgery by laparoscopy, were studied. Before surgery the patients were
      divided in two groups: Spirometer Group (SG) (n=13) and EPAP Group (EG) (n=15). Pulmonary
      function was evaluated by spirometry, thoracoabdominal (cirtometry) and diaphragmatic motion,
      on the preoperative and on the second postoperative day. Physiotherapy started on the day of
      surgery, each modality (incentive spirometry or EPAP) performed lasting 15 minutes. The
      deambulation and active exercises of upper and lower limbs were standardized for groups.
