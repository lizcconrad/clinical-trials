    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1, dose escalation study of MLN4924 in adult
      patients with nonhematologic malignancies. This study will be the first to administer MLN4924
      in humans. The patient population will consist of adults with any form of nonhematologic
      malignancy for which standard, curative, life prolonging, or palliative treatment does not
      exist or is no longer effective.
