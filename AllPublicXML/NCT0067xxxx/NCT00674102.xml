  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ASA404 when administered in
      combination with paclitaxel and Carboplatin are assessed. ASA404 is administered
      intravenously every 21 days to Japanese patients with Non small cell lung cancer.
