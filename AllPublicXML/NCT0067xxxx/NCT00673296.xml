  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic premacular hemorrhage occurs when blood from preretinal neovascular tissue is
      entrapped between the retina and the posterior hyaloid in the macular area. It may occur
      spontaneously or secondary to traction from a localized posterior vitreous detachment. This
      complication may greatly disturb the central vision and may be an important stimulant of
      fibrovascular proliferation.

      Bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, Inc.) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has been used to treat a variety of neovascular
      ocular diseases. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, intravitreal bevacizumab has been
      shown to induce prompt regression of neovascularization and may enhance resolution of
      vitreous hemorrhage.

      In this study, we propose that simultaneous intravitreal injection of gas and bevacizumab may
      be a useful treatment option in diabetic premacular hemorrhage with active fibrovascular
      tissue. In this procedure, gas is used to displace the blood while bevacizumab may render the
      neovascularization less active to decrease the likelihood of recurrent hemorrhage.

      In this study, consecutive cases of acute diabetic premacular hemorrhage and active
      fibrovascular proliferation will receive intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in
      0.05 mL) and C3F8 (0.2-0.3 mL) during the same setting. Before intravitreal injection, all
      patients should either have complete panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) treatment or PRP to
      the peripheral retina. After treatment, patients will maintain a prone position for three
      days and be followed at regular interval. After vitreous clear-up, further supplementary PRP
      extending beyond equator will be done. Snellen best-corrected visual acuity measurements,
      intraocular pressure, slit-lamp examination and non-contact lens biomicroscopic examination
      will be performed before treatment and at each follow-up visit. Data including the extent of
      premacular hemorrhage, and the interval between the treatment and clearing of premacular
      hemorrhage will also be recorded.
