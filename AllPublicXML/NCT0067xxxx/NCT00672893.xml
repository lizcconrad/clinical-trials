  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vibration response imaging (VRI) technology, provides a radiation-free dynamic image of the
      lung, by visualizing vibration energy emitted during the respiration cycle (lung sounds).
      Airflow in the lungs during the respiration cycle creates vibrations that propagate through
      the lung tissue; these vibrations are affected by the structural properties of the lungs and
      may vary in space, time and frequency. Moreover, any structural alteration, such as a
      bronchial obstruction or space occupying infiltration, is reflected in a corresponding
      modification of the vibration response.

      As obstructions that occur in airways alter airflow, the VRI may provide additional lung
      function information prior to treatment for airway obstruction and during follow-up.
      Moreover, the VRI may provide the physician immediate evaluation of the improvement of air
      flow distribution, quantitative and qualitative measurements. Furthermore, the VRI is a
      non-invasive, radiation free procedure which is simple and doesn't require the level of
      patient effort required for lung function test and other evaluation.
