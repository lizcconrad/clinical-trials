    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate a reduction in the proportion of new
      vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis following 3-years of treatment
      with 20 and 40 mcg/day of teriparatide plus calcium and vitamin D compared with calcium and
      vitamin D alone.

             two moderate fractures or in patients previously treated with therapeutic doses of
             bisphosphonates or fluorides
