    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Sativex® and GW-2000-02 are effective in
      the management of subjects with intractable cancer-related pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two week (two days baseline and two weeks treatment period), multicentre, double
      blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy of
      Sativex® and GW-2000-02 in subjects with cancer-related pain. Subjects are screened to
      determine eligibility and completed a two-day baseline period. Subjects then return to the
      centre for assessment, randomisation and dose introduction. All subjects are allowed to
      continue using all their current medications, provided that the dose remains stable
      throughout the study period. Their progress is reviewed after seven to 10 days and at the end
      of the study (day 14 to 20), or upon withdrawal. Subjects in this study are given the
      opportunity to be enrolled in an open label extension study (GWEXT0101).

    <measure>The Change in Mean Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score From Baseline to the End of the Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks: baseline - end of week 2 (last 3 days of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The pain NRS was complete at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your pain or average pain in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. No pain relates to the time prior to the onset of pain due to cancer. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

    <measure>The Consumption of Escape Analgesic Medication.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks: baseline - end of week 2 (last 3 days of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects recorded their use of escape medication each day on their diary card.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks: baseline to end of week 2 (last 3 days of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep disruption NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how your pain disrupted your sleep last night?&quot; where 0 = did not disrupt sleep and 10 = completely disrupted (unable to sleep at all). A negative value indicates an improvement in sleep disruption score from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Nausea 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks; baseline - end of week 2 (last 3 days of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The nausea NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how sick you felt throughout the day?&quot; where 0 = not sick at all and 10 = very sick. A negative value indicates an improvement in nausea score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks: baseline - end of week 2 (last 3 days of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The memory NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how well you are able to remember what you have done in the past 24 hours?&quot; where 0 = very well and 10 = not at all. A negative value indicates an improvement in memory score from baseline.</description>

A negative value indicates an improvement in appetite score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentration 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks: baseline - end of week 2 (last 3 days of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration NRS was completed at the same time each day, i.e. bedtime in the evening. The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate how well have you been able to concentrate throughout the day e.g. when reading a newspaper?&quot; where 0 = very well and 10 = not at all. A negative value indicates an improvement in concentration score from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQC30)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks; baseline and end of treatment (2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), a core cancer-specific questionnaire containing 30 items on patients' functioning, global quality of life, disease- and treatment related symptoms. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of symptoms, min.: 0, Max.: 100</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>End of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a 14-item questionnaire that asks patients to rate pain over the prior week and the degree to which it interferes with activities on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items(range 0-10). The minimum value is zero and maximum is 10. A higher score represents a poor outcome.</description>

The patient was asked &quot;on a scale of '0 to 10', please indicate the number that best describes your pain or average pain in the last 24 hours&quot; where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. No pain relates to the time prior to the onset of pain due to cancer. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

        <description>The BPI-SF is a 14-item questionnaire that asks patients to rate pain over the prior week and the degree to which it interferes with activities on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items(range 0-10). The minimum value is zero and maximum is 10. A higher score represents a poor outcome.</description>
