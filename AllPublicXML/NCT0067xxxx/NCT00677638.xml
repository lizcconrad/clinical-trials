      A prospective single arm study evaluating feasibility and safety of a catheter-based
      transapical implantation of the Ventor Embracer™ aortic valve bioprosthesis in patients with
      severe aortic valve disease, specifically aortic stenosis, who are at elevated risk for
      standard surgical valve replacement.
