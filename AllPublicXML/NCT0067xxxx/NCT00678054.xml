    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study to test the efficacy of exogenously administered GM-CSF in prostate
      cancer patients who have failed definitive local therapy, and have only serologic (PSA)
      evidence of progression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate; stage T1-T3, N0-N1, M0

          -  Prior definitive therapy for primary prostate cancer consisting of:external beam
             radiotherapy;brachytherapy with or without pelvic external beam radiation; or radical
             prostatectomy with or without adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy

          -  Therapeutic PSA response to primary therapy below 1.0 ng/ml post radiation therapy or
             below 0.4 ng/ml for radical prostatectomy

          -  Patients treated with adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy following radical
             prostatectomy are eligible provided:Post prostatectomy PSA was never &gt; 6.0 ng/ml, last
             effective day of androgen deprivation is at least 3 months prior to study entry

          -  Recurrent PSA level elevation (between 0.4 ng/ml and 6.0 ng/ml) on two determinations
             at least one week apart.

          -  No clinical evidence of gross local recurrence or known metastatic disease other than
             PSA elevation. Transrectal ultrasound and/or biopsy to evaluate local recurrence is
             not required. All patients will receive a bone scan and CT scan of the abdomen to
             exclude metastases.

          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cryosurgery as definitive therapy of primary tumor.

          -  Any metastasis.

          -  No concurrent or prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately
             treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer
             from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from
             which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.

          -  Current systemic steroid therapy (inhaled or topical steroids acceptable).

          -  Prior hormonal therapy for treatment of progressive disease.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or therapy with other experimental agents for
             prostate cancer.

          -  Any surgery within the prior 4 weeks.

          -  Bilirubin and SGOT &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal.

          -  BUN and serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 times normal.

          -  No active congestive heart failure.

          -  If there is a history of clinically significant obstructive airway disease, a DLCO
             must exceed 50%.

          -  Active uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection until these conditions are
             corrected or controlled.

          -  Any underlying medical condition which in the principal investigator's opinion will
             make the administration of GM-CSF hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse
             events.

          -  PSA &gt; 6.0 ng/ml
