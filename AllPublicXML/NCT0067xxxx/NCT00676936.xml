      Study hypothesis: corticosteroids are effective for pain in cancer patients. We will perform
      a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicentre trial evaluating the effect of
      Methylprednisolone 16 mg twice daily in cancer patients with pain (average pain last 24 hrs
      NRS &gt; 4 (Numerical rating scale, 0 No pain, 10 worst pain).

      Patients are required to use strong opioids before entering the study. Weak opioids are
      allowed if patients have short acting strong opioids as rescue-medication. The scheduled
      opioids shall be stable last 48 hours before entering the study and will be kept stable
      during the study period. Patients may use as much short acting rescue-medication as they
      require. No other analgesic medication should be started during the study period.

      The study is a multicentre trial. Patients will be randomized according to 1. study centre
      (No 1-5) and 2. pain mechanism: skeletal metastases (yes/no).

      Patients are evaluated Day 0 and Day 7 by palliative care physician. Patients will be
      contacted by phone Day 1-6 and will fill in questionnaire regarding symptoms and analgesic
      usage. Patients will be contacted Day 14 and 21 to fill in questionnaires regarding symptoms,
      quality of life and side effects.
