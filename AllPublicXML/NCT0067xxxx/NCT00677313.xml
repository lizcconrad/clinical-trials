  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to provide metreleptin for the treatment of diabetes mellitus
      and/or hypertriglyceridemia associated with lipodystrophy. This study intends to provide
      guidance to investigators with respect to identification of appropriate subjects for
      metreleptin treatment, guidance on metreleptin dosing, and collection of safety and efficacy
      data following metreleptin treatment in this population

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is male or female ≥5 years old

               2. Negative pregnancy test result

               3. Must practice and be willing to continue to practice appropriate birth control
                  (defined as a method which results in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per
                  year, when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, oral
                  contraceptives, some intrauterine contraceptive devices, sexual abstinence, tubal
                  ligation, or a vasectomized partner) during the entire duration of the study
                  (Double barrier methods including the use of female diaphragm and male condom
                  with spermicide can also be used.)

          -  Has physician-confirmed lipodystrophy as defined by evidence of generalized (whole
             body) or partial (limbs) loss of body fat outside the range of normal variation

          -  Has been diagnosed with at least one of the following 2 metabolic disorders:

               1. Diabetes Mellitus

               2. Hypertriglyceridemia as defined by fasting triglyceride concentrations &gt;200 mg/dL

          -  If ≥18 years of age, is able to read, understand, and sign the Informed Consent Form
             (ICF) and an Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information form,
             communicate with the investigator, and understand and comply with protocol
             requirements

          -  If &lt;18 years of age, has a parent or legal guardian to read and understand the ICF and
             Child Assent Form, communicate with the investigator, and understand and comply with
             protocol requirements. Adolescent subjects must also read and understand the Child
             Assent Form; if the child is too young or unable to read, then the Child Assent Form
             must be explained to the child.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been diagnosed with HIV infection

          -  Has known infectious liver disease
