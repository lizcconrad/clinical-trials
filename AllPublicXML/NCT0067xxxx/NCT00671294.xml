      This purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Ramelteon, once daily
      (QD), in elderly subjects with chronic insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is characterized by a complaint of difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep or
      of nonrestorative and non-refreshing sleep. Transient insomnia affects approximately
      one-third to one-half of the US population, based on the results of 2 surveys of
      representative samples of the adult US population conducted by the Gallup Organization in
      which respondents were asked if they had .ever had difficulty sleeping. Based on reports of
      regular or frequent sleep difficulty, results from the same studies suggest that
      approximately one-tenth of the US population experiences chronic insomnia. The ideal
      treatment for insomnia would reduce the latency to onset of sleep and increase total sleep
      time, without a negative impact on sleep architecture and without safety concerns or next-day
      effects.

      Ramelteon is a melatonin-1 receptor agonist under global development by Takeda Chemical
      Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan, for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia and for
      the treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.

      Participation in this study is anticipated to be about 2 months.
