  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We believe ongoing bleeding during complex cardiac surgery can be accurately measured and
      that administration of a specific blood product replacement strategy designed to optimally
      slow or stop the bleeding can be followed by the during the operation.

      Patients at risk of significant bleeding after complex cardiac surgery will be approached to
      allow their operation to be watched by study personnel to see if ongoing blood loss can be
      accurately measured and to see how quickly a prescribed, standardized blood product
      replacement protocol to control the bleeding does slow or stop the bleeding. Permission to
      review the medical record to see if bleeding risk features can be identified and permission
      to follow the patient after surgery to see how they recover is also requested.

        Study populations includes male and female patients over 18 kg in weight and less than 75
        years old who are undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and are theoretically at risk for
        significant bleeding in the peri-operative period

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligible male and female patients will include those who are over 18 kg (identified as the
        lower inclusion threshold so as to standardize CPB circuit dilution) and less than 75 years
        old (to limit excessive stroke risk) and at theoretically increased risk for excessive
        bleeding following cardiopulmonary bypass, including patients:

          1. undergoing repeat sternotomy, or

          2. undergoing combined procedures (i.e. - valve and coronary artery surgery), or

          3. undergoing multiple valve surgery, or

          4. undergoing aortic root replacement with/without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest,
             or

          5. undergoing complex congenital cardiac surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ineligible patients include those:

          1. with known coagulation factor deficiency, or

          2. refusing to receive donor blood products if necessary, or

          3. undergoing emergency surgery, or

          4. undergoing their first coronary artery bypass surgery or their first valve
             repair/replacement, or

          5. with history of previous stroke or other significant thromboembolic event within 6
             months (such as pulmonary embolism, valve obstruction [if not replacing this valve in
             upcoming operation], renal vein thrombosis, acute MI, DVT ), or

          6. with known thrombophilia, or

          7. with active infection (bacteremia, sepsis, endocarditis, meningitis, urinary tract
             infection, cholecystitis, cellulitis, pneumonia)

          8. pregnant, or

          9. weight &gt; 150 kg or &lt; 18 kg
