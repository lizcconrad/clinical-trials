      The objective of this study is to demonstrate a reduction of intrahepatic fat as measured
      with Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy after 12 weeks administration of oral acarbose.
      The study will also examine the hypothesis of whether the chronic administration of acarbose
      in patients with NAFLD will influence postprandial substrate metabolism reflected in the RQ
      measured by indirect calorimetry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The chronic administration of acarbose has been shown to improve insulin resistance and
      reverse impaired glucose tolerance. Both these conditions, especially insulin resistance, are
      physiologically associated with the development and progression of NAFLD. Therefore, we
      hypothesized that the chronic administration of acarbose attenuates NAFLD by improving
      glucose handling. This would be reflected in a reduction of intrahepatic fat accumulation.
      Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is a sensitive and non-invasive method to measure
      changes in intrahepatic fat content. The primary endpoint of this study would be to
      demonstrate a reduction of intrahepatic fat as measured with Proton Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy after 12 weeks administration of oral acarbose. Other relevant secondary
      outcomes that have been previously demonstrated to be associated with improvement of NAFLD
      included improvement of insulin resistance, normalizing of serum adiponectin, and a lowering
      of serum Leptin.

      A second intent of the study is to test the hypothesis of whether the chronic administration
      of acarbose in patients with NAFLD will influence postprandial substrate metabolism reflected
      in the RQ measured by indirect calorimetry. The consequence of insulin resistance is a
      relative inhibition of fatty oxidation. However, the chronic administration of acarbose
      improves insulin resistance and dampens the post-prandial surge in serum glucose and insulin.
      These changes in glucose handling could possibly result in a shift towards a pattern of
      preferential lipid oxidation. We anticipate either a lowering or blunting of the postprandial
      RQ after chronic administration of acarbose for 3 months.
