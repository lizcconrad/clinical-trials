      RATIONALE: Expressive writing may help relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in breast
      cancer survivors with chronic lymphedema.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying expressive writing in improving the quality of life
      in women with breast cancer and lymphedema.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if expressive writing improves quality of life (QOL) relative to the
           control condition in breast cancer survivors with chronic stage II lymphedema.

        -  To determine if expressive writing improves physical and psychological symptoms/outcomes
           (i.e., fatigue, psychological distress, activity level, confidence in body) relative to
           the control condition in breast cancer survivors with chronic lymphedema.

      Secondary

        -  To explore the influence of individual difference variables (dispositional optimism,
           emotional intelligence, and repressive coping) on outcomes associated with this
           intervention to include identification of subsets of individuals for whom expressive
           writing is most effective.

        -  To explore the influence of intrusive/avoidant thinking as a mediator between the
           intervention and outcomes of QOL and physical and psychological symptoms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      Patients travel to the School of Nursing at Vanderbilt University or meet a team member in
      their home or another private location for an initial visit. Patients complete
      questionnaires, are measured for height and weight data, and arm fluid measurements.

        -  Expressive writing group: Twenty minutes a day, twice a week for 2 weeks, patients write
           about their deepest thoughts and feelings regarding their lymphedema and its treatment.

        -  Daily diary group (control): Twenty minutes a day, twice a week for 2 weeks patients
           write about how they manage their time .

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires periodically.

      After completion of study, patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months.
