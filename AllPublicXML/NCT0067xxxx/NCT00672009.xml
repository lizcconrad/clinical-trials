      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the
      investigational drug, Ixabepilone, in men with high risk prostate cancer who plan to receive
      surgery.

      Prostate cancer is a common and important health issue facing men in the United States. Most
      patients with prostate cancer are identified when the disease is limited to the prostate
      gland itself (localized prostate cancer). A standard treatment for some patients with
      localized prostate cancer is removal of the prostate gland in an operation known as a
      &quot;radical prostatectomy.&quot; A sub-set of patients with localized prostate cancer can be
      identified who are at high-risk of suffering a recurrence of prostate cancer after radical
      prostatectomy. For these patients, additional treatments are being investigated to combine
      with surgery in the hopes of increasing the chances for cure.

      Several kinds of chemotherapy medicines have been used for advanced prostate cancer which
      returns after initial therapy. Epothilones are a newly developed class of chemotherapy drugs
      that appear promising for the treatment of many forms of cancer. Ixabepilone is drug in the
      epothilone class of chemotherapy medicines that has shown encouraging results for the
      treatment of advanced prostate cancer and other cancers in clinical trials.

      This trial will include men with high-risk localized prostate cancer who will receive
      treatment with ixabepilone (4 cycles over 12 weeks) prior to radical prostatectomy. The goal
      of this trial will be to determine if analysis of genes and proteins in prostate cancer
      tissue taken before and after treatment can be used to predict ixabepilone response. In
      addition, this trial will evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering ixabepilone
      prior to radical prostatectomy for patients at high-risk of developing recurrent prostate
      cancer.

      The study has three phases: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up

        -  Screening: Eligibility will be verified

        -  Treatment: Subjects will receive Ixabepilone, which will be administered every 21 days
           for 4 cycles prior to surgery

        -  Follow up: Subjects will be followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.

      In addition, tissue will be collected at the time of surgery for genetic and protein studies.
      Blood will also be collected pre and post therapy for proteomic and/or genetic studies.
