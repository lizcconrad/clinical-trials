  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a safe dose of actinium-225 when it is labeled to
      HuM195. This will be done with a &quot;phase I trial,&quot; in which a preset schedule of doses gets
      more powerful for each new group of patients as the trial progresses. If too many serious
      side effects are seen with a certain dose, no one will be treated with a higher dose, and
      some additional patients may be treated with a lower dose to make sure that this dose is
      safe. The starting dose of actinium-225 in this study is less than doses that are known to be
      safe in animals.

      Antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system and help the body to fight
      foreign substances, such as bacteria or viruses. HuM195 was made by putting human leukemia
      cells into mice. Most of the mouse parts of this antibody were replaced with human parts.
      Only the part of the antibody that binds to the leukemia cells was kept from the mouse.
      HuM195 attaches to leukemia cells but does not attach to most normal cells. It can kill small
      amounts of disease by identifying the leukemia cells as &quot;foreign.&quot; HuM195 has worked less
      well against large amounts of leukemia since the normal immune cells needed to kill leukemia
      cells are lowered in most patients with leukemia.

    <description>This is a phase I, dose-escalation trial. The starting dose level will be 0.5 μCi/kg of 225Ac-HuM195. Three to six patients will be treated at each dose level, and dose escalation will proceed if less than 33% of patients in a cohort experience dose limiting toxicity. Six patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose</description>

    <description>A single infusion of 225Ac-HuM195 will be administered at a starting dose of 0.5 μCi/kg. Additionally, 100 mCi of 213Bi-HuM195 have been administered with full dose cytarabine (200 mg/m2 daily for 5 days) without dose-limiting toxicity.Serial sampling of blood, urine, and bone marrow will be performed following treatment to determine the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and antileukemic effects. Three to six patients will be treated at each dose level. Dose escalation will proceed if less than 33% of patients in a cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity.Patients will be followed until completion of therapy as outlined in the study, loss to follow-up, death, or until the day the patient is removed from the study.</description>
