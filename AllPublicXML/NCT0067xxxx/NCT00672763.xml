    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of vitamin D to standard
      corticosteroids improves onset of remission in active Crohn's Disease, a form of Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease (IBD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease is a form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). It is caused by abnormal
      immune-mediated gut inflammation and is both chronic and difficult to treat. Symptoms are
      often unpleasant (e.g. abdominal pain, diarrhoea, disfiguring fistulation) and often lead to
      surgery to remove diseased bowel.

      There is emerging evidence that Vitamin D, a nutrient largely produced in the skin upon
      exposure to sun-light, may possess properties regulating the immune system in IBD. In
      addition, vitamin D deficiency appears common in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

      This study aims to determine if the addition of vitamin D to standard corticosteroid
      treatment in active Crohn's Disease helps to achieve remission (resolution of symptoms).
