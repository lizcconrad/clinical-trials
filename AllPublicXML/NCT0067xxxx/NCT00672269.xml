      There is a high incidence among the first degree relatives of the carcinoid patients,
      indicating the involvement of genetic components in its initiation and pathogenesis.

      This proposed pilot study will conduct detailed interviews into the medical, environmental,
      and family histories and to collect blood specimen to obtain DNA. The Blood specimen and DNA
      will be processed by the Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository (RUCDR) to rule out
      Familial Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN 1), and succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit D
      (SDHD), gene inactivation thought to be associated with different types of carcinoid cancer.

      Blood: a small sample of 2 tubes (2 - 4 teaspoons, or 20 ml). One tube will be used to
      prepare the DNA (your genetic material) for the test. The other would be used for further
      gene evaluation. The DNA will be stored with Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository
      (RUCDR).
