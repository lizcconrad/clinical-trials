      This study will examine safety of single doses of GSK369796 in healthy subjects, along with
      some test to examine how quickly GSK369796 gets in your blood, and how long it takes your
      body to get rid of it.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study

          -  Healthy adult males and females between 18 and 60 years of age, inclusive. Whether a

             evaluation including history, physical examination, laboratory tests, cardiac
             monitoring.

          -  To be eligible, female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test (i.e. serum bhCG
             test) and be of:

               1. non-childbearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant).
                  This includes pre-menopausal females with documented (medical report
                  verification) hysterectomy or double oophrectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum
                  FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL or 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy with or
                  without hysterectomy, or documented hysterectomy - tubal ligation is not
                  sufficient.

               2. childbearing potential and agrees to commit to two of the protocol-approved
                  methods of contraception, when used consistently and in accordance with both the
                  product label and the instructions of a physician (and as listed in protocol).

          -  Male subjects must agree to abstain from or use a condom during sexual intercourse
             with pregnant or lactating females; or use a condom/spermicide, in addition to having
             their female partner use another form of contraception, such as an IUD, diaphragm with
             spermicide, oral contraceptive, inject able progesterone, or sub dermal implant if
             engaging in sexual intercourse with a female partner who could become pregnant. This
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until
             completion of follow up procedures.

          -  Body weight ³ 50 kg (110 pounds) for men and ³ 45 kg (99 pounds) for women and body
             mass index (BMI) between 19 and 31.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin within
             reference range at screening.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study. The subject
             is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and
             protocol-stated restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening history and physical
             exam, screening 12-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG), and screening 24-holter
             cardiac monitoring.

          -  Any evidence of cardiac disease or other clinically relevant abnormality identified on
             the screening echocardiography.

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality on the clinical safety laboratory tests at
             screening.

          -  Positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibody at screening.

          -  Significant cardiac history including but not limited to history of myocardial
             infarction, angina, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, myocarditis,
             hypertrophy (atrial or ventricular), or cor pulmonale.

          -  Significant central nervous system (e.g., seizures), pulmonary, metabolic, renal,
             hepatic or gastrointestinal conditions or history of such conditions that, in the
             opinion of the investigator and/or GSK medical monitor, places the subject at an
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications or components thereof.

          -  History of sensitivity to 4-aminoquinolines (e.g., chloroquine, amodiaquine, or

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, if the clinical
             research unit will use heparin to maintain intravenous cannula patency.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to study

             medication administration Unless in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor the
             medication will not interfere with study procedures or compromise safety. By
             exception, the volunteer may take paracetamol (&lt;/ 2 grams/day) up to 48 hours prior to
             the study medication administration.

             within 3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) preceding the study medication
             administration.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to dosing.

          -  History of drug abuse within 6 months of the study.

          -  A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol (or alcohol breath test) at
             screening or predose.

          -  History of smoking or use of nicotine containing products within 3 months of
             screening, or a positive urine cotinine indicative of smoking at screening.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 units/week or 2 units/day for
             women, or 21 units/week or 3 units/day for men, within 6 months of screening. One unit
             is equivalent to a half-pint of beer or 1 measure of spirits or 1 glass of wine.

          -  An unwillingness of male subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or
             lactating women, or an unwillingness of male subjects to use a condom/spermicide, in
             addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception such as an
             IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone,
             subdermal implants or a tubal ligation, if engaging in sexual intercourse with a
             female partner who could become pregnant. This criterion must be followed from the
             time of study medication administration and until 84 days later.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 90 days prior to dosing.
