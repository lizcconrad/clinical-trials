  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) reduce fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)
      concentrations in children with asthma, but the effect of LTRA withdrawal on FENO and lung
      function is unknown. We will aim to study the effect of treatment and withdrawal of
      montelukast, a LTRA, on airway inflammation as reflected by FENO and lung function in
      children with asthma.

      A double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group study will be undertaken in 18
      atopic children with mild persistent asthma who will be treated with oral montelukast (5
      mg/day for 4 weeks) and 18 atopic children with mild persistent asthma who will receive
      matching placebo.

      A follow-up visit will be performed 2 weeks after montelukast or placebo withdrawal.
