      The purpose of this study was to describe the safety and IOP-lowering efficacy of Travoprost
      New Formulations compared to TRAVATAN速 and to vehicle in patients with open-angle glaucoma or
      ocular hypertension.

          -  Able to discontinue use of all IOP-lowering medications for a minimum of 5 to 28 days
             prior to the Eligibility 1 Visit;

          -  IOP measurements in at least 1 eye as specified in protocol;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of childbearing potential if pregnant, breastfeeding, or not using highly
             effective birth control measures;

          -  Any form of glaucoma other than open-angle glaucoma;

          -  Severe central visual field loss in either eye;

          -  Chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease;

          -  Clinically relevant or progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration,
