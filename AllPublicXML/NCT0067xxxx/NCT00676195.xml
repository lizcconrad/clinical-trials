      The purpose of the study is to test the tolerability and efficacy of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)
      in children with Autism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) is a compound that increases the levels of Glutathione, the body's
      main antioxidant. Glutathione is a compound in the blood that is part of a natural defense
      system (the antioxidant system). Anti-oxidants protect the body from damage caused by
      internal toxins called free radicals. It is possible that children with Autism tend to have
      lower levels of glutathione, an important compound in our bodies that helps combat the
      effects of toxic free radicals. We hope that by studying the antioxidant system in more
      detail, we will increase our understanding of the reasons why people develop Autism so that
      we can design better ways to treat individuals with this condition. This study is meant to
      test the safety tolerability of N-Acetyl Cysteine and its effectiveness in the treatment of
      behavioral difficulties in children with autism. It will also examine the possible benefit of
      this agent in improving the core deficits in autism such as social deficits.
