      The purpose of this study is to compare postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain
      syndrome in demographics psychological features, infection of Helicobacter pylori, gastric
      emptying and therapeutic response to lansoprazole.

      Functional dyspepsia is a common clinical disorder with significant impact on quality of life
      and with enormous social cost. Previous studies have revealed that functional dyspepsia is
      not a homogenous disease but a heterogenous symptom complex. Because of heterogeneity in
      etiology and pathogenesis, no specific treatment is appropriate for all patients with
      functional dyspepsia. Currently available treatments demonstrated efficacy only in subsets of
      patients.

      Appropriate subgrouping of functional dyspepsia, which categorizes more homogenous patients
      into the same group, will correlate better with specific etiologic factors and pathogenetic
      mechanisms. Consequently patients may have appropriate specific treatment based on more
      directed pathologenesis and subgrouping. To this end, American Gastroenterology Association
      launched new edition of clinical guide for functional gastrointestinal disorder, the Rome III
      in May 2006. The new diagnostic criteria of Rome III de-emphasized functional dyspepsia as an
      entity and recommended sub-classification into two conditions: postprandial distress syndrome
      and epigastric pain syndrome. However whether this new diagnostic criteria and systems are
      effective and clinically relevant remains unknown.

      Aims:

      We aim to compare postprandial distress syndrome and epigastric pain syndrome in demographics
      psychological features, infection of Helicobacter pylori, gastric emptying and therapeutic
      response to lansoprazole.

    <description>All tests start after overnight fast. Test meals consists of 120g scrambled egg, two slices of toasted bread, 30g of strawberry jam and 120ml of water. 12MBg (0.33mCi) of 99mTc sulfur colloid is mixed with egg thoroughly before the mixture cooked in a microwave oven for 2 minutes. All meals are prepared on the morning of examination and consumed within 20 minutes.
Anterior and posterior images of the gastric region are taken within one minute after completion of test meals. Subsequent images are taken every 2 minutes in the first 60 minutes and at 120 minutes and 180 minutes. One-min images of gastric region at upright position are taken in the 140keV 99mTc peak with a 20% window.</description>
