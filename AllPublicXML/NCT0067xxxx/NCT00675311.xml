      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether remote monitoring in diabetes
      management is more effective at helping patients manage their disease than a standard disease
      management program.

    <description>The conventional disease management group will receive management under the site's usual program offering, which includes, but is not limited to, compliance with the prescribed treatment regimens, dietary management, exercise programs, and other measures recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Association of American Endocrinologists (AACE).</description>

  <arm_group>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Plus is one of the randomized arms of the study. Patients assigned to this arm receive support from Disease Management nurses and technology that includes mobile phone client software with web-based companion software, Bluetooth glucose meter cradle, and web-based clinical management software for the clinical management team. The core of the system is the patient's cell phone which is used as an input device and which enables patients to maintain an electronic diary of information such as meal times, blood glucose, insulin use, weight, blood pressure, and exercise. The device is customizable to collect only the information relevant to the patient with diabetes and their healthcare provider. The patient with diabetes enters diary information on his or her mobile phone. No immediate or real-time information is provided to patients as part of this study.</description>
