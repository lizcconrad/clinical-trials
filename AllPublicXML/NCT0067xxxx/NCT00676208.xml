      While medical training has increasingly included chronic care management, quality care
      necessitates education approaches that go farther. In April 2005, the Louis Stokes Cleveland
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) implemented a weekly Diabetes Shared Medical
      Appointment (SMA). SMAs offer an important opportunity to improve chronic care and a unique
      setting for training physicians. In order to equip physicians with needed resources to manage
      chronic care, the ways in which SMA experiences are processed and integrated into learning
      about interdisciplinary approaches and expanding trainees' understanding of chronic care
      issues need to be examined.

      : Most physicians receive training in and about an acute care-oriented health care system
      that cannot adequately address the challenges of chronic care management. While medical
      training has increasingly included chronic care management, quality care necessitates
      education approaches that go farther. In April 2005, the Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC
      implemented a weekly Diabetes Shared Medical Appointment (SMA). Results indicate that SMAs
      are sustained and, as such, SMAs offer an important opportunity to improve chronic care and a
      unique setting for training physicians. SMAs offer the potential to provide training in
      crucial skills that have to date remained less amendable to traditional educational
      practices. In order to equip physicians with resources to effectively and efficiently manage
      chronic care, the ways in which SMA experiences are processed and integrated into learning
      about interdisciplinary approaches and expanding trainees' understanding of chronic care
      issues need to be examined. Without addressing this gap, it is not possible to develop a
      comprehensive care model that links education and patient outcomes for chronic conditions,
      such as diabetes. Building on previous pilot work, we continued to address evaluating and
      validating instruments. The proposed pilot project included using a think-aloud protocol to
      evaluate and validate new items and scales assessing interdisciplinary team and chronic
      care/diabetes beliefs, and evaluating and adjusting direct observation coding tools for
      chronic condition care.

    <measure>Change in Confidence in Ability to Perform Teamwork</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and Post-Intervention at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>A three item scale was used to assess confidence in ability to convey logic of recommendations to other providers, explain one's distinctive perspective, and be accountable to patients for a decision made by a colleague from another discipline. The responses for each item ranged from 'not at all confident' (0) to 'very confident' (4), with higher values indicating more confidence. The total scale ranged from 0 to 16 with higher being more confident. Difference scores were analyzed (post-pre) with positive and higher values indicating more favorable change.</description>

    <measure>Change in Professionals' Attitudes About Diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention and Post-intervention at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The University of Michigan's Research and Training Center's Diabetes Attitude Scale was used. There are 33 items and the response format is a 5 point Likert Scale ranging from 'strongly disagree'(1) to 'strongly agree'(5). A higher score means more positive attitudes toward diabetes and its treatment (e.g., psychosocial impact of diabetes; value of tight glucose control).The total score is computed by summing individual items and ranges from 0 to 165. Post-pre total scores were used with positive and higher values indicating greater favorable change.</description>

        <title>Change in Professionals' Attitudes About Diabetes</title>
        <description>The University of Michigan's Research and Training Center's Diabetes Attitude Scale was used. There are 33 items and the response format is a 5 point Likert Scale ranging from 'strongly disagree'(1) to 'strongly agree'(5). A higher score means more positive attitudes toward diabetes and its treatment (e.g., psychosocial impact of diabetes; value of tight glucose control).The total score is computed by summing individual items and ranges from 0 to 165. Post-pre total scores were used with positive and higher values indicating greater favorable change.</description>

This was a pilot study, both limitations were recognized from the outset and indeed seen as an advantage given the focus on trying to identify measures to include in a larger study.</limitations_and_caveats>
