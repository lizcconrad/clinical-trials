  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term consequences of poverty on child health, including cognitive development, are
      one of the world's great tragedies. In the Philippines, diarrhea, acute lower respiratory
      infections, and the attendant problems of malnutrition, are the leading causes of childhood
      illness. The Philippine government plans to launch a broad national Health Sector Reform
      Agenda (HSRA) that will address the problems of poverty and illness in children. The
      introduction of these reforms provides an exceptional opportunity to conduct a social
      experiment. Four institutions, already involved in the design and implementation of the HSRA,
      plus leading experts in international health, government, and health measurement will
      collaborate on this project to collect longitudinal data and measure the impact of HSRA
      reforms on child health outcomes in a population. We will measure the health impacts of two
      experimental interventions: (1) expansion of health insurance coverage, and (2) capitation of
      providers. Our research will measure the impact of health reforms on the physical and
      cognitive health outcomes of children age 0-4. We will use a block design of 21 sites
      throughout the Philippines: seven for each of the two interventions, and seven matched
      controls. We will measure the quality of clinical practice using vignettes and will measure
      health outcomes using objective clinical tests. We will also use an advanced sampling
      strategy and panel data to link clinical practice with population health outcomes. This
      unparalleled research opportunity will yield significant insights about specific, unanswered
      questions of tremendous importance: Does health care serve as a social intervention that
      ameliorates the effects of morbidity and malnutrition on cognitive development? How effective
      are government policies at creating incentives to improve the quality of clinical practice?
      Do financial and organizational policies actually lead to better health and developmental
      outcomes? The results from this study will provide insights into the linkages between
      increased access, high quality care, and health outcomes in children.
