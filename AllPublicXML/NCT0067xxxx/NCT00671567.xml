      (QD), in adult subjects with chronic insomnia.

      Insomnia is characterized by difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep or complaints of
      nonrestorative and non-refreshing sleep. Transient insomnia affects approximately one-third
      to one-half of the US population, based on the results of 2 surveys of representative samples
      of the adult US population conducted by the Gallup Organization in which respondents were
      asked if they had &quot;ever had difficulty sleeping.&quot; Based on reports of &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;frequent&quot;
      sleep difficulty, results from the same studies suggest that approximately one-tenth of the
      US population experiences chronic insomnia. The ideal treatment for insomnia would reduce the
      latency to onset of sleep and increase total sleep time, without a negative impact on sleep
      architecture and without safety concerns or next-day effects.

      Ramelteon is a melatonin-1 receptor agonist under global development by Takeda Chemical
      Industries, Ltd, for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia and for the treatment of
      Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.

      This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of 35-day treatment of chronic
      insomnia with Ramelteon, using subjective measures of sleep. Total subject participation time
      in this study is expected to be approximately 2 months.
