      To determine whether valdecoxib 40 mg twice a day the first day and then 40mg once a day
      until Day 7, was at least as effective as diclofenac 75 mg twice a day for 7 days, in
      treating acute first or second degree ankle sprain. The study also compared valdecoxib and
      diclofenac with respect to time to onset of pain relief (measured after the first dose),
      tolerability (adverse events) and time to return to Normal Function/Activity, among other
      measures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients had sprained their ankle within 48 hours

          -  The sprain was a first or second degree ankle sprain of the lateral aspect,
             specifically: anterior talofibular ligament and/or calcaneofibular ligament

          -  At presentation patients were to have had moderate-severe ankle pain, (i.e., patient's
             assessment of ankle pain, on full weight bearing, using a 100 mm visual analog scale
             (VAS) was â‰¥ 45 mm), have a minimum rating of 2 on the Patient's Global Assessment of
             Ankle Injury and Patient's Assessment of Normal Function/Activity

          -  Investigator must have thought that the patient required and was eligible for therapy
             with an anti-inflammatory agent and/or analgesic to control symptoms

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who were not post-menopausal or surgically sterilized, or who had have a
             positive urine pregnancy test prior to randomization and/or were not using adequate
             contraception according to the judgment of the Investigator

          -  Patients with a similar injury of the same joint within the last 6 months

          -  Clinical evidence of complete rupture of ankle ligaments (third degree sprain),
             required bed rest, hospitalization, surgical intervention for the ankle injury or
             non-removable full cast, bilateral occurrence of ankle injury or ankle and knee injury
             on the same side

          -  Patients with esophageal, gastric or duodenal ulcer within 30 days prior to
             randomization or had active GI or other disease that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude safe participation by the subject in the study.
