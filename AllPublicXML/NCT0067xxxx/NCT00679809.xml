      The purpose of this study is to describe the features of continuity and quantify fatigue in
      three ICU resident work schedules, estimate the frequency of preventable adverse events, and
      inform the design and demonstrate the feasibility of a future multi-centre study.

      The overall goal of our research is to describe the optimal scheduling pattern for frontline
      physicians working in ICUs. Our hypothesis is that call schedule associated reductions in
      fatigue are counterbalanced by reductions in continuity, resulting in no change in the safety
      of patients.

      This is a prospective before-after, two-centre study using a mixed-methods design. We will
      apply 3 work schedules, each for a period of 2 months over a 6 month period in the adult
      medical-surgical ICUs at two university affiliated hospitals in Toronto. In this mixed
      methods approach, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected concurrently, analysed
      separately, and their results compared, to produce an integrated interpretation of the impact
      of work schedule on the relationship between continuity and fatigue.

      This will evaluate healthcare continuity and fatigue, describe adverse events in ICUs,
      identify the two best resident schedules for subsequent comparison, and demonstrate the
      feasibility of a future multi-centre study of physician scheduling.

        Residents will be on their 2-month ICU rotations at one of two university affiliated
        hospitals in Toronto medical-surgical ICU. Residents in these ICU rotations are from
        internal medicine, surgery, emergency medicine and anesthesia training programs, and are
        supported by 2-3 critical care fellows, and 1 staff physician
