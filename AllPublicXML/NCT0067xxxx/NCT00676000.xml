  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal prolapse is a common condition that is treated with surgical correction. Recently
      surgeons have been using mesh to augment the repair of vaginal prolapse. Common complications
      of this surgery include vaginal pain, pain during sex, infection or erosion of the mesh in
      the vagina. There are different ways to close the vaginal wall over the mesh used in these
      procedures. Currently, there is no accepted standard method of closing the vaginal wall. The
      purpose of this study is to find out the best way to close the surgical wound in the vagina.
      We will compare interrupted closure (separate stitches) to continuous closure (one long,
      running stitch). We hope to show in our study that one method of closure is better than the
      other.
