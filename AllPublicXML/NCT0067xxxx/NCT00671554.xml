    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with the autologous cellular vaccine,
      Melaxin, in combination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) injections is effective in Stage
      IV malignant melanoma.

      Chemotherapy and immunotherapy are the main therapies for metastatic melanoma with the hope
      of prolonging survival. The ideal immunotherapy would consist of the professional
      antigen-presenting cell, the dendritic cell, with the entire repertoire of tumor antigens
      inside. The best way to achieve this is by creating an autologous hybrid fusion cell of the
      dendritic cell and tumor cell. In this study, melanoma tumor tissue surgically removed from
      the patient will be disassociated into single cells, irradiated and fused to dendritic cells
      produced by culturing the patient's blood monocytes. Prior to the electrofusion procedure,
      the tumor cells are stained red and the dendritic cells are stained green. After fusion, the
      uniquely colored fused cells, or dendritomas, are separated from the unfused cells by use of
      a fluorescence activated cell sorter. This highly purified population is then divided into 4
      doses containing 250,000 dendritomas each and frozen. Each dose is thawed, diluted to 1
      milliliter (ml) with Sterile Saline for Injection containing 5 percent (%) human serum
      albumin and administered subcutaneously (SQ) over a lymph node bed to the patient once every
      4 weeks. A separate injection of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is administered in the same
      area within 10 minutes of the dendritoma injection. The safety and efficacy of the therapy
      will be evaluated in 25 patients.
