      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of docetaxel plus carboplatin as first
      line treatment in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel-prednisolone is the current standard in HRPC, based on 2 large randomized trials
      showing improved survival compared to mitoxantrone-prednisolone. Carboplatin has activity in
      prostate cancer and the combination of Docetaxel-carboplatin is known to be synergistic and
      is used with good effect in many cancers. The advantage of using this combination in prostate
      cancer is suported by clinical data: high response rates of
      docetaxel-carboplatin-estramustine (with G-CSF support) in a phase II trial (Oh, Halabi,
      Kelly et al. Cancer. 2003 Dec 15;98(12):2592-8), and additional effect of this combination in
      prior taxane failures (Oh, George, Tay. Clin Prostate Cancer. 2005 Jun;4(1):61-4).
      Carboplatin itself has activity and theoretically could target the more hormone resistant
      clones or neuroendocrine components of the tumor.(Di Sant' Agnese. J Urol. 1994 Nov;152(5 Pt
      2):1927-31.) We are studying the combination of docetaxel-carboplatin both given in a weekly,
      low-dose fashion, without estramustine and without G-CSF. This is expected to be an effective
      and tolerable treatment for HRPC patients. We will be documenting (to our knowledge) for the
      first time in this trial the efficacy of the combination given in this particular dose and
      schedule.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          2. At the time of enrollment, patients must have evidence of metastatic disease, with
             either measurable disease per RECIST criteria or non- measurable disease (i.e.
             positive bones scan) and PSA &gt; 5 ng/mm3.

          3. Disease progression following androgen deprivation therapy.
