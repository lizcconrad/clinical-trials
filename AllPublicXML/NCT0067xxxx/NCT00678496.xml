    <textblock>
      Guidance issued by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
      recommends the use of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) 'Beating the Blues'
      (BtB) in treatment of depression. However CCBT has not been designed specifically for use by
      people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and may not be effective or appropriate for use by people
      with physical disabilities or cognitive symptoms. There would therefore be value in
      conducting a trial of the effectiveness of CCBT for depression in people with MS. The aim of
      this pilot study is to test the feasibility of a randomised control trial (RCT) of CCBT for
      depression in people with MS. The objective is to undertake a pilot RCT of comparison of CCBT
      with usual care including 3 month follow up to identify a realistic patient recruitment rate
      and provide reliable estimates of other parameters needed for designing a definitive RCT
      including the sample size. Other outcomes to be measured include estimates of the effect on
      depression and quality of life. Participants will be assessed as experiencing clinical levels
      of depression and be recruited from two participating MS Centres. The outcomes of the study
      will be (1) preliminary indication of the impact of CCBT on depression in MS; and, (2) a well
      researched protocol for a definitive RCT of the effectiveness of CCBT in treating depression
      in people with MS.

    <description>Beating the Blues is a CBT-based software package for patients with anxiety and/or depression. The CBT strategies used include: identifying thinking errors, challenging automatic negative thoughts, modifying attributional style and identifying core beliefs. The behavioural techniques used include graded exposure, sleep management, problem solving, task breakdown and activity scheduling. The programme consists of a 15 minute &quot;Introduction to Therapy&quot; video plus eight computer-interactive sessions of approximately 50 minutes each in duration. Each session consists of a mix of cognitive and behavioural strategies, which are customised to the patient's individual problems. The eight computer sessions are designed to be taken weekly, or thereabouts, and each session builds on the previous one.</description>
