      Purpose: L-[3-18F]-α-methyltyrosine (18F-FMT) is an amino-acid tracer for PET. We have
      conducted a clinicopathologic study to elucidate the correlation of angiogenesis with 18F-FMT
      and 18F-FDG uptake in the patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Method: Thirty-seven NSCLC patients were enrolled in this study, and a pair of PET study with
      18F-FMT and 18F-FDG was performed. Uptake of PET tracers was evaluated with standardized
      uptake value. VEGF, CD31, CD34, LAT1 and Ki-67 labeling index of the resected tumors were
      analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and correlated with the clinicopathologic variables
      and the uptake of PET tracers.
