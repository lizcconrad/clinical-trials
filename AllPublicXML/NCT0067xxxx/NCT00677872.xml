          -  Men and Women &gt;40 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of COPD with an FEV1 above 20% and less than 65% of predicted normal and an
             FEV1-to-FVC ratio of less than 70%

          -  Diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension based on echocardiography within the last 6 months
             or by cardiac catheterization within the last 12 months

          -  New York Heart Association(NYHA)Class II or III

          -  Screening LVEF&gt;55%, obtained by any appropriate method within 6 months of screening

          -  Baseline 6MWT distance&gt;150m and &lt;450m

          -  Written informed consent from each subject prior to the initiation of any
             study-related procedure

          -  Documented negative results (within 12 months)and Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Serology

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment for pulmonary hypertension with epoprostenol (prostacyclin), trepostinil
             (Remodulin), iloprost (Ventavis), bosentan (Tracleer), ambrisentan (Letairis),
             sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil (Levitra) within the 30 days
             prior to study entry

          -  Presence or history of any of the following cardiovascular co-morbidities or
             conditions: Un-controlled systemic hypertension at screening; unstable cardiovascular
             disease including intermittent atrial fibrillation or unstable angina within the 4
             weeks prior to screening; amyloidosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,
             restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis; history of myocardial
             infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or percutaneous cardiac intervention
             within the 3 months prior to screening; significant valvular heart disease;
             cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within 3 months prior to
             screening

          -  COPD exacerbation less than 1 month prior to screening

          -  Exercise tolerance limited by non-cardiac causes

          -  No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities

          -  Subjects currently being treated for PH with prostnoids, PDE-5 inhibitors and or
             endothelin receptor antagonist. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors &quot;as needed&quot; for erectile
             dysfunction is acceptable as long as the subject does not take the medication within
             72 hours of an efficacy assessment. Other concomitant medications are allowed provided
             the subject has been on a stable dose regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment
             and the regimen continues and remains stable during the treatment and follow-up
             periods.

          -  History of nasal airway mass, septal perforation, chronic sinusitis, lidocaine allergy
             or current nasal passage condition that would decrease the safety or tolerability of a
             naso-esophageal catheter

          -  The subject has the presence, or history, of malignancy that required significant
             medical intervention within the preceding 3 months and/or is likely to result in death
             within the next 2 years

          -  The receipt of any investigational medication within 30 days prior to screening or
             anytime during the course of the study
