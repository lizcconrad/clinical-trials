  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment and follow-up of congestive heart failure (CHF) represents a major part of
      France's health expenses. The beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation is well
      established, especially regarding the reduction of dyspnea, exercise limitation and fatigue
      and leads ultimately to a better quality of life. Maintaining these benefits in secondary
      prevention requires an improvement in daily physical activity, which is challenging and
      supposes a close follow-up difficult to perform on a daily living basis. However, a better
      knowledge of the type and dose of daily physical activity of this population would be very
      beneficial for the practitioner to prescribe or advise individually the type and the dose of
      physical activity required to maintain the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation. To date, only
      a physical activity questionnaire adapted to CHF could provide information regarding both the
      type and dose of daily physical activity. Such a questionnaire has been developed by our
      research team and allows an estimation of daily energy expenditure as well as the daily
      energy expended in its physical activity dimensions (rest, activities &lt; 3 MET, activities
      between 3 and 5 MET, and activities &gt; 5 MET). During its first step of validation, daily and
      physical activity energy expenditure estimated by this questionnaire was correlated to
      various factors of physical condition and notably, to peak V'O2 (R=0.71), prognostic factor
      largely recognized in CHF. A second step of validation was a pilot study comparing the
      estimation of daily energy expenditure by the questionnaire with a measurement of free-living
      daily energy expenditure with the doubly labelled water (DLW) method in 11 middle-aged males
      patients suffering CHF (NYHA I to III). Daily energy expenditure estimated from the
      questionnaire was very close to daily energy expenditure measured from the DLW method (R2 =
      0.81; individual relative error &lt; 7%). However, the high cost of the DLW method reduced the
      population studied to a small sample, which is a major limitation of this study since the
      sample was somewhat different to general CHF population in France.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the validity of the questionnaire
      against the DLW method in a larger population of 30 patients with CHF more representative of
      the general population with CHF, including men and women, NYHA I to IV, with a larger age
      panel. Along with this concordance study, a measurement of the energy cost of specific
      physical activities of daily life is performed with an ambulatory gaz analyzer method to
      further validate the calculation method of daily energy expenditure from the questionnaire.
