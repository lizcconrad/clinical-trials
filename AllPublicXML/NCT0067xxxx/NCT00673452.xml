    <measure>Patient's Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-I) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-Improvement scale is a patient-rated instrument that measures perceived improvement in symptoms. It is a 7-point scale where a score of 1 indicates that the patient is &quot;very much improved,&quot; a score of 4 indicates that the patient has experienced &quot;no change,&quot; and a score of 7 indicates that the patient is &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) (Modified Short Form) at 12 Week Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BPI is a self-reported form that assesses severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. There are 4 questions assessing the severity for worst pain, least pain, and average pain in the past 24 hours, and the pain right now. Severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) at 12 Week Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MFI is a 20-item, self-reporting instrument designed to collect data on the following 5 dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. Each dimension score is derived by summing the scores of the 4 individual items that pertain to each dimension. Item scores range from 1 to 5; thus, dimensional scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score reflecting greater levels of fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-form Health Survey (SF-36) at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient-rated SF-36 consists of 36 questions covering eight health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health perceptions, mental health, social function, and vitality. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning. Two summary scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary are constructed based on the eight SF-36 domains.</description>

          <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20- item, self-reporting instrument designed to collect data on the following 5 dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. Each dimension score is derived by summing the scores of the 4 individual items that pertain to each dimension. Item scores range from 1 to 5; thus, dimensional scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score reflecting greater levels of fatigue.</description>

          <title>Patient's Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-I) at Week 12</title>
          <description>The PGI-Improvement scale is a patient-rated instrument that measures perceived improvement in symptoms. It is a 7-point scale where a score of 1 indicates that the patient is “very much improved,” a score of 4 indicates that the patient has experienced “no change,” and a score of 7 indicates that the patient is “very much worse.”</description>

            <groups_desc>Patients treated with 60-120 mg duloxetine for 12 weeks compared with placebo will show greater improvement in symptoms as assessed by Patient's Global Impressions of Improvement (PGI-I). Sample size determined using 2-sided t-test with significance level of 0.05, and discontinuation rate of 5% without postbaseline data. With 261 patients per arm, study has approximately 85% power to detect treatment group difference of –0.4 points (standard deviation of 1.5) in PGI-I between treatment groups.</groups_desc>

        <description>BPI is a self-reported form that assesses severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. There are 4 questions assessing the severity for worst pain, least pain, and average pain in the past 24 hours, and the pain right now. Severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) at 12 Week Endpoint</title>
        <description>MFI is a 20-item, self-reporting instrument designed to collect data on the following 5 dimensions: general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced motivation, and reduced activity. Each dimension score is derived by summing the scores of the 4 individual items that pertain to each dimension. Item scores range from 1 to 5; thus, dimensional scores range from 4 to 20 with a higher score reflecting greater levels of fatigue.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at 12 Week Endpoint</title>
        <description>BDI-II is a 21-item patient-completed questionnaire designed to assess characteristics of depression. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0 = not present; 3 = present in the extreme). This questionnaire will be used to rate the severity of depressive symptoms and any improvement during the course of the trial. The total score ranges from 0 to 63; the higher the score, the more severe the depressive symptoms.</description>

        <description>The patient-rated SF-36 consists of 36 questions covering eight health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health perceptions, mental health, social function, and vitality. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning. Two summary scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary are constructed based on the eight SF-36 domains.</description>

Anxious: anxious feelings; rated 0 = not feeling anxious to 10 = extremely anxious. Sleep: how much patient bothered by sleep difficulties; rated 0 = not bothered to 10 = extremely bothered. Pain: how much patient bothered by painful physical discomforts; rated 0 = not bothered to 10 = extremely bothered. Stiffness: how stiff patient felt in past 24 hours; rated 0 = not felt any stiffness to 10 = felt extremely stiff.</description>
