    <textblock>
      To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol as add-on therapy with
      stable-dose disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for achieving clinical remission
      in patients with moderate to low disease activity rheumatoid arthritis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment period starts with a 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized period
      followed by an open label phase until week 52.

      In the double blind phase eligible patients will be randomized via an Interactive Voice
      Response System (IVRS) in a 1:1 ratio to receive either certolizumab pegol (400 mg at Weeks
      0, 2 and 4, followed by 200 mg every two weeks) or placebo up to and including Week 22. All
      patients will continue to receive their Disease Modifying AntiRheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)
      therapy established before study entry until Week 52. At Week 24, patients will not receive
      any injection but will be evaluated:

        -  Non-remitters at Week 24 (patients who did not achieve remission at both Week 20 and
           Week 24) will be discontinued from the study and may be given the opportunity to enter
           in an open-label follow-up trial, C87080 [NCT00843778], with certolizumab pegol.

        -  Remitters (i.e. patients who achieved remission as measured by Clinical Disease Activity
           Index (CDAI) at both Week 20 and Week 24) will stop their randomized treatment
           (certolizumab pegol or placebo) and be followed up until Week 52. Remitters who flare up
           (CDAI ≥11 confirmed at two consecutive visits four weeks apart) between Week 24 and Week
           52 will be re-treated with the same dosing regimen of certolizumab pegol (3
           administrations of 400mg, given every 2 weeks, followed by 200 mg given every other
           week) up to and including Week 50.

      Remitters who flare up between Week 24 and Week 52 and complete 52-week study period will be
      allowed to enter open label follow up trial at Week 52.

    <description>DAS28-ESR is calculated using the tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). Change from Baseline is computed as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement.

        <description>DAS28-ESR is calculated using tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR mm/hour) and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS mm). 0.56x√(TJC) + 0.28x√(SJC) + 0.70xlognat(ESR) + 0.014xPtGADA-VAS. 28 joints are examined. Lower score indicates less disease activity. Patients losing remission (DAS28-ESR≥2.6) for two consecutive visits will be considered as having the event on the first of the two visits. Subjects discontinued/non-remitted by Week 24 are considered as having the event on day 1.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). Change from Baseline is computed as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement. This analysis was carried out using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.</description>

      <desc>A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) in the OL phase is an AE for which the onset date and time is after 84 days after last injection in the DB treatment phase and not later than the date of the last visit for non-retreated patients or not later than 84 days after last injection for retreated patients.</desc>

Remitters stop randomized treatment and are followed up until Week 52. Remitters who flare up between Week 24 and Week 52 will be re-treated with (3 administrations of 400 mg CZP, given every other week, followed by 200 mg CZP given every other week) up to and including Week 50.
