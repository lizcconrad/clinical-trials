    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) Total Score at the End of Treatment Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Panic and Agoraphobia Scale has 13 items with a 5-point scale (range: 0 to 4). The total possible score is ranged from 0 to 52. The increasing value are considered worse outcome. The scale is grouped into 5 subscores (not including item U in total score): panic attacks ; agoraphobia/avoidance behavior ; anticipatory anxiety; disability; and health worries. Four point difference in reduction of the PAS total score has been identified as not clinically meaningful in the assessment of Panic Disorder symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants of Responder in Clinical Global Impression (CGI) - Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ratings were rated to compare with baseline by 7-point &quot; 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, 7 = very much worse&quot;.
Responder was defined as number of participants who were assessed as &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot; much improved&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Panic Attack at the End of Treatment Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Panic attacks were defined as having four or more of the following Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders symptoms. Palpitations or increased heart rate, Sweating, Trembling or shaking, Shortness of breath or smothering sensations, Choking, Chest pain or discomfort, Nausea or upset stomach, Dizziness, unsteady feelings or faintness, Feeling unlike yourself, or detached from a situation and/or like things happening around you are strange and unreal, Fear of going crazy or doing something uncontrolled, Fear of dying, Abnormal sense, Hot flashes or chills.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale Total Score at the End of Treatment Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale provided a 5-point intensity rating (0=None to 4=Very severe) of anxiety symptoms in 14 items.
The increasing values are considered worse outcome. The total possible score is ranged from 0 to 52.</description>
