      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as HPPH, that becomes active when it is
      exposed to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. This may
      be an effective treatment for laryngeal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of laser light therapy
      when given together with HPPH in treating patients with dysplasia, cancer in situ, or
      invasive cancer of the larynx.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of laser light therapy using a fixed dose of
           HPPH in patients with dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma in situ, or T1 squamous cell
           carcinoma of the larynx.

      Secondary

        -  To determine response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of laser light therapy.

      Patients undergo photodynamic therapy comprising HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1 and laser light
      therapy to the tumor on day 2. Approximately 8 weeks later, patients with a partial response,
      no response, or a geographical miss may receive a second course of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and
      then periodically thereafter.
