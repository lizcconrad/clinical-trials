  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of

      residual neuromuscular blockade at the time of tracheal extubation after reversal of
      rocuronium bromide-induced neuromuscular blockade by 4 mg/kg sugammadex with that of 50 µg/kg
      neostigmine. Residual neuromuscular blockade is defined as the fourth twitch to first twitch
      (T4/T1) ratio of

      &lt; 0.90.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Undetected residual neuromuscular blockade is common in the post-anesthesia care

      unit (PACU). In fact, 16%-42% of patients receiving intermediate-acting muscle

      relaxants in the operating room have T4/T1 ratios &lt;0.7-0.8 in the PACU. Respiratory and
      pharyngeal muscle function can be adversely affected during minimal neuromuscular blockade.
      Studies in awake volunteers and surgical patients have demonstrated that T4/T1 ratios of 0.7
      - 0.9 are associated with impaired airway protective reflexes, upper airway obstruction, a
      decreased hypoxic ventilatory response, and post-operative hypoxemia. The incidence and
      severity of residual neuromuscular blockade at the time of tracheal extubation will be
      evaluated to determine how these influence the length of stay in the operating room and PACU.

    <measure>Residual Neuromuscular Blockade Evidenced by T4/T1 Ratio at the Time of Tracheal Extubation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to the first 24 hours after tracheal extubation</time_frame>
    <description>Neuromuscular function was monitored by applying repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve every 15 seconds, and assessing twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle with a TOF-Watch® SX. The magnitudes (heights) of the first and fourth twitches (T1 and T4) were used to calculate the T4/T1 ratio, where a higher T4/T1 ratio indicates a greater recovery from neuromuscular blockade, with a value of 1.0 indicating complete recovery. After anesthesia, when neuromuscular function was expected to be fully recovered, tracheal extubation was performed, at which time the T4/T1 ratio was measured, with any missing recovery times imputed.</description>
