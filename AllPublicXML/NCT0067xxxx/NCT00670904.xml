      This randomized trial compared the effectiveness of a three session pharmacist-delivered
      group program for smoking versus one 5 to 10 minute standard care session delivered over the
      telephone on 7-day point prevalence quit rates. Participants in both groups were offered
      their choice of bupropion IR or nicotine patch at no cost. At 6 months after the established
      quit date, self-reported cessation was biochemically verified using tests for urinary
      cotinine.

    <description>Participants assigned to the treatment group participated in a pharmacist-delivered program at the clinic. The six-hour program consisted of three in-person sessions delivered at 2-week intervals over 5 weeks to a small group of smokers. Participants were offered their choice of one medication either bupropion IR or nicotine patch using doses and durations based on current medical practices. Participants receiving bupropion received a quantity sufficient to complete 12 weeks of therapy. Participants receiving nicotine patches received a quantity sufficient to complete 8 weeks of step-down therapy.</description>

    <description>Those assigned to the control group received one 5 to 10 minute session delivered by the clinical pharmacist over the telephone that included all the components of standard care recommended by the Clinical Practice Guidelines for brief interventions delivered by health care providers. Participants were offered their choice of one medication either bupropion IR or nicotine patch using doses and durations based on current medical practices. Participants receiving bupropion received a quantity sufficient to complete 12 weeks of therapy. Participants receiving nicotine patches received a quantity sufficient to complete 8 weeks of step-down therapy.</description>
