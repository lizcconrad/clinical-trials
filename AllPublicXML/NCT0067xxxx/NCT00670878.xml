  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter randomized controlled, Phase III study comparing the
      disease free survival after randomisation in patients treated with 3 cycles of
      Epirubicin-Fluorouracil-Cyclophosphamide (FEC)-chemotherapy, followed by 3 cycles of
      Docetaxel (D)-chemotherapy versus 3 cycles of Epirubicin-Fluorouracil- Cyclophosphamide
      (FEC), followed by 3 cycles of Gemcitabine-Docetaxel(DG)- chemotherapy. Patients will be
      required to have HER2-neu positive disease and histopathological proof of axillary lymph node
      metastases (pN1-3) or high risk node negative, defined as: pT&gt;=2 or histopathological grade
      3, or age &lt;= 35 or negative hormone receptor', but are not allowed to have evidence of
      distant disease. Patients will have to be entered into the study no later than 6 weeks after
      complete resection of the primary tumor. No other antineoplastic treatment other than
      surgical treatment, the defined cytotoxic and endocrine treatment and radiotherapy will be
      allowed prior to study entry and during the course of the study.
