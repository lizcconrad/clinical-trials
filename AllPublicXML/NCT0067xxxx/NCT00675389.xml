  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in rural, resource-limited settings entails
      substantial challenges due to limitations in the health service infrastructure and in human
      resources for HIV/AIDS care. In addition, long geographical distances between providers, care
      facilities, and patients can represent a significant barrier to appropriate and timely care.
      The use of peer health workers as frontline adherence supporters and clinical monitors in
      order to improve care in underserviced settings has been implemented by a number of programs,
      but the effect of peer support on HIV care outcomes has not been extensively evaluated.
      Mobile phones have also been proposed as a potential method of improving access to health
      care in resource-limited environments by expediting communication and data transfer, but
      rigorous studies on their effectiveness in Africa have not yet been conducted.

      The Rakai Health Science Project (RHSP) was founded in 1987 to study the HIV epidemic in the
      rural setting of Rakai District in southwest Uganda. Since June 2004, the US President's Plan
      for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has enabled the RHSP to provide ART through a community-based
      distribution system which includes clinical monitoring via a decentralized, mobile clinic
      approach. By late 2006, the program has screened 4,397 HIV-infected individuals and initiated
      ART in 849 patients. One of the challenges of providing ART in this setting has been the
      distance between many patients' homes and the clinic and medical staff trained in HIV care.
      This distance and the lack of communication channels make frequent clinic contacts difficult
      and has raised concerns about adherence and management of drug toxicity. This study will
      investigate whether peer health workers can help support this AIDS care program and improve
      patient outcomes.

      This study is a three armed, community-randomized operations research trial to assess the
      effectiveness of peer health workers, with and without mobile phones, in improving the
      delivery of HIV care in the resource-limited Rakai setting. The three arms will be: a)
      communities with peer health workers, b) communities with peer health workers and mobile
      phones, and c) control communities without peer health workers.

      Study hypotheses include:

        -  Peer health workers, by supporting adherence and by managing simple clinical issues,
           will reduce virologic treatment failure and improve ARV adherence compared to patients
           in communities without peer educators.

        -  Mobile phone technology used by peer health workers, by more rapidly addressing
           adherence and clinical problems, will reduce treatment failure and improve adherence
           compared to patients in communities with peer health workers without mobile phones.

    <description>Peer health workers are themselves PLWHA on ART who have demonstrated good ART adherence for at least 6 months. The peers are responsible for ~15-20 patients and are expected to visit the patients in their homes once every two weeks. At these visits, peers record a review of symptoms, client self-report of adherence, and a pill count. At the clinic, peers assist with patient organization and share their experiences, particularly with patients about to start ART. Peer health workers undergo an initial, intensive two day residential training course and are provided with a bike and basic supplies, and a modest amount of remuneration to encourage compliance with their responsibilities and promote a high program retention rate.</description>

    <description>In addition to the peer health worker intervention, this arm adds a mobile phone intervention consisting of the following: during home visits, peers with mobile phones, using data collected on their home visit forms, send real-time text messages containing this clinical and adherence data back to the central clinic to be reviewed by clinical staff within a 24 hour period. Peers may also call, toll-free, back to a central clinic Warmline with any questions or concerns.</description>
