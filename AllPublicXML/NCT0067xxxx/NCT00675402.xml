  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that previous studies demonstrated the feasibility of the required MRI techniques, we
      propose to study the macro- and microvascular adaptations in PAOD patients undergoing
      supervised exercise therapy. It is expected to provide valuable insights into the
      contribution of each vascular mechanism to the rehabilitation and to identify which vascular
      mechanism fails or is insufficient for a successful rehabilitation. Improvement of future
      treatment requires the identification of relevant adaptive mechanisms. With this we will
      provide early noninvasive MRI readout tools to diagnose and monitor the potential
      rehabilitation during any form of therapy for PAOD that affects the peripheral vasculature.

    <intervention_name>supervised treadmill exercise program</intervention_name>
    <description>Supervised treadmill therapy consists of a walking exercise on a treadmill under supervision of a physiotherapist, 2-3 times a week. This program is combined with individual walking every other day and the total duration of the program is 6 months. Guided by the painfree walking distance, every month the angle and/or speed of the treadmill will increase. A standardized protocol for this type of therapy is already in use by many physiotherapists in Limburg (Willigendael, 2005).</description>
