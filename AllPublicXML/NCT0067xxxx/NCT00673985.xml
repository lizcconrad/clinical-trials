      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards
      Lifesciences LifeStent nitinol self expandable stent device and its delivery system in the
      treatment of occlusive superficial femoral artery (SFA) disease by reducing the
      re-intervention rate as compared to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone

      The RESILIENT Trial is a dual stage clinical investigation designed to evaluate the safety
      and effectiveness of the Edwards Lifesciences self-expanding stent system.

      Phase 1 consists of a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study with a peri-procedure
      endpoint. Phase 2 consists of a prospective, multi-center, randomized study with a 30-day
      primary safety endpoint and a 6-month primary effectiveness endpoint.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent approved by the IRB.

          -  ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Lifestyle-limiting claudication defined as: Rutherford Cat. 1-3.

          -  Target lesion(s) is de-novo or restenotic and located within the native SFA and/or
             proximal popliteal artery

          -  Angiographic evidence of ≥ 50% stenosis or occlusion

          -  Target RVD is ≥ 4.0 mm and ≤ 7.0 mm

          -  Target total length of the lesion or series of lesions is ≤ 150 mm.

          -  Angiographic evidence of at least one vessel runoff to the foot.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to conform to the study protocol procedures and visits.

          -  Lifestyle-limiting claudication/CLI (Rutherford Cat. 4-6)

          -  Patients who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the clinical
             investigation

          -  Contraindication to study related medications, Ni, Ti, Ta, or other media that is not
             amenable to pretreatment.

          -  History of bleeding diatheses or coagulopathy.

          -  Concomitant renal failure with a creatinine of &gt; 2.0 mg/dL.

          -  Concomitant hepatic insufficiency, thrombophlebitis, uremia, SLE, or DVT at the time
