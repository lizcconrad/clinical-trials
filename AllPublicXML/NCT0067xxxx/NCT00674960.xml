  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pick's disease, also known as Pick disease,or FTD is a rare fronto-temporal neurodegenerative
      disease. This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation for the control,
      management and treatment of Pick's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This disorder causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and causes tau
      proteins to accumulate into the &quot;Pick bodies&quot; that are a defining characteristic of the
      disease. Tau proteins are microtubule-associated proteins that are abundant in neurons in the
      central nervous system and are less common elsewhere.

      Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the
      body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the
      endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the
      level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain
      cells.

      It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20
      microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could
      prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people who have FTD.
