    <textblock>
      This study compares the effect of Adalat LA to Coracten on drug levels as well as changes in
      blood pressure and heart rate in fed hypertensive subjects. Subjects are dosed with either
      Adalat or Coracten for first 2 weeks, followed by the other drug for 2 weeks, and then
      switched back to the original drug for one day. Blood samples, blood pressure, and heart rate
      are taken before and after each treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:- Mild to moderate hypertension (sitting DBP &gt; 95 - &lt;114 mmHg and/or SBP
        &gt; 140 - &lt; 160 mmHg) currently untreated. or- Previously diagnosed mild to moderate
        hypertension (DBP 95-114 mmHg and/or SBP 140 - 160 mmHg) well controlled on current
        treatment but experiencing adverse events who can be safely switched to the study
        treatments. or- Previously diagnosed mild to moderate hypertension (DBP 95-114 mmHg and/or
        SBP 140 - 160 mmHg), well controlled on current treatment, without adverse events, and
        willing to participate in the study. Exclusion Criteria:- Females who are pregnant, nursing
        or of childbearing age, unless sterilised. Subjects receiving any form of contraception are
        not eligible.- Subjects with a medical history of cardiac disease within 6 months (e.g.
        myocarditis or pericarditis, aortic stenosis, myocardial infarction, unstable angina
        pectoris or severe angina pectoris). - Subjects with history or evidence of congestive
        heart failure- Subjects with evidence of clinically important arrhythmia or conduction
        disturbances requiring treatment.- Subjects with severe liver disease (liver enzymes twice
        the upper limit of &quot;normal&quot;) or other gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases including
        inflammatory bowel disease or Crohns disease- Subjects with lactose intolerance.- Subjects
        with renal diseases (creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL), which could alter the absorption, metabolism
        or excretion of the study drugs.- Subjects with Type I diabetes. - Subjects taking drugs
        which may interfere with the metabolism of nifedipine (cimetidine, ranitidine, quinidine,
        digoxin, rifampicin, diltiazem, cisapride, quinupristin/dalfopristin, cyclosporin,
        phenytoin or other antiepileptic drugs,).- Subjects suffering from secondary or malignant
        hypertension.- Subjects with any known contraindication (e.g. hypersensitivity) to
        nifedipine or other calcium channel blockers of the dihydropyridine class.- Subjects with
        previously known clinically significant abnormalities of laboratory tests that might
        suggest further investigation.- Subjects with a resting heart rate &lt; 50 bpm or &gt; 100 bpm.-
        Subjects with a history of drug and/or alcohol abuse.- Subjects unwilling to comply with
        the protocol.- Subjects who have participated in another clinical trial within the last
        month.- Subjects with neurologic or psychiatric illness requiring medication (e.g.
        tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors).- Subjects with clinical evidence of ongoing or
        recent (within the last year) stroke or transient ischemic attacks.- Subjects with
        pre-existing severe gastrointestinal or oesophageal constriction or narrowing.
