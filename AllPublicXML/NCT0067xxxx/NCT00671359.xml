  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an evaluation of the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of
      TR-701 given to normal, healthy, adult volunteers in the fed and fasted state.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive the following treatments in a crossover design:

      Treatment A: Three 200-mg capsules (600-mg dose) of TR-701 administered orally with 240 mL
      room temperature tap water after at least a 10-hour fast.

      Treatment B: Three 200-mg capsules (600-mg dose) of TR-701 administered orally with 240 mL
      room temperature tap water following a high-fat meal preceded by at least a 10-hour fast.

      Descriptive statistics will be calculated for PK parameters where available, including Cmax,
      Tmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf. Minimum, maximum, mean, and median values will be determined and
      standard deviations will be calculated. Where data are available, food effect will be
      examined between test (fed state) and reference (fasted state) groups.
