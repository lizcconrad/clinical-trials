  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare how ZD4054 (Zibotentan) is taken up, how it is broken down
      and removed from the body in subjects with liver cirrhosis and hepatic impairment compared to
      healthy subjects of a similar age, sex and weight. As for all clinical trials, safety and
      tolerability of the drug will be evaluated as well to develop dosing recommendations for
      dosing of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) in subjects with varying stages of hepatic impairment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hepatically impaired subjects - Subjects with stable liver cirrhosis and hepatic
             impairment for at least 3 months prior to the start of the study.

          -  Healthy volunteers - Clinical laboratory tests within the normal reference range or
             results with minor deviations which are not considered by the Investigator to be
             clinically significant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, any evidence of additional severe or uncontrolled
             systemic disease (eg, cardiac, or renal disease) or evidence of any other significant
             clinical disorder or laboratory finding

          -  Healthy volunteers - History or presence of hepatic disease known to interfere with
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drug

          -  Hepatically impaired subjects - Fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function
             as indicated by widely varying or worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of
             hepatic impairment within the screening period
