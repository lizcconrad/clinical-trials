  <brief_title>A Study Designed to Determine if the Pharmacokinetic Disposition of Inhaled Insulin Exposure is the Same for Asthmatics and Non-asthmatics</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase 1, Open-Label, Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics After Administration of TechnosphereÂ® Insulin Inhalation Powder Alone and With Salbutamol (Albuterol) and/or After Methacholine Challenge Testing in Subjects With Asthma Versus Matched Healthy Subjects Without Asthma</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the rate and extent of absorption of TI Inhalation Powder in subjects
      with asthma and subjects with normal lung function. 24 eligible subjects will be enrolled
      into the treatment phase of the trial.

      Visit 1 screening will determine eligibility and obtain informed consent. At visit 2, 3 and 4
      subjects inhale 1 dose of 45U TI Inhalation Powder. At visit 3 subjects inhale 2 puffs
      (200mcg) Albuterol prior to dosing. Only asthmatic subjects undergo visit 4 where a
      methacholine challenge test (MCT) is performed followed by inhalation of Albuterol then
      administration of TI Inhalation Powder. Each visit's dosing will occur during a
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Visit 5 is the follow up visit.
