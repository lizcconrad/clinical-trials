  <brief_summary>

      Patients will receive 2mg/kg/day IV daily administration of AmBisome® over 30-60 minutes as a
      reaction to signs/symptoms and positive Candida culture

      Subjects will be enrolled to receive intravenously AmBisome® at 2 mg/kg/day for a maximum of
      4 weeks. Treatment will be discontinued in case of failure, adverse events precluding
      treatment or success. In case of success AmBisome® at 2 mg/kg/day should be administered for
      at least 5 days after the complete resolution of all clinical findings of an active infection
      or for at least 8 days after the last positive blood culture or culture from a normally
      sterile site. It is not recommended to declare failure (and therefore change treatment)
      before giving at least 5 days of antifungal therapy. Failures in patients given less than 5
      days of treatment should be well documented (e.g. persistent positive cultures despite
      catheter removal, clinical deterioration in absence of any explanation other than the fungal
      infection). Follow-up evaluations will be conducted at 2 and 4 weeks after the end of
      AmBisome® therapy. At end of treatment (time point for success or failure) patients may be
      shifted to oral (not intravenous) antifungals at the discretion of the local investigator,
      once a complete response has been achieved, if secondary prophylaxis is deemed necessary.

          -  Subjects with at least one positive blood culture isolation of a Candida spp. from a
             specimen or from a normally sterile site (including abdominal catheters), drawn within
             96 hours prior to study entry.

          -  Subjects who have clinical evidence of infection AT SOME TIME WITHIN 48 HOURS PRIOR TO
             ENROLLMENT, including AT LEAST ONE of the following:
