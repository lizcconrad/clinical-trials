      Postoperative ileus (POI) in the absence of any mechanical obstruction remains a commonly
      encountered clinical problem.So, this study aimed to show the effective way to decrease the
      rate of postoperative Ileus (POI).

      We honestly declare that, the use of parasympathomimetic agents such as neostigmine is not
      without risk. Patients with underlying bradyarrhythmias or those receiving β-adrenergic
      antagonists may be more susceptible to neostigmine-induced bradycardia. Similarly,
      neostigmine increases airway secretions and bronchial reactivity, which may exacerbate active
      bronchospasm. Recently, a new class of drugs—peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor
      antagonists—may help enhance multimodal management of POI. Although, the cost benefit of the
      new class of drugs is debated. It has been suggested that the individual components of
      multimodal protocols—for example, laparoscopy—may reduce certain post surgical morbidities
      (including POI) But do not by them prevent POI. Therefore, combinations of strategies with
      demonstrated effectiveness—early feeding , epidural analgesia, laparoscopic surgery, and use
      of peripherally acting mu-opioid-receptor antagonists—may help transform the reactive
      approach to POI into a proactive multimodal paradigm that effectively targets the diverse
      etiologic factors leading to this common clinical problem.
