      The purpose of this study is to investigate an anticancer immunotherapeutic, AGS-003, when
      used in combination with sunitinib (the treatment regimen) in a single-stage, Phase II design
      in subjects with previously untreated advanced stage RCC after nephrectomy/excisional
      biopsy/metastasectomy. AGS-003 is formulated using mature DCs co-electroporated with CD40L
      IVT RNA and autologous total tumor RNA
