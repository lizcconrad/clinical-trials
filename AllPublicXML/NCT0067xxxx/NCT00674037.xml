      Patients' recruitment is difficult in clinical trial. Financial incentives are frequently
      proposed to clinicians in private funded trials. However, the effect of these financial
      incentives has never been evaluated.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of financial incentive on the rate of
      recruitment of patients in a cohort study.
