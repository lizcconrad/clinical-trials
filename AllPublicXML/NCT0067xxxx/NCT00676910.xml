    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of JNJ-26854165 (a new drug in development
      for cancer) in patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors on the maximum dose
      tolerated by these patients.

    <textblock>
      JNJ-26854165 is a new drug in development and belongs to a class of drugs that act on the
      specific protein present in cells. It may stop cancer cells from growing or kill cancer
      cells. In this study, the safety (the effect on the body) of the JNJ-26854165 in patients
      with advanced or refractory solid tumors will be examined. The effect (if any) of
      JNJ-26854165 on the disease will be assessed throughout the study. The maximum dose tolerated
      by these patients will be determined.

      The dose of JNJ 26854165 will start low and will be increased during the study. The drug will
      be taken by mouth every day in each 21-day cycle. The dose each patient receives will be
      assigned at enrollment. Patients who enroll at a later time may receive a higher dose. If
      patients do not have severe side effects at a certain dose level, the next group of 3 to 6
      patients will get a higher dose. The dose will increase until some patients have severe side
      effects. The dose will be then decreased and 3 to 6 patients will receive the highest amount
      of drug where non-severe side effects were observed.

      The amount of JNJ 26854165 in the blood will be measured and the effect of JNJ 26854165 on
      the disease will also be monitored. The effect of food on the absorption, break down and
      elimination of the drug will be studied in some patients. At some dose levels, the possible
      interaction of JNJ 26854165 with medications frequently used in cancer patients will be
      examined and patients at these dose levels will be asked to take a single dose of three
      additional drugs (dextromethorphan hydrobromide (30mg), tolbutamide (250mg), and midazolam
      (5mg) &quot;cocktail&quot;) on 2 study days, which will all be supplied by the study doctor.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility up to 4 weeks before the study drug is
      administered. During Cycle 1 patients will be observed as inpatients for at least 12 hours
      after administration of the drug on 3 or 4 days and will be required to visit the study site
      on 2 additional days. One additional visit is required for patients in whom the food effect
      or interaction with other medications will be examined. During Cycle 2, patients are required
      to visit the study center on 2 days. During all cycles after Cycle 2, patients are required
      to visit the study center on 1 day. Fourteen days after the last dose of JNJ-26854165, the
      patient will be invited for a follow-up visit which will include tests for safety and the
      effect of the drug on the disease. The proposed starting dose of JNJ-26854165 is 4 mg/day as
      a single oral dose. JNJ26854165 will be provided in a glass vial with tear-off cap placed in
      a child resistant pouch so that the drug may be taken at home. Patients will take
      JNJ-26854165 each day while in the study. Treatment may continue as long as there is benefit
      and there are no unacceptable side effects as assessed by the study doctor.
