      This randomized clinical trial is aimed at testing the efficacy of pit and fissure sealants,
      in a current environmental context different from that of the seventies and eighties. It has
      a split mouth design. 4OO subjects are included and the duration of follow up is 2 years.

      This randomized clinical trial is aimed at testing the efficacy of pit and fissure sealants,
      in a current environmental context different from that of the seventies and eighties. This
      study assesses the cost-effectiveness of sealants according to the individual caries risk.
      This study takes place in Nice, Marseille and Paris (France) and the patients are to be
      enrolled both in the dental hospitals and in the private practice. In the hospitals, the
      subjects are recruited directly by the headmasters of the pediatric dentistry or public
      health departments in the three dental schools. In private practice, the head of the
      department of pediatric dentistry and / or public health dentistry, of each dental school
      chooses 4 to 6 private practitioners who are used to place dental sealants in their daily
      practice. They recruit the subjects among their own patients. The type of study corresponds
      to randomized clinical trial (Split mouth design) in which the tooth is the statistical unit
      (one pair of molars considered for each included patient). This study has a direct benefit
      for individuals. The number of necessary subjects is 328; the sample size is 400. The
      follow-up duration is 2 years. The treatment is a pit and fissure sealant on one randomized
      tooth by pair of permanent molars (Split mouth design). Sealant material is set up in
      accordance with the usual practice of each practitioner. Occlusal exams are conducted every 6
      months. The effectiveness of dental sealants and the retention of sealing materials are
      statistically analyzed according to both the individual caries risk and the clinical protocol
