  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association between the COMT haplotypes and the presence or absence of CPSP or CRPS will
      be assessed stratifying the patients based on the individual categories of trauma or elective
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective association study in which we will recruit patients who have
      experienced single extremity trauma, or who have scheduled elective surgery on a single
      extremity. HRQoL will be determined at recruitment. We will identify their haplotypes and
      genotypes for 4 linked SNPs in the coding region of COMT as described by Diatchenko [2].
      Patients will receive follow-up at 3 and 6 months following trauma or surgery. Individuals
      who report either neuropathic pain or a reduced HRQoL score will be more closely examined, in
      order to identify CPSP or CRPS. Statistical analyses will be performed to determine whether
      haplotypes are associated with the development of either condition, and to determine the
      strength of this association.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written Informed Consent prior to participation in the study

          -  Be at lease 18, but not more than 80 years of age

          -  Have the ability to read and understand the study procedures and the use of the pain
             scales and have the ability to communicate meaningfully with the Study Investigator
             and staff.

          -  Be free of other physical, mental, or medical conditions, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, makes Study participation inadvisable

          -  Is scheduled to undergo open or arthroscopic shoulder surgery

          -  If the subject is a female of childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test
             on the day of surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Has significant medical disease(s), laboratory abnormalities or conditions(s) that in the
        Investigator's judgment could compromise the Subject's welfare, ability to communicate with
        the Study staff, complete Study activities, or would otherwise contraindicate Study
        participation
