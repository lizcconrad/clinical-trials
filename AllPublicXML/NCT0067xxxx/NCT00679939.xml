    <measure>Adjusted Percent Change From Baseline in Femoral Neck (FN) Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Via Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>FN BMD (measured in grams per centimeters squared [g/cm^2]) was measured by DXA. Bone mineral density is calculated as the mineral content of a bone divided by the area of the bone. DXA is the principal technique used for measuring BMD. Percent change from Baseline at Week 52 was calculated as (BMD at Week 52 minus BMD at Baseline)/BMD at Baseline x 100% and was assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region. Change in FN BMD at Week 52 was only analyzed within the Rosiglitazone arm.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Percent Change From Baseline in Femoral Neck (FN) Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Via Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at Week 52</title>
        <description>FN BMD (measured in grams per centimeters squared [g/cm^2]) was measured by DXA. Bone mineral density is calculated as the mineral content of a bone divided by the area of the bone. DXA is the principal technique used for measuring BMD. Percent change from Baseline at Week 52 was calculated as (BMD at Week 52 minus BMD at Baseline)/BMD at Baseline x 100% and was assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region. Change in FN BMD at Week 52 was only analyzed within the Rosiglitazone arm.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Percent Change in Femoral Neck (FN) Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Via Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) From Week 52 +10 Days to Week 76+10 Days</title>
        <description>FN BMD (measured in grams per centimeters squared [g/cm^2]) was measured by DXA. Bone mineral density is calculated as the mineral content of a bone divided by the area of the bone. DXA is the principal technique used for measuring BMD. Percent change from Week 52+10 days to Week 76+10 days was calculated as (BMD at Week 76+10 days minus BMD at Week 52+10 days)/BMD at Week 52+10 days x 100% and was assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Percent Change in Femoral Neck, Total Hip, Trochanter, and Lumbar Spine BMD Via DXA From Week 52+30 Days to Week 76 + 30 Days</title>
          <description>BMD (measured in grams per centimeters squared [g/cm^2]) was measured by DXA. Percent change from Week 52 + 30 days to Week 76 + 30 days was calculated as (BMD at Week 76 + 30 days minus BMD at Week 52 + 30 days)/BMD at Week 52 + 30 days x 100% and was assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region.</description>
          <population>Safety Population. Only evaluable participants with a value at Week 52 performed up to 30 days after initiating OL MET and Week 76 performed up to 30 days after stopping OL MET for the parameter of interest were analyzed. Not all participants had correct positioning for all of the DXA measurements.</population>

        <description>BMD (measured in grams per centimeters squared [g/cm^2]) was measured by DXA. Percent change from Baseline at Week 52 + 30 days or Week 76 + 30 days was calculated as (BMD at Week 52 + 30 days (or Week 76 + 30 days) minus BMD at Baseline)/BMD at Baseline x 100% and was assessed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Percent Change in Femoral Neck (FN) Supero-anterior Integral, Trabecular, and Cortical vBMD Via QCT From Week 52+30 Days to Week 76 + 30 Days</title>
        <description>vBMD (measured in milligrams per centimeters cubed [mg/cm^3]) was measured by QCT. Percent change from Week 52 + 30 days to Week 76 + 30 days was calculated as (vBMD at Week 76 + 30 days minus vBMD at Week 52 + 30 days)/vBMD at Week 52 + 30 days x 100% and was assessed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region. Supero-anterior is the upper and front section of the FN.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Percent Change in Femoral Neck (FN) Infero-posterior Integral, Trabecular, and Cortical vBMD Via QCT From Week 52+30 Days to Week 76 + 30 Days</title>
          <description>vBMD (measured in milligrams per centimeters cubed [mg/cm^3]) was measured by QCT. Percent change from Week 52 + 30 days to Week 76 + 30 days was calculated as (vBMD at Week 76 + 30 days minus vBMD at Week 52 + 30 days)/vBMD at Week 52 + 30 days x 100% and was assessed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region. Infero-posterior is the lower and back section of the FN.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Change in Femoral Neck (FN) Infero-anterior Cortical vBMD Via QCT From Week 52 + 30 Days to Week 76 + 30 Days</title>
        <description>vBMD was measured by QCT. Change from Week 52 + 30 days to Week 76 + 30 days was calculated as vBMD at Week 76 + 30 days minus vBMD at Week 52 + 30 days and was assessed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region. Infero-anterior is the lower and front section of the FN.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Change From Baseline in Albumin-adjusted Serum Calcium (AASC) at Week 52 and Week 76</title>
        <description>AASC levels were measured from blood samples. AASC is the amount of free calcium circulating in the blood and calcium is required for good bone health. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 52or Week 76 value minus the baseline value and was assessed by an ANCOVA with terms for treatment, baseline value, prior therapy, and region.</description>
