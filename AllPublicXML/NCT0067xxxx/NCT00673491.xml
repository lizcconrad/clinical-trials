  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine whether clinical pathways: 1)improve the quality
      of the care provided to patients affected by stroke in terms of clinical outcomes, efficiency
      continuity of care and patients' satisfaction; 2) facilitate the use of evidence based
      medicine in clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The coordination of care has been proved to be able to improve prognosis in acute stroke
      patients. Prompt identification of symptoms, organised timely and efficient transportation
      towards appropriate facilities, has become essential part of effective treatment, as well as
      organized rehabilitation. The importance of organized stroke care in facilitating recovery
      has been recognized for the last 10 years, but it is still unclear how organized care
      contributes to improved outcomes. Since clinical pathways aim to promote evidence- and
      guideline-based care, improve the organisation and efficiency of care, and reduce cost, their
      implementation may be a method for achieving the organizational standards required to grant
      appropriate care in stroke. Even though in the past decade, care pathways have been
      increasingly implemented as a tool in acute stroke care and stroke rehabilitation the
      evidence supports partially the use of clinical pathways in stroke because very little
      prospective controlled data demonstrated their effectiveness through the continuum of the
      care. Our study was designed in order to conduct a rigorous evaluation of clinical pathways
      for treatment of acute stroke patients in different types of organized stroke care.

    <description>Clinical pathways are a methodology for the mutual decision making and organization of care for a well-defined group of patients during a well-defined period. Defining characteristics of clinical pathways includes: an explicit statement of the goals and key elements of care based on evidence, best practice, and patient expectations; the facilitation of the communication, coordination of roles, and sequencing the activities of the multidisciplinary care team, patients and their relatives; the documentation, monitoring, and evaluation of variances and outcomes; and the identification of the appropriate resources.</description>
