        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult males and females &gt; 18 years.

          -  Subjects who currently have allergic eczema with an EASI score in the range of 10-50.

          -  Subjects who have been on a stable dose of topical medications for eczema for â‰¥ 1
             month from screening but whose eczema is not adequately responsive to, or controlled
             by, conventional topical treatments (eg: topical steroids, Tracrolimus, Pimecrolimus).

          -  Subjects who have not had systemic immunosuppressive therapy (eg systemic steroids)
             within 1 month of screening.

          -  Subjects who if female, are not currently pregnant or breast feeding and are using
             medically acceptable methods of contraception.

             acceptable to the investigator.

          -  Subjects with stable, adequately treated medical conditions other than eczema may be
             enrolled provided the Investigator does not consider their study participation to
             place them at increased risk of adverse events. Subjects should continue their
             concomitant treatments for medical conditions (other than eczema).

          -  Subjects who are able and willing to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are having acute gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of screening
             and/or admission (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, heartburn), may be asked to
             reschedule their screening and/or admission to when they are not longer having acute
             symptoms.

          -  Subjects who have an acute infection such as influenza at the time of screening and/or
             admission.

          -  Female subjects who are not using an acceptable method of contraception.

          -  Subjects who have used any investigational drug and /or participated in any clinical
             trial within 3 months of their first dosing.

          -  Subjects who have previously received AeroDerm.

          -  Subjects using medication, which in the opinion of the Investigator will affect the
             outcome of the study.

          -  Subjects who have donated and/or received any blood or blood products within the
             previous 3 months prior to first dosing (to review on a case by case basis).

          -  Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator.

          -  Subjects who are unlikely to co-operate with the requirements of the study.
