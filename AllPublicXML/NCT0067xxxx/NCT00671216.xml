  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW642444 and GSK233705 are in development for treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease. Development of these two inhaled drugs as a combination therapy would have potential
      for improved patient benefit as they both work through different mechanisms and the combined
      bronchodilatory effect might be additive. This study will look at the this combination, for
      the first time, in healthy subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age.

          -  Female subjects must be of non childbearing potential including pre-menopausal females
             with documented (medical report verification) hysterectomy or double oophorectomy or
             postmenopausal

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol.
             This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication
             until 90 days post-last dose.

          -  BMI within the range 18 - 30 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Average QTc(B)≤450 msec taken from triplicate assessments at screening.

          -  No clinically active and relevant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening or 24h
             Holter ECG.

          -  Normal spirometry (FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ≥ 70%).

          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history
             (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked))

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject

          -  The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  Available to complete the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically important abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment
             (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, or ECG (12-lead).
             24hr Holter monitoring outside normal limits.

          -  A history of breathing problems (i.e. history of asthmatic symptomatology, unless
             asthma in childhood that has now resolved and no longer requires maintenance therapy
             which should not be an exclusion).

          -  A mean QTc(B) value at screening &gt;450msec, or an ECG that is not suitable for QT
             measurements (e.g. LBBB or poorly defined termination of the T wave).

          -  A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than
             140/90 mmHg at screening.

          -  A mean heart rate outside the range 40-90 bpm at screening.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A positive pre-study
             Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 months of
             screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody (if determined by the local SOP's).

          -  History of high alcohol consumption within 3months of the study defined as:

          -  an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of
             greater than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than
             14 units or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is
             equivalent to a half-pint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass
             (125ml) of wine.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, (except for simple analgesics eg
             paracetamol), including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's
             Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless
             in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history of regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products prior to screening.

          -  The subject is unable to use the novel dry powder inhaler correctly.

          -  The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to ipratropium bromide,
             Tiotropium, atropine and any of its derivatives.

          -  Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any β2 agonist
             or sympathomimetic drug,

          -  The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to milk protein or the excipients
             lactose monohydrate and MgSt.
