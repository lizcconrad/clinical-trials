      RATIONALE: Gathering information about the number of young patients with cancer and the
      outcome of these patients may help doctors learn more about cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at the medical records of young patients undergoing
      cancer treatment at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center to determine how often cancer occurs
      and the outcome of these patients.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the number of patients between 15 and 30 years old who are treated for
           newly diagnosed cancer at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC), in middle
           Tennessee, and in the state of Tennessee between 1990 and 2005.

        -  To determine the outcomes of these patients.

        -  To determine the number of these patients enrolled on clinical trials at VICC.

        -  To compare the outcomes of these patients when treated on a trial versus not treated on
           a trial provided they have the same disease.

        -  To compare the number of these patients who are treated on a clinical trial when they
           are first seen at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital vs Vanderbilt University Hospital.

        -  To determine referral patterns of these patients to VICC.

        -  To compare the outcomes of these patients who are treated at VICC vs middle Tennessee vs
           the state of Tennessee vs the entire nation.

        -  To determine the reason for not enrolling on a clinical trial.

      OUTLINE: Cancer cases taken from the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) Registry and the
      Tennessee Cancer Registry are examined for number and types of cancer, mortality rates broken
      down by county and health department region, electronic medical records, and treatment
      outcomes. Data is analyzed for comparison of number of new cancer patients, mortality rates,
      and referral patterns at VICC versus number of new cancer patients in the region, state, and
      country.
