    <textblock>
      Follow-up study 06-UPLF-01 was a prospective collection of longer-term data on the patient
      population from pivotal study S01-01US, and was conducted to expand the information regarding
      efficacy, particularly with regard to radiographic assessment of fusion, as well as the
      longer-term safety of OP-1 Putty in uninstrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) as compared to
      autograft
