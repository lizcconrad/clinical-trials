  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been a number of tobacco prevention programs developed and tested in the past few
      years, and some of the comprehensive programs have been promoted by the Office on Smoking and
      Health at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). However, the use of these programs and
      integration into school-based curriculum has been lacking due to a number of factors. We are
      proposing to develop an interactive computer-based program for tobacco prevention aimed at
      middle school students. The CD-ROM is designed to be an adjunct to the existing health
      education curriculum provided for 6th through 8th grade students.

    <textblock>
      The CD-ROM is based upon our Phase I prototype program entitled Tobacco World in which
      students are presented with a video arcade interface that offers them random access to
      several game-like activities in which they learn about tobacco and the negative health
      effects associated with tobacco use. We will expand the menu of options to include more
      complex activities and entertaining games.

      The Phase II program will deliver engaging media to educate students about the risks of
      tobacco and peer and industry influences on their decisions regarding tobacco. Games and
      activities will be designed to act on mechanisms shown to be effective in decreasing
      intentions to use tobacco through changing attitudes, social images, beliefs about short and
      long term physical consequences, perceptions of peers' social images, subjective norms, and
      perceived behavioral control. We will test individual components of the program with middle
      school students for effectiveness in changing mediating variables related to initiation and
      use of tobacco.

      The final program will be evaluated in a randomized trial where middle schools in Oregon and
      New York will be assigned to either an established tobacco prevention curriculum, or to the
      usual tobacco curriculum plus the Tobacco World program. Students will be assessed at pre-,
      post- and 6-month follow-up to evaluate the impact of program use on intentions, and actual
      tobacco use.
