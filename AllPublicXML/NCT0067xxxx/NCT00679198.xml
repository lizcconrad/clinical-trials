    <textblock>
      SPECIFIC AIMS: We propose a three-year study to develop a high-intensity intervention to
      improve osteoporosis care and test a novel intervention in a group-randomized trial of 27
      home health offices and 1,000 patients referred to home health care with a history of
      fracture.

      Aim 1. Develop an intervention to promote osteoporosis treatment that includes: (1) training
      to enhance nurse-patient and nurse-physician risk communication regarding osteoporosis and
      fracture risk; (2) automated prompts within the home health agency's electronic medical
      record system to promote appropriate osteoporosis management; and (3) implementation of
      osteoporosis-related standardized care pathways and order sets.

      Aim 2. Conduct a group-randomized trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention to
      promote initial use of osteoporosis medications and adherence to treatment after discharge
      from home health. We hypothesize that:

      H1: Patients in the intervention group will have increased initial receipt of osteoporosis
      prescription medications and calcium/vitamin D supplements to prevent and treat osteoporosis
      compared to patients receiving usual care; H2: Patients in the intervention group will
      demonstrate increased persistence in the use of these therapies compared to those receiving
      usual care.

      Secondary Aims (SA) will include exploratory analyses of fracture related morbidity and
      mortality, patient-reported quality of life, and health services utilization and costs.

    <description>We will train home health nurses to act as patient advocates by communicating the risks and benefits of osteoporosis treatment to patients and their healthcare providers.
Thus, we will provide a comprehensive, integrated approach to the management of osteoporosis among patients with a history of insufficiency fractures that is highly generalizable to a national setting.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be identified as &quot;at-risk&quot; if they are referred to home health care for
             post-fracture care or if they are admitted for another reason and have a previous
             diagnosis of fracture.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in hospice, with a life expectancy &lt; 1 year, over 95 years old, or with
             concomitant metabolic bone diseases (e.g. Paget's disease of bone) will be excluded.
