  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generic medications should be the equivalent of brand medications with the exception of their
      price. Before a generic medication is introduced, its bioequivalence within a window of 80 to
      125% of the original has to be demonstrated. There are reports that this criterion is not
      always followed in post-marketed periods. Such investigations were triggered by the
      observation that some patients previously stable on original medications relapsed when
      switched to a presumable equivalent generic. Several factors could account for this problem.
      Given reports of such problems occurring with the antidepressants citalopram and venlafaxine,
      some pharmacokinetic properties of specific brands of generics and the originals will be
      examined for these two medications. Twelve healthy male volunteers will participate in this
      crossover study. It is anticipated that there will be significant differences emerging
      between the two formulations given the clinical reports of patients deteriorating when
      switched from the original to the generic preparations.

    <description>Crossover Effexor / NOVO-Venlafaxine
Examination of the bioequivalence of Effexor (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) and NOVO-Venlafaxine (NOVOPHARM).
Both drugs will be given at the dose of 75 mg/day (one capsule per day) for 4 consecutive days. A washout period (corresponding to 10 half-life of the active metabolite desmethylvenlafaxine) will be respected after receiving each medication.</description>
