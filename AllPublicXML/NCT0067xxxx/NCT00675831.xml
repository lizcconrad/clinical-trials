  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cell depletion
      in a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) product with the use of the CliniMACS machine.
      Previously, patients with hematologic malignancies who have relapsed after transplant have
      been given infusions of donor white blood cells calsed donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) as a
      way to boost their immune function and fight cancer. Information from other research studies
      suggests that lowering the number of a certain type of white blood cell called CD25+ Tregs in
      the DLI may allow for a greater effect. In this research study, we are looking for the
      appropriate dose of DLI depleted of the CD25+ Treg white blood cells that can be given
      safely.

      -  The original marrow/stem cell donor will undergo one or two white blood cell collection
           procedures called leukopheresis. The cells collected from the first leukopheresis will
           be sent to the laboratory where the amount of white blood cells collected will be
           measured. If the number of cells collected at the first leukopheresis is not enough, the
           donor will have a second leukopheresis procedure.

        -  Once enough lymphocytes are collected from the donor, the CliniMACS CD25 Reagent System
           device will reduce the number of CD25+ Tregs. The CD25+ depleted donor lymphocytes will
           then be infused to the participant intravenously. Participants will be observed for
           about one hour after the infusion.

        -  One, two, four and eight weeks after the DLI, participants will return to the clinic for
           follow-up visits. At each visit a physical exam, questions about the participants
           general health, and blood tests will be performed.

Dose level -C: 3x10^7 (CD3+Dose (#cells/kg*))
Dose level -B: 1x10^7 (CD3+Dose (#cells/kg*))
