  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this series of challenge studies is to examine the impact of menstrual cycle
      phase on cortical GABA response to administration of agents with either direct
      (benzodiazepines) or indirect (progesterone, fluoxetine) GABA modulating properties. While
      the impact of these agents on cortical GABA levels in women with premenstrual dysphoric
      disorder (PMDD) is of interest, this study is designed primarily for those women without a
      psychiatric illness.

    <description>This study was conducted at Yale University almost two decades ago. Our group at the University of Pennsylvania only has very basic information about this study. This includes the number of participants, which was 8, and the fact that no adverse events occurred. Staff members at the University of Pennsylvania do not have access to any additional study data. The contact person who initially entered this study protocol information is no longer at the University of Pennsylvania and we are unable to contact for additional information.</description>

             on the DSM-IV research criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and has
             been used in numerous studies to confirm the presence or absence of significant
             premenstrual mood and behavioral difficulties;

          -  Must be willing and able to participate in at least three of the four challenge
             paradigms.

          -  Medical, neurologic or cerebrovascular disorder (CVA, seizure disorder, etc.);

          -  Family history of first degree relative with an Axis I psychiatric or substance
             dependence disorder (excepting alcohol and nicotine) (per subject report);

          -  Current treatment with psychoactive medication;

          -  Diabetes controlled by means other than diet;

          -  Use of steroid contraceptives (any method involving hormones) within the previous 4
