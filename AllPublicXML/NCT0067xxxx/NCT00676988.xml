      To assess the relationship between the change in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores
      and trough serum infliximab concentration in subjects who are scheduled to receive infliximab
      infusions at an interval of 8 weeks.

      This cross sectional study will evaluate a sample of 360 subjects with luminal Crohn's
      disease who are receiving infliximab in 15-20 Canadian infusion centres. The sample will be
      stratified by disease activity [mild = CDAI &lt;150, moderate/severe = CDAI â‰¥150] and whether or
      not subjects are on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Thus 4 strata will be created
      consisting of 90 subjects each. Consent will be obtained prior to or at Visit 1, subjects
      will retrospectively complete a CDAI diary card for the preceding 7 days and blood work will
      be drawn prior to infliximab infusion. Four weeks thereafter at Visit 2, subjects will
      provide an additional blood sample to measure serum infliximab concentrations and CRP levels.
      Between Visits 1 and 3, subjects will complete daily CDAI diary entries. Visit 3 will take
      place at the next scheduled infusion, 8 weeks after Visit 1 (+/- 7 days ).
