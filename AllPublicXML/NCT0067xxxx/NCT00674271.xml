      The aim of this study is to investigate the relation between individual differences in
      pattern recognition molecules (PRM's) in the innate immune system and the prevalence and
      development of vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      This is based on the hypothesis that pattern recognition molecules (PRM's) in the innate
      immune system contributes to a chronic low grade inflammation in diabetic patients. Variation
      in PRM's - at the genome, proteome as well as the functional level - are therefore associated
      with the degree of chronic low grade inflammation, and probably also with the prevalence of
      vascular complications.

      Aim: The primary aims of the project are:

        1. By use of advanced magnetic resonance imaging to characterize the prevalence of
           atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries in patients with newly diagnosed type 2
           diabetes.

        2. To investigate if individual differences in the innate immune system contributes to the
           prevalence and development of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.

        3. To prospectively observe the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a cohort of
           patients with type 2 diabetes seen in the light of the obtained baseline
           characteristics.

      Background: Type 2 diabetes is a very common disease in the western world. Patients with type
      2 diabetes are at risk of a number of complications, including macroangiopathy which involves
      an accelerated atherosclerosis, that causes most of the increased mortality and morbidity in
      type 2 diabetics. Mounting evidence suggests that development of vascular complications is
      associated to a chronic low grad inflammation in type 2 diabetes. Individual differences in
      the innate immune system might contribute to this chronic low grade inflammation as it has
      become apparent that in some situations - as after tissue ischemia or in diabetes - a change
      in the body's own cell glycosylations occurs, which leads to increased affinity of PRM's.
      This study will focus primarily on two families of PRM's: Collectins and Toll-like receptors.

      Methods: The study consists of a prospective observational cohort study of 100 newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with continuous 2-year clinical follow-up and a
      register-based follow-up of morbidity and mortality study after 5 and 10 years. Furthermore
      100 healthy control subjects will be included. Baseline data will represent a independent
      cross-sectional study of the relationship between the innate immune system, glycemic control
      and the presence of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries in newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetic patients.
