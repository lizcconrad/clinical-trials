        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neuropathic pain of peripheral origin as a consequence of either post-herpetic
             neuralgia or post-traumatic neuropathic pain

          -  Well-defined skin area of mechanical allodynia to punctate (von Frey filament) stimuli

          -  Pain intensity score of â‰¥ 4/10 for von Frey filament-evoked allodynia at the skin area

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have undergone neurolytic or neurosurgical therapy, including skin
             excisions, for neuropathic pain

          -  Patients who have trigeminal neuralgia, central pain, chronic radiculopathy, or
             peripheral neuropathy of non-mechanical or unknown origin

          -  Patients with any other co-existing pain which cannot be differentiated from the
             neuropathic pain of peripheral origin
