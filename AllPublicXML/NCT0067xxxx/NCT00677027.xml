      The drug substance to be studied is a powder produced from shiitake mushroom, containing
      beta-glucans. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of increasing doses of
      MM-10-001 and to determine the dose of MM-10-001 that enhances the immune system in normal
      healthy subjects.
