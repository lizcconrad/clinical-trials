  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the correlation between the region of abdominal tenderness determined by the
      examining physician and the location of acute pathology diagnosed on abdominal CT. We
      hypothesize that the acute pathology diagnosed by CT will lie within the region marked on the
      abdominal wall by the examining physician prior to CT.

    <description>The examining physician will place a radio-opaque skin marker (Beekley Corporation, Ortho-SPOTSÂ® Order Code 187; 6mm spherical markers) at the point of maximal tenderness to direct abdominal palpation indicated by the patient. Additional markers will be placed at the cephalad and caudad limits of the region of tenderness, defined as the point at which the patient no longer complains of direct tenderness to palpation.</description>

        All consecutive emergency department patients undergoing abdominal CT for non-traumatic
        abdominal pain and tenderness will be prospectively enrolled, with the following
        exceptions. For study purposes, &quot;abdominal pain and tenderness&quot; is defined as pain and
        tenderness to direct palpation in the region anterior to the mid-axillary line bilaterally,
        and extending from the costal margins to the inguinal ligaments. Consequently, patients
        undergoing CT for indications such as isolated vomiting, fever without source, staging of
        malignancies, isolated flank pain or suspected renal colic, or other indications that do
        not meet the above definition will not be enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All consecutive emergency department patients undergoing abdominal CT for
             non-traumatic abdominal pain and tenderness will be prospectively enrolled, with the
             following exceptions. For study purposes, &quot;abdominal pain and tenderness&quot; is defined
             as pain and tenderness to direct palpation in the region anterior to the mid-axillary
             line bilaterally, and extending from the costal margins to the inguinal ligaments.
             Consequently, patients undergoing CT for indications such as isolated vomiting, fever
             without source, staging of malignancies, isolated flank pain or suspected renal colic,
             or other indications that do not meet the above definition will not be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women do not routinely undergo abdominal CT due to radiation concerns and
             will be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients with altered mental status or altered abdominal sensation (due to
             neurological conditions such as paraplegia) that may prevent assessment of the
             location of abdominal tenderness will be excluded.

          -  Preverbal children will be excluded as they rarely undergo CT and will be unable to
             indicate the region of maximal tenderness.
