      in subjects with chronic insomnia.

      Insomnia is characterized by difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep or complaints of
      non-restorative and non-refreshing sleep. Transient insomnia affects approximately one-third
      to one-half of the US population, based on the results of 2 surveys of representative samples
      of the adult US population conducted by the Gallup Organization in which respondents were
      asked if they had &quot;ever had difficulty sleeping.&quot; Based on reports of &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;frequent&quot;
      sleep difficulty, results from the same studies suggest that approximately one-tenth of the
      US population experiences chronic insomnia. The ideal treatment for insomnia would reduce the
      latency to onset of sleep and increase total sleep time, without a negative impact on sleep
      architecture and without safety concerns or next-day effects.

      Ramelteon is selective melatonin-1 receptor agonist under global development by Takeda
      Chemical Industries, Ltd., for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia and for the
      treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.

      The purpose of this study is to obtain data in support the safety of long-term use of
      Ramelteon for insomnia, and to determine whether there are any adverse effects associated
      with extended use. Participation in this study is expected to be about. Participation in this
      study is anticipated to be approximately 13 months.
