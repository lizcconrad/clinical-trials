  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome characterized by repetitive episodes of airway
      obstruction during sleep, which result in low oxygen level in the blood and bad sleep
      quality. Both of these effects are implicated in medical, neurological and cognitive
      disorders in subjects with OSA. The purpose of this study is to examine how OSA affects
      medical and neurobehavioral outcomes after gastric bypass surgery for weight loss in morbidly
      obese patients.
