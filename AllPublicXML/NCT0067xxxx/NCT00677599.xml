  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this placebo controlled trial is to determine whether a year long intervention
      with flavonoids (found in cocoa and soy) is more effective in reducing the risk of
      cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes, than standard therapy
      (statins). A range of markers of cardiovascular disease risk are being studied and volunteers
      are also providing urine and blood samples. 152 postmenopausal women, from the locality, will
      be recruited for this study.
