        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a Physician Responsible, based on a medical evaluation
             including history, physical examination, laboratory tests, cardiac monitoring. A
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory variables outside the reference
             range for the population being studied, with the exception of liver transaminases,
             troponin I and TSH, may be included only if the Investigator considers that the
             finding will not introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the
             study procedures. Please note that subjects should have liver transaminases, troponin
             I and TSH values within the range specified in the exclusion criteria below.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea and confirmed by screening follicle stimulating hormone
                  (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml or &lt;140 pmol/L.. Females on hormone
                  replacement therapy (HRT) must discontinue HRT and their post-menopausal status
                  confirmed as per above tests prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at
                  least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw;
                  this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of
                  their post-menopausal status, they are not allowed to use HRT during the study.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods as per
                  protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
                  investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of
                  pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until at
                  least 7 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods as per protocol. This
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until
             at least 7 days post last dose.

          -  No co-morbid Psychiatric Disorders as defined using the Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I) scale.

          -  Normal neurological examination performed by the study neurologist

          -  A 12-lead ECG at screening showing no abnormalities that in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator will compromise safety in this study.

          -  Body weight &gt;/ 50 kg and BMI within the range 19.0 - 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  The subject must be able to read, comprehend and record information.

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject

          -  The subject is available to complete the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of any of the medical interview, physical examination or screening
             investigations the Physician Responsible considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  The subject or his/her family has a history of a drug or other allergy which in the
             opinion of the Physician Responsible contraindicates the participation in the study.

          -  Subjects with an unstable medical disorder or a disorder that would likely interfere
             with the action, absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of GW823296, may
             pose a safety concern, or interfere with accurate assessment of safety.

          -  The subject has a current or recent (within six months) documented gastrointestinal
             disease; a history of malabsorption, oesophageal reflux, or irritable bowel syndrome;
             frequent (more than once a week) occurrence of heartburn, or any surgical intervention
             (e.g. cholecystectomy) which would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs.

          -  History of psychiatric illness

          -  Any history of a clinically significant abnormality of the neurological system
             (including dementia and other cognitive disorders or significant head injury) or any
             history of seizure (excluding febrile seizure).

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of any
             drug(whichever is longer)

          -  The subject has screening alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST) &gt;1.5x upper limit of the normal range (ULN); testing may be repeated once to see
             if value returns to within acceptance range but any such laboratory abnormality must
             be resolved by the baseline visit.

          -  Subjects with a troponin I value &gt;0.03 ng/mL at screening are not eligible. Testing
             may not be repeated. The subject should be referred to the treating physician for
             further evaluation, as appropriate.

          -  Subjects with a TSH value above the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) at screening
             are not eligible. The subject should be referred to the treating physician for further
             evaluation, as appropriate. Testing may be repeated once to see whether the value
             returns to within normal range but such abnormality must be resolved before the
             baseline visit.

          -  Subjects with a history of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis

          -  The subject is unable to abstain from strenuous physical activity for 72 hours prior
             to screening, for 72 hours prior first dosing until the last PK sample has been
             collected, and for 72 hours prior to the follow-up visit.

          -  The subject has donated a unit of blood (450 mL) within the previous 60 days or
             intends to donate in the month after completing the study

          -  Subjects with a history of eye disease (excluding moderate myopia) or clinically
             relevant eye examination finding, which in the opinion of the study ophthalmologist
             contraindicates their participation in the study

          -  The subjects is currently taking regular (or a course of) medication whether
             prescribed or not, including vitamins and herbal remedies, such as St John's Wort. Any
             concurrent medication will not be permitted for 48 hours before admission to the CPRU
             until the end of the study period (follow-up visit), unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the
             study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

        An average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater
        than 3 units (males), or an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an average

          -  History of regular use of tobacco or nicotine containing products within 3 months

          -  The subject has a past history of drug/alcohol abuse or has a positive pre-study
             drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be screened for include
             Amphetamines, Barbiturates, Cocaine, Opiates, Cannabinoids, Benzodiazepines and
             Ethanol.

             study
