  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The values of laboratory examinations which are useful for the diagnoses of appendicitis are
      white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte blood sedimentation
      rate (ESR). However up to date there is no laboratory marker for the pre-operative diagnosis
      of appendiceal perforation in acute appendicitis. Recently hyperbilirubinaemia has been
      associated with appendiceal perforation. Aim of this retrospective study is therefore to
      investigate if hyperbilirubinaemia has a diagnostic value for the pre-operative diagnosis of
      appendiceal perforation in patients with appendicitis.

      We identified 538 patients with histologically proved acute appendicitis who underwent
      laparoscopic or conventional appendicectomy between January, 2004 and December, 2007 in a
      surgical department of an academic teaching hospital. A retrospective multiple chart review
      of the medical records including laboratory values (bilirubin, CRP, white blood count) and
      histological results was conducted.
