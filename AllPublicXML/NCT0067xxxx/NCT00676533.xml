      The primary objective of this clinical trial was to determine the time to improvement of the
      signs and symptoms (eg, dysuria, frequency, urgency, gross hematuria, suprapubic pain,
      hesitancy, low back pain) of acute, uncomplicated, symptomatic, lower UTIs in women treated
      with Cipro XR 500 mg once daily for 3 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:- Non-pregnant, non-lactating women between the ages of 18 and 65 years
        with signs and symptoms of acute, uncomplicated, symptomatic lower UTI were eligible for
        enrolment. Dysuria and at least 1 clinical sign or symptom of a lower UTI (frequency,
        urgency, suprapubic pain, or gross hematuria) had to be present, with symptom onset &lt;/= 72
        hours before study entry. - In addition, 1 pretreatment clean-catch MSU culture had to be
        positive for 1 to 2 urinary pathogens (&gt;/= 10.000 colony-forming units {CFU}/mL). Women of
        childbearing potential were required to use 2 reliable methods of contraception during
        exposure to study drug. Exclusion Criteria:- Men- Women who were pregnant, nursing, or not
        using 2 medically accepted, effective methods of birth control- Known or suspected
        hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or the quinolone class of antimicrobials- Subjects taking
        urinary analgesic medication (phenazopyridine-containing products {eg, Pyridium}) within 24
        hours before first dose of study drug and throughout the study for urinary tract pain-
        Subjects taking other analgesic medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
        [NSAID], acetaminophen-containing products, etc) for urinary tract pain or any other pain
        (eg, headache, back pain, joint pain, dental pain, sore muscles, etc) within 2 dosing
        intervals for that medication before first dose of study drug and throughout the study.
        More specifically, a subject who had taken a medication for pain could not be entered into
        the study until the time elapsed since her last dose of the medication was equal to at
        least 2 dosing intervals for that medication.- History of gastrointestinal illness that
        could interfere with absorption of orally administered antimicrobials- Subjects requiring
        concomitant administration of multivalent cation-containing products such as
        magnesium/aluminum antacids, sucralfate, Videx (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or
        pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc, such as multivitamin
        preparations. These medications were not to be taken less than 6 hours before or 2 hours
        after study drug administration. - Subjects experiencing vaginitis- Subjects with a
        temperature &gt;/= 38.3°C or &gt;/= 101°F, flank pain, chills, or any other manifestations
        suggestive of upper UTI - Subjects with evidence of factors predisposing to the development
        of UTIs, including calculi, stricture, primary renal disease (eg, polycystic renal
        disease), or neurogenic bladder - Subjects currently taking, or who might require,
        antibiotics other than Cipro XR during the study period- Subjects who had received any
        systemic antibiotic therapy in the previous 48 hours, for any reason- Subjects who, in the
        opinion of the investigator, were unsuitable for enrollment and were unlikely to complete
        the course of treatment or to be available for follow-up- Subjects unable or unwilling to
        comply with the use of an electronic subject diary to record UTI symptoms and impairment of
        normal daily activities- Subjects requiring concomitant administration of theophylline -
        Inability to take oral medication for any reason - Subjects with &gt;/= 3 episodes of UTIs in
        the past 12 months - Subjects with onset of symptoms more than 72 hours prior to study
        entry - Subjects with symptoms of a UTI within the 4 weeks prior to the present episode -
        Subjects with previous history of tendinopathy associated with fluoroquinolones - Subjects
        diagnosed with a rapidly fatal underlying disease (death expected within 6 months) -
        Subjects previously enrolled in this clinical study - Subjects with known neutrophil count
        &lt; 1000/mm3, CD4 &lt; 200/mm3, or other conditions associated with significant depression of
        host defense; HIV testing was not mandatory - Subjects taking an investigational drug in
        the last 30 days - Subjects who could not begin answering the first visit baseline
        questionnaire by 5:00 pm
