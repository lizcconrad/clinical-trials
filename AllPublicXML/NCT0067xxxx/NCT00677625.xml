      The purpose of this study is to collect data to examine and characterize the clinical
      outcomes of pediatric patients diagnosed with any liver disease at Children's Hospital of
      Wisconsin.

      In this study, medical information which is routinely obtained on children with any liver
      diseases, or children who have had a liver transplant will be entered into a database. No
      extra tests are done for participating in this study, and no extra visits to the doctor are
      required. The clinical data collected is then entered into a database and followed
      longitudinally. The information obtained from this study will help researchers learn more
      about pediatric liver disease, therefore providing better routine clinical treatment.
