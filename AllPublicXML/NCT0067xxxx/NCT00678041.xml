      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common complication after surgery for prolapse or
      urinary incontinence. UTIs are painful and have the potential to turn into kidney infections.
      We are asking women who self-catheterize after surgery to try either an antibiotic or a
      placebo pill so we can see if we can prevent UTIs without causing side effects.

      This study will not require any additional visits or blood draws. You will be asked to answer
      some questions, keep a brief diary of your experience, and immediately report any symptoms of
      a UTI to your doctor.

      Abstract:

      Specific aim: to determine if extended release nitrofurantoin antibiotic prophylaxis
      administered to patients performing clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) after
      pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery decreases the incidence of
      symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) compared with placebo.

      Study Design: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

      Methods: Consented patients who undergo urogenital surgery and fail their post-operative
      voiding trial will be randomized to either extended release nitrofurantoin 100mg or an
      identical appearing placebo capsule to be taken daily while performing CISC and for three
      subsequent days after stopping CISC. Catheterized urine specimens will be sent for culture
      and sensitivity when women report symptoms consistent with cystitis. Symptomatic UTI will be
      defined using strict culture-based definitions. We anticipate that the study will end within
      6 weeks of starting CISC.

      Data Analysis: Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated with Student t test and
      Fisher exact test.

      Sample Size: Assuming a decrease in symptomatic UTIs attributable to nitrofurantoin
      prophylaxis from 33% to 10%, with 80% power, and a two-sided alpha of 0.05, and a 10% dropout
      rate, we should recruit a total of 108 patients.
