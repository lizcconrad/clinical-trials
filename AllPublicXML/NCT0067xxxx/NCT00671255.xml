      Insomnia is characterized by a complaint of initiating and maintaining sleep or complaints of
      nonrestorative and non-refreshing sleep. Transient insomnia affects approximately one-third
      to one-half of the US population, based on the results of 2 surveys of representative samples
      of the adult US population conducted by the Gallup Organization in which respondents were
      asked if they had &quot;ever had difficulty sleeping.&quot; Based on reports of &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;frequent&quot;
      sleep difficulty, results from the same studies suggest that approximately one-tenth of the
      US population experiences chronic insomnia. The ideal treatment for insomnia would reduce the
      latency to onset of sleep and increase total sleep time, without a negative impact on sleep
      architecture and without safety concerns or next-day effects.

      Ramelteon is a selective melatonin-1 receptor agonist under development by Takeda Chemical
      Industries, Ltd., for the treatment of transient and chronic insomnia and for the treatment
      of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.

      Ramelteon is the first candidate in a novel class of drugs based on this mechanism. Based on
      non-clinical and clinical studies completed to date, TAK-375 has the potential to offer
      unique advantages relative to approved hypnotics in terms of its pharmacological profile and
      its selectivity to the melatonin-1 receptor.

      This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of 35-day treatment of chronic
      insomnia with ramelteon. Participation in this study is anticipated to be approximately 2
      months.
