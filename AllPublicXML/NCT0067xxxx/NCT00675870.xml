      A common current therapeutic approach to APL uses oral ATRA and chemotherapy in induction and
      consolidation. This approach has significantly improved survival in newly diagnosed APL
      patients. However, approximately 30% of patients relapse. Recently, an approach involving the
      combination of oral ATRA and arsenic trioxide has been tested. The prognosis for relapsed
      patients is very poor. This study seeks to investigate NRX 195183 monotherapy in patients who
      have failed or are resistant to or are intolerant of any prior therapy.

    <description>Daily oral NRX 195183 administration for 90 days to assess CR rate. Patients with CR may continue maintenance therapy after a 2-week drug holiday. Maintenance therapy will consist of two 3-month daily oral NRX 195183 administration separated by a 2-week drug holiday.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of APL morphology or FAB M3 variant confirmed by RT-PCR assay or
             chromosome analysis/FISH showing t(15:17) translocation. Patients must also have
             relapse from, resistance to or intolerance of any one or more of the following
             therapies:

               -  ATRA

               -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy

               -  Arsenic trioxide

          -  Patients must be 18 or older.

          -  Bilirubin equal or less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Creatinine equal or less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Patients entered into this study should be non-pregnant and non-nursing and should not
             plan on becoming pregnant while on treatment. Treatment under this protocol would
             expose an unborn child to significant risks. Women and men of reproductive potential
             should agree to use an effective means of birth control. There is an extremely high
             risk that a severely deformed infant will result if NRX 195183 is administered during
             pregnancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-APL, AML patients should be excluded from the study.

          -  Other serious illnesses which would limit survival to 6 months.

          -  Psychiatric conditions which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed
             consent.

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease. This would include history of a recent
             acute myocardial infarction, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, or active angina.

          -  AIDS or HIV positive patients, although HIV test is not required for accrual.
