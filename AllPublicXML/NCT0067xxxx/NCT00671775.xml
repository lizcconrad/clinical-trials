  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that obesity is associated with adverse neurocognitive outcome.
      Recent studies demonstrate that elevated body mass index (BMI) is an independent risk factor
      for Alzheimer's disease, structural brain abnormalities, and cognitive dysfunction in older
      adults. Preliminary work from our lab extends these findings and shows structural brain
      differences and cognitive dysfunction also exist in obese young and middle-aged adults.

      Bariatric surgery is increasingly viewed as an effective intervention for morbid obesity,
      though its effects on cognition are unknown. Post-operative nutritional deficiencies are
      common and can adversely impact cognitive performance. However, substantial weight loss
      resolves or improves many medical conditions with reversible cognitive effects, suggesting
      bariatric surgery may provide cognitive benefits.

      No study to date has examined the cognitive effects of bariatric surgery. To do so, the
      proposed study will prospectively assess cognitive performance in 125 bariatric surgery
      patients enrolled in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) project and 125
      matched controls. Bariatric surgery patients will complete a computerized cognitive test
      battery at four time points: pre-operatively, 12 weeks post-operatively, 12 months
      post-operatively, and 24 months post-operatively. Matched control participants will complete
      the test battery at similar intervals. Demographic, medical, and psychosocial information
      will be collected to elucidate possible mechanisms of change. We hypothesize that the
      substantial weight loss following bariatric surgery will be associated with improved
      cognitive performance.
