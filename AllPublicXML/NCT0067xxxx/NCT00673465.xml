    <textblock>
      This study includes two parts, each part includes three consecutive 28-day treatment periods.
      Part 1 (to be conducted in the United States): each participant will receive the following
      treatments for 28 days in each of three treatment periods in an order determined by a random
      code: SCH 497079, or matching placebo, or metformin.

      Part 2 (to be conducted in India): this part of the study will be conducted after completion
      of Part 1 and an analysis indicates a clinically significant decrease in blood glucose in
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to placebo. The same procedures
      conducted in Part 1 will be conducted in Part 2.
