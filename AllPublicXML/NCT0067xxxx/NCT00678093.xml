  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mulligan's mobilisation techniques are believed to increase the range of movement (ROM) in
      patients with low back pain. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical
      effects of Mulligan's &quot;SNAG&quot; technique on lumbar flexion ROM. The secondary aim was to
      measure the intra- and inter-day reliability of lumbar ROM employing the same procedure, and
      utilising a 3-D motion analysis system for measuring range of motion (ROM).

      The primary aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical effects of Mulligan's &quot;SNAG&quot;
      technique on lumbar flexion ROM. The secondary aim was to measure the intra- and inter-day
      reliability of lumbar ROM employing the same procedure. For the interventional component of
      the study, 49 asymptomatic volunteers participated in it. Subjects were randomly assigned
      into either a treatment (SNAG) group (n=25), or a placebo (SHAM) group (n=24). The &quot;SNAG&quot;
      technique was applied on L3 and L4 spinal levels by an experienced manual therapist. SNAGs
      were performed with active flexion in sitting, 10 times at each level. The placebo-SHAM was
      similar to the SNAG without however applying the appropriate direction or force. Lumbar ROM
      was measured by a three dimensional electronic goniometer (Zebris CM20), before and after
      each technique. For the reliability component, five measurements in two different days (one
      week apart) were performed in 20 healthy subjects.
