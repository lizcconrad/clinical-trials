  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emphysema is a lung disease that involves damage to the air sacs in the lungs and can lead to
      breathing difficulties. Treatment options for people with emphysema include pulmonary
      rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation. This study will
      observe people with emphysema to assess the effect of these treatment therapies on their
      quality of life and long-term health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emphysema is a progressive lung disease that results in shortness of breath and a reduced
      capacity for physical activity. It is caused by inflammation within the small air sacs and
      small airways of the lungs, which can lead to the destruction of the air sac walls and
      eventually to airway collapse. Treatment options for emphysema include both non-surgical and
      surgical interventions. Pulmonary rehabilitation, a non-surgical treatment, includes a
      combination of education, exercise training, nutrition advice, and smoking cessation
      programs. The goal of pulmonary rehabilitation is to increase exercise tolerance and reduce
      breathing difficulties. Two surgical treatment options include lung volume reduction surgery,
      in which small amounts of damaged lung tissue are removed, and lung transplantation, in which
      a person's damaged lung is replaced with a healthy lung from a donor. While these surgical
      options may offer potential improvements in quality of life, they also impose substantial
      risks, including infections, pneumonia, or even death. In this study, researchers will follow
      participants over a long period of time to assess the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation,
      lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation on health outcomes and quality of
      life.

      This study will enroll people with moderate to severe emphysema who have undergone pulmonary
      rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, or lung transplantation. Participants will
      attend annual study visits and will complete computerized interviews and health-related
      questionnaires that will assess quality of life factors. Study researchers will also review
      participants' medical records to collect information on lung function and blood test results.
