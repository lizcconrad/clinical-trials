      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of administering Wilms
      tumor gene 1 (WT1) cancer peptides. Cancer peptides are short pieces of protein that are made
      in a laboratory to be like the peptides that can be found in cancer. These peptides are
      intended to be given as a &quot;vaccine&quot; to activate the immune cells in a person to attack
      his/her cancer. These peptides are mixed with an oily substance called Montanide ISA-51 and a
      white cell growth factor called Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
      which may help make the immune response stronger.

    <textblock>
      Two subgroups with 2 dose cohorts of up to 6 patients each will be enrolled in this
      exploratory study in order to attempt to obtain immunologic and clinical data on patients
      with a variety of hematologic malignancies and amongst those in remission and early relapse.
      The 2 subgroups of patients will be treated with different schemas depending upon whether
      they are undergoing or have undergone autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      For the autologous transplant patients: Immune monitoring will require 90ml peripheral blood
      before the first immunization, 3-5 ml from the leukapheresis product, 40-90ml peripheral
      blood before the 4th immunization immunizations, after the last immunization (week 6-8), and
      at the discretion of the immune monitoring lab, every two months if immunizations are
      continued.

      For the allogeneic transplant patients: Immune monitoring will require 90ml peripheral blood
      before the first immunization, 40-90ml peripheral blood before the 4th immunization
      immunizations, after the last immunization (week 6-8), and at the discretion of the immune
      monitoring lab, every two months if immunizations are continued.

      Subjects will be monitored with blood pressure, temperature, and pulse, pre-injection, at 15
      and 30 minutes after injection, prior to being allowed to leave the clinic. Diphenhydramine
      50 mg, solumedrol 100 mg, and epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mL) must be available bedside (or a
      clinic code cart must be available). If hypotension (SBP &lt;90mmHg for patients with baseline
      SBP &gt; 110mmHg or &gt; 20 mmHg decrease for those with baseline SBP&lt; 110 mmHg), urticaria or
      orofacial or laryngeal edema or bronchospasm occurs, an IV line will be placed and the
      diphenhydramine 50 mg, solumedrol 100 mg, and epinephrine 1:1000 sq are recommended. In this
      event, patients will be transported emergently to the emergency room if stabilized or the
      code team will be contacted if patients continue to have progression of symptoms or worsening
      hypotension. For fever&gt;101.5, acetaminophen 650 mg may be given orally.
