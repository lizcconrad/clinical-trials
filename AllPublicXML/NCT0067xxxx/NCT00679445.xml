      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of focal
      delivery of radiation for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in
      patients with age related macular degeneration that have failed Primary Anti-VEGF therapy.

    <textblock>
      Therapeutic advances in the arena of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have
      provided multiple treatment options for the disease. Radiotherapy has been studied in
      multiple clinical trials in the past with many studies showing a therapeutic benefit.
      Treatment with radiotherapy and anti-VEGF compounds is a promising approach to treating AMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have predominantly classic, minimally classic, or occult with no classic
             lesions, as determined by the Investigator, secondary to AMD, with a total lesion size
             (including blood, scarring, and neovascularization) of &lt; 12 total disc areas (21.24
             mm2), and a GLD ≤5.4 mm

          -  Subjects must have received a minimum of three (3) prior injections (a minimum of 3
             prior injections of the same compound) of anti-VEGF therapy (Lucentis® or Avastin®,
             subjects may have been treated previously with Macugen®, but must have been most
             recently treated with Lucentis® or Avastin® and met the criteria for failure below)
             with evidence of &quot;failure&quot; to respond to therapy

          -  Subjects must be age 50 or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with prior or subfoveal CNV therapy with photodynamic therapy, intravitreal
             or subretinal steroids, or transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) (Note: This includes
             subjects with no known history, but with photographic evidence of prior therapy)

          -  Subjects who underwent previous radiation therapy to the eye, head or neck

          -  Subjects who have been previously diagnosed with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
             Subjects who do not have a documented diagnosis but have retinal findings consistent
             with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (female subjects must be post menopausal or
             surgically sterilized)
