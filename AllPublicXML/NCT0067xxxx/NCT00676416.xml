  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The change of airway responsiveness and alveolar macrophage (AM) immunity occurs during the
      pathogenesis of asthma. Macrophage-associated airway protection in patients with asthma is
      affected positively or negatively by propofol general anesthesia. The investigators
      hypothesized that the effects of propofol on asthmatic AMs and corresponding airway
      reactivity in vivo is different from the in vitro research. Through in vivo airway
      hyperresponsiveness (AHR) observation and clinical investigation of AM immune functions from
      asthma patients undergoing propofol general anesthesia to clarify the precise effects of
      propofol on AM immunity, and to provide theoretical basis for the clinical administration of
      propofol in asthmatic patients. This would optimize the practice of clinical anesthesia,
      especially for those with the tendency of AHR.
