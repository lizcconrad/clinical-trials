  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective is to safely determine if we can identify the severity of Acute
      Kidney Injury (AKI) early in the course of the disease. Once enrolled, we will draw blood and
      urine for relevant biomarkers. Our goal is to validate if any of these biomarkers can predict
      the course of AKI (recovery v. RRT v. death)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AKI is a very common disease in the intensive care unit. However, despite advances in
      supportive care, patients with AKI carry a high mortality rate (50% to 70%). The established
      AKI affects nearly 5 percent of hospitalized persons and as many as 15 percent of critically
      ill patients. Currently, there are no FDA approved therapeutic agents for the treatment of
      AKI.

      Retrospective studies suggest that the early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT)
      improves outcome. Many clinicians tend to take a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach because they do not
      want to dialyze a patient who is destined to recover renal function without the need for RRT.
      Therefore, it is vitally important to know early in the course which patients with AKI are
      likely to progress to RRT.
