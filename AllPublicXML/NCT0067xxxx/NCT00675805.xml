  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients treated with the monoclonal antibody infliximab (RemicadeÂ®) -which binds to and
      blocks tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) - an infusomat filter is routinely used to
      prevent the very same early adverse events observed in individuals receiving intravenous
      immunoglobulins (IVIG). We recently used such a filter in a patient suffering from malaise
      and vomiting in the context of an IVIG substitution therapy. In this patient symptoms
      improved and IVIG-induced complement-activation was reduced (unpublished observation).

      Based on this simple observation we hypothesize that this simple and approved filter-system
      may be efficient in retaining complement-activating immunoglobulin G (IgG) aggregates in
      IVIG-preparations. This effect may reduce complement activation - and consecutive
      inflammation - thereby diminishing adverse events.

      In this prospective study we propose to investigate how complement activation and side
      effects after IVIG infusion relate in individuals receiving conventional (i.e. unfiltered)
      vs. filtered IVIG-preparations.

      Prospective single center study with an observational phase (phase A) and a randomized
      intervention-phase (phase B), monitoring adverse events and complement activation after IVIG
      infusion. Patients would be enrolled at the Out-patient Clinic of the Division of Hematology
      at the Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital Basel (USB). Based on the
      number of patients receiving IVIG at the Division of Hematology of the USB we expect to be
      able to complete data accrual within 8-10 months.

      Inclusion criteria: all patients at the Division of Hematology at the University Hospital of
      Basel, Switzerland after allogeneic stem cell transplant and older than 18 years which are
      planed for at least 2 applications of IVIG. The patients are included in this study only by
      informed consent.

      Methods: Side effects of IVIG will be monitored by use of a standardized questionnaire
      distributed to the nursing staff and the patients (please see attachment). Complement
      activation will be monitored before and after the IVIG-infusion using standard C3, C4 and 50%
      complement hemolytic activity (CH50) assays. Serum levels of immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin
      M and immunoglobulin G will be quantified before and after IVIG-infusion. In phase A of the
      study we aim at including approximately 40 patients (which would be predicted to include
      approximately 20 patients with clinical symptoms). In phase B we would randomize these same
      patients into two groups of similar sizes, the first group receiving standard unfiltered IVIG
      infusions, the second group receiving 0.2um filtered IVIG infusions
