    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effect and safety of two different
      doses of PZ-601 and to compare this with another antibiotic that is approved by the US Food
      and Drug Administration (also known as FDA) to treat adults with skin and skin structure
      infections.

    <textblock>
      PZ-601 is a novel investigational carbapenem antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum of
      activity that includes pathogens responsible for community-acquired bacterial infections as
      well as multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens - MRSA and vancomycin-resistant
      enterococci. PZ-601 also has activity against Gram-negative organisms including cephalosporin
      and quinolone resistant Enterobacteriaceae as well as Bacteriodes fragilis and
      peptostreptococci. Based on the antimicrobial profile, PZ-601 is a potentially promising
      agent for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
