    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health problem in this country. It is
      estimated that at least one out of every seven women in our society have been the victim of
      childhood sexual abuse at least once before their 18th birthday. Previous studies have shown
      that stress is associated with damage to neurons of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in
      learning and memory. Also, imaging studies of brain function are consistent with dysfunction
      of the medial prefrontal cortex during presentation of traumatic cues. We have previously
      shown that serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications (paroxetine; Paxil) can change memory
      function and hippocampal structure in PTSD. We now propose to perform a placebo controlled
      study with Paxil CR (paroxetine hydrochloride controlled-release tablets), which is thought
      as paroxetine with less side-effects. The main purpose of this study is to determine the
      effects of Paxil CR on memory deficits measured with neuropsychological testing, hippocampal
      volume measured with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medial prefrontal lobe cortical
      function estimated with PET, and cortisol response (reflecting the intensity of stress) in
      men and women with PTSD. We plan to recruit 40 subjects. After completing physical
      examination and evaluating neuropsychiatric history, patients will undergo an initial group
      of tests which includes memory testing, MRI and PET brain scan, and measurement of cortisol
      in their saliva. Afterwards, half will receive Paxil CR 12.5 to 62.5 mg and half will receive
      a placebo (sugar pill) in the beginning of the first 12 weeks as &quot;Double Blind Phase&quot;. After
      12 weeks, they will be administered memory tests, PET and MRI scan for the post-treatment
      phase. After this period, Paxil CR will be offered to the placebo group and followed for an
      additional 12 weeks. They will have final memory tests, and a MRI scan. We hypothesize that
      Paxil CR exerts its efficacy by acting on abnormal neural circuits, including hippocampus and
      prefrontal cortex, in PTSD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders, 4th edition (DSM IV) criteria for PTSD assessed by the Structured Clinical
             Interview for DSM IV (SCID).

          -  All patients with PTSD will be greater than 18 years of age, and will be required to
             give informed consent.

          -  Patients will be recruited from newspaper advertisements and fliers.

          -  All patients must be free of major medical illness on the basis of history and
             physical examination, lab testing, and electrocardiogram, and must not be actively
             abusing substances or alcohol.

          -  Patients should be free of psychotropic medications for four weeks before the study.

             childbearing age will be advised to use barrier contraception for the duration of the
             study, in addition to other forms of contraception that they may be using.
