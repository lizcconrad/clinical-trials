  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (abbreviated MS) is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system
      attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination. This study will
      investigate the use of far infrared radiation for MS control, management and treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS a demyelinating disease, is any disease of the nervous system in which the myelin sheath
      of neurons is damaged. This impairs the conduction of signals in the affected nerves, causing
      impairment in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions depending on which nerves
      are involved.

      MS affects the areas of the brain and spinal cord known as the white matter. White matter
      cells carry signals between the grey matter areas, where the processing is done, and the rest
      of the body. More specifically, MS destroys oligodendrocytes which are the cells responsible
      for creating and maintaining a fatty layer, known as the myelin sheath, which helps the
      neurons carry electrical signals.

      Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the
      body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the
      endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the
      level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain
      cells.

      It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20
      microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could
      prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people who have MS.
