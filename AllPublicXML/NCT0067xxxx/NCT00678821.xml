      This study will determine if a rehabilitation exercise program can help people with pulmonary
      hypertension (PH) increase their physical activity. Patients with PH have an increase in
      blood pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels (artery, vein or capillaries) that leads to
      shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting and other symptoms.

      Healthy volunteers and people with pulmonary hypertension between 21 and 75 years of age may
      be eligible for this study.

      All participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  6-minute walk test: Subjects walk as fast as they can for 6 minutes on a walking track
           to determine their ability to participate in physical activity.

        -  Questionnaires: Subjects complete nine questionnaires related to their fatigue, daily
           physical activity, mood, and so forth.

        -  Maximum treadmill test: The exercise begins at an easy level and gradually increases
           until the subject says he or she can no longer continue or the investigator decides it
           is not safe to continue. Subjects are fitted with a mask, electrodes and light sensors
           to measure how well the heart is working and how well the muscles use oxygen.

      Patients with pulmonary hypertension undergo the following additional procedures:

        -  Activity monitoring: Patients wear a monitor for 3 days that measures movement and heart
           rate.

        -  Group assignment: Patients are randomly assigned to Group 1 (education plus aerobic
           exercise) or Group 2 (education followed by exercise).

        -  Group 1 patients will attend classes three days a week at either Inova Fairfax Hospital
           Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center or The National Institutes of Health for 10 weeks. Two
           sessions a week will include a 1 hour education session as well as a 30-45 minute track
           or treadmill exercise session. The third session will only include exercise. During the
           education patients will learn about a healthy lifestyle with pulmonary hypertension.
           After the 10 weeks of education and exercise, subjects repeat the 6-minute walk test,
           maximum treadmill test and questionnaires.

        -  Group 2 patients participate in 2; 1-hour educational session at either the Inova
           Pulmonary Rehabilitation Center or The National Institutes of Health for 10 weeks. After
           the classes, they repeat the 6-minute walk test, maximum treadmill test and
           questionnaires. The following 10 weeks will consist of 3 days a week of 30-45 minute
           track or treadmill walking at either Inova or NIH, after which they again repeat the
           questionnaires, treadmill and walk tests.

      We propose a randomized trial to determine the safety and effectiveness of aerobic exercise
      for patients who have primary pulmonary hypertension (PH) or PH secondary to interstitial
      lung disease (ILD). This project will be the first in a series of studies aimed at
      establishing exercise prescription and general rehabilitation guidelines for patients who
      have advanced lung diseases.

      An essential treatment for almost all cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders is aerobic
      exercise training. The effectiveness of exercise rehabilitation has been established and
      exercise rehabilitation has become a standard of care for patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). However, fundamental information about the mechanisms underlying
      exercise training and its therapeutic benefits remains lacking for patients who have advanced
      lung disease in general and specifically for those with PH.

      Subjects will be over the age of 21 years. The patients will be enrolled from sites within a
      reasonable travel distance from the greater Washington area and will receive their exercise
      training at Inova Fairfax Hospital or at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) main campus.
      Exercise-based rehabilitation is already common for patients who have PH at the Inova Fairfax
      Hospital. Their pulmonary rehabilitation program is well established, and their staff is
      experienced in providing exercise therapy for patients with PH and advanced lung diseases.
      The Rehabilitation Medicine Department (RMD) at The NIH Clinical Center has established a
      pulmonary rehabilitation program for this protocol as well as to provide rehabilitation
      services for NIH clinic patients.

      There will be two primary treatment arms. Patients with PH will be randomized to either
      aerobic exercise training plus education (AET) or education only (Ed-only) treatments. A
      comparison group of patients with ILD who do not have secondary PH (ILD-only) will also
      undergo the AET arm. Exercise training will consist of a 10-week regimen of supervised
      treadmill or over ground walking three times a week. Exercise session duration will be 30
      minutes and will progress to 45 minutes per session over the 10 weeks. The intensity of the
      exercise will be between 70 and 80% of the heart rate reserve.

      There will also be two secondary studies. First, the subjects with PH initially randomized to
      the education only arm will complete an aerobic exercise training program after participation
      in education. In addition, we will also compare baseline tests among patients with PH,
      patients with ILD-only and healthy controls.

      The study outcome measures will be assessed at NIH, RMD. These will include pre- and
      post-exercise training comparisons of symptom limited treadmill exercise tests to assess
      heart rate, pulse oximetry, EKG, maximum oxygen consumption, bioelectrical impedance
      cardiography, and near infrared spectroscopy measurements of muscle oxygenation. We will also
      assess accelerometry based activity, 6-minute walk distance, and a number of other quality of
      life and functional measures questionnaires including: International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire, Fatigue Severity Scale, SF-36v2 Health Survey, Human Activity Profile, Stages
      of Exercise Change, Exercise Self-Efficacy, Profile of Mood States, Cambridge Pulmonary
      Hypertension Outcome Review.

      This study represents a unique opportunity to assess the effects of exercise on patients with
      advanced lung disease and may open up valuable new treatment options for these patients.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        PH and ILD-only Groups: Subjects of this study will include individuals with ILD and PH who
        are referred for Pulmonary Rehabilitation. Patients with ILD, PH or PH comorbid with ILD
        will be included. The following list provides more specific inclusion criteria:

          -  Between age 21-82 years

          -  WHO functional class II or III, will accept WHO functional class I and IV based on 6
             minute walk test results (less than or equal to 400 meters for Class I and greater
             than or equal to 50 meters for Class IV)

          -  No recent syncope or significant chest pain

          -  No prior Pulmonary Rehabilitation received within the last 6 months.

          -  Physically inactive, no participation in a structured exercise program 3 or more days
             a week for over 30 minutes at each session including pulmonary rehabilitation
             maintenance within the last 6 months.

          -  Patients may qualify if they have any one of the following conditions:

               -  PAH diagnosed by right heart catheterization defined as resting pulmonary mean
                  arterial pressure equal to or higher than 25 mmHg

               -  Interstitial lung disease, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),
                  non-specific pulmonary fibrosis (NSPF), sarcoidosis or other form of chronic lung
                  fibrosis will be based on clinical context via clinic note from primary
                  pulmonologist and an echo within one year of enrollment showing an RVSP &lt;40mmHg.

                    1. If RVSP is lower than 40mmHg patients with interstitial lung disease will be
                       enrolled without the need for a right heart catheterization.

                    2. If RVSP is indeterminate on an echo procedure performed within a year of
                       enrollment, the patient will undergo another echo test at The National
                       Institutes of Health, Echocardiogram Laboratory.

                    3. Only if RVSP is unable to be estimated on an echo at NIH, the absence of the
                       following abnormalities on echo will be used: right ventricular enlargement,
                       right ventricular hypertrophy, paradoxical movement of interventricular
                       septum and/or altered pulmonary flow velocity. If RVSP is unable to be
                       estimated and these abnormalities are absent on echo, the patient will be
                       enrolled as an ILD-only patient. If any of these echocardiographic
                       abnormalities are present the patient will not be enrolled until the results
                       of a right heart catheterization can be obtained to verify the absence of
                       pulmonary hypertension.

        Healthy Controls: The controls will include individuals who have never been diagnosed with
        primary or secondary PH and are apparently healthy. Controls will be matched to the PH
        cohort for age, gender, and body mass.

          -  Between 21 82 years

          -  Physically inactive, no participation in a structured exercise program 3 or more days
             a week for over 30 minutes at each session.

          -  No cardiorespiratory or pulmonary disease

          -  No other diseases of the neurological, metabolic, renal, or musculoskeletal system

          -  No medications that would influence aerobic capacity or treadmill performance

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH PH, ILD-ONLY AND HEALTHY CONTROLS:

        Since the goal is to examine exercise responses and adaptations as affected by PH, patients
        will have no other (except the primary disease in those with secondary PH) medical
        conditions that would impair aerobic capacity or the ability to engage in physical
        activity. These conditions would include any of those affecting the cardiovascular,
        pulmonary, metabolic, neurological, or musculoskeletal systems. Specific exclusion criteria
        for the PH and control cohorts are:

          -  Significant Restrictive or Obstructive Lung Disease with a FEV1/FVC ratio less than or
             equal to 65 percent

          -  Diagnosis of ischemic heart disease

          -  Left ventricular dysfunction with the ejection fraction less than 40 or a documented
             pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than or equal to 18 mmHg.

          -  Acute cor pulmonale

          -  Dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

          -  Non-idiopathic cardiomyopathy

          -  Significant hepatic or renal dysfunction

          -  Metastatic cancer with a life expectance of less than 6 months

          -  Disabling stroke

          -  Active substance abuse

          -  Severe psychiatric disease

          -  Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with a history of DKA

          -  Mitochondrial disease

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Ongoing tobacco use

          -  Children: Individuals younger than 21 years will not be included in the protocol
             because reference ranges for normative aerobic capacity and aerobic fitness have not
             been established for these age ranges.
