    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the ability of AGS-004 to control HIV-1 replication
      and to determine if HIV-1 immunotherapy made with dendritic cells is safe and well tolerated,
      to determine if immunotherapy increases the body's immune response to HIV-1; and, to
      determine if after stopping anti-HIV drugs, immunotherapy can control the HIV-1 virus.

      Although chronic ART raises cluster of differentiation CD 4+ T cell counts and improves
      immune function, the immune systems' ability to control HIV-1 replication is not improved.
      AGS-004 is an immunotherapeutic agent made from autologous DCs co electroporated with
      amplified in vitro transcribed (IVT) ribonucleic acid (RNA) encoding CD40L and with IVT RNA
      encoding three or four autologous HIV-1 antigens. The HIV-1 RNA is derived from the plasma
      sample taken immediately prior to the initiation of ART.

             occasion is allowed if subsequent pre-ART CD4+ cell counts were &gt; 200 cells/mm3 on at
             least two time points.
