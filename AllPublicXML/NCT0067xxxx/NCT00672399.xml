    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, randomized, three period, placebo- and positive-controlled,double-blind,
      double-dummy, crossover study will be performed with approximately 80 healthy male and female
      subjects. The effects of single doses of exenatide (10 μg, subcutaneous), moxifloxacin (400
      mg, oral) or placebo(subcutaneous or oral) on QT interval will be assessed.
