      The goal of this study is to enable the study sponsor to develop a new blood test method for
      clinicians to accurately predict which individuals with lupus will flare, when the flare will
      occur, and flare severity. Ultimately such a newly derived test would allow treating
      physicians to start pre-emptive therapy early, with the goal of achieving remission quickly
      and with a shorter duration of treatment; identify individuals who will have less severe
      flares and will thus require less aggressive treatments; or intensify and lengthen treatment
      for those individuals who will need such therapy.

      The design of this study is to follow individuals with a known diagnosis of SLE for changes
      in disease activity during the course of one year of observation. Clinical data and blood and
      urine samples will be collected at scheduled monthly visits. The clinical data and blood
      samples will be used for identifying gene expression profile(s) that are associated with
      increases in SLE disease activity (lupus &quot;flares&quot;).

      This study is currently enrolling individuals who have an established diagnosis of SLE to
      participate. There is no cost to volunteers who participate and the study pays for the visits
      to the clinics for monthly collection of clinical information and blood and urine samples.
      Women who are or become pregnant may participate in the study with the recommendation of
      their health care providers and the study doctors.
