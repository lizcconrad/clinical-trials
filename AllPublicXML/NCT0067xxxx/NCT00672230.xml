    <textblock>
      The clinical trial aspect of this study is the provision of a lutein supplement to lactating
      women and compare the amount of lutein in the milk and blood with lactating women who do not
      receive the lutein supplement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About one-fourth of preterm infants who weight less than 2 3/4 pounds at birth develop an eye
      problem. This problem occurs in the retina (back of the eye) and may result in blindness.
      This eye problem is called the retinopathy of prematurity(ROP). There are two yellow pigments
      in the retina called lutein and zeaxanthin. These pigments may protect the retina from being
      damaged by light. They may also protect the retina from being damaged by oxygen. These
      pigments are transferred from the mother to the baby. Most of this takes place during the
      last trimester of pregnancy. The situation could be worse if the baby receives formula. Most
      baby formulas do not contain lutein and zeaxanthin; breast milk does. Another worry is that
      breast milk may not have enough lutein and zeaxanthin if the mother does not eat enough
      vegetables and fruits. The purpose of this study is to measure the transfer of lutein and
      zeaxanthin from the mother to the baby, to measure the amount of lutein and zeaxanthin in
      breast milk, to find out if taking a lutein supplement will increase the amount of lutein in
      breast milk and to find out if dietary lutein and zeaxanthin are involved in the development
      of the retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
