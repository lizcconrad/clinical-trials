      The purpose of this study is to measure microcirculation in type 2 diabetes patients with
      peripheral edema who are taking pioglitazone, once daily (QD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione compound with a mode of action as a peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist. Activation of this receptor causes increased
      transcriptional activity at a number of locations that are important to carbohydrate and
      lipid (fat) metabolism. Insulin resistance is reversed by enhancing the action of insulin,
      thereby promoting glucose utilization in peripheral tissues, suppressing gluconeogenesis in
      the liver, and reducing lipolysis at the adipocyte.

      In previous studies of pioglitazone, peripheral edema (swelling in the hands, feet, and legs)
      was reported as an adverse event more often in pioglitazone groups and appears to be a dose
      dependent phenomenon with pioglitazone. The incidence of peripheral edema in monotherapy
      studies was 3.2% in pioglitazone patients compared with 0.7% placebo patients and was
      reported more by females than males. This incidence was higher when pioglitazone was combined
      with sulphonylurea or insulin (5.9% and 15.6%, respectively). In comparison, the incidence of
      edema, when sulphonylurea or insulin was combined with placebo, was 2.1% and 7.5%,
      respectively.

      This study is designed to identify the mechanisms underlying peripheral edema formation with
      pioglitazone in patients with Type 2 diabetes.

      Individuals who participate in this study will provide written informed consent and will be
      required to commit to a screening visit and approximately 4 additional visits at the study
      center. Study participation is anticipated to be about 10 to 12 weeks (or approximately 3
      months). Multiple procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood
      collection, urine collection, physical examinations and electrocardiograms.
