      1. To find the optimal dose of topotecan that can safely be given directly into the spinal
           fluid (called intrathecal administration) of children whose cancer has spread to the
           lining of the brain and/or spinal cord.

        2. To find out what effects (good and bad) topotecan has when given directly into the
           cerebrospinal fluid in children with neoplastic meningitis (cancer that has spread to
           the lining of the brain and spinal cord).

             -  Cerebrospinal fluid is the fluid that circulates around the brain and spinal cord.

        3. To determine if intrathecal topotecan is beneficial to patients.

        4. To better understand how topotecan is handled by the body after intrathecal
           administration.

        5. To evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid for signs (markers) of tumor spread.

      This is a multi-center, non-randomized pharmacokinetically-guided optimal dosing study of
      intraventricular topotecan in children with neoplastic meningitis. Topotecan will be
      administered daily for five consecutive days utilizing the schema shown in the Schema below.
      Concomitant chemotherapy to control systemic disease or bulk CNS disease is allowable
      provided that the systemic chemotherapy is not an investigational agent or one of the
      following: high-dose methotrexate (&gt; 1g/m2), high-dose cytarabine (&gt; 1g/m2), 5-fluorouracil,
      capecitabine, thiotepa, a nitrosourea, or topotecan. The starting dose for this trial was
      derived from pharmacokinetic simulations that utilized data from a prior phase I study of
      intrathecal topotecan. The simulations were performed to estimate the length of time that
      ventricular CSF concentrations of topotecan lactone would remain above an optimal &quot;target
      level&quot; of 1 ng/mL. One of the primary objectives of this study is to estimate the dose of
      intrathecal topotecan that will result in CSF lactone concentrations exceeding 1 ng/mL for at
      least eight hours after an intrathecal injection. Dose escalations for patient cohorts will
      be conducted following the traditional phase 1 design in order to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD will be called pharmacokinetically optimal if that dose
      achieves the targeted PK parameter in at least 23 of 25 patients treated at that dose level.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CSF Flow: Patients with clinical evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus are not
             eligible for this protocol. Patients with compartmentalization of CSF flow, as
             documented by radioisotope Indium111 or Technetium99-DTPA flow study are not eligible
             for this protocol. Requirement for CSF flow studies are:

             1.1 Solid or CNS tumor patients: Nuclear medicine CSF flow studies are required within

             investigator's opinion, cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or
             would compromise a patient's ability to tolerate this therapy.

          3. Concomitant Therapy Patients receiving other therapy (either intrathecal or systemic)
             designed to treat their leptomeningeal disease are not eligible for this study. Note:
             Patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy to control systemic disease or bulk CNS
             disease will be eligible, provided that the systemic chemotherapy is not an
             investigational agent or one of the following: high-dose methotrexate (&gt; 1g/m2),
             high-dose cytarabine (&gt; 1g/m2), 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, thiotepa, a nitrosourea,

             study entry.

          4. Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt are not
             eligible unless they are completely shunt-independent, e.g., shunts that have an
             on/off valve that is always in the &quot;off&quot; position.

          5. Patients must be free of uncontrolled infection, except HIV patients with AIDS-related
             lymphomatous meningitis.

          6. Patients currently receiving or who have received an investigational agent within
             the14 days prior to study registration. The 14 day period should be extended if the
             investigational agent is known to have delayed toxicity.

          7. Patients with impending spinal cord compression or other CNS involvement requiring
             emergent local XRT (e.g., acute visual loss secondary to optic nerve involvement).

          8. Patients receiving concomitant radiation therapy to the CNS. Note: Patients may
             receive radiation therapy to extra-CNS sites, e.g. painful bone metastases not in the
             craniospinal axis.
