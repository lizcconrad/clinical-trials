  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering a peptide vaccine
      consisting of twelve different tumor-rejection antigens to patients with high risk (TxN2-3M0)
      or metastatic breast cancer with no evidence of disease following their completion of
      systemic therapy. The vaccine is designed to elicit immune responses against twelve different
      pathways that are essential to tumor growth, survival and metastasis.

      The primary endpoint will be to determine the safety and feasibility of administering cancer
      peptides to patients with high risk (TxN2-3M0) or metastatic breast cancer with no evidence
      of disease following their completion of systemic therapy, with the secondary objectives of
      evaluating immune response disease relapse survival. Two cohorts of 9 patients each will be
      treated with different doses of the vaccine. They will receive the peptide vaccine
      subcutaneously on weeks 0,1,2,4,5, and 6 and then receive the immunizations every 1 month for
      6 months or disease recurrence. Toxicity will be assessed at each dose level using CTCv3
      toxicity criteria.

    <description>Patients will receive 1 injection into each thigh at each of 6 visits: week 0, week 1, week 2, week 4, week 5, and week 6. The first 9 patients will receive a 100 microgram dose and the second 9 patients a 1 milligram dose of the peptide mixture.</description>
