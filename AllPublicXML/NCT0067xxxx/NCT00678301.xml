    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity in terms of antibody response and
      the safety/reactogenicity in terms of solicited and unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse
      events following primary vaccination of African Sub-Saharan infants with pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine GSK 1024850A co-administered with a diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell
      pertussis (DTPw)-combined vaccine and oral polio vaccine in children during the first 4
      months of life.

Grade 3 irritability was defined as crying that could not be comforted/ preventing normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite was defined as the subject not eating at all.</description>
