    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy of ranibizumab and verteporfin PDT combination
      treatment and verteporfin PDT monotherapy vs.ranibizumab monotherapy alone in achieving
      complete regression of polyps in patients with symptomatic macular polypoidal choroidal
      vasculopathy.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Regression (CR) of Polyps Measured by Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) assessments were performed using the Heidelberg Retinal Angiography 2 (HRA2) machine to measure the Total Lesion Area and the degree of polyp regression. Complete regression was defined as no polyps seen on the imaging.</description>

    <description>Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) assessments were performed using the Heidelberg Retinal Angiography 2 (HRA2) machine to measure the Total Lesion Area and the degree of polyp regression. Complete regression was defined as no polyps seen on the imaging.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness Measured by Optic Coherence Tomography (OCT)</measure>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of the Study Eye at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA score was based on the number of letters read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart assessed at a starting distance of 4 meters. An ETDRS visual acuity score of 85 is approximately 20/20. An increase in the VA score indicates improvement in visual acuity.</description>
