  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, pilot study. A total of 18 subjects will be enrolled in
      this 6 month study to evaluate whether the response to intralesional alefacept injections
      prior to the standard course of intramuscularly (IM) treatment can predict clinical outcomes
      in psoriasis patients. One lesion with a psoriasis severity assessment score greater than 3
      and an induration score greater than 1 will be identified on each patient. Each lesion will
      receive only one intralesional alefacept injection during the first three weeks of the study
      (1 lesion per week). Following a 2 week observation period, subjects will undergo a standard
      12 week course of weekly intramuscular alefacept injections. The Psoriasis Area Severity
      Index (PASI) score will be used to determine the effectiveness of the intramuscular alefacept
      treatments. An 8 week follow-up period will begin after the last dose of alefacept is
      administered where safety and efficacy measures will continue to be monitored as outlined in
      the study procedures. The hypothesis is that the response to intralesional alefacept
      injections, whether it is positive or no benefit, will predict the clinical response to
      intramuscular alefacept administration.

    <description>Patients were first injected with alefacept into a single &quot;target&quot; plaque. Those who had improvement in the plaque from baseline were deemed &quot;intralesional responders&quot;. All the patients then were injected with alefacept intramuscularly. The patients who had a 70% or greater improvement in their psoriasis severity score (includes assessment of entire body) were systemic responders to alefacept. The number of patients who were both intralesional and systemic responders was measured.</description>

Intralesional Alefacept : Patients enrolled in this study will receive intralesional alefacept injections once a week for 3 weeks in three different lesions. Each lesion will only be injected once with one alefacept concentration. The week it is administered will depend on the concentration. Three different concentrations of the alefacept preparation will be administered.</description>
