    <textblock>
      Medication non-adherence is a true public health problem. Despite advancements in the
      molecular understanding of disease and improvements in therapy, patient health outcomes will
      not improve unless patients take prescribed medications regularly. Decreasing the gap between
      efficacious and effective therapy for patients with SCD is an essential research agenda.
      Hydroxyurea has been shown to be safe and efficacious in children and infants. However, the
      effectiveness of the prophylaxis depends on adherence to the recommended regimen. Medication
      adherence in SCD has previously been found to be sub-optimal in patients taking penicillin,
      desferoxamine, and pain medication. Adherence to HU has been studied to some extent in
      children with SCD. Based on estimates of adherence in other chronic illness we expect
      approximately 50% of patients to be &gt;80% adherent with their HU administration. There is no
      gold standard for improving adherence to treatment. There have been a few attempts in the SCD
      population to improve adherence. These include a day camp to promote education about
      desferoxamine and peer support, a combination of a slide-show about SCD and it complications,
      weekly phone calls by the clinic social worker and a calendar, and a seven-phase educational
      program. Given the striking improvements in the peripheral blood smear findings of patients
      with SCD on HU therapy, with reduction in the numbers of sickled cells, we hypothesize that
      viewing the peripheral blood smear of patients with poor adherence to HU compared to a blood
      smear of someone on HU can be used to improve adherence in non-adherent patients.

      We will conduct a randomized trial between the intervention of regularly showing children and
      their parents the peripheral blood smear and standard care, including reminders of the
      importance of compliance and review of complete blood count parameters, including WBC, MCV,
      and Hgb concentration. The outcome measures will be increase in hemoglobin concentration and
      %HbF and increase in perceived QOL. QOL will be measured with age-appropriate and
      parent/proxy PedsQLâ„¢. Medication adherence will also be monitored throughout the study with
      pharmacy prescription refills, physician assessment, and self-report via a visual analogue
      scale. Adherence estimates, hemoglobin concentration, %HbF and QOL will be measured at
      baseline, 3 months and 6 months.
