    <textblock>
      The Pathway PV Atherectomy System is a rotating, aspirating, expandable catheter for active
      removal of atherosclerotic debris and thrombus in peripheral vasculature.

      This is a prospective, single arm, multi-center study to obtain safety and performance data
      for the Pathway PV Atherectomy System when used as a primary or adjunctive therapy for
      percutaneous intervention to remove atherosclerotic disease, debris, and thrombus from the
      lower limb peripheral vasculature.

        <title>Major Adverse Events (MAEs) Within 30 Days</title>
        <description>Major adverse events (MAEs) are any death, target vessel revascularization (TVR), target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial infarction (MI), or amputation of the treated limb that occurred within 30 days of the index procedure.</description>
        <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
        <population>Number of study participants was statistically determined by protocol-defined endpoints. Analysis endpoints were assessed via summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals. No p-values were generated and no statistical inferences asserted regarding point estimates or confidence limits generated for any additional post-hoc data analysis.</population>
