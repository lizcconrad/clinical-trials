      The purpose of this study is to determine, in a group of overweight or obese volunteers, if a
      handheld indirect calorimeter can accurately measures oxygen consumption to determine resting
      metabolic rate compared to a portable indirect calorimeter.

      1. Background and Rationale: With the growing number of overweight and obese Americans,
           health professionals need accurate and convenient tools to help personalize weight loss
           programs. Portable indirect calorimetry measurements are more expensive than handheld
           devices and often limited to research setting only, making them impractical for clinical
           use. Additionally equations used to estimate resting metabolic rate may be significantly
           inaccurate in overweight patients. Several studies have been conducted to determine the
           accuracy of handheld devices, however none have been done in the overweight and obese
           populations. If handheld calorimeters can accurately measure resting metabolic rate in
           overweight and obese patients, these tests may be used to improve and personalize weight
           management programs.

        2. Key Objectives: To determine in a group of overweight or obese volunteers if a handheld
           indirect calorimeter can accurately measures oxygen consumption to determine resting
           metabolic rate.

        overnight. Have a BMI no less than 25 kg/m2.

        Method of Identification of Subjects/Samples/Medical Records: Participants will be
        recruited with a flyer. Interested individuals will contact the investigators who will ask
        basic eligibility questions. If eligible, pre-test requirements will be explained to the
        participant (12 hour fast, avoidance of physical activity and smoking for the same time
        period.)
