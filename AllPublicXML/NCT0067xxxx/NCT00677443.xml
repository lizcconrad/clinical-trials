      Primary objective :

      To compare the combination of S-1 and oxaliplatin(SOX) to the combination of capecitabine and
      oxaliplatin(COX) therapy for advanced or metastatic colorectal carcinoma.

      Secondary objectives :

        1. To evaluate and compare the efficacy (overall survival and response rate) in the two
           treatment groups.

        2. To evaluate and compare the quality of life of the patients and safety profiles of the
           two treatment groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The urgent need for new effective therapy with better safety profile for metastatic
           colorectal cancer patients and promising results observed so far in trials with S-1
           combined with oxaliplatin in gastrointestinal cancer including colorectal cancer
           strongly warrants the comparison of S-1 combined with oxaliplatin to capecitabine
           combination with oxaliplatin acknowledged as a standard regimen in a first-line
           treatment for advanced colorectal cancer patients.

        -  Recently, a Phase I study was completed, indicating recommended dose as S-1 100
           mg/m2/day1-14 and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2/day1), repeated every 3 weeks. However, in the
           phase II study using the above recommended dose, delayed toxicities of thrombocytopenia
           and anemia were observed. These delayed toxicities were also reported in a phase II
           study using S-1 90 mg/m2/day plus oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2/day1 in advanced gastric cancer.
           At 2007 GI ASCO, the interim data of S-1(80 mg/m2/day1-14) plus oxaliplatin (130
           mg/m2/day1) combination, repeated every 3 weeks, was presented, showing promising
           antitumor activity with favourable safety profile. Among 18 patients, there were only
           two patients with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and one with Grade 3 neutropenia. Response
           rate was 57.1 % and disease control rate was 92.9 %. Considering these results and
           Japanese data which showed that enhanced efficacy was not observed with S-1 over 90
           mg/m2/day and oxaliplatin combination, S-1 80 mg/m2/day 1-14 and oxaliplatin 130
           mg/m2/D1, repeated every 3 weeks, will be tested in this study.
