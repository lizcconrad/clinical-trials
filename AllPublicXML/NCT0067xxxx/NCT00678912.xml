      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a computer-driven system (Smartcare/PS)
      decreases weaning duration from mechanical ventilation when compared to usual care in
      children.

      Baseline data: All subjects included into this RCT will undergo routine examination upon
      admission to the hospital. These examinations include physical, medical/medication history
      (on the last year for medical history and the last 3 months for medication history (if
      available), vital signs, radiologic data and laboratory tests.

      Intervention: A pre-inclusion test (pressure support test) with a level of pressure support
      of ± 5 cmH2O of the P plateau, but no greater than 30 cmH2O (pressure-support level plus
      positive end-expiratory pressure), is performed to evaluate the patient's tolerance of this
      ventilation mode; the test is repeated daily until positive. The test could be stopped before
      30 minutes if the patient showed evidence of respiratory distress (respiratory rate &gt; 40
      breaths per minute and FiO2 &gt; 60% in order to obtain pulse oxymetry ≥ 95%). The test is
      considered positive when, after 30 minutes, the patient remained clinically stable with a
      respiratory rate lower than 40 breaths per minute and an expiratory tidal volume higher than
      6 ml per kilogram of body weight within the authorized pressure-support range, with pulse
      oxymetry no lower than 95 percent when the fraction of inspired oxygen was no greater than 60
      percent. When the pressure-support test is positive, the patient is randomized either to Arm
      1 where the intervention is weaning with the support of Smartcare/PS or to Arm 2 where the
      intervention is weaning based on usual care. Both group are ventilated with the same
      ventilator: Evita XL.
