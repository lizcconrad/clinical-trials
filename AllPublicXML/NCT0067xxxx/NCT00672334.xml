    <textblock>
      With over one million operations a year, cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is one
      of the most common major surgical procedures worldwide (1). Acute kidney injury is a common
      and serious postoperative complication of cardiopulmonary bypass and may affect 25% to 50% of
      patients (2-4). Acute kidney injury carries significant costs (4) and is independently
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality (2,3). Even minimal increments in plasma
      creatinine are associated with an increase in mortality (5,6).

      Multiple causes of cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury have been proposed,
      including ischemia-reperfusion, generation of reactive oxygen species, hemolysis and
      activation of inflammatory pathways (7-10). COMT LL genotype appears to increase the risk of
      vasodilatory shock and AKI after cardiac surgery. To date, no simple, safe and effective
      intervention to prevent cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury in a broad
      patient population has been found (11-14).

      Urinary acidity may enhance the generation and toxicity of reactive oxygen species induced by
      cardiopulmonary bypass (10,15). Activation of complement during cardiac surgery (16) may also
      participate in kidney injury. Urinary alkalinization may protect from kidney injury induced
      by oxidant substances, iron-mediated free radical pathways, complement activation and tubular
      hemoglobin cast formation (9,17,18). Of note, increasing urinary pH - in combination with
      N-acetylcysteine (19,20) or without (21) - has recently been reported to attenuate acute
      kidney injury in patients undergoing contrast-media infusion.

      In a pilot double-blind, randomized controlled trial the investigators found sodium
      bicarbonate to be efficacious, safe, inexpensive and easy to administer. These findings now
      need to be confirmed or refuted by further clinical investigations in other geographic and
      institutional settings.

      Accordingly, the investigators hypothesized that urinary alkalinization might protect kidney
      function in patients at increased risk of acute kidney injury undergoing cardiopulmonary
      bypass needs to be confirmed in an international multicenter, double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial of intravenous sodium bicarbonate.

      Renal impairment following cardiopulmonary bypass is common. While most of these patients do
      not require either short or long term renal replacement, the mortality of patients with acute
      renal failure is substantially greater than those who do not develop renal dysfunction.

      In a pilot double-blind, randomized controlled trial we found sodium bicarbonate to be
      efficacious, safe, inexpensive and easy to administer. These findings now need to be
      confirmed or refuted by further clinical investigations in other geographic and institutional
      settings.

      There is evidence that sodium bicarbonate affects the cardiovascular, respiratory and immune
      systems and may be of benefit to patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      Study Design - overview and rationale Patients will be randomised to receive sodium
      bicarbonate from the induction of anaesthesia until 24 hours postoperatively, or a placebo
      (sodium chloride).

      Serum creatinine is the most commonly used clinical indicator of renal function along with
      urine output. Both will be measured for several days postoperatively - the time period during
      which renal impairment is most likely to develop.

      Randomisation The randomisation will be based on random numbers generated by computer. Once
      consent is obtained, the allocation of either treatment with sodium bicarbonate or placebo
      will be organised by an independent person (clinical trials pharmacist) who will dispense the
      coded and blinded infusion bags (shrink-wrapped in extra black plastic bags). This will be
      delivered to the anaesthetic staff looking after the patient in theatre, and the ICU nurse
      caring for the patient postoperatively.

      20 ml samples of heparinised blood and urine will be taken from the arterial line or urine
      catheter. Samples will be taken immediately after the preoperative insertion of the
      arterial/urine catheter, at 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after commencement of
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Immediately following collection, the preoperative, 6 and 24 hour
      blood and urine will be centrifuged at low speed to separate the plasma from the cellular
      components. Urine and plasma and full-blood (for COMT polymorphism) will be stored in
      aliquots (where necessary) at -70 degrees prior to batch analysis.

      The following variables will be obtained:

      Code for patient, gender and age. Date and time of admission to ICU Operative procedure and
      date and time on and off cardiopulmonary bypass Preoperative assessment of left ventricular
      function, Comorbidities, Pre-, intra- and post-operative medication, Markers of renal
      function and COMT polymorphism as described above, Doses of frusemide administered (or rate
      of frusemide infusion) Use of inotropes or vasopressors Cardiac output whenever measured for
      clinical purposes in the first 24 hours postoperatively Requirement of renal replacement
      therapy Urine output in each 6 hour period during the presence of urine catheter Acid base
      status and electrolytes at baseline, 6 and 24 hours after commencement of cardiopulmonary
      bypass, Time of intubation and extubation, Date and time of arrival on and discharge from ICU
      and hospital, death Resources required The principle of the study has been discussed with the
      involved cardiac anaesthetists, cardiac surgeons, intensivists and intensive care nurses, who
      have offered their co-operation. ICU research nurse to allocate patients and collect clinical
      data. Pharmacy will be required to prepare drug and placebo infusion bags. Clinical pathology
      will be required to perform 24 hour creatinine clearance estimation (in addition to those
      tests clinically indicated) Protocol violations All protocol violations will be recorded. It
      will then be decided whether the nature of such violation had been such that the patient
      should be excluded from primary data analysis. Such evaluation will be blinded to treatment.

      Withdrawal The treating clinician will have the right to withdraw the patient from the study
      if he or she believes that continued participation is jeopardising the patient's well being.

      Ethical Issues sodium bicarbonate used in this study is considered to be very safe as has
      been demonstrated by its widespread clinical use in the management of critically ill patients
      with metabolic acidosis. We consider the potential benefit of this treatment theoretically
      significant. Given the balance of benefits and risks, we consider it ethical to proceed and
      seek informed consent.

      Indemnity This is an investigator-initiated study and, accordingly, no commercial sponsor's
      indemnity has been provided.

      Informed consent will be obtained from the patient prior to the operation by one of the
      investigators or the ICU research nurse. The clinical care of a patient who does not consent
      for any reason will not be affected.
