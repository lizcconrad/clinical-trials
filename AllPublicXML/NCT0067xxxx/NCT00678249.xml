      This study compared the FLAIR™ Endovascular Stent Graft to balloon angioplasty in patients
      with stenoses at the venous anastomosis of a synthetic AV access graft.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 227 patients were treated at 16 U.S. investigational sites to evaluate the safety
      and effectiveness of the FLAIR™ Endovascular Stent Graft. This study compared the FLAIR™
      Endovascular Stent Graft to balloon angioplasty in patients with stenoses at the venous
      anastomosis of a synthetic AV access graft.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Treatment Area Primary Patency (TAPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>TAPP was defined as patency (open to blood flow) after the study index procedure until reintervention in the treatment area (within 5 mm proximal or 5 mm distal to the study device or index balloon angioplasty treatment area), or thrombotic occlusion that involved the treatment area.</description>

    <measure>Total Number of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>The safety endpoint was evaluated based on the incidence of adverse events observed within the same time interval. An adverse event was defined as any undesirable clinical occurrence in a patient that (a) is considered possibly or definietly device related by the investigator, (b) involves the access circuit (AV graft arterial anastomosis to the superior vena cava-right atrial junction) or the arm where the access circuit is located or (c) the investigator considers relevant to the objectives of this study. An adverse event could be mild, moderate or severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Successful Delivery of the Device</measure>
    <time_frame>Index Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to successfully deliver the FLAIR™ Endovascular Stent Graft. Successful delivery is the ability to deliver and seat the implant in the intended location of a stenosed segment of the venous anastomosis region of a synthetic access graft. This attribute is only applicable to the FLAIR and FLAIR Roll-in arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Procedural Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Index Procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Procedural Success was defined as anatomic success (&lt;30% residual stenosis) and at least one indicator of hemodynamic or clinical success</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With TAPP</measure>
    <time_frame>2 month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>TAPP was defined as patency (open to blood flow) after the study index procedure until reintervention in the treatment area (within 5 mm proximal or 5 mm distal to the study device or index balloon angioplasty treatment area), or thrombotic occlusion that involved the treatment area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Access Circuit Primary Patency (ACPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>ACCP defined as patency (open to blood flow) following the index study procedure until access thrombosis or an intervention of a lesion anywhere within the access circuit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Access Circuit Assisted Primary Patency (ACAPP)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>ACAPP defined as patency (open to blood flow)following the index study procedure until access thrombosis or a surgical intervention that excludes the treated lesion from the access circuit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Access Circuit Cumulative Patency (ACCP or Secondary Patency)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>ACCP defined as patency (open to blood flow) following the index study procedure until the access is surgically revised or abandoned because of the inability to treat the original lesion. Multiple treatments for occlusions to restore patency are compatible with ACCP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Binary Restenosis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month Follow-Up</time_frame>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients between 18 to 90 years of age whose hemodialysis access was a
             synthetic AV access graft located in an arm.

          -  Angiographic evidence of one or more stenoses, 7 cm or less in length and greater than
             or equal to 50%, at the graft-vein anastomosis of a synthetic AV access graft. The
             entire lesion must have been located within 7 cm of the anastomosis such that
             approximately 1 cm of the IMPRA/Bard Device must have extended into non-diseased vein
             and approximately 1 cm, but no more than 2 cm, of the IMPRA/Bard Device will be
             extended into non-diseased AV graft.

          -  Clinical evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis.

          -  Percutaneous endovascular therapy for the identified lesion was the best treatment
             choice in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Patients must have been able to understand and provide informed consent.

          -  Patients whose synthetic AV access grafts had been implanted greater than 30 days and
             had undergone 1 or more successful hemodialysis sessions.

          -  During primary balloon angioplasty, full expansion of an appropriately sized
             angioplasty balloon, in the operator's judgment, must have been achieved.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant disease (e.g., terminal cancer) or other medical condition that was likely
             to result in death of the patient within 6 months of the time of implantation.

          -  Stenoses that had a corresponding thrombosis treated within 7 days.

          -  The presence of a second lesion in the access circuit less than or equal to 3 cm from
             the edges of the primary lesion that was treated within 30 days or that was greater
             than or equal to 30%. Access circuit was defined as the area from the AV access graft
             arterial anastomosis to the superior vena cava-right atrial junction.

          -  The presence of a second lesion in the access circuit greater than 3 cm from the edges
             of the primary lesion that was greater than or equal to 30%. Second lesions that were
             greater than or equal to 30% must have been treated prior to patient inclusion to
             reduce the percent stenosis to less than 30%.

          -  Patients who were unwilling or unable to return for follow-up visits or patients with
             whom follow-up visits may have been unreliable.

          -  Patients who had a stent placed at the target lesion site.

          -  Patients with a blood coagulative disorder or sepsis.

          -  Patients in which the IMPRA/Bard Device would have been required to cross an angle
             (between the inflow vein and synthetic AV access graft) that was greater than 90
             degrees.

          -  Patients in which the IMPRA/Bard Device would have been required to be deployed fully
             across the elbow joint, which is identified radiographically by a combination of the
             humeroulnar joint and the humeroradial joint.

          -  Patients with a contraindication to the use of contrast media.

          -  Patients whose AV access graft was infected.

          -  Patients who were currently or were scheduled to enroll in other investigations that
             conflicted with follow-up testing or confounds data in this trial.

          -  Procedural use of another investigational device.

          -  Patients who were pregnant.
