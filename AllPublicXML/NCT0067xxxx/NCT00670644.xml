      RATIONALE: Identifying why patients don't do self care for lymphedema may help doctors plan
      better at-home self-care treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at self-care practices for lymphedema in patients
      with breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To systematically identify and describe the barriers to completing recommended at home
           self-care of lymphedema in patients with breast cancer.

        -  To identify patient recalled instructions as to at home self-care practices for
           lymphedema as told to them by healthcare professionals and others.

        -  To identify the current at home self-care practices of breast cancer survivors with
           treatment treated lymphedema.

      Secondary

        -  To examine the relationship between at home self-care activities and symptoms in breast
           cancer survivors with lymphedema.

        -  To examine the relationship between at home self-care activities and quality of life in
           breast cancer survivors with lymphedema.

        -  To identify patient-perceived benefits to at home self-care.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete questionnaires about their breast cancer diagnosis and treatment
      history, lymphedema history and problems, and years of education and income. Patients also
      complete surveys about home self-care practices for lymphedema and any benefits, burdens, or
      barriers of at home care.
