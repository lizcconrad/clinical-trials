      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate equivalent safety and IOP-lowering effectiveness
      of two Travoprost/Timolol combination products in patients diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma
      or ocular hypertension. This global study will be conducted in the US (C-07-64, NCT00672997)
      and Japan (C-08-08, NCT00760539).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Open-angle glaucoma or confirmed ocular hypertension.

          -  Mean IOP in at least one eye, the same eye(s):22-36 mmHg at 9 AM on eligibility visits
             1 &amp; 2 and 21-36 mmHg at 11 AM and 4 PM on Eligibility Visits 1 &amp; 2.

          -  Sign an informed consent form.

          -  Discontinued use of all IOP-lowering medications(s) for a minimum of 4 days to a
             minimum of 27 days or more prior to the Eligibility 1 Visit.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant during
             the study period, breast-feeding, or not using adequate birth control measures.

          -  Any form of glaucoma other than open-angle glaucoma (with or without a pigment
             dispersion or pseudoexfoliation component) or confirmed ocular hypertension.

          -  History or current evidence of chronic or recurrent severe inflammatory eye disease in
             either eye.

          -  History or current evidence of clinically relevant or progressive retinal disease such
             as retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment in either eye.

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) worse than 0.6 logMAR in either eye.

          -  Severe central visual field loss in either eye.

          -  Not able to safely discontinue use of all IOP-lowering ocular medication(s) according
             to the Ocular Hypotensive Medication Washout Schedule.

          -  History or current evidence of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD) that would in the opinion of the investigator preclude the
             safe administration of a topical beta-blocker.

          -  History or other evidence of severe illness or any other conditions which would make
             the subject, in the opinion of the investigator, unsuitable for the study.

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
