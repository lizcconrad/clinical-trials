  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of Bowman-Birk
      inhibitor concentrate in healthy men. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep
      cancer from forming. The use of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate may prevent cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the toxicity of single-dose Bowman-Birk Inhibitor Concentrate (BBIC) when
      administered as a suspension in orange juice in healthy male participants.

      II. Determine the appropriate dose range and doses to be used in a subsequent phase I
      multiple-dose BBIC study that will be based upon the data gathered from this phase I
      single-dose study.

      III. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of single-dose BBIC.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Bowman-Birk Inhibitor Concentrate (BBIC).
      Participants are sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose level cohorts. One participant in each
      dose level cohort is randomized to receive placebo or BBIC.

      Participants receive a single dose of oral BBIC or placebo, as an orange juice suspension,
      immediately followed by consumption of a defined low-fat breakfast. Participants continue to
      consume a low-fat diet for the next 48 hours and then resume their normal diet.

      Participants undergo blood and urine sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic
      studies. Samples are analyzed by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure
      concentrations of BBIC and its metabolites in serum and urine.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed once weekly for 4 weeks.

    <description>Presented in a form of time course of serum BBI concentration after BBIC ingestion by the study subjects and peak concentration (Cmax), time to reach peak concentration (Tmax), area under the curve (AUC), and elimination rate constant (kel) and serum half-lives (t1/2) will be calculated for each subject. Mean, median, and 95% confidence interval will then be calculated for each parameter for each dose group. The relationship between dose and the above parameters will be investigated using simple linear regression.</description>
