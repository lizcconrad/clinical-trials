  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The well established importance of regular administration of antiplatelet drugs stands on
      firm grounds, as large meta-analyses have shown these therapies to significantly reduce the
      risk of death. Plavix® (clopidogrel) is widely used following coronary angioplasty, to reduce
      the risk of periprocedural thrombotic complications, for up to one year. As the current
      recommendations suggest clopidogrel use for no longer than one year, the drug is normally
      discontinued within that period. In the limited state of knowledge on antiplatelet drug
      withdrawal, an early sound of alarm has risen from early thromboembolic complications
      reported after the interruption of antiplatelet treatment used in prevention of ischemic
      vascular disease. Although little information is available, discontinuation of
      thienopyridines has been associated with increased thromboembolic complications, mainly acute
      stent thrombosis. These complications may signal a platelet sensitization effect to
      aggregating stimuli by antiplatelet drugs taken chronically.

      The current study aims to evaluate the impact of clopidogrel discontinuation on platelet
      function, in order to shed light on underlying mechanisms leading to increased risk of acute
      thrombo-occlusive events.
