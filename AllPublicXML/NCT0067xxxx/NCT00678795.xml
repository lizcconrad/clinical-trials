      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Sativex® compared with placebo in
      reducing the daily number of episodes on incontinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a ten week, multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled parallel group
      study to evaluate the efficacy of Sativex® on urge incontinence associated with neurogenic
      unstable bladder. Multiple sclerosis patients with incontinence symptoms are screened to
      determine eligibility and complete a two-week baseline period. They then return for a further
      eligibility check, randomisation and initial dosing. Subjects titrate and self-medicate with
      study medication between study visits at weeks two and five. They will also complete efficacy
      assessments in their diary-books and at visits.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Number of Incontinence Episodes at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effect of Sativex in neurogenic overactive bladder, the incontinence episode frequency was selected as the primary endpoint. Baseline was the average of all available data recorded during the 14 days immediately prior to the randomisation visit. End of Treatment was the last average available from Week 3, Week 5, and Weeks 7-8. A negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Episodes of Urgency at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily diary entries throughout 10 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects documented in the daily subject diary each instance of urgency, and the time that each took place, as for the recording of incontinence episode frequency. Baseline was the average of all available data recorded during the 14 days immediately prior to the randomisation visit. End of Treatment was the last average available from Week 3, Week 5, and Weeks 7-8. A negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Episodes of Nocturia at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects documented in the daily subject diary each instance of nocturia, and the time that each took place (as for the recording of incontinence episode frequency). Baseline was the average of all available data recorded during the 14 days immediately prior to the randomisation visit. End of Treatment was the last average available from Week 3, Week 5, and Weeks 7-8. A negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Number of Incontinence Pads Used at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects documented in the daily subject diary, the total number of incontinence pads they had used each day. Baseline was the average of all available data recorded during the 14 days immediately prior to the randomisation visit. End of Treatment was the last average available from Week 3, Week 5, and Weeks 7-8. A negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Total Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) Questionnaire Score at the End of Treatment (Completion or Withdrawal)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The I-QOL consists of 22 items from three subscales; avoidance/limiting behaviour (eight items), psychosocial impact (nine items) and social embarrassment (five items). The responses to each of the 22 items were summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation. The transformation formula used for the I-QOL total scores is: Transformed score = 100 x (the sum of the items - lowest possible score) / Possible raw score range. An increase in score indicates an improvement in QOL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Overall Bladder Condition 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects subjectively assessed the severity of their urinary incontinence and general bladder symptoms by responding to the following question on a Numerical Rating Scale: My bladder condition, taking everything into account, causes me: 0 = &quot;no problems&quot; and 10 = &quot;intolerable problems&quot;. Baseline was the average of all available data recorded during the 14 days immediately prior to the randomisation visit. End of Treatment was the last average available from Week 3, Week 5, and Weeks 7-8. A negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked at completion or withdrawal to give their impression of the overall change in their condition since entry into the study using the following seven-point scale: 1 = 'Very Much Improved', 2 = 'Much Improved', 3 = 'Minimally Improved', 4 = 'No Change', 5 = 'Minimally Worse', 6 = 'Much Worse', 7 = 'Very Much Worse'. The numbers who scored 1, 2, or 3 are presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Number of Daily Voids at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline was the average of all available data recorded during the 14 days immediately prior to the randomisation visit. End of Treatment was the last average available from Week 3, Week 5, and Weeks 7-8. A negative value indicates an improvement in score from baseline.</description>

        <description>The I-QOL consists of 22 items from three subscales; avoidance/limiting behaviour (eight items), psychosocial impact (nine items) and social embarrassment (five items). The responses to each of the 22 items were summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation. The transformation formula used for the I-QOL total scores is: Transformed score = 100 x (the sum of the items - lowest possible score) / Possible raw score range. An increase in score indicates an improvement in QOL.</description>
