    <textblock>
      The study proposes the use of Fludarabine, Busulfan, Anti Thymocyte Globulin Rabbit (ATG) and
      Total Body Irradiation as a preparative regimen before hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      from unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). The hypothesis states that the 100
      day mortality after this type of transplant will be significantly below the accepted
      standards, which is about 30% for unrelated donors.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the toxicity (as measured as 100 day
      survival) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor with a novel
      preparative regimen of Fludarabine, Busulfan, Anti-Thymocyte Globulin, and Total Body
      Irradiation for pediatric patients with leukemia. The secondary objectives are to evaluate
      the relapse-free and overall survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplant as well as to
      evaluate the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease after this preparative
      regimen.
