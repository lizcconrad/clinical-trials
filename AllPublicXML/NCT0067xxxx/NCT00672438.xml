  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proposed twin study will test to what degree inter-individual differences in pain sensitivity
      and amount of pain relief in response to opioid therapy are inherited or alternatively, are
      due to environmental factors. This knowledge is important to guide future studies trying to
      explain such inter-individual differences. For example, finding that differences are largely
      due to environmental factors would discourage genomic studies and emphasize epidemiological
      studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal hypothesis to be evaluated is that the degree of analgesia provided by opioids
      in humans displays substantial familial aggregation, and is, in fact, heritable. These
      studies will use a classical twin paradigm to determine the role of genetics and the
      environment in influencing analgesia and a range of other opioid effects.

      Specific Aims: (1) Determine the degree to which opioid analgesic responses show familial
      aggregation and make preliminary estimates of heritability using both a heat and cold pressor
      pain model, and (2) determine the degree to which non-analgesic opioid responses show
      familial aggregation and make preliminary estimates of heritability. Side effects such as
      sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, and pruritus, as well as the positive affective
      response, a measure of abuse potential, will be monitored. Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic
      (DZ) twin pairs (125 total pairs) will be tested under controlled pain laboratory conditions
      for their responses to opioid infusion using the complementary pain models while monitoring
      side effects and additional psychometric indices of mood, sleep, and abuse potential. The
      selected models provide unique mechanistic information because they involve different
      peripheral and/or central pain pathways. DNA samples will be collected for zygosity testing
      and banked for future studies.

    <measure>Heat Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants underwent the pain testing measures at training prior to study procedures, at baseline and during each of the infusions.</time_frame>
    <description>Degrees Centigrade
Heat pain was induced with a thermal sensory analyzer (TSA-II, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Durham, North Carolina). A thermode was placed in contact with skin at the volar forearm. Starting at a comfortable temperature, the thermode temperature was increased at a measured rate. Study participants pushed a button of a hand-held device at the onset of pain at which point the thermode immediately reduced the temperature.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants underwent the pain testing measures at training prior to study procedures, at baseline and during each of the infusions.</time_frame>
    <description>Time in seconds
Sensitivity to cold-pressor pain was tested by asking subjects to immerse their hand up to the wrist in ice water (1-2 C) continuously re-circulated within a 12-L container with the palm of the hand in full contact with the bottom of the container.They were asked to indicate the onset of pain - reported as pain threshold.</description>

    <measure>Sedation</measure>
    <time_frame>The trail making test was performed at training prior to study procedures, at baseline, and during each of the infusions.</time_frame>
    <description>Sedative opioid effects were assessed with the trail-making test (TMT) (Angst et al., 2004; Oswald and Roth, 1987). The TMT is a paper-and pencil test consisting of 4 different matrices listing numbers 1-90 in a 9 × 10 format. Subsequent numbers are located in neighboring rows or columns. Matrices were allocated randomly. Subjects had to connect numbers 1-90 as quickly as possible and the time to completion was recorded.</description>

Heat pain was induced with a thermal sensory analyzer (TSA-II, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Durham, North Carolina). A thermode was placed in contact with skin at the volar forearm. Starting at a comfortable temperature, the thermode temperature was increased at a measured rate. Study participants pushed a button of a hand-held device at the onset of pain at which point the thermode immediately reduced the temperature.</description>

        <description>Sedative opioid effects were assessed with the trail-making test (TMT) (Angst et al., 2004; Oswald and Roth, 1987). The TMT is a paper-and pencil test consisting of 4 different matrices listing numbers 1–90 in a 9 × 10 format. Subsequent numbers are located in neighboring rows or columns. Matrices were allocated randomly. Subjects had to connect numbers 1–90 as quickly as possible and the time to completion was recorded.</description>

          <title>Sedation</title>
          <description>Sedative opioid effects were assessed with the trail-making test (TMT) (Angst et al., 2004; Oswald and Roth, 1987). The TMT is a paper-and pencil test consisting of 4 different matrices listing numbers 1–90 in a 9 × 10 format. Subsequent numbers are located in neighboring rows or columns. Matrices were allocated randomly. Subjects had to connect numbers 1–90 as quickly as possible and the time to completion was recorded.</description>

        <title>Average Nausea</title>
        <description>At the end of an infusion stage participants were asked to rate the average severity of nausea on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) anchored by the words “not at all” and “as much as possible.” This means that the scale is 100mm long where one extreme end of the scale represents &quot;0&quot;, and 0 represents no nausea experienced. The other extreme end of the scale represents &quot;100&quot;, and 100 represents as much nausea as possible.

        <title>Maximum Drug Disliking</title>
        <description>At the end of an infusion stage participants were asked, &quot;What was the maximum that you disliked the drug at any moment (VAS)? (100-mm VAS, 0 _ “not at all,” 100 _ “as much as possible”)? The VAS scale is 100mm long where one extreme end of the scale represents &quot;0&quot;, and 0 indicates the participant did not like the drug experience. The other extreme end of the scale represents &quot;100&quot;, and 100 indicates that the participant liked the drug experience as much as possible. Participants are asked to indicate what point on that continuum best represents the most they disliked the drug experience.</description>

        <title>Sedation by Patient Report</title>
        <description>Sedation was assessed by measuring cognitive speed and by asking participants to indicate on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) how sedated they felt. This means that the scale is 100mm long where one extreme end of the scale represents &quot;0&quot;, and 0 represents no sedation was experienced. The other extreme end of the scale represents &quot;100&quot;, and 100 represents as much sedation as possible. Participants are asked to indicate what point on that continuum best represents their experience of sedation.</description>
