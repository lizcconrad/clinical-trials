    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer the most frequent neoplasm and the fifth mortality rate of malignancies of
      the women in the world. It results in about 1,000 women in Taiwan and about 200,000 women
      worldwide dying of cervical cancer each year. Human papilloma viruses (HPV) have been
      consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer especially those high-risk types (HPV
      16,18,31,45) have been strongly associated with cervical cancer. Around 50-80 % of women are
      infected by HPV within their whole lives. However, only 1% of HPV-infected women have
      cervical cancer eventually. Seventy and 91% of HPV infection could be cleaned up by host
      immune responses within 1 and 2 years later. It shows that host immunity plays an important
      role in the progression, persistence, or regression of HPV infection.

      There are two main defense lines in the host immunity including innate immunity and adoptive
      immunity. Adoptive immunity plays more important roles in the defense of HPV infections than
      innate immunity. The adoptive immunity could be further divided into humoral immunity and
      cell-mediated immunity. Humoral immunity regulated by Th2 helper T lymphocytes to generate
      memory B cells to produce antibody which provide the protective function to HPV infection.
      Cell-mediated immunity regulated by Th1 helper T lymphocytes to induce antigen-specific
      cytotoxic T cells which could kill the HPV-infected cells. Although there are many researches
      focused on the immunity to HPV infection, there is no conclusion about the relationship
      between humoral and cell-mediated immunities on HPV infection and roles of humoral and
      cell-mediated immunities in the prognosis of HPV-infected population and cervical cancer
      patients.

      Our research team has focused on the establishment of platforms on cell-mediated immunity to
      HPV infection and on the correlation of cell-mediated immunity and prognosis of HPV-infected
      population and cervical cancer patients for years. In order to survey the host immunity to
      HPV infection more comprehensively, we propose this proposal. First, we would like to set up
      the platforms to elucidate the humoral immunity to HPV infection in normal population and
      patients with CIN lesion or cervical cancer. Second, we would to survey the correlation
      betweem humoral immunity and status and clinico-pathologic items of HPV-infected populations.
      Our research results will have a more comprehensive overview in the host immunity to HPV
      infection and its related diseases. It could provide more information in the prevention and
      treatment of HPV infection in the future.
