  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE), or tennis elbow, is a common and often disabling condition
      affecting young and middle-aged adults-most commonly manual workers and recreational
      athletes. It results in significant pain and disability, limiting work productivity and an
      individual's ability to participate in and enjoy recreational activities. Like many other
      chronic musculoskeletal conditions LE often shows an incomplete response to acute treatments,
      leading to chronic pain and disability. Prolotherapy (PrT) involves the injection of an
      irritant or proliferant solution into tendons, ligaments, and joints to treat chronic
      musculoskeletal pain. We will be conducting a 3-group randomized, blinded trial to determine
      the safety and efficacy of PrT injections in the treatment of chronic LE. Additionally, we
      will seek to determine to what extent any beneficial effect of PrT is derived from deep
      needle placement vs. a specific effect of the injectate. The specific aims for this study
      are: 1) to determine if PrT is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment for
      individuals with chronic LE; and 2) to determine whether the deep needle placement alone is
      responsible for the therapeutic effect, independent of injectate. In order to accomplish
      these aims, we will measure indicators of pain and disability using self-rating scales,
      questionnaires and physical measures. Subjects will be stratified prior to randomization on
      two factors: 1) unilateral vs. bilateral LE; and 2) treatment with steroids within the prior
      6 months. If effective, subjects receiving PrT will show greater reduction of pain and
      functional impairment compared with the other two groups. This research will guide future
      studies on prolotherapy by determining what may be the best control condition. Additionally,
      further studies may explore the mechanism responsible for any beneficial effect.

    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 12 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This is a pain severity rating. 15 adjectival descriptors of pain are scored on a 0-3 scale for a total score of 0-45 with a high score reflecting greater pain severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>QuickDASH</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH is an abbreviated form of the rating scale DASH or Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, &amp; Hand. This is a self-report rating of function for individuals with problems of the upper extremity. The Institute for Work and Health, in collaboration with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons developed a self-report questionnaire &quot;Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, &amp; Hand&quot;. It is seen as a valid and reliable measure of upper extremity functional impairment, is in widespread use in the States and abroad, having been translated into multiple languages and has been used for studies on LE. 11 items are scored on this self-rating instrument on a 1-5 Likert scale with higher score reflecting greater disability. The scores are averaged and then converted to a 100 point scale (0-100), with higher score reflecting greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal pain-free grip strength has been used as a physical correlate of disability associated with LE. Grip strength was obtained using a Jamar Dynamometer set in the 2nd position. 3 trials were recorded and the average pain-free grip strength was noted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nirschl Pain Phase Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Nirschl Pain Phase Scale (NPPS), which has been used to describe functional impairment related to tendinopathies such as lateral epicondylitis. This scale provides a global rating of impairment associated with sports and musculoskeletal injuries. A rating from 0-7 describes the phase of overuse injuries, with Phase 0 noting &quot;No stiffness or soreness after activity&quot; and Phase 7 corresponding with &quot;Pain that also disrupts sleep consistently. Pain is aching in nature and intensifies with activity&quot;. It was used as an indication of severity for entry into the study and as the criterion for treatment response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Threshold on Dolorimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) has been noted to correlate with pain and disability associated with LE. PPT was determined by applying pressure with a digital algometer over the area of maximal tenderness corresponding with the common extensor tendon area. Only 1 determination was obtained as the 1st application of pressure can lower the pain threshold for subsequent testing.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages 18-65, as younger individuals are more likely to have other developmental
             conditions and older individuals are more likely to have a significant arthritic
             component to their elbow pain;

          2. Ability to speak, read, and write English;

          3. Unilateral or bilateral lateral elbow pain associated with findings on exam consistent
             with LE and absence of other conditions that can mimic LE such as radial tunnel
             syndrome.

          4. Functional impairment, due to the diagnosis of LE, with a Nirschl Pain Phase Scale
             (NPPS) rating of Phase 4 or higher.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other conditions that result in significant impairment in upper extremity function
             such as fibromyalgia, rotator cuff tendonitis, cervical radiculopathy, or carpal
             tunnel syndrome;

          2. Prior surgery of the involved elbow;

          3. Known allergy to lidocaine or dextrose;

          4. Presence of an autoimmune condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, given that a
             possible immune mechanism is hypothesized for PrT.

          5. Presence of known immune dysfunction, such as with HIV/AIDS, as it might raise the
             risk for development of infection from injections;

          6. Ongoing treatment with systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressant medications, as
             they may block a potential immune mechanism of the PrT and increase the risk for
             infection;

          7. Active diagnosis of malignancy anywhere in the body, given potential of any concurrent
             immune dysfunction to impact on the response to PrT;

          8. Treatment with any anticoagulant medication beyond 1 aspirin per day, given the
             potential to increase bleeding or bruising associated with injections;

          9. Presence of a coagulopathy, given the potential to increase bleeding or bruising
             associated with injections;

         10. Pregnancy—as there is no research documenting safety of PrT during pregnancy;

         11. Medical necessity for taking ongoing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, beyond
             1 aspirin per day for cardiac prevention, as this may diminish the effect of PrT;

         12. Corticosteroid injection within the 6 weeks prior to entry into the study, as this may
             diminish the effect of the PrT.

         13. Prior treatment with PrT for any condition, as this may impact on blinding.

        <title>QuickDASH</title>
        <description>The QuickDASH is an abbreviated form of the rating scale DASH or Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, &amp; Hand. This is a self-report rating of function for individuals with problems of the upper extremity. The Institute for Work and Health, in collaboration with the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons developed a self-report questionnaire “Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, &amp; Hand”. It is seen as a valid and reliable measure of upper extremity functional impairment, is in widespread use in the States and abroad, having been translated into multiple languages and has been used for studies on LE. 11 items are scored on this self-rating instrument on a 1-5 Likert scale with higher score reflecting greater disability. The scores are averaged and then converted to a 100 point scale (0-100), with higher score reflecting greater disability.</description>

        <description>The Nirschl Pain Phase Scale (NPPS), which has been used to describe functional impairment related to tendinopathies such as lateral epicondylitis. This scale provides a global rating of impairment associated with sports and musculoskeletal injuries. A rating from 0-7 describes the phase of overuse injuries, with Phase 0 noting “No stiffness or soreness after activity” and Phase 7 corresponding with “Pain that also disrupts sleep consistently. Pain is aching in nature and intensifies with activity”. It was used as an indication of severity for entry into the study and as the criterion for treatment response.</description>

        <title>Pain Threshold on Dolorimetry</title>
        <description>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) has been noted to correlate with pain and disability associated with LE. PPT was determined by applying pressure with a digital algometer over the area of maximal tenderness corresponding with the common extensor tendon area. Only 1 determination was obtained as the 1st application of pressure can lower the pain threshold for subsequent testing.</description>
