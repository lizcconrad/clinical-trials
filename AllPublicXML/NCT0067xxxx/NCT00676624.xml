  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of one or both eyes. Uveitis will in severe cases lead to
      permanent loss of vision/blindness on the affected eye. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune
      disease, infections and rarely trauma, but 50 % of the cases remain of unknown origin.
      Intraocular infections are from previous studies, known to be responsible for approximately
      40 % of the cases of severe forms of uveitis. Most infectious causes of uveitis have the
      potential to be treated with antibiotic.

      Most infectious causes of uveitis are under normal condition only possible to detect by using
      very specific detection methods. Further more it is often necessary to study a sample from
      with-in the eye (vitrectomy to get a proper diagnosis. The knowledge about witch kind of
      infections that causes uveitis, are therefore limited to the kind of infections that are
      tested for.

      Our hypothesis are that infections are a frequent cause of severe uveitis in Denmark, and
      that by using a broad diagnostic approach it is possible to identify new or less recognized
      infections agents that are associated with uveitis. By this study we want to describe the
      prevalence and distribution of infections among patients with severe uveitis. In this study
      are we only including patients with a severe form of uveitis from a referral-hospital
      setting, where vitrectomy is done for a diagnostic purpose.

      The patients will undergo a standard diagnostic examination including the most common
      infectious causes of uveitis. Beside this we will look for a broad range of infection, which
      has previously been described in the litera-ture to cause uveitis, but are not normally
      tested for. Further more, we will use broad ranged molecular diagnostic methods to look for
      new previously unknown bacterial causes of uveitis. Such study has not previously been done
      previously in Denmark. As control group are included patients that undergo vitrectomy for due
      either one of the two diseases &quot;epiretinal fibrosis or &quot;macula hole&quot;. All patients and
      controls will be interview using a standardized questionnaire about risk factors for
      acquiring these infections.

      All patients included eye examination that includes split-lamp examination with
      semi-quantification evaluation of the inflammation, fundoscopy incl. picture, and
      angiography.

      Hemoglobin (Hb), Erythrocyte-volume fraction (EVF), Middle cell volume (MCV), middelcell
      hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), Trombocyte

        -  Alanin-aminotransferase (ALAT), S-albumin, S-bilirubin (total), Protrombin complex, INR.

        -  Na, K, creatinin,

        -  CRP, Leukocyte and differential count

        -  ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme)

        -  S-Ca2+

      X-ray of thorax

      The biopsies taken from the patient are in the routine program are patients tested for
      intraocular infections with Herpes Simplex Virus, Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoster virus,
      Epstein-Barr virus and toxoplasma with PCR and serology on serum. Test for others infections
      like Candida spp. and Toxocare are done if clini-cally indicated. Other test includes
      cytopathological test of the corpus vitreum for cancer cells and serological test for
      Syphilis.

      Beside the above mentioned test will we in this study test for:

      Infections with Leptospira, Bartonella, Brucella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Leptospira,
      Toxocare, Borrelia, HIV.

      We will use unspecific molecular test for Bacteria under a special setup to avoid DNA
      contamination. Culture of Leptospira will be done on urine samples.
