  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept) in
      children with Down syndrome who have finished the preceding 10-week, double-blind study of
      donepezil hydrochloride. Medical tests for drug safety will be conducted at each clinic
      visit.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All children in this study will take donepezil hydrochloride once a day, and will come back
      to the clinic at 8, 24 and 42 weeks after the study has begun. In between these clinic
      visits, the clinical staff will telephone the child's parent or caregiver to discuss drug
      safety observations and possible changes in drug dose. At the end of the study (42 weeks),
      psychological testing will also be given to determine how well the child is functioning.
