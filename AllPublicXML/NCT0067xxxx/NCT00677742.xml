      The purpose of this study is to determine whether getting more packs of birth control pills
      leads to improved continuation, when compared with getting the traditional supply.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discontinuation of oral contraceptive use in the initial months is common; successful early
      continuation is predictive of long term continuation and prevention of unintended pregnancy.
      The conventional approach to initiation of hormonal contraceptives in publicly funded clinics
      across the United States is to give the patient a limited supply of OCs, or a prescription
      with a limited number of refills, and then have her return to the clinic for a refill. This
      approach requires the patient to make frequent visits to the clinic, a barrier to method
      continuation.

      This randomized trial will evaluate a simple but potentially powerful change in family
      planning clinic practice, i.e., the effect of dispensing more versus fewer cycles of oral
      contraception (OC). The study will be carried out in an urban, publicly funded family
      planning clinic that serves a population that is poor, young and primarily Hispanic or
      AfricanAmerican. This population was targeted as its members are at increased risk of
      discontinuing contraception in the ﬁrst year of use.
