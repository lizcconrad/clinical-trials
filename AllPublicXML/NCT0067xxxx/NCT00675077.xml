  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal disease with profound neurological and behavioral
      features. HD is typically characterized by uncontrollable movements and psychological
      disturbances.

      This study will investigate the use of far infrared radiation for control, management and
      treatment of HD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the
      body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the
      endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the
      level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain
      cells.

      It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20
      microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could
      prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people who have HD.
