  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of omalizumab on the number of tissue eosinophils
      and other markers of airway inflammation and remodeling, including thickness of the lamina
      reticularis, in moderate to severe asthmatics with persistent symptoms and evidence of airway
      inflammation despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta-agonists.
      This study will also investigate the correlation between systemic and pulmonary inflammation,
      and the correlation between clinical outcomes and changes within the tissue, to assist in the
      future identification of patients with tissue eosinophilia and their response to treatment,
      without the need for invasive bronchoscopy.

             regular long acting beta-agonist for at least 3 months prior to screening

          -  With a body weight between 20 and 150kg and a serum total IgE level of 30 to 700 IU/mL

          <description>The variable of change from baseline in thickness of the lamina reticularis at end of Week 78 was analyzed on sub-population such as responders and non-responders. Responders are defined as all patients having a Global Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE) outcome of excellent or good where as non-responders are with GETE outcome of poor, moderate or worsening. GETE categories are excellent, good, moderate, poor, worsening, and missing as determined by the investigator.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: The ITT population consisted of all randomized patients. Patients with both baseline and end of treatment (at the end of week 78) data were only included for the analysis under each category.</population>

The dose administered was individualized for each patient based on the patient’s body weight and total serum Immunoglobulin E (IgE) level at Visit 1 and the number of injections and injection volume was determined using protocol-specified dosing tables.
