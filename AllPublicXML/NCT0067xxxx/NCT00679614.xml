  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients over 70 years of age, scheduled for joint replacement surgery will be randomized to
      tramacet/ naloxone plus morphine PCA or to morphine PCA to assess quality of analgesia in the
      postoperative period.

      The primary objective is to determine opioid use during combined use of oral tramacet and
      naloxone infusion perioperatively in elderly patients (70 yrs and older) having elective
      knee/ hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia.

      Secondary objectives are to determine the incidence VAS scores â‰¥4 and adverse effects such as
      nausea, vomiting, sedation, respiratory depression, pruritus, confusion, and time of
      independent mobilization.

      Hypothesis: Perioperative naloxone infusion and tramacet provides adequate analgesia in
      elderly patients undergoing total knee/hip arthroplasty and is associated with 80% reduction
      in opioid use and reduced opioid-induced side effects.

Naloxone infusion starting preop at 0.25ug/kg/hr and continuing during hospital stay (an equivalent of 400ug over 24 hours in a 70 kg man).

    <description>Group B will receive oral tramacet 2 tablets preoperatively and then 2 tablets every 6 hours for five days. ( or until discharge.

    <description>Group A: oral tramacet 2 tablets preoperatively, then 2 tablets every 6 hours for 5 days then 1-2 tablets of tramacet prn to a maximum of 8 tablets per day. A naloxone infusion will started preop at 0.25ug/kg/hr and will continue during patient's stay in hospital (an equivalent of 400ug over 24 hours in a 70 kg man). Infusion discontinued 1 hour before patient discharge. All the patients in groups A and B will be provided Morphine PCA for the duration of their hospital stay. Use of morphine PCA will be noted.Oral celebrex 200mg will be given to all the patient twice a day for five days as per our standard practice. All patients will receive peri-articular infiltration with local anesthetic solution intraoperatively by the surgeon as per our standard practice.</description>
