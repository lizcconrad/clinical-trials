  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out what IG-IMRT radiation dose works best for
      treatment of disease in bone or soft tissues. This protocol will study what dose level may
      work most effectively. The first part of study will treat 10 patients with 22 Gray. Gray (Gy)
      is the unit that is used to describe the dose of radiation that is being given to a person
      with cancer. After we confirm that 22 Gy is a safe and sufficient amount of radiation, we
      will then treat another group of patients with 24 Gy and so on until we reach 28 Gy. Each
      dose level starting with 24 Gy will enroll at least 20 patients per treatment site (bone,
      bowel and/or spine). Patients will be enrolled in each treatment category until 20 patients
      in each strata reach an evaluable time point of 3 months post-RT. When we understand what
      dose works best and has the least amount of bad effects, the study will then look to see how
      well the patients do after the radiation therapy. This study is trying to see how your doctor
      can best treat the cancer that has spread to the other parts of your body.

    <description>Patients will be accrued at each dose level beginning at 22 Gy with increments of 2 Gy up to 28 Gy. Patients with a soft tissue mass, lymph nodes or focal bone metastases with lesions large enough to be imaged on CT scan will be accrued. Starting at 24 Gy, patients will be stratified in to 3 treatment categories: lesions involving bone, bowel, or spinal cord. Patients will be enrolled in each treatment category until 10 patients in that cohort reach an evaluable timepoint of 3 months post-RT. The maximum accrual is 20 for 22 Gy, and 90 (30 per treatment category) for each subsequent dose level (24-28 Gy). Some of these patients have participated in the optional FLT-PET scan portion of the study. Some of these patients have under gone an optional MRI scan which take place within one hour of the radiation treatment .</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy-proven cancer verified at MSKCC

          -  Imaging evidence of lymph node metastases, bone metastases or soft tissue disease

          -  Age &gt; or = to 18 years

          -  Epidural disease is acceptable as long as the dose to the spinal cord â‰¤ 14 Gy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Target lesion not visible on conventional CT scan

          -  Unable to be administered intravenous CT contrast safely

          -  Prior radiation to the planned target region. A second metastatic lesion would not be

             bladder, rectum or other tissue to 15-16 Gy dose constraints

          -  Weight-bearing bones with significant cortical destruction from tumor. In these cases,
             patients will be referred for orthopedic consultation for rod stabilization
