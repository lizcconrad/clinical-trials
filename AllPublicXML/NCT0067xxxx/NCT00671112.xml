      RATIONALE: Everolimus and bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when
      given together with bortezomib in treating patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus (up to 10 mg PO daily) in combination
           with bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent or mantle cell
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) including cutaneous forms, or relapsed/refractory
           aggressive NHL ineligible for hematopoetic stem cell transplantation

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this combination.

        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics interactions between these agents.

        -  Assess the response rate and 6-month progression-free survival in treated patients.

        -  Obtain preliminary data to assess associations between tumor characteristics and
           response to treatment. in those subjects who underwent biopsy prior to study treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Patients also receive oral everolimus
      once daily or once every other day on days 1-21 in all courses. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients will undergo blood sample collection on Cycle 1, Day 11 for pharmacokinetic studies.
      Baseline tumor expression of mTOR and NFkB -related proteins (i.e., pS6K, pAKT, and cREL) and
      FOXP3 is assessed by immunohistochemistry.

             barrier contraceptive with spermicide) while on study. Oral, implantable, or
             injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are
             therefore not considered effective for this study. WCBP must agree to have pregnancy
             tests every 4 weeks while on study drug. Male subject agrees to use an acceptable
             method of contraception for the duration of the study.
