  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the body's immune response to the LT patch at
      different doses.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the LT patches at different
      doses and the safety of the skin preparation system. Another secondary purpose is to compare
      the safety and the body's immune response to LT patches placed on the upper arm versus the
      lower back.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging, multicenter study.
      Subjects will be assigned to one of ten treatment groups and vaccinated according to the
      study group designation. Treatments will remain the same for first and second vaccinations
      (alternating left and right sides).
