  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a positive correlation between an
      evidence based clinical nutrition concept and relevant clinical outcomes in malnourished
      hospitalised patients when severity of disease is adjusted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients have been consecutively screened at admission by SGA
      (Subjective-Global-Assessment)-Score and NRS 2002 (Nutritional-Risk-Screening)-Score in the
      departments of surgery and internal medicine. The nutrition status of each patient is
      combined with clinical data, utilization data and direct costs on the basis of clinical
      homogenous patient clusters. Risk-Adjustment was provided by the Disease-Staging-Scale
      (MEDSTAT/Thomson Healthcare, Ann Arbor MI), which allows patient classification by diagnosis
      and co morbidities including age and gender. The risk adjustment scales run by routine data
      sets from german inpatient G-DRG system. In the control period the effects of usual nutrition
      care are documented. During the intervention period an implementation of an interdisciplinary
      evidence-based guideline for screening and clinical nutrition was introduced in each
      participating hospital.

      The issue is to describe the relation between risk-adjusted malnutrition status and clinical
      outcomes and costs.
