  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an on-going study of visual characteristics of personnel diagnosed with a mild traumatic
      brain injury (MTBI) related to their service in Iraq and Afghanistan we found a high rate of
      binocular vision problems (such as double/blurry vision, reading difficult, etc.). These
      individuals are also usually diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is
      known to cause some vision symptoms. We wish to conduct this study on individuals with PTSD
      (but not an MTBI) to see if they have symptoms similar to those in individuals who have MTBI.
      This will provide us with information useful in determining the specific cause of the visual
      symptoms in the MTBI population.

    <textblock>
      We will recruit 75 patients diagnosed with PTSD, but with no history of mild traumatic brain
      injury (MTBI), from the population of the VAPAHCS PTSD Center and Clinics. These volunteers
      will be scheduled for an eye screening developed for a concurrent project to assess visual
      dysfunction (accommodation/vergence insufficiency, pursuit/saccade deficits, etc.) in
      patients diagnosed with MTBI and seen at the Palo Alto Polytrauma Network Site clinic. The
      MTBI patients have unexpectedly high rates of binocular dysfunction, although their visual
      acuities and visual fields are normal/near normal. The MTBI diagnosis is associated with a
      combat blast event in some 90% of cases. Th majority of this population has also been
      diagnosed with PTSD. PTSD is known to cause some visual symptoms, thus it is necessary for us
      to determine if the visual dysfunctions in the MTBI are related to their PTSD diagnosis or
      not. The volunteer participants will be scheduled for an eye screening and consented prior to
      the screening. Inclusion criteria include diagnosis of PTSD, aged 19 to 39, and willingness
      to participate. Exclusion criteria is primarily history of TBI. The visual screen includes
      assessments of visual acuity, visual field, self-reported visual function (i.e., light
      sensitivity, eye fatigue, reading difficulty), and measures of accommodative function,
      vergence, pursuit and saccades. The data collected will be compared to the data from the
      ongoing study of visual dysfunction in patients diagnosed with MTBI.
