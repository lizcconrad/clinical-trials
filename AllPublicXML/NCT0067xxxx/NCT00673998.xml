  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An age-related decrease in muscular strength may have a detrimental effect on muscle fatigue
      and recovery. To date, only one study has determined the effect of varied rest intervals (RI)
      between exercise sets in active younger and older women. They reported that active younger
      and older women require similar RI between sets to recovery full isokinetic knee extension
      peak torque (PT). However, we are unaware of any published studies comparing RI PT recovery
      between younger and older men. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the effect of
      two different RI's between sets of isokinetic knee extension exercise on PT, and Total Work
      (TW) between untrained younger and older men.

      18 young men (24.22 ± 2.58 yrs) and 20 older men (66.85 ± 4.02 yrs) performed 3 sets of 10
      unilateral isokinetic knee extension repetitions at 60°/s. The rest intervals between sets
      were 1 and 2 minutes and were counterbalanced across 2 testing days, separated by a minimum
      of 48 hours. The work-to-rest ratio was 1:3 and 1:6. All subjects were not involved in
      exercise programs that included resistance exercises within the last 6 months. Statistical
      evaluation of the data was performed using a 2x 2 x 3 mixed factor repeated measures ANOVA
      [age (younger and older) x rest interval (1 and 2 min) x set (1st, 2nd, and 3rd)].
      Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons.
