  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety and tolerability study to investigate the effect of GSK239512 on mild to
      moderate Alzheimers disease patients. The dose of GSK239512 will be titrated to reach the
      most well tolerated dose in the patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease

          -  The subject has an MMSE score at screening of 12 to 26 for Part A and 16-26 for Part
             B.

          -  Age ≥ 50 and above.

          -  If female, the subject must be post-menopausal (i.e. 12 months without menstrual
             period) or surgically sterile.

          -  Male subjects must be willing to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or
             lactating women; or be willing to use a condom/spermicide in addition to having their
             female partner use another form of contraception if the woman could become pregnant,
             from the time of the first dose of GSK239512 until 84 days following completion of the
             study.

          -  The subject has the ability to comply with the study procedures.

          -  The subject has a permanent caregiver and is willing to attend all study visits for
             Parts A and B.

          -  The subject has provided full written informed consent prior to the performance of any
             protocol specific procedure, or if unable to provide informed consent due to cognitive
             status, full written informed consent on behalf of the subject has been provided by a
             legally acceptable representative.

          -  The caregiver has provided his / her written consent prior to the performance of any
             protocol specific procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, following review of CT/MRI scans in the past 12
             months and completion of neurological review there could be other probable causes of
             dementia

          -  History of significant psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective
             disorder that in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with participation in
             the study, or current depression (a score of ≥8 on the Cornell Scale for Depression in
             Dementia), or subjects with other psychiatric features in their AD which would in the
             opinion of the investigator, would increase risk to safety.

          -  History of significant sleep disturbance, for example, when it is associated with
             nocturnal wandering, nocturnal confusion / disorientation / agitation, which in the
             opinion of the investigator, may increase safety risk.

          -  History or presence of known or suspected seizures, unexplained significant loss of
             consciousness within last 6 months. Subjects who had febrile seizures in childhood may
             be included if these ceased by age 10 and they have had no other type of seizure in
             their medical history and have not been on anti-epileptic medications.

          -  History or presence of significant cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal, hepatic, or
             renal disease or other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or any other clinically relevant abnormality,
             medical or psychiatric condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the
             subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study.

          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse, according to the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Substance related disorders (DSM-IV)
             criteria.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory tests, including subjects with
             active liver disease or uncontrolled thyroid disease.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension with systolic BP ≥160 and/or diastolic ≥95 mmHg. Subjects
             with controlled hypertension with systolic BP &lt; 160 mmHg and diastolic &lt;95 mmHg for at
             least 4 weeks are acceptable.

          -  Systolic BP &lt;100 mmHg and/or diastolic &lt;60 mmHg.

          -  Subjects with ECG criteria outside ranges specified in the protocol

          -  History of hypersensitivity to GSK239512 or its excipients.

          -  Treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, (including Tacrine), memantine or selegiline
             within the previous month. No patients with AD who are already on these medications at
             the time of screening will be recruited, as it would be unethical to withdraw these
             medications for study participation. Only AD subjects who are not yet on these
             medications, or who have withdrawn from these medications for other reasons
             previously, may be enrolled into this study.

          -  Subjects who are currently taking or who have taken in the last month anti-psychotic
             drugs (typical or atypical dopaminergic antagonists or modulators) or mood
             stabilization drugs (including SSRI, DNRI, SNRI, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic
             antidepressants, lithium, valproate, carbamazepine).

          -  Subjects who are currently taking Pgp inhibitors or any CYP3A4 inhibitors.

          -  Subjects on chronic sedative medications (≥ 4 days per week for the past 4 weeks).

          -  Subject or caregiver is an immediate family member or employee of the participating
             Investigator, any of the participating site staff or GSK staff.

          -  Has received any other investigational treatment in the previous 3 months.
