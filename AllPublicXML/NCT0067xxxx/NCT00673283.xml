    <textblock>
      This project proposes a new method, Bi-plane Correlation Imaging (BCI), for improved
      detection of subtle lung nodules. In BCI, two digital radiographs of the chest are acquired
      within a short time interval from slightly different posterior projections. The image data
      are incorporated into an enhanced Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) algorithm in which nodules
      present in the thoracic cavity are detected by examining the geometrical correlation of the
      detected signals in the two views. The data are alos viewed stereoscopically for visual
      diagnosis. The expected high sensitivity/specificity of the method has the potential to
      change the current state of practice, perhaps leading to a preventive lung cancer screening
      program for high-risk populations, similar to the mammography screening program currently in
      place for breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Normal individuals

          -  Individuals with CT-confirmed subtle lung nodules.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with acute pulmonary abnormalities or those in poor health conditions will
             be excluded due to the potential impact on the results as well as difficulty of
             acquiring the images. Pregnant women will also be excluded to avoid the exposure of
             the fetus to radiation.
