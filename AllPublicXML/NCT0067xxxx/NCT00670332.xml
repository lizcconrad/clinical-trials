  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will demonstrate whether patients with prognostically-significant myocardial
      abnormalities detected with AI-700 contrast ECHO have a rate of cardiac death or MI that is
      higher than that of patients with normal AI-700 contrast ECHO.

      This observational study will investigate the ability of AI-700 contrast ECHO to predict risk
      of future cardiovascular events occurring in patients who had a recent history of chest pain
      at the time of ECHO evaluation. Eligible patients were enrolled in either AI-700-32 or
      AI-700-33, which are completed Phase 3 international, multicenter, open-label, dual-injection
      studies of the myocardial imaging capabilities and safety of AI-700 administered
      intravenously in patients with chest pain. In the course of these Phase 3 studies, patients
      were evaluated with AI-700 contrast ECHO. In addition, eligible patients were to have had an
      evaluable pharmacologic stress-induced AI-700 ECHO assessment as part of AI-700-32 or
      AI-700-33.

        This observational study will enroll up to 773 patients who participated in either
        AI-700-32 or AI-700-33 and who were evaluated with AI-700 contrast ECHO at rest and at
        pharmacologic-induced stress. Approximately 28 international study centers will
        participate. At the time of AI-700 contrast ECHO (defined as the index date), the patients
        were to have had a recent history of chest pain and were to meet all eligibility criteria.
        Chest pain (angina) was defined as either:

          -  typical chest pain: 1) substernal chest discomfort with a characteristic quality and
             duration that is 2) provoked by exertion or emotional stress and 3) relieved by rest
             or nitroglycerin, or

          -  atypical chest pain (angina) that meets 2 of the 3 typical chest pain characteristics.
