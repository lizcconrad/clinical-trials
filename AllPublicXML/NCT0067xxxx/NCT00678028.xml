  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to genetic polymorphism about 15%-30% of the world population have low levels of MBL
      (Mannose Binding Lectin) in serum (below 500ng/mL). Different studies reported correlation
      between polymorphism in the MBL gene with low levels of MBL in serum and higher frequency of
      recurrent infections, severity of sepsis, ARDS and other infections. Urinary Tract Infection
      (UTI) is one of the very common infection in women. Since MBL is part of the innate immunity
      and there are proofs of relation between patients with recurrent infections and lack of MBL,
      we decided to explore a possible relation between low levels of MBL and different genotypes
      of MBL in young women and the risk to develop recurrent UTI.
