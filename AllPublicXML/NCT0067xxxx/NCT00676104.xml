  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility and clinical benefits of a
      new rapid treatment for secondary treatment for secondary brain injury called Discrete
      Cerebral Hypothermia System by CoolSystems, Inc., Berkley, CA. This device induced
      hypothermia in the adult brain without significant whole body hypothermia. Discrete Cerebral
      Hypothermia System holds a great potential for protecting the brain from the devastating
      secondary complications of trauma without the associated deleterious system effects.
