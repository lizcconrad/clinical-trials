      RATIONALE: Valproic acid may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether valproic acid is more effective than
      observation in treating patients with prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well valproic acid works in treating
      patients with progressive, non-metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess whether treatment with valproic acid (a type I histone deacetylase inhibitor) can
           alter the kinetics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in patients with
           non-metastatic prostate cancer and biochemical progression.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of PSA response.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients who achieve a complete response.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients who achieve a partial response.

        -  Assess the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (observation): Patients undergo observation according to standard of care.

        -  Arm II (valproic acid): Patients receive oral valproic acid twice daily for up to 1 year
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year.
