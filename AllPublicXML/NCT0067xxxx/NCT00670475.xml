      application of herbal product has old history in therapy of human diseases. olive oil is one
      of the important diet in Iran which its efficacy in reducing of rheumatic pains was pointed
      out by Avicenna in 10th century. Nevertheless, its efficacy is not confirmed by scientific
      study.

      in this double blinded study, 200 patients with diagnosed osteoarthritis of knee will be
      recruited that will randomly be assigned in piroxicam or olive oil group. the piroxicam gel
      or olive oil will be repackaged in anonymous tubes, which only recognizable via codes. the
      patients or visiting clinicians will be unaware of content of tubes. the final assessor will
      be blind to groups and interventions.

      the efficacy of therapies will be evaluated by means of WOMAC and PGs standard
      questionnaires.
