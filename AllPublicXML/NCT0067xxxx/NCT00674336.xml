  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Norwalk virus and related &quot;Norwalk-like viruses&quot; are the most common cause of outbreaks of
      stomach sickness (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) in older children and adults in the United
      States. These viruses are sometimes found in drinking water, ice, shellfish and in other
      foods. They can be spread easily from contact with water, food, objects or hands that have
      even small amounts of feces from someone who was sick.

      The purpose of this research study is to the effectiveness of high hydrostatic pressures
      processing (HPP) treatment on norovirus infected shellfish. Norwalk virus can survive in
      shellfish and still be able to cause sickness. HPP inactivates microorganisms living both on
      the surface and on the interior of the food. The goal of the study is to determine whether
      HPP treatment on oysters spiked with norovirus will reduce infection rates in people
      consuming raw infected oysters.
