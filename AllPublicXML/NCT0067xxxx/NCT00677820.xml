  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective annual release study was designed to assess the safety of a trivalent
      influenza virus vaccine using a new strain recommended for the 2008-2009 influenza season not
      previously contained in the trivalent intranasal FluMist vaccine. Three hundred healthy
      adults received a single dose of vaccine or placebo and were followed for 180 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled release study. Eligible
      subjects were randomly assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of trivalent
      vaccine or placebo by intranasal spray. Randomization was stratified by site. Each subject
      received 1 dose of study vaccine on Study Day 0. The duration of study participation for each
      subject was the time from study vaccination through 180 days after study vaccination.

        <description>SAEs were those that resulted in death; were life-threatening; resulted in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; were a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant; or were an medical event that may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
An SNMC was a newly diagnosed medical condition of a chronic, ongoing nature and assessed by the investigator as medically significant.</description>
