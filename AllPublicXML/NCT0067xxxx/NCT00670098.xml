      The main purposes of the study are to compare changes in sexual function, changes in sex
      hormones, and changes in body image and marital satisfaction at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months
      postoperatively in two groups: individuals who undergo a bariatric surgical procedure and
      extremely obese individuals with similar obesity-related comorbidities who do not seek
      surgery (treatment comparison group).

      The mechanisms by which extreme obesity affects sexual functioning have received little
      attention. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that obesity and physical inactivity are
      independently related to the likelihood of developing sexual dysfunction over time. For
      example, men with a BMI greater than 29 kg/m2 have a 30% greater risk of developing erectile
      dysfunction and up to 50 % of ED cases can be attributed to hypertension and cardiovascular
      disease, both commonly associated with obesity. Many treatments for hypertension have also
      been shown to interfere with sexual function.

      Changes in sex hormones with increasing BMI have not received much attention either. Obesity
      has been associated with decreases in testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin for men
      and increases in testosterone and estrogen for women. Several studies have shown improvement
      in sex hormone levels in both men and women following weight loss. Sexual functioning has
      never been assessed in association with weight loss and whether through improvements in body
      image, sex hormones, or obesity related comorbidities, bariatric surgery may have a profound
      effect on sexual functioning.

      Dr. Ray Rosen, the Principal investigator for this sub study, has conducted a previous
      investigation focused on sexual functioning after weight loss in a behavioral weight loss
      program. Specifically, he looked at short and long term sexual function outcomes associated
      with Type-2 diabetes. His previous work in this area has shown that patients are willing to
      participate in studies of sexual function.

      The Psychosocial Changes study assesses sexual function in two ways. Participants first fill
      out a packet of questionnaires covering topics related to depression, quality of life, body
      image, and marital and sexual functioning. They also give a blood sample in order for us to
      assess levels of sex hormones including testosterone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol,
      follicle stimulating hormone, and others.

        Inclusion Criteria:

                  medical conditions).

               -  Ambulation: Patients must be ambulatory, given the frequent number of assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Any major illnesses that the surgical team believes present too great a risk for
             surgery. These include severe cardiac and pulmonary diseases, as well as uncontrolled
             type 2 diabetes.

               -  Evidence of major depression or other psychiatric disorder (schizophrenia,

                  steroids or psychiatric medications including lithium, tricyclic antidepressants,
                  and anti-psychotic agents (The use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
                  (SSRIs) will not be excluded because of their widespread use and lesser effect on
                  body weight.)

               -  Any current (past 12 months) substance abuse or dependence disorder.

               -  Pregnancy or lactation (Those who are pregnant do not undergo bariatric surgery.
                  In addition, the hormone changes induced by pregnancy are known to interfere with
                  the hormones examined in this study, confounding the findings. Participants who
                  become pregnant while in this study will be withdrawn from the study.)
