  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although mechanical ventilation is life saving, it is associated with a number of severe
      complications collectively referred to as ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). VILI
      contributes to the high morbidity and mortality associated with the acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS). Within the context of a randomized study evaluating the feasibility
      of conducting a study comparing high frequency oscillation to conventional lung protective
      ventilation in early severe ARDS, we are evaluating the effect of both ventilator strategies
      on biological markers of VILI.

      Specific objectives:

      To measure known biomarkers conventionally associated with VILI and biotrauma To measure
      potential novel biomarkers of VILI and biotrauma To identify the best time point for
      biomarker measurement To collect and store samples for differential expression and genomic
      analysis
