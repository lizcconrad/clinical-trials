      The present feasibility study is designed to find out whether pre-treatment with the compound
      mangafodipir lowers the frequency and severity of side effects during adjuvant chemotherapy
      according to the FOLFOX6 regimen in patients operated upon colon cancer in stage Dukes' C.

    <textblock>
      Mangafodipir, manganese (Mn) dipyridoxyl diphosphate, is a catalytic antioxidant and iron
      chelator recently (2006) suggested for cancer treatment in an Editorial in Journal of the
      National Cancer Institute. Preclinical research has shown that mangafodipir protects normal
      tissues without loss of anti-tumour activity during chemotherapy. Other advantages are that
      mangafodipir is already approved for use in patients as a contrast agent for magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) of liver, and that the experience for more than a decade reveals high
      safety with mainly minor and tolerable side-effects.

      The present study will include 14 patients who will be followed throughout 3 treatment
      cycles. Each cycle will be preceded by infusion of mangafodipir or placebo in two groups,
      each consisting of 7 patients. The primary endpoints will be the most frequent manifestation
      of FOLFOX6, namely neutropenia and neurosensory toxicity. The secondary endpoints will be the
      frequency and severity of other FOLFOX6-related adverse events and quality of life.

    <description>Treatment will be undertaken with a ready-to-use investigative drug formulation identical to what is in diagnostic use as a contrast medium for MRI.
Formulation content: MnDPDP 10 mmol/ml
Administered dose per cycle: 2 μmol/kg b.w. Administration form: Ready-to-use formulation (solution). Mangafodipir or placebo (0.2 ml/kg b.w.) will be administered as an i.v. infusion over 5 min about 30 min prior to start of chemotherapy.</description>
