    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the continued efficacy of Omacor
      co-administered with simvastatin for lowering non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (non-HCL-C) levels.

    <textblock>
      The present trial is an open-label, uncontrolled extension to the previous trial (PRV-06009)
      which utilized a randomized,double-blind, two-period crossover design with eight clinic
      vists.

      The current trial consists of nine clinic visits over 104 weeks. There will be two treatment
      periods in this study:

        -  Phase I: All subjects will receive simvastatin 80 md/d plus Omacor 4 g/d for the first
           six weeks of the trial.

        -  Phase II: All subjects will receive simvastatin (at a dose to be determined at the
           discretion of the Investigator) plus Omacor 4 g/d for the remainder of the treatment
           period.
