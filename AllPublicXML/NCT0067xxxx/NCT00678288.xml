    <textblock>
      This study is to assess sorafenib as second treatment for patients that have previously
      received only sunitinib as first-line treatment for advanced renal cell cancer, and who
      either responded and then progressed with sunitinib or were intolerant to sunitinib. This
      study is to assess if combining the usual dose of sorafenib (200mg twice-daily) with low dose
      interferon (3 million international unit (MIU) five times a week) can treat kidney cancer
      more effectively than the current approved dose alone and if it is safe. In addition, for
      patients that respond to treatment with sorafenib alone or in combination with interferon
      before progressing, patients may receive sorafenib alone at an increased dose of 300mg
      twice-daily, provided that toxicities are acceptable and at the discretion of the
      investigator.

    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free Survival (PFS) was the time from the first dose of combination therapy to disease progression (radiological or clinical, whichever is earlier, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]) or death (if death occurs before progression is documented). PFS for subjects without tumor progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last tumor evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response Rate was the best tumor response (confirmed Complete Response [CR], Partial Response [PR] or Stable Disease [SD]) observed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.</description>

    <measure>Time to Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression was the time from treatment start date to disease progression. Subjects without progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of Response was the time from date of first response (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) to the date when Progressive Disease (PD) is first documented or to the date of death, whichever occurs first. Subjects still having CR or PR at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment of the first subject until 14 months later, assessed every 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival was the time from treatment start date to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact.</description>

The planned enrollment was 120 subjects in the 2 treatment groups (60 subjects per group). The study was stopped early because of slow accrual.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 24 subjects were screened; 16 were enrolled and randomized; 10 (63%) to sorafenib alone and 6 (37%) to sorafenib + interferon. All 16 randomized subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the safety analysis population.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score</title>
          <description>The MSKCC score is a prognostic score obtained by adding 1 point for each of 5 risk factors: 1. Absence of prior nephrectomy, 2. Corrected serum calcium &gt; 10 mg/dL, 3. Hemoglobin &lt; lower limit of normal, 4. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 1.5X upper limit of normal, 5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) ≥ 2 (The ECOG PS is a scale that measures how cancer affects a patient. The scale ranges from 0 [fully active] to 5 [dead]). A Low MSKCC score is 0 risk factors, Intermediate is 1-2 risk factors, and Poor is 3-5 risk factors.</description>
