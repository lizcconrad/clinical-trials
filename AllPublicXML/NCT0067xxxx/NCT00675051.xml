  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive and life threatening condition. It is characterized
      by severe remodeling of the pulmonary vessel wall, obstructive plexiform lesions, multi-focal
      thrombosis, and enhanced vasoconstriction. All of these characteristics contribute to
      increased pulmonary vascular resistance.

      Circulating endothelial microparticles (EMPs) play an integral role in the pathogenesis and
      perpetuation of pulmonary hypertension. Levels of EMPs are considered a reliable biological
      parameter of endothelial injury.

      We propose to assess the evolution of both circulating and pulmonary venous EMPs in patients
      with PH. Assessments will be made before and after initiation of Endothelin-1 (ET-1) Receptor
      blocker therapy, and correlated to their patterns with the changes in mean PAP, the 6 Minutes
      Walking Distance test, and circulating Endothelin-1 values. Measurements of the endothelial
      microparticle circulating levels (assessed by flow cytometry methods) will be made before, 1
      month and 3 months after initiation of therapy.
