    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a major health problem in men and women in this country and the incidence of
      this disease is rising. We think that environmental factors such as nutrition may play a role
      in the increasing prevalence of osteoporosis. In particular, we think that a diet that is too
      low in protein may be contributing to bone loss. The primary purpose of this study is to
      compare the long-term impact of a low protein diet on measures of bone and calcium
      metabolism.

      The protocol is composed of a 9.5-week study, consisting of a 3-week adjustment period
      followed by a 6.5-week experimental period. During the adjustment period, subjects consume a
      well-balanced lead-in diet designed to stabilize baseline Ca homeostasis. In the subsequent
      experimental period, subjects will consume the experimental diet containing 0.7 g protein/kg,
      800-1200 mg phosphorus, 800 mg calcium and 2300 mg sodium. During days -6 to -1 of the
      adjustment diet, 5-10 and days 40-45 of the experimental period, we will measure Ca
      absorption and kinetics. Weekly assessments of Ca homeostasis will be done using our standard
      measures of calcitropic hormones, markers of bone turnover, and urine and serum minerals.
