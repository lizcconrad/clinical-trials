  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about an investigational drug known as oral lipoic acid
      (LA) that may help treat multiple sclerosis. This study will measure how a person's body
      absorbs and breaks down the drug (pharmacokinetics) and will compare four different forms of
      the drug from four different manufacturers as well as LA in conjunction with fish oil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common, often disabling inflammatory disease of the central
      nervous system (CNS). Present treatments for MS are only partially effective, available only
      in injectable forms, have significant side effects and are very costly. Developing more
      effective and better-tolerated treatments of MS thus remains an important goal for the
      improvement of the care of MS. Lipoic acid (LA) is an antioxidant that is widely available as
      a dietary supplement.

      The primary outcome of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of oral LA 1200 mg to
      see if we can identify factors affecting the bioavailability of LA. We will also study the
      salivary concentrations of oral LA and its correlation with the serum LA concentrations. We
      will also study the effects of LA on the immunological markers after four hours of
      administration.
