      The purpose of this study is to evaluate subjectively reported treatment effects of
      ramelteon, once daily (QD), in adults with chronic insomnia.

      Insomnia is characterized by difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, or complaints of
      non-restorative and non-refreshing sleep. Transient insomnia affects approximately one-third
      to one-half of the US population, based on the results of 2 surveys of representative samples
      of the adult US population conducted by the Gallup Organization in which respondents were
      asked if they had &quot;ever had difficulty sleeping.&quot; Based on reports of &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;frequent&quot;
      sleep difficulty, results from the same studies suggest that approximately one-tenth of the
      US population experiences chronic insomnia. The ideal treatment for insomnia would reduce the
      latency to onset of sleep and increase total sleep time, without a negative impact on sleep
      architecture and without safety concerns or next-day effects.

      Ramelteon is under global development by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., for the treatment
      of transient and chronic insomnia and for the treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorders.

      This study is being conducted to assess the treatment effects of ramelteon in adults through
      the use of daily entry of information into an interactive voice response system. Study
      participation in this study is anticipated to be about 1 month.
