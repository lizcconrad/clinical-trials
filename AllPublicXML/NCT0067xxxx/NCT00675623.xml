    <textblock>
      The Connection Study is a six-month confirmatory Phase 3 study to determine the safety and
      efficacy of Dimebon in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled 6-month study designed as an adequate and
      well-controlled trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Dimebon in the treatment of
      patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Dimebon is an investigational drug for Alzheimer's
      disease. The target of Dimebon's mechanism of action are the mitochondria (a cell's primary
      source of energy).The Connection Study is the second of two pivotal studies evaluating the
      effect of Dimebon. It is a 6-month study enrolling 525 patients in the United States, Europe,
      and South America. All patients completing the 6-month study will be eligible to receive
      Dimebon in an open-label extension trial.

      The patient population will be carefully selected to ensure inclusion of patients with AD,
      rather than other types of dementia. Mild-to-moderate disease will be defined by the
      screening Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients will attend study visits with
      caregivers who will provide information about the patient's condition.
