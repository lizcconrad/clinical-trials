    <textblock>
      This study would like to test whether the combination of ondansetron and olanzapine will be
      superior to placebo at decreasing self-reported heavy drinking among early onset alcoholics.

      Target population: We will enroll male and female who meet DSM IV criteria for alcohol
      dependence and who are currently drinking equal or more than 21 alcohol units/week for women
      and equal or more than 28 alcohol units/week for men in the 7 day period prior to enrollment.

      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Eligible subjects will be randomized to
      ondansetron (4 ug/kg) and olanzapine (9, 18, 36 ug/kg) vs placebo. All subjects will
      participate in a 9 week regimen of weekly BBCET and outpatient medication treatment.
