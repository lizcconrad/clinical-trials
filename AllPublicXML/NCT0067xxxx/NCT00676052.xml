  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose Day 1) and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 28. The Baseline FEV1 is the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose [time 0] on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline assessment value from the Baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean for 0 to 24 Hours Serial FEV1 on Day 1 to 2 and 28 to 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose Day 1) and Days 1 to 2, Days 28 to 29</time_frame>
    <description>Weighted means serial FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under curve (AUC), and then dividing by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. Baseline was defined at pre-dose Day 1. The weighted mean change from Baseline is the weighted mean minus Baseline. The AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. For all post-dose observations, actual times that the spirometry measurements were conducted was used for the calculation. Pre-dose observations were counted as 0 hr observations - that is they had their time set to the time of dosing. The pre-dose value used for the calculation of the AUC was the mean of the two pre-dose observations (-30 and 0 min for Day 1 or 28). If one of these observations was missing, the remaining single pre-dose observation was used.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted across 79 centers: 30 in North America, 28 in Europe and 21 in International regions. The first participant first visit was on 16 May 2008 and last participant last visit was on 22 December 2008.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Out of the 963 participants screened for this study, 303 participants were screen failures and 79 participants were run-in failures. Therefore, a total of 581 participants were randomized out of which 5 participants did not receive any study medication, thus 576 participants were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) Population.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean for 0 to 24 Hours Serial FEV1 on Day 1 to 2 and 28 to 29</title>
        <description>Weighted means serial FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under curve (AUC), and then dividing by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. Baseline was defined at pre-dose Day 1. The weighted mean change from Baseline is the weighted mean minus Baseline. The AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. For all post-dose observations, actual times that the spirometry measurements were conducted was used for the calculation. Pre-dose observations were counted as 0 hr observations - that is they had their time set to the time of dosing. The pre-dose value used for the calculation of the AUC was the mean of the two pre-dose observations (-30 and 0 min for Day 1 or 28). If one of these observations was missing, the remaining single pre-dose observation was used.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean for 0 to 24 Hours Serial FEV1 on Day 1 to 2 and 28 to 29</title>
          <description>Weighted means serial FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under curve (AUC), and then dividing by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. Baseline was defined at pre-dose Day 1. The weighted mean change from Baseline is the weighted mean minus Baseline. The AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. For all post-dose observations, actual times that the spirometry measurements were conducted was used for the calculation. Pre-dose observations were counted as 0 hr observations - that is they had their time set to the time of dosing. The pre-dose value used for the calculation of the AUC was the mean of the two pre-dose observations (-30 and 0 min for Day 1 or 28). If one of these observations was missing, the remaining single pre-dose observation was used.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean for 0 to 24 Hours Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) on Day 1 to 2 and 28 to 29</title>
        <description>Weighted means serial FVC was derived by calculating the AUC, and then dividing by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. Baseline was defined at pre-dose Day 1. The weighted mean change from Baseline is the weighted mean minus Baseline. The AUC was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. For all post-dose observations, actual times that the spirometry measurements were conducted was used for the calculation. Pre-dose observations were counted as 0 hr observations - that is they had their time set to the time of dosing. The pre-dose value used for the calculation of the AUC was the mean of the two pre-dose observations (-30 and 0 min for Day 1 or 28). If one of these observations was missing, the remaining single pre-dose observation was used.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough FVC on Day 29</title>
        <description>The trough FVC is defined as the mean of the FVC values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Day 28. The Baseline FVC is the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose [time 0] on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-baseline assessment value from the Baseline value.</description>
