  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In opioid dependent patients treated with long-acting injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol ®), we
      will compare the efficacy of a primary care model of counseling (Condition 1) versus
      individualized cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (Condition 2) for the treatment of opioid
      dependence. Treatment will last 12 weeks, and participants will be given 380mg of naltrexone
      per injection (3 injections in total; each lasting 4 weeks). Primary outcomes will be 1)
      percent of opioid negative urines and 2) treatment compliance as measured by attendance and
      time in treatment. Secondary outcomes are opiate craving, opiate withdrawal symptoms,
      perceived stress scores, severity of addiction problems, and patient satisfaction. Findings
      will elucidate whether injectable, long-acting naltrexone would be safe and effective in a
      primary care setting where medication would be administered in the absence of traditional
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and indicate whether cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy
      adds to treatment effects above and beyond primary care counseling. If positive, this small
      controlled study will provide effect size estimates for a larger trial to assess Vivitrol ®
      in a primary care setting.

    <description>Subjects in this condition will attend bi-weekly 15 minute sessions with the study nurse for primary care counseling which is a brief manual-guided, medically focused counseling approach to the treatment of opioid dependent individuals seen in primary care settings. The brief counseling sessions involve repeated support for and monitoring of medication compliance, and the provision of advice regarding established methods for coping with psychological and social factors that lead to drug use.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the CBT condition will participate in bi-weekly 50-minute-long individualized cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy sessions with a CBT trained clinician. The general purpose of the therapy is to: (1) acquire information about important concepts and aspects of recovery from opioid addiction; (2) increase self-awareness of specific problems and issues in relation to addiction and recovery, and (3) learn new coping skills to deal with problems contributing to or resulting from the addiction and to improve overall psychosocial functioning. The primary focus of this approach is to provide patients with frequent supportive contact and to teach cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention skills.</description>

          -  Medical problems that would preclude naltrexone treatment, such as laboratory evidence

             including SGOT and SGPT (&gt; three times normal) or elevated bilirubin levels), and a
             history of cirrhosis.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing or refuse to use a reliable form of birth control (as
