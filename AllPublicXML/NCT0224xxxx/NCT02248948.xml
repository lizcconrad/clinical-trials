    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, prospective, parallel-group, double-blind
      study to evaluate the effect of an Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplement with EPA, DHA, vitamins E
      and D on ADHD clinical symptoms (according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental
      Disorders, 4th. edition (DSM-IV-TR) criteria) in children between 6 and 11 years. Patients
