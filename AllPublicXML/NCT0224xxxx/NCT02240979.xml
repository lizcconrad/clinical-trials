  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate a new way to examine cardiac function, using software
      developed at Caltech. The experimental device is software loaded on an iPhone. The iPhone is
      used to capture a pulse (waveform) by simply placing the iPhone lightly over the neck where
      the carotid pulse can be felt. In this study the information collected from the iPhone app is
      compared to cardiac function data obtained from the current gold standard for measuring
      cardiac function, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subjects referred from
      cardiologists will also generally have echocardiography information available for comparison
      with the iPhone app. For the study, subjects will have completely non-invasive studies done
      in one setting: The iPhone app to capture the waveforms (over carotid and radial (wrist)
      arteries), tonometry (another non-invasive method using a modified stethoscope), standard
      pulse oximetry, followed by a 30 minute MRI examination of the heart. A second complete study
      will be done about 6 months after the first. The complete study session takes about 1.5
      hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at Caltech have developed an iPhone-based application that allows them to
      capture an arterial waveform using the iPhone camera held over the skin. Then based on the
      captured waveform and previous laboratory experiments and models, the investigators are able
      to calculate ejection fraction, the percentage of blood that goes out of the heart into the
      circulation with each beat. Previous studies suggested that the iPhone app measurements of
      ejection fraction were similar to those obtained with traditional cardiac echocardiography.
      In the current study the iPhone app measures are being compared to ejection fraction obtained
      using cardiac MRI. The iPhone also measures other physical properties of the heart and aorta
      that the investigators call &quot;intrinsic frequencies&quot;. Using healthy subjects they have
      established the normal pattern/range of intrinsic frequencies, and in this study, a more
      diverse population of subjects (some with heart disease) will be studied, to determine how
      intrinsic frequency measures compare to traditional clinical measures of cardiac function.
