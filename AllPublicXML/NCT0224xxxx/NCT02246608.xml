    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the therapeutic effect of Oasis® Matrix along with Negative Pressure
      Wound Therapy (NPWT) on pressure wounds. Either Oasis or standard foam will be applied to the
      wound prior to activating the NPWT.

    <textblock>
      In this study, patients being treated with Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) will be
      randomized to receive either:

        1. Oasis® matrix, applied to the wound, OR

        2. Standard foam, applied to the wound prior to activation of NPWT.

      Wounds will be examined weekly for up to 12 weeks. At weeks 4, 8, and 12, the NPWT evacuation
      canister will be collected for specimen analysis.

      The aim of this study is to determine the therapeutic effect of using Oasis® Wound Matrix
      with NPWT. Outcomes include: a) closure rate of non-healing wounds, and b) levels of growth
      factors and interleukins in fluid evacuated from the wound.

    <description>Oasis® is a porcine acellular small intestine submucosa material compatible with human tissue. It is a complex scaffold that provides optimal environment for restoration of tissue structure. It guides tissue growth and traps growth factors. Oasis Matrix indications include partial and full thickness wounds and skin loss injuries as well as second-degree burns.</description>
