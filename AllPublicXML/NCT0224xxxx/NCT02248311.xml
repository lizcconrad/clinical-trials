      Current methods based on traditional Cardiovascular risk factors are not clinically useful
      for identifying Type 2 Diabetes patients at risk of developing acute Cardiovascular ischemic
      events (ie.myocardial infarction or stroke). In addition, Cardiovascular ischemic events in
      Type 2 Diabetes population have worse prognosis than in general population. In fact, there is
      sufficient experimental evidence indicating that diabetes exaggerates the deleterious effects
      of ischemic events and worsens their outcome.

      A prolonged sub-clinical phase exists before a Cardiovascular event occurs in Type 2 Diabetes
      patients. Therefore, new strategies aimed at identifying those patients with this subclinical
      Cardiovascular Diabetes and, consequently, more prone to develop Cardiovascular events is a
      challenge to be met.

      Objectives

      1) To examine whether the extension and degree of microangiopathy is an independent risk
      factor for silent myocardial and brain ischemia. 2) To evaluate whether the degree and
      extension of microangiopathy is a predictor of CV events and poor outcome. 3) To evaluate
      whether a new score based on the extension and the degree of microangiopathy will permit us
      to improve the current methods used to identify patients at risk of CVD and its outcomes. 4)
      To determine whether the presence and the degree of NAFLD is an independent Cardiovascular
      disease risk factor and represent and extra-value to the score based on the extension and the
      degree of microangiopathy.

      Secondary objectives:

      1) To examine the usefulness of selected serum biomarkers in identifying diabetic patients at
      risk of Cardiovascular disease 2) To evaluate whether these selected biomarkers are related
      to the degree and extension of microangiopathy and the outcome of cardiovascular events. 3)
      To better define the meaning of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic population (glomerular
      involvement vs. index of generalized endothelial dysfunction)

        A total of 200 T2D diabetic patients without history of clinical Cardiovascular disease
        will be recruited from the Outpatient Diabetic Clinic of Vall d'Hebron Hospital and the
        Primary Health Care centers under its influence area. Sixty non-diabetic patients without
        classic Cardiovascular risk factors matched by age will be used as a control group.
        Specifically, vascular risk factors, concomitant diseases, family history of Cardiovascular
        disease or stroke and the treatments taken at the time of inclusion will be collected.

             will be defined following the American Diabetic Association criteria: fasting glucose
             level of at least 126 mg/dl [7.0 mmol/l] in two separate analyses, a non-fasting
             glucose level of at least 200 mg/dl [11.1 mmol/l] or a self-reported history of
             physician-diagnosed diabetes or treatment for diabetes
