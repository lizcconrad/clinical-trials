  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngeal motor and sensory nerve dysfunction may cause phonation and swallowing disturbance,
      which often happens after the treatment for laryngopharyngeal and esophageal cancer and may
      induce fatal complications such as aspiration pneumonia. By the conventional examinations,
      the tiny sensory or motor changes are hard to be detected before complete vocal paralysis. It
      is utmost important to establish a comprehensive quantitative method which is sensitive
      enough to evaluate the neuromuscular functions. The present project will evaluate the
      laryngeal nerve function by quantitative laryngeal electromyography, which was developed by
      the research team, and another novel examination technique, mucosal membrane sensation test.
      The comprehensive method is expected to grade the laryngeal nerve injuries quantitatively
      before the significant symptoms or complications and can also help to evaluate the treatment
      effect from medicine, rehabilitation or surgery.

    <description>Voice-related questionnaire The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) is a 30-item instrument developed by Jacobson et al. as a self-measure the psychosocial handicapping effects of voice disorders. The questionnaire consists of three sub scales: emotional, physical and functional with 10 items from each scale. It has been translated into traditional Chinese and validated. All individuals will be asked to response for the questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Disease related life quality assessment: FACT-H&amp;N, FACT-E</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline:Within 3-6 months after synptom occurs</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck (FACT-H&amp;N) and FACT-E (esophagus) are self -report questionnaires with a Likert-type response set, ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;. FACT-G (general) is a 27-items scale measures four QOL (quality of life) domains including Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being and Functional Well-Being. In FACT-H&amp;N, there are 11 additional specific questions for head and neck cancers while 17 additional items for esophageal cancers in FACT-E. The specific questionnaires will be provided to patients according to individual diseases. The traditional Chinese (Mandarin) version has been validated and proved to be useful in previous report. We have received the licensing agreement from the institute (FACIT) for using the questionnaires on the project.</description>
