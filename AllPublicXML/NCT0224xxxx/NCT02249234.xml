  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no previous reports on the use of OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) to treat men with
      scrotal pain that we found published.

      We proposed a pilot study using Botox to block the nerves on a small group of men with
      chronic scrotal pain (CSP) who have failed the standard medical therapy. The men must have
      had temporary relief from a testicular cord block using local anaesthetic drug.

      The encourage results of the pilot study has given us the background information to proceed
      with a formal randomised control trial of Botox vs placebo.

      We hypothesized that Botox injections to block the testicular nerve will be effective in
      providing long term pain relief for men with scrotal pain.
