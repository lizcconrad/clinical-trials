      The purpose of this project is to evaluate patients' methodology and ability to select an
      economical and ideal Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (PDP).

      The primary objective of this project is to determine the percentage of patients who are
      enrolled in Medicare Part D who are currently enrolled in their ideal plan based on estimated
      costs.Secondary objectives are to determine:

        1. The percentage of patients who have switched or considered switching their Medicare Part
           D PDP at any point during their enrollment

        2. The most commonly used resources used by beneficiaries to aid in selection of a Medicare
           Part D PDP

        3. The percentage of patients who reach the Medicare Part D donut hole as a result of their
           current plan

        4. Physician perception of appropriate selection of Medicare Part D PDP among their patient
           panel

        5. Physician perception of administrative time spent resolving medication issues related to
           Medicare Part D PDPs
