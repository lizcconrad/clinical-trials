      -  Background: Infantile asthma is composed of various phenotypes, however the definition
           is still based on the clinics. Namely, the infants could be classified as transitory,
           peristent or late and persistent asthma. Some risk factors for the persistent asthma
           phenotype are recognized as atopy. However all peristent asthma are not related to
           atopy. Regarding the pathophysiology, little is known on airways inflammation in these
           infants, and the current data are mostly based on the BAL analyses, or on biopsies.
           Consequently, BLA and biopsies should be justified by the need of an indicated
           fiberbronchoscopy, and therefore limited to severe infantile asthma. Airway secretion
           could be also collected after hypertonic saline induction and chest physiotherapy. This
           method has been validated in the children, but has not in the younger.

        -  Aim : Analyses of cell profiles regarding the severity of infantile asthma.

        -  Methods : This descriptive study compared 3 groups of infants, the first with acute
           exacerbation, the second with uncontrolled asthma and the third with controlled asthma.
           Accounting 25% of failure, the number of 40 infants per groups has been calculated. The
           sputum induction will be performed by repeated nebulizations of 3% saline hypertonic
           solution. Cellularity and cell profiles were analysed as previously recommended. Safety
           will be evaluated.

        -  Inclusion criteria : Any infants suffering of infantile asthma (at least 3 episodes of
           wheezing during the 2 first years of life), aged between 6-12months.Asthma control was
           evaluated on the last 4 weeks, allowing to classify the infants . Control asthma was
           aimed when neither exacerbation nor persistent symptoms were observed. Uncontrolled
           asthma was defined whether the infant presented any symptoms during the last 4 weeks.
           Exacerbation was defined as any acute symptoms, as cough, dyspnoea or wheezing.

        -  Feasibility : A preliminary study has been presented in the Vienna ERS congress.
