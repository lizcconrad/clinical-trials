    <textblock>
      A single-center, open-label, dose-escalation pilot trial of a single infusion of darTregs in
      two dosing cohorts. This study is an independent single-center clinical trial. However, the
      organizational and mechanistic infrastructure of the study will be provided by the ONE Study
      project, a European Union funded collaborative project, whose objective is to assess distinct
      purified hematopoietic immunoregulatory cells as clinical therapies in solid organ
      transplantation. This study is one of multiple clinical trials within the framework of The
      ONE Study project, based on the same general design.

          1. Unacceptable darTreg product.

          2. Delayed graft function (requiring dialysis post-transplant).

          3. Requiring oxygen supplementation to keep capillary oxygen saturations &gt;95%.

             dehiscence, pneumonia, ongoing fevers, etc.) that in the judgment of the investigators
             or responsible clinician would put the subject at undue risk.-
