      In a 4-arm, randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate the relative effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of improving cholesterol levels among participants who are at high risk of
      CVD and who have elevated LDL cholesterol levels by testing process versus outcomes financial
      incentives. Participants will use electronic pill bottles that continuously monitor statin
      adherence. The primary outcome will be change in LDL cholesterol over 12 months.
