  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the significance of an early and consequent Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment as
      well as the challenge to achieve high adherence to treatment, evaluating the benefits of any
      new measure to improve adherence is important. The data storage capabilities of the
      BETACONNECT device, including the automated recording of injections, will facilitate the
      collection of reliable data on patient's injection behavior and adherence, which should be
      unaffected by recall bias or reporting bias.

      To better understand the utilities of the new BETACONNECT device and characterize its
      contribution to adherence, we plan to prospectively follow-up MS patients using this device
      for 24 weeks. The study will take place in a real-life setting in Neurology centers across
      Europe.

        The study population will consist of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis
        (RRMS) or patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) who are treated with Betaferon
        or will be treated with Betaferon速 according to the attending physician's decision and for
        whom the patient and the physician have agreed to use the BETACONNECT device.

        The study will be conducted in neurological centers and neurology departments specialized
        in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis patients.
