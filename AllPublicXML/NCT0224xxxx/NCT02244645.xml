  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common problem, with 70-80% of adults were bothered in their lives, which
      influence the work and quality of life. Yoga is one of the most popular complementary and
      alternative medicine for back pain, and this mind-body intervention has increasingly chosen
      to effectively treat chronic pain.

      This is a parallel-arm randomized controlled trial which will compare the outcomes of
      participants assigned to the experimental treatment group (yoga, with 36 participants) with
      those assigned to a passive modality control group for 3 months (12 weeks). Each group will
      receive regular 60-minutes yoga classes or passive modality twice a week. The investigators
      confer the difference of pain relief and functional life improvement between passive modality
      and yoga. The latter is expected to have positive effects on Chronic low back pain. The
      effects and possible mechanisms of action responsible for passive modality and yoga on
      salivary cortisol concentrations, inflammatory cytokines and autonomic nervous tone will be
      also evaluated. The study's primary endpoints are (1) back pain relief, (2) functional life
      improved, (3) Salivary cortisol concentrations decreased, (4) brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor improved, (5) heart rate variability improved, and (6) immune function improved
      significantly among the participants in the experimental group than the control group.

      This study may clarify a potential promising mechanism and clearest evidence to support the
      value of yoga as a therapeutic option for reducing chronic low back pain. If the results are
      positive, clinicians will attain more options for treating patient with chronic low back.
      Furthermore, the positive results from this study will help focus more future in-depth
      research on the most promising potential mechanism of action identifies.
