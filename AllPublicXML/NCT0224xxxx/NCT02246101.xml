  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Environmental toxins exert damaging health effects in workers. Thousands of responders who
      worked or volunteered on the World Trade Center (WTC) rescue and recovery effort following
      the September 11, 2001 attacks suffer from health conditions or may be at increased risk for
      worsening health. In a pilot study, investigators identified the first evidence of kidney
      damage in subjects with very high exposure at Ground Zero. Specifically, noted was a
      preliminary association between the intensity of particulate matter exposure and albuminuria,
      a marker of early chronic kidney disease (CKD), systemic endothelial dysfunction, and
      increased cardiovascular risk.

      The long-term goal is to minimize the risk of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among
      individuals exposed to inhaled toxins. The primary objective of this research is to quantify
      the risk of kidney damage among first responders to the WTC attack and to determine the
      relationship to particulate matter exposure as well as determine an association between renal
      and cardiovascular damage in first responders and to explore potential mechanisms. The
      central hypothesis is that exposure to inhaled particulate matter causes systemic
      inflammation and endothelial dysfunction that result in chronic kidney and cardiovascular
      damage. This hypothesis will be investigated in a subgroup of participants from a previously
      conducted NIOSH-funded study &quot;Pulmonary Function Abnormalities, Diastolic Dysfunction and WTC
      Exposure: Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment&quot; (&quot;WTC-CHEST,&quot; PI Mary Ann McLaughlin).

      The proposed study will capitalize on unique resources in WTC-CHEST, including the
      standardized collection of data on particulate matter exposure and shared risk factors for
      CKD and cardiovascular disease, and cardiopulmonary function testing. The output from this
      proposal is anticipated to have a broad impact on understanding the health effects of inhaled
      particulate matter.

      Specific Aim 1. To quantify the risk of kidney damage and the relationship to particulate
      matter exposure among first responders to the WTC attack.

      Urine samples will be collected on 2 occasions for albumin and creatinine. The investigators
      will define clinically relevant albuminuria as a UACR ≥30 mg/g. If, as hypothesized, the
      investigators find that albuminuria is more common among WTC responders, this simple and
      non-invasive measure may be useful in monitoring programs to identify responders at increased
      risk for adverse outcomes. eGFR will be calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease
      Epidemiology Consortium (CKD-EPI) equations.

      Specific Aim 2. To examine the relationship between kidney damage and cardiac structure and
      function among first responders to the WTC attack.

      Cardiovascular Disease Risk Screening In order to identify an independent relationship
      between CKD and cardiac dysfunction, the investigators will comprehensively evaluate
      potential confounders. Participants will undergo an evaluation of traditional CVD risk
      factors as accounted for in both the Framingham Risk Score and Reynold's score (medical
      history, medication use and baseline risk for CVD: smoking status, family history of
      premature coronary disease, blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, waist, hip and neck
      circumference). Laboratory evaluation will include: lipid panel, complete blood count, HbA1C,
      serum creatinine and cystatin C. Standard questionnaires on chest pain, shortness of breath,
      depression, sleep apnea and stress, IPSS.

      Specific Aim 3. To explore potential mechanisms for kidney and cardiovascular damage among
      first responders to the WTC attack.

      An established marker of systemic inflammation, serum hsCRP, will be measured in all
      participants. Flow-mediated dilatation, a validated non-invasive measure of endothelial
      function, will be measured in a subgroup of participants. Heavy metal assays will be
      performed and will be compared between participants with and without evidence of kidney
      damage (albuminuria or decreased eGFR) or proximal tubular dysfunction.
