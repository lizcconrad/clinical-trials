      In this study we explore To explore the role of maternal serum vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) in pregnancies complicated by foetal growth restriction.

      Small-for-gestational age (SGA) is defined as an estimated foetal weight (EFW) or abdominal
      circumference (AC) less than the 10th centileand severe SGA as an EFW or AC less than the 3rd
      centile. Foetal Growth Restriction refers to failure of the foetus to achieve its
      predetermined growth potential for various reasons.Foetus with foetal growth restriction
      (FGR) greatly contributes to perinatal mortality and short- and long-term morbidity. There is
      a 3-10 fold increase in perinatal mortality in pregnancies complicated by this FGR .The
      incidence of FGR in newborns ranges between 3 and 7% of the total population .FGR is thought
      to stem from placental hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction of the fetoplacental vessels, leading
      to placental hypoperfusion and thus fetal undernutrition. However, the effects of hypoxia on
      the fetoplacental vessels have been surprisingly little studied.Vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) is one of the factors that take part in placental angiogenesis. It is highly
      expressed during embryonic and foetal development..Angiogenesis involves the branching of new
      microvessles from pre-existing larger blood vessels.Angiogenesis plays a role in the
      development of the villous vasculature and the formation of terminal villi in human placenta.
      IUGR occurs as a result of the failure of elongation, branching and dilatation of the
      capillary loops and of terminal villous formation.

    <description>Patients with gestational age 28-36 weeks were included in our study. Patients with SGA were defined by obstetric ultrasound as estimated fetal weight was below the10thcentile. Twice weekly CTGs and Umbilical artery (UA) Doppler were done. Women with abnormal CTGs or UA Doppler were excluded from the study. A follow up scan was done 2 weeks later and FGR will be diagnosed if fetal weight had altered.</description>

    <description>Maternal blood samples (10 cc) were taken from an antecubital vein. Plastic clean sterile tubes were used for collection of blood. Two cc of the blood sample were put in other clean sterile tubes containing ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) to be used in measuring maternal hemoglobin concentrations and evaluating the complete blood count. The rest of maternal blood samples were centrifuged within 3 hours and sera collected equally in 2 suitable containers and stored at -80 degrees until assayed (first container for routine laboratory investigations and the second for VEGF assay).VEGF sample was allowed to clot for 30 minutes before centrifugation for 15 minutes. Serum is removed and assay immediately or sample was stored at -80 degrees.Serum VEGF concentration was determined by Enzyme Linked immunosorbant assay using Quantitative Human VEGF Immunoassay kit (cat. No. DVEOO) manufactured by R &amp; D Systems, Inc , (Minneapolis, MN, USA).</description>
