  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this observational study was the assessment of prognosis factors for
      having recourse to prostatic surgery in patients with BPH who were administered class-1 alpha
      blockers. The secondary objectives were the assessment of the time from alpha-adrenergic
      blockade treatment initiation to surgery and the evolution of patients during the study.
