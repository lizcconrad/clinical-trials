    <textblock>
      This observational study aims to assess the therapeutic responsiveness of MabThera SC in
      patients with malignant lymphomas under everyday clinical practice conditions. Patients with
      previously untreated CD-20 positive follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or previously
      untreated CD-20 positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are planned for therapy
      with MabThera SC according to the assessment of the physician will be prospectively enrolled
      for observation. No study specific measures are required; treatment and documentation will be
      performed according to usual clinical practice.
