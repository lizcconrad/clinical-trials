  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain cardiac and neurologic diseases influence each other via a still poorly understood
      &quot;brain-heart axis&quot;. Subarachnoidal bleedings are well known to cause ECG alterations
      resembling those of myocardial infarction, along with a reduction of systolic myocardial
      function (&quot;neurogenic stunned myocardium&quot;). Alterations of the right insula region by a
      stroke or intracranial hemorrhage go along with a sympathetic activation (increased
      circulating catecholamine levels, tachycardia, arterial hypertension). In contrast,
      alterations of the left insula region often cause vagal reactions such as bradycardia,
      arterial hypotension. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a just recently recognised subform of
      heart attacks, often caused by psychological or physical stress (death of a beloved one,
      divorce, job loss, infection, preoperative state). In more than 90% of cases, TTC affects
      postmenopausal women.

      Functional MRT enables imaging of activated brain regions, either without (&quot;resting state&quot;)
      or with specific stimuli. The investigators speculate that there is a specific involvement of
      the insula region during TTC.
