      This study aims at capturing for the first time at which frequencies and sound intensities
      hearing distortions are perceived after successful stapedotomy surgery. Also, the portion of
      patients perceiving these sound distortions and the length of time over which the distortions
      occur are assessed.

      If the stapes footplate is fixed in position, e.g. by otosclerosis, rather than being
      normally mobile, a conductive hearing loss results. This conductive hearing loss is usually
      compensated with hearing aids or through stapedotomy. During stapedotomy, the diseased stapes
      bone is removed and is replaced with a piston prosthesis that conveys the sound stimulus from
      the incus to the footplate of the removed stapes.

      After surgery subjects sometimes state that the quality of sound is suboptimal, even though
      their hearing ability has improved significantly. Some subjects subjectively hear distorted
      sounds, which often disappear several weeks after surgery.

      This study aims at capturing for the first time at which frequencies and sound intensities
      these distortions are perceived. Additionally, the portion of patients perceiving these sound
      distortions and the length of time over which the distortions occur are assessed.

        Control group: Healthy volunteers are recruited by flyers that are displayed in the waiting
        zones of the ENT clinic.

        Subjects with stapedotomy: Patients are being asked by the examining MD as soon as the
        indication for stapedotomy is proven.
