      Irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by abdominal discomfort and bowel habit change. It
      is increasing worldwide. But the pathophysiology of the irritable bowel syndrome is not
      proven. So, the treatment's target is the relief of the symptoms.

      Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth considered as the cause of the irritable bowel
      syndrome. Because, it is related to the postprandial abdominal discomfort and the abdominal
      discomfort could be relieved after taking antibiotics. There are several diagnostic methods
      for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. hydrogen breath test is non-invasive method for
      diagnosis of the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. But, there is no standardized cut-off
      value for the hydrogen breath test. So, we want to compare the hydrogen breath test between
      the irritable bowel syndrome patients and normal people. And then, we want to analyze the
      efficacy of hydrogen breath test for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome.

    <description>Hydrogen breath test is the current gold standard for diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome. Glucose is a sugar that will be broken down by bacteria if present in the small bowel with hydrogen or methane gas as a by-product. The breath sample will be analyzed for hydrogen or methane content to determine if you are able to properly break down the lactose, fructose or sucrose, or if you have bacterial overgrowth.</description>
