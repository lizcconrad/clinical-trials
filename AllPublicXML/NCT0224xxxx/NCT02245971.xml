    <textblock>
      Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced technique that enables en bloc
      resection of superficial tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. ESD, however, is a
      time-consuming procedure that requires a high level of endoscopic skill to achieve a
      desirable oncologic outcome. Especially, ESD for the lesion which is located in the antrum of
      lesser curvature side is difficult. Because the antrum of lesser curvature side is dependent
      position, irrigated water and blood may prevent visual field of ESD.

      Generally, whole precutting around the lesion during the ESD is performed prior to
      dissection. However, it is expected that partial precutting method for the lesion located in
      the antrum of the lesser curvature may improve the visibility of ESD because it can help us
      the flap of the lesion evaginated easily. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the procedure time
      of ESD for the lesion located in the antrum of the lesser curvature according to the
      precutting methods (whole precutting vs. partial precutting).
