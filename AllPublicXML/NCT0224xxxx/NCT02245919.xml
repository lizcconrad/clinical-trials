  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, only little research has been performed in tailoring treatment of patients with
      chronic low back pain (CLBP). It would be interesting to evaluate a biopsychosocial
      intervention in patients with a moderate to high level of disability and in whom the
      contributing role of psychosocial factors to this disability is mild to moderate (WPN3-).
      Nowadays, these patients receive cognitive behavioral-based treatments in multidisciplinary
      rehabilitation settings but might also benefit from treatments based on these
      multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment principles when provided by specifically trained
      primary care physical therapists. Therefore, the aims of this pilot-study are to evaluate the
      feasibility of a specifically for primary care physiotherapist developed biopsychosocial
      intervention (&quot;Back on Track&quot; intervention) in WPN3- classified patients, and to evaluate
      whether this &quot;Back on Track&quot; intervention results in a significant improvement in functional
      disability in this subgroup of patients.

    <time_frame>All therapy sessions of the Back on Track intervention will be audio recorded (the intervention period of the trial will last approximately one year and 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Physiotherapists will audio record all therapy sessions. A random sample will be assessed for protocol adherence using a modified version of the protocol used by Leeuw et al (2009). This protocol includes essential treatment elements and raters will judge whether these essential treatments elements are provided during the therapy or not. Adherence will be regarded sufficient in case a percentage of 70% of the required treatment elements are provided during the treatment.</description>
