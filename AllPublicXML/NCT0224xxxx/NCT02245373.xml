  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depression (MD) is highly prevalent and has associated a high burden and economic
      costs. Mild levels of MD could be treated without antidepressants at Primary Care (PC).

      Main objectives: 1) To calculate the cost-effectiveness of active monitoring (recommended by
      NICE) vs pharmacological antidepressant treatment to treat mild MD at PC level.

      Methods: 300 patients (≥18 years) with MD (diagnosed by the GP) will be recruited at the PC
      center. Depending on the level of symptoms, the GP will choose between: A) Active Monitoring
      (n=150) and B) pharmacological treatment (n=150).

      Patients will be followed-up for one year and data will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12
      months. Severity will be assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), quality of life
      with the EuroQoL-5D (5 health dimensions), and the use of services with an adapted version of
      the Client Service Receipt Inventory (including lost productivity).

      Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will be calculated and 5000 bootstrapping
      replications will be conducted to asses uncertainty. Cost-acceptability curves will be done
      using two perspectives: the National Health Service perspective and the Societal perspective.

      The Propensity Score technique will minimize the absence of randomization, matching cases
      from both treatment options.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients whose GP considers to have major depression. The indication of
             pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment will be based strictly on the
             clinical judgment of the physician.

          2. Adults (≥18 years)

          3. Informed consent signed by the physician and the patient to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of antidepressant drugs during the previous 60 days to inclusion date.

          2. Alcohol or other toxic abuse.

          3. Psychosis or bipolar disorder identified in the psychiatric interview

          4. Use in the last 6 months of antipsychotic drugs, lithium or antiepileptic

          5. Health status (pregnancy) and / or disease and / or treatments that contraindicate the
             use of antidepressant drugs.

          6. Terminal illness.
