  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of CD25 monoclonal antibody and
      calcineurin inhibitors with or without mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating patients
      with steroid-resistant acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for
      several hematological disorders. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and
      treatment of side effects associated with transplantation, aGVHDremains a common and
      life-threatening complication with poor prognosis. Corticosteroids are still acted as the
      first-line treatments of aGVHD, with a response rate of 50-80. However, those who failed to
      initial therapy only have 10-30% long-term survival.

      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be
      isolated from many tissues, such as bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Such
      cells possess the capacity to suppress immunological responses, support hematopoiesis and
      repair tissues. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly for preventing and
      treating GVHD. Although the results are still controversy, most prospective and retrospective
      data suggest that MSCs are effective to aGVHD.

      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors combined with CD25 monoclonal
      antibody and calcineurin inhibitors in treating patients with aGVHD.

    <description>The responses to aGVHD are according to the literature criteria, including completely response (CR), partial response (PR) and no response (NR), and CR is defined as resolution of all symptoms of aGVHD; PR is defined as a decrease by at least 1 GVHD stage in any 1 organ system without deterioration in others 24. Overall response (OR) includes CR and PR.</description>

    <description>MSCs will be given at a median dose of 1×10^6 cells/kg once weekly for 4 dose (as 1 cycle) or until CR. The response should be evaluated at 3 and 4 weeks. If symptoms of aGVHD progress at 3 weeks or the patients have NR at 4 weeks, these patients will switch to other therapy. If patients achieved PR at 4 weeks, another cycle will be given. Besides, CD25 monoclonal antibody (20mg/kg) will be administered at day 1,4,8,15, 21 and calcineurin inhibitors will also be used.</description>
