  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, patients with cancer in the upper gastrointestinal canal who are going to
      receive first line palliative chemotherapy and patients with colorectal cancer who are going
      to receive second line palliative chemotherapy will be included. Participating patients will
      be randomized between early contact with a palliative care unit, or contact with a palliative
      care unit when needed. The objectives with the trial is to investigate if an early
      establishment with a palliative care unit will have a positive impact on the patients quality
      of life, this also applies for the nearest relative, survival, and if a difference in numbers
      of chemotherapy cycles can be detected.
