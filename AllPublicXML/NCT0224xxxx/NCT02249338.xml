    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic Society criteria. Patients
             must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an FEV1 ≤ 70 %
             of predicted value and FEV1/FVC ≤ 70 % at Screening Visit 1

          -  Ability to produce an adequate induced sputum sample ad defined by: volume &gt; 1 ml:
             squamous cells less than 80% and the ability to tolerate the procedure for at least
             four minutes with no bronchoconstriction ( a fall in FEV1 ≥ 20%)

          -  Greater than 50% of neutrophils in induced-sputum cells at visit 1. This requirement
             refers to the neutrophils percentage excluding squamous cells

          -  Males or females aged 40 to 80 years inclusive.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential cannot participate in this study. Female
             patients participating in this study must meet at least one of the following criteria:

               -  surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation

               -  post-menopausal for at least two years

          -  A smoking history of more than ten pack years. A pack-year is defined as the
             equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year

          -  Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests and maintain records during
             the study period as required in the protocol

          -  All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior tho participation in the trial,
             i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Culture-documented and/or radiographic evidence and/or antibiotic treatment of an
             upper or lower respiratory tract infection within the previous 4 weeks or during the
             baseline period of this study

          -  Significant diseases other than COPD will be exclude. A significant disease is defined
             as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at
             risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the
             results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study. Patients
             with inflammatory diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, and those with autoimmune
             diseases will be excluded

          -  Clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, liver function, blood chemistry
             or urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion
             will be excluded. Laboratory parameters listed in the protocol must be within normal
             range, or if not, be documented by the investigator as not clinically relevant. The
             following tests may be outside the normal range to the extent indicated:

               -  Aspartate transaminase, Alanine transaminase, Total Bilirubin, Alkaline
                  Phosphatase: 10% &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  White blood cell count &lt; 3.80 x 10**9/L, Neutrophils &lt; 2.00 x 10**9/L, Platelets
                  &lt; 100 x 10**9/L, Hemoglobin &lt; 12 x g/dL

               -  Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine: 10% &gt; ULN

          -  A recent history (i.e. within six months) of myocardial infarction

          -  A recent history (i.e. within three months) of refractory heart failure or unstable
             arrhythmias requiring treatment

          -  Patients with known active tuberculosis

          -  A history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated basal cell
             carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are allowed

          -  A history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of cystic fibrosis
             or bronchiectasis

          -  Previous thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a history of a
             thoracotomy without pulmonary resection should be evaluated as per exclusion criterion
             no. 2

          -  The use of oral corticosteroids within 4 weeks, or theophyllines and oral or
             long-acting inhaled beta2-agonists within 2 weeks of visit 1

          -  A change in pulmonary therapy within the 6 weeks prior to the screening visit 1 in
             order to control the patient's COPD

          -  A history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a total blood eosinophil
             count ≥ 600/mm**3

          -  A history of and/or current alcohol abuse and/or drug abuse

          -  Use of an investigational drug within one month or six half-lives (which ever is
             greater) of the screening visit 1
