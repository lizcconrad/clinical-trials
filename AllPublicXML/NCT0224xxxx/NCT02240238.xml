  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the dose escalation phase (Part 1), this study will determine the dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 (RPII) dose of NC 6004 in
      combination with gemcitabine.

      In the expansion phase of the study (Part 2), study will evaluate the activity, safety, and
      tolerability at the RPII dose identified in Part 1 in patients with squamous NSCLC, biliary
      tract, and bladder cancer.
