    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of functional cervical pillow on
      inpatients with neck discomfort.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 inpatients with neck discomfort(NRS&gt;4) will be randomly allocated to 2 groups. The
      experimental group was treated with functional cervical pillow and the control group was
      treated with general pillow. All applications of pillow were limited to 3-4 weeks. Primary
      outcomes were measured using the VAS scale. Post-treatment follow-up will be performed to
      measure primary outcomes at baseline, 3 day, per weeks until the duration of admission.
      Satisfaction levels of the patient's current status, Neck disability Index(NDI) PSQI, EQ-5D
      will also be collected. The applicants will also get thru the diagnosis of range of motion by
      X-ray(flexion, neutral, extension of their neck position)

    <description>The NDI is a modification of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index . It is a patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, week 2, 4 following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration,habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month.</description>
