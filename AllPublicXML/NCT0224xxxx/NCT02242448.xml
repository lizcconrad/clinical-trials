      Background:

      - Computed tomography (CT) scanning is a procedure that helps doctors with diagnoses. It uses
      X-ray radiation to produce an image in three dimensions. Researchers want to study how to get
      the best quality CT scans using the lowest possible radiation dose.

      Objective:

      - To determine how to improve CT scanning.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 45 years of age and older who have not had a CT scan in the past year and do not
      have kidney disease.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and blood and urine tests.

        -  Nurses will put an intravenous (IV) line into an arm or hand vein. It will stay in for
           several hours during the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scans. Through this IV,
           blood will be taken, dye will be injected, and medicine will be given.

        -  Participants may have a CT scan of the heart, head, chest, abdomen, and/or pelvis.
           Participants will lie on their back on a table. The table will slide into a donut-shaped
           machine. An X-ray tube will move around the body, taking pictures.

        -  Participants may be given a drug called a beta blocker by mouth or through the IV tube.

        -  Participants heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored.

        -  Participants may have an MRI scan. The MRI is a large hollow tube. The participant will
           lie on a table that will be moved into the tube, which contains a magnetic field. When
           the imaging starts, a thumping sound will be heard. Headphones or earplugs will be
           provided to muffle the sound.

        -  Participants will give blood samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, computed tomography (CT) imaging performed on healthy volunteers and
      subjects with disease will be used to test, develop and optimize CT protocols. The results of
      this optimization will be used to evaluate the performance of new imaging methods and
      equipment, and to provide essential ground work for research and development for use in
      future patient CT studies. CT imaging is a noninvasive technology. As appropriate, MRI scans
      will be used to compare to CT imaging findings to help validate the CT methods.
