        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient, age: over 40 years (lower age if genetic Dementia of Alzheimer
             Type (DAT) is documented. Patients over 85 years need to be in a clinically stable
             state (investigator's judgement)

             and local legislation

          -  Patient has a non-demented relative or care giver who is willing to support the
             clinical trial; his/her written informed consent is optional

          -  Body weight: within +/- 30% of normal weight (Broca index)

          -  Diagnosis of DAT by the National Institute of Neurological and communicative
             Disorders-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorder Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria

          -  MMS-score 10 - 24 inclusive

          -  Rosen ischemia score is lower or equal to two

          -  Patient is able to complete the trial examinations, to hear, speak, read and write in
             a basic way and primary sensorial functions are intact

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any dementia of vascular genesis (excluded by Rosen ischemia score &gt; 2)

          -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computer Tomogram (CT) (more recent than 12
             months; if a MRI of CT recording is performed more than 12 months before study entry,
             it must be repeated) findings make the diagnosis of DAT unlikely

          -  Any stroke history

          -  All secondary dementia (exclusion diagnosis defined by the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) as a
             late complication of:

             in normal range, clinically stable diabetes and any case of insulin dose ≤ 0.5
             UI/kg/day may be included), or other metabolic diseases

          -  Renal insufficiency: calculated creatinine clearance is less than 60 ml/min

          -  Acute hepatic disorder (liver enzymes above 50 % upper normal limit)

             cytostatics etc.)

          -  Patients with obvious symptoms of dehydration

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence on other hepatotoxic agents (if a

             hospitalisation, no additional drug screen is necessary)

          -  Neoplasm currently active or likely to recur (except basal cell carcinoma)

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last four weeks and re-entering
