  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Glucerna SR treating newly-diagnosed
      type 2 diabetes patients (NDM) on glycemic stability, with the application of CGMS
      (continuous glucose monitoring system) and to further realize the safety and effect of
      Glucerna SR on daily and day-to-day amplitude of blood glucose fluctuation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucerna SR (Abbott Laboratories, Columbus, USA) is a nutritional product with lower glycemic
      response. About 24% of the total energy provided by Glucerna SR is due to monounsaturated
      fatty acids, which can help keep good metabolic state in accordance with the recommendations
      of the American Heart Association. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of Glucerna
      SR treating newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients (NDM) on glycemic stability, with the
      application of CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system) and to further realize the safety
      and effect of Glucerna SR consumed as a meal replacement at breakfast meal on daily and
      day-to-day amplitude of blood glucose fluctuation.

    <description>Subjects will perform continues blood glucose monitoring using CGMS for 72 hours at the beginning of the study and within the last three days during a 4-week treatment interval.
Mean incremental are under the curve(IAUC) for postprandial glucose after 4 weeks treatment will be calculated based on CGMS data.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypoglycaemia</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycaemia based on CGMS readings or hypoglycaemia based on self-reported episodes. The frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes will be derived as the number of the CGMS readings that come below 3.9 and 2.8 mmol/l respectively over 72-hour monitoring period. Due to fluctuations in CGMS readings around the threshold, two episodes must be separated by at least 15 minutes. The duration of the hypoglycaemic episodes will be quantified by accumulating the total time the CGMS profiles stays below the defined threshold.</description>
