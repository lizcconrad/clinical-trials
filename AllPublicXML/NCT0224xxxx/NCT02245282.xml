  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer detection and disease progression monitoring relies on systematic multi-core
      biopsies. Minimal invasive imaging capacities for lesion targeting and monitoring are badly
      needed. The purpose of this study is to determine if a new MRI technique can identify and
      monitor prostate disease progression. If so biopsy core number can be reduced to as small as
      one, and frequency for biopsy repeat can be reduced. The new technique is about a new way of
      analyzing the pictures taken as part of prostate MRI exam. This part is called dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI. It involves an injection of contrast reagent (or dye) through the arm
      vein during a time period when prostate MRI pictures are continuously taken.

      The aim of the study is to perform contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
      OHSU on subjects with diagnosed prostate cancer. This pilot project will study 20 subjects
      prior to their next scheduled clinical procedures (biopsy or radical prostatectomy). Data
      from this project will be used to explore new capabilities of the software platform developed
      under current SBIR funding. CE-MRI will involve the use of an extracellular (Gadolinium
      based, Gd) contrast agent. When Gd is used, (dynamic-contrast-enhanced) DCE-MRI signal
      intensity time-course data will be analyzed analytically using the so called &quot;shutter-speed&quot;
      paradigm which takes into account of the effects of finite water exchange kinetics. Region of
      interest (ROI) and high resolution (~millimeter) parametric maps of pathophysiologic
      quantities, such as tumor vessel permeability, tumor perfusion, extracellular extravascular
      volume fraction, will be generated from the DCE-MRI data. All parameters will be compared to
      literature results for software validation and correlated with pathology for clinical
      potential.

        A total of 20 subjects will be studied under this protocol. Subjects will be selected from
        patients scheduled for prostate biopsies with known prostate lesions. Subjects will also be
        recruited from prostate cancer patients who choose radical prostatectomy as disease
        management plan. The research project will be introduced to a potential subject by a
        urologist at OHSU. If interested, the subject will then be contacted through phone to
        participate in the study by an investigator or a research assistant on the research team.
