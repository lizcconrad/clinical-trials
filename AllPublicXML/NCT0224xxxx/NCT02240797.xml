  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to understand the brain function of individuals with anorexia nervosa
      and healthy controls.

      This is a 3-year study involving n=7 women with anorexia nervosa - recovered (AN-REC) from
      restricting subtype that have achieved a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 18.5 in the past year, are
      medication free, range in age from 18-55 years and n=7 healthy (medical and psychiatric
      statues) age- and weight-matched controls who are invited to participate in a medical and
      psychiatric evaluation, neuroendocrine assessments, one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      study and one positron emission tomography (PET) study kappa opioid receptor (KOR) 11-carbon
      (11C) [11C]PKAB and PET. Subjects will be asked to provide written informed consent after
      full explanation of all study procedures and risks and benefits related to study
      participation. On the screening day a full medical evaluation including blood work, urine
      analyses, toxicology, electrocardiogram (ECG) and physical exam will be performed.
