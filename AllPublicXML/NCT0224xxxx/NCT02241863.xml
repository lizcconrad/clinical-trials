  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite an increasing pharmacopoeia of effective medications for the treatment of bipolar
      disorder, patient outcomes continue to be impacted by treatment adherence. Non-adherence to
      treatments is also a major obstacle in translating efficacy in research settings into
      effectiveness in clinical practice. Non-adherence with bipolar disorder (BD) medication
      treatment dramatically worsens outcomes. Reasons for non-adherence among individuals with BD
      are multi-dimensional, and it has been suggested that a multifaceted intervention will be
      more effective. The study is aimed to assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention
      on enhancing medications adherence in patients with bipolar disorders.
