  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study test the effectiveness of the Universal Medication Schedule (UMS),
      which was designed as a strategy to standardize and simplify medication instructions to
      support safe and effective prescription drug use among diabetic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown the UMS (1) improves patients' understanding of how much to take of a
      medicine and when, and (2) reduces the number of times per day patients would take a
      multi-drug regimen. In this study, UMS tools will be exported into a second electronic health
      record platform to demonstrate ease of dissemination. Also, as patients may require
      assistance outside of clinic visits to adapt their prescription regimen to the UMS, this
      study will test the potential benefit of daily short message service (SMS) text reminders via
      cell phone.

      We will conduct a three-arm, provider-randomized controlled trial among English and
      Spanish-speaking adults taking three or more prescription drugs to evaluate the effectiveness
      of the UMS strategy, with and without SMS text reminders, to improve patient understanding,
      consolidation, and adherence compared to usual care.We will conduct a three-arm,
      provider-randomized trial at two community health centers in Chicago, IL to evaluate the UMS
      and UMS+SMS text reminder strategies compared to usual care. English and Spanish-speaking
      patients who are prescribed three or more medications will be recruited and assessed by phone
      at baseline, three months, and six months.

    <time_frame>6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' ability to correctly dose their prescription medications will be assessed through a series of questions. Correct dosing will be scored for each medication as yes or no, reflecting having demonstrated all of the following: proper dose (# of pills), spacing (hours between doses), and frequency (# of times per day), and total pills per day.</description>

    <measure>Medication Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The identification of each medication's purpose and side effects, risks, warnings, and benefits will be assessed through a structured questionnaire. Patients will be asked about each of the above via structured, open-ended items.</description>

    <measure>Medication Adherence: PMAQ</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A 4-item validated Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire (PMAQ) that assesses adherence behaviors by asking patients to self-report missed/wrong doses in past 4 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence: Pharmacy Records</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Primary adherence as determined by the proportion of days covered (PDC) with medication using pharmacy records. This is calculated by summing the number of days' supply obtained by a patient during a given time period and dividing by the number of days for which the patient was prescribed the medication. Aggregate PDC data will be obtained for all patients who see a study provider.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months before baseline to 1 year after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>An exploratory analysis will be conducted to investigate the impact of receiving the UMS in either intervention arm on biologic outcomes for these prevalent conditions. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be obtained from patients' electronic health records. Differences will be measured between the last clinical measurement prior to baseline assessment and the last measured value during the study period (closest to 6 month assessment). Aggregate blood pressure readings will be obtained for all patients who see a study provider.</description>

Hemoglobin A1c (hbA1c) will be obtained from patients' electronic health records. Differences will be measured between the last clinical measurement prior to baseline assessment and the last measured value during the study period (closest to 6 month assessment). Aggregate hemoglobin A1c levels will be obtained for all patients who see a study provider.</description>

    <description>Patients of providers randomized to the UMS arm will receive study-related educational tools at their primary care visit to support the understanding, regimen consolidation, and use of prescriptions.
Prescription instructions will be adapted to UMS to establish four standard time intervals for prescribing and dispensing of medicine. UMS instructions also use simplified text and numeric characters instead of words to detail dose.
Single-page, plain language medication information sheets with content from a patient's perspective and following health literacy best practices.
A list of their current medications each corresponding to a set of instructions and a checkbox for morning, noon, evening, and bedtime medicine to help patients visually depict when to take their medicines.</description>
