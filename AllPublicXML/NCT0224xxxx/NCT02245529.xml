      The Objective of this study is to conduct a Prescription Event Monitoring (PEM) involving
      patients treated with Secotex® (Tamsulosin) in &quot;real life&quot; settings. The aim of a PEM is to
      monitor the safety profile of Secotex® in a cohort of patients with Benign Prostatic
      Hyperplasia as used in general practice

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of any age with a diagnosis of symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)
             and/or that, according to the Physician, their symptoms require medical treatment to
             improve their quality of life. The patients could be naïve to treatment or could be on
             treatment with other drugs but have not responded adequately to treatment. This study
             is non-interventional, so the decision to treat must be based on the best standard
             accepted clinical practice, and according to Secotex® prescribing information

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to Tamsulosin, or any other component of the
             product

          -  Patients with a history of orthostatic hypotension or severe liver failure
