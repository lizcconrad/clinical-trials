      Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been shown to be the most accurate test for
      detecting breast cancer however, MRI is not always reliable because it can indicate the
      presence of cancer when in reality, there is none; this is called a 'false positive' result.
      A history of breast carcinoma alone does not qualify a patient for ongoing monitoring with
      breast MRI. This study is being done to assess a new technique called FAST breast MRI. A FAST
      breast MRI is different than a traditional breast MRI because it has much fewer sequences and
      takes approximately 3 minutes for the scan. MRI sequences are combinations of magnetic pulses
      that collect information about the tissues. There is no radiation associated with an MRI.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact on patient health when a FAST breast MRI
      is used as a screening technique in women with a personal history of cancer. It has been
      shown that FAST breast MRI is similar to routine breast MRI in the detection of breast
      cancer, but it has not been proven that FAST breast MRI will help women who have a personal
      history for breast cancer. Currently, routine breast MRI is not part of the standard of care
      in screening for breast cancer in women who have a prior personal history of breast cancer.
      By evaluating FAST MRI the investigators are able to study the effects of this short MRI on
      cancer detection in women with a personal history of breast cancer, and on the impact on
      overall health. The investigators estimate that 300 participants will be enrolled in the
      study from The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre at The Ottawa Hospital, General Campus and the
      Women's Breast Health Centre at The Ottawa Hospital, Civic Campus. All of the participants
      have had a history of breast carcinoma.

      Given the demand for breast MRI screening by breast cancer survivors and oncologists, we plan
      to perform a randomized controlled trial in a select patient population of breast cancer
      survivors who would not normally be eligible for breast MRI screening. This study will
      determine whether using FAST MRI in addition to mammography will reduce anxiety in patients
      compared to the current standard of care: mammography alone. If it turns out to reduce
      anxiety, the next step would be to conduct a large-scale multi-centre randomized control
      trial (RCT) to evaluate whether FAST MRI is more sensitive and whether the increased
      sensitivity leads to improved clinical outcomes.

      The purpose of our study is to determine the impact on patient anxiety of FAST Breast MRI as
      a surveillance technique in women with a personal history of breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English or French speaking female patients over the age of 18 years, with a personal
             history of a diagnosis of breast carcinoma (including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
             and invasive ductal or lobular carcinoma) within the past 10 years.

             cancer greater than 12% (average risk) and less than 25% (high risk) as defined using
             the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm
             (BOADICEA) model (see Appendix A)
