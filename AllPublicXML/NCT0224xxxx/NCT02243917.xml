  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of orally administered CB-5083 in adult
      subjects with advanced metastatic solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: an
      initial Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1a) of CB-5083 in subjects with advanced metastatic
      solid tumors who have progressed or are non-responsive to available therapies and for which
      no standard therapy exists, followed by a Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 1b) which will include
      1 to 4 arms: one arm in subjects with RAS mutated mCRC; optionally, at sponsors discretion, 3
      additional arms may be added for subjects with advanced RCC, advanced pNET, or solid tumors
      with mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway.

    <textblock>
      The objectives of the Dose Escalation Phase are to determine the safety, tolerability, PK and
      pharmacodynamic profiles, the MTD and/or RP2D, and the effect of fed vs. fasted state on the
      bioavailability of orally administered CB-5083. The objectives of the dose expansion phase
      are to confirm the safety and tolerability of the RP2D, to further assess the PK and
      pharmacodynamic profiles and to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of CB-5083 in
      subjects with tumors for which there is biologic plausibility of unique sensitivity to
      CB-5083 mechanism of action (MOA) based on pre-clinical data. The objectives of the Food
      Effect Stage is to determine the effect of fed vs. fasted state on the bioavailability of
      orally administered CB-5083.

             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results and, in the Investigator's opinion, would make the

         19. Use of any investigational agents within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             shorter) prior to Baseline;
