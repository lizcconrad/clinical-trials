    <textblock>
      This study has several purposes. DCE-MRI will be used to image the tumor. Safety of cetuximab
      given before surgery will be studied. Cetuximab delivery to the tumor will be studied. In
      Stage 2 of this study, the safety of cetuximab and PEGPH20 given before surgery will be
      studied. Also, the effects of PEGPH20 on tumors will be studied.

    <description>5 participants will undergo DW- &amp; DCE-MRI for sequence parameter optimization. The 1st stage of the study, patients (n = 5) will have the option to undergo (DW-) &amp; (DCE)-MRI for repeatability investigation &amp; T1 mapping. Optional DW- &amp; DCE-MRI will be repeated 2 to 5 days later, followed shortly by administration of 1 intravenous dose of cetuximab at 250 mg/m2/60 min. Pancreatic tumor resection will be performed 1 to 2 days later.Blood samples will be drawn at various time points. The resected tumor specimen will be studied. If deemed safe, we will proceed to the second stage of the study. Patients (n = 5) will have the option to undergo DW- &amp; DCE-MRI. 1 to 3 days later, patients will receive 1 IV dose of PEGPH20 at 3 μg/kg/10 min. Optional DW- &amp; DCE-MRI will be repeated 1 to 2 days after PEGPH20 administration, followed on that day by administration of 1 IV dose of cetuximab at 250 mg/m2/60 min. Pancreatic tumor resection will be performed 1 to 2 days later.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed PDAC. Pathologic
             confirmation is mandated before initiation of any protocol specified imaging studies
             or drug administrations. It is recognized that for some patients, histologic or
             cytologic confirmation of cancer may be obtained following study enrollment. Patient
             volunteers to the DW- and DCE-MRI sequence parameter optimization imaging portion of
             the study are eligible if they have any pancreatic lesion, histologic or cytologic
             confirmation of pathology is not required for this patient volunteer group.

          -  Radiographically resectable PDAC as adjudicated by MSKCC surgical oncologist without
             evidence of distant metastases by CT or by laparoscopy, if performed at the discretion
             of the surgeon.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  ECOG Performance Score of 0 - 2.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500 cells/mm3

          -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3.

          -  Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine &lt; 1.6 mg/dL.

               -  INR &lt; 1.5, unless patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation where a therapeutic
                  INR is acceptable. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or warfarin,
                  where medically indicated, is permitted.

          -  Patient volunteers for the DW- and DCE-MRI sequence parameter optimization portion of
             the study are exempt from criteria 2, 5, 6 and 8.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to the
             administration of protocol specified interventions.

          -  Ability to understand informed consent and signing of written informed consent prior
             to initiation of protocol therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histology other than adenocarcinoma, e.g., neuroendocrine cancer or
             acinar cancers, are ineligible.

          -  No prior therapy for pancreas cancer is allowed.

          -  Patients with metastatic or locally unresectable PDAC (resectability is as defined by
             MSKCC pancreatic surgeon and as outlined

          -  Active infection, with the exception of resolving cholangitis, will preclude
             enrollment on the study. Preoperative interventions can only be initiated when acute
             cholangitis has resolved.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of PEGPH20 or cetuximab.

          -  For patients who choose to undergo MRI imaging, hypersensitivity to MRI IV contrast
             media not suitable for pre-medication.

          -  Patients who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy or who have received
             investigational therapy within 30 days of the first scheduled day of protocol
             treatment (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is
             currently no regulatory authority approved indication).

          -  Patients who have a history of venous or arterial thromboembolic events including
             pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis and stroke.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  For patients who choose to undergo MRI imaging patients who are ineligible for an MRI
             with contrast based on Radiology Department screening.

          -  Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by
             the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed
             consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or follow up procedures.

          -  Patient volunteers for the DW- and DCE-MRI sequence parameter optimization portion are
             exempt from criteria 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18.
