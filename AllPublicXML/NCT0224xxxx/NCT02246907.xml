  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an exercise intervention on
      patient-reported anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances among acute leukemia
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that exercise will reduce fatigue in acute leukemia
      patients.

      The purpose of this randomized, prospective, longitudinal study is to evaluate the impact of
      an exercise intervention on patient-reported anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep
      disturbances outcomes among acute leukemia patients. The study will include 2 groups for a
      total sample size of 30: n=15 control group and n=15 intervention group. Each patient
      enrolled in the intervention arm will participate in an exercise program for the duration of
      their hospitalization, 4-6 weeks on average during the first treatment (induction
      chemotherapy).

    <description>All intervention patients will participate in an individualized prescriptive exercise intervention 2 to 4 times per week for a period of the induction chemotherapy/in-hospital recovery. The exercise intervention will begin on week 1 of the study, the day after the first batteries of initial assessments are concluded. Each exercise session will be divided into two parts. One part will be administered in the morning and the second one late in the afternoon. There will be a period of rest of at least 36 hours between each exercise session.</description>

          -  An expected hospital stay of 3-4 weeks or longer

          -  Participation in the study must be approved by the physician directly responsible for
             the patient's care while at University of North Carolina -Hospitals

          -  Age &gt;21 years of age

        patient's medical history. If any of the exclusion criteria are observed, the patients will
        be informed and excluded from participating in the study.

        potential risks involved, patients will be screened for exclusion based upon the following
        criteria:

          -  Cardiovascular disease (unless the disease would not compromise the patient's ability
             to participate in the exercise rehabilitation program)

          -  Acute or chronic respiratory disease that would compromise the patient's ability to
             participate in the exercise rehabilitation program

          -  Acute or chronic bone, joint, or muscular abnormalities that would compromise the
             patient's ability to participate in the exercise rehabilitation program

          -  Inability to understand and speak English

          -  Dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the
             understanding or rendering of informed consent

          -  Another active malignancy

          -  Patients will also be excluded if they have active bleeding, acute thrombosis,
             ischemia, hemodynamically unstable, and uncontrolled pain.
