    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the influence of uncontrolled type 1 and type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (DM) on the kinetic disposition, metabolism and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of
      tramadol enantiomers in patients with neuropathic pain. Thus, nondiabetic patients (control
      group, n = 12), patients with type 1 DM (n = 9), and patients with type 2 DM (n = 9), all
      with neuropathic pain and phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of cytochrome P450 2D6
      (CYP2D6) who were treated with a single oral dose of 100 mg racemic tramadol were
      investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic that effectively relieves acute and chronic pain,
      including neuropathic pain in diabetic patients. The drug is available in clinical practice
      as a mixture of the (+)-tramadol and (-)-tramadol enantiomers. Tramadol is metabolized by
      CYP2D6 to O-desmethyltramadol (M1) and by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A4) and cytochrome P450 2B6
      (CYP2B6) to N-desmethyltramadol (M2). Both tramadol enantiomers and (+)-M1 contribute to the
      analgesic activity of the drug: (+)-tramadol and the (+)-M1 metabolite act as -opioid
      receptor agonists; (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake; and (-)-tramadol inhibits the
      reuptake of norepinephrine. This study investigated the influence of uncontrolled type 1 and
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on the kinetic disposition, metabolism and
      pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of tramadol enantiomers in patients with neuropathic pain.
      Nondiabetic patients (control group, n = 12), patients with type 1 DM (n = 9), and patients
      with type 2 DM (n = 9), all with neuropathic pain and phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of
      CYP2D6, received a single oral dose of 100 mg racemic tramadol. Serial blood samples were
      collected up to 24 h after administration of the drug for pharmacokinetic study and for the
      analysis of noradrenaline in plasma. Pain was rated on a visual analog pain scale at the same
      time as blood sampling. The patients were evaluated for in vivo CYP3A activity using
      midazolam as a probe drug and genotyped for CYP2B6. Total and unbound plasma concentrations
      of the tramadol, M1 and M2 enantiomers were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
