  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a novel neoadjuvant treatment strategy
      incorporating 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX )chemotherapy in
      combination with chemo-radiation with gemcitabine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate frequency of achieving complete resection ( RO resection
      )in patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer treated with a
      neoadjuvant regimen of FOLFOX followed by radiation therapy (RT) concurrent with gemcitabine
      chemotherapy at standard dosing.

      Secondary objectives are to determine overall survival and progression-free survival as a
      function of time from study enrollment and to evaluate tolerability and toxicity of protocol
      treatment.

      Eligible patients with resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer will be accrued
      onto protocol therapy, which would include a neo-adjuvant phase followed by surgical
      resection. A cycle of FOLFOX treatment is 14 days. 2 cycles are intended prior to combined
      modality treatment. Combined modality treatment will begin 2 weeks (plus or minus 2 days)
      after the last FOLFOX administration. (Gemcitabine 1000mg/mÂ² will be infused over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 during the 5-week course of radiation treatment. The surgical
      procedure performed will be that required for a complete resection, and this will be based on
      the discretion of the operating surgeon. Patients will be followed for 1 year after
      completion of neoadjuvant therapy or until removal or termination from study, or until death,
      whichever occurs first. Patients will be seen in follow-up ever 3+/- 1 months for 1 year from
      completion of protocol therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma
             of the pancreatic head or body

          -  Patients must have radiographically-confirmed surgically resectable or borderline
             resectable disease at study entry staged at T1-3, NO-1 and MO

          -  Age &gt;/= 18years

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months in the opinion of the investigator, excluding
             theh pancreatic cancer

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= 1

          -  Required laboratory data (see protocol)

          -  Disease assessment by CT scan within 4 weeks of study entry

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent

          -  Patients with metastatic disease are excluded from this clinical trial

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to Fluorouracil (5FU), oxaliplatin and
             gemcitabine

          -  No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for pancreatic cancer (previous
             chemotherapy or radiation therapy for other malignancies is permitted)

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the
             institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this
             study.

          -  Uncontrolled serious intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             serious active infection requiring IV antibiotics for over 30 days, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia other than
             chronic, stable atrial fibrillation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients with unresectable disease are excluded form the protocol (see Appendix B for
             National Comprehensive cancer Network [NCCN] criteria for determining resectability
             status). Surgical resectability must be confirmed by a surgeon experienced in
             pancreatic surgery.

          -  Patients with pancreatic tail lesions will be excluded
