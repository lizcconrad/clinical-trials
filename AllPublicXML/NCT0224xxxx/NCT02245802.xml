    <textblock>
      This study aimed to validate CU prediction model on mortality for patients with high risk
      bleeding peptic ulcers after therapeutic endoscopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, mortality is still
      10%. We previously reported a prediction score for ulcer bleeding related mortality developed
      from a local cohort. The risk factors for mortality included patients older than 70, presence
      of co-morbidity, more than one listed co-morbidity, hematemesis, SBP &lt; 100 mmHg, in-hospital
      bleeding, rebleeding, and need for surgery.

      Study objective This study aimed to validate the prediction of mortality among patients with
      bleeding peptic ulcers from different Asian countries.

      Method Consecutive patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who presented to the study centers in
      Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan were recruited after successful primary endoscopic hemostasis.
      The baseline demographics, ulcer characteristics, the predictive factors, 30 days mortality,
      rebleeding, hospital stay and need of surgery were recorded. The accuracy of prediction for
      adverse events including mortality and rebleeding with the prediction risk scoring system
      would be analysed.

    <description>The CU prediction score would be calculated from addition of all the risk factors scores. . The calculated predictive score collected from the whole group of patients would be analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and represented using the area under curve (AUC). An AUC of 0.5 would be interpreted as poor predictive power whereas a value of 1.0 would indicate excellent predictive power.</description>
