      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of everolimus when given
      together with bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with cancer of the blood
      (hematologic cancer) that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or did not
      get better with a particular treatment (refractory). Everolimus may prevent cancer cells from
      growing by blocking a protein that is needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving everolimus together with bendamustine hydrochloride may be a better
      treatment for hematologic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus when administered in
      combination with bendamustine (bendamustine hydrochloride) in defined hematologic
      malignancies.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of administering everolimus in combination with
      bendamustine chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of everolimus when administered in combination with bendamustine
      in adult patients with relapsed/refractory hematological malignancies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus.

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      2 and everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <measure>MTD of everolimus, defined as the dose that produces dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in =&lt; 1/6 patients, determined by incidence of DLT graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicities observed at each dose level will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by NCI CTCAE version 4.0) and nadir or maximum values for the laboratory measures, time of onset (i.e. course number), duration, and reversibility or outcome. Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities and side effects by dose and by course.</description>
