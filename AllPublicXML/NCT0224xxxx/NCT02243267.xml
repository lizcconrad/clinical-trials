    <textblock>
      The investigators are creating a data and specimen repository to study causes , early
      detection, prevention and treatment of colon and rectal cancer. The investigators are
      collecting data and specimens (blood, stool, urine and tissue) from people who have colon or
      rectal cancer, or who are risk for developing colorectal cancer or had normal colonoscopies.
      Data and samples are held in the repository until there are enough to be used for a large
      study or until there are new techniques that can be used to test them. The GI SPORE Program
      at the University of Michigan maintains a repository of specimens for colorectal diseases
      that the investigators hope will help fuel new research. The investigators hope that this
      work may lead to new treatments or earlier detection of colorectal cancer or improved
      diagnosis and treatment of other colon and rectal diseases.
