      The primary purpose of the study is to compare efficiency of a non-stick gel application
      after scraping surgery for natural miscarriage with no non-stick gel application after
      scraping surgery.

      Post-scraping uterine synechiae rate will be established at the diagnostical hysteroscopy 6-8
      weeks after surgery.

      Women patients coming for natural miscarriage will be compared according to whether a
      non-stick gel will be applicated or not after scraping surgery.

      6-8 weeks after this surgery uterine synechiae rate will be established at a diagnostical
      hysteroscopy. Proofreading of this exam will be made by 2 experts at the end of the study
      without knowing the randomization arm.

      Long-term follow-up of the patients will be performed to evaluate the effect of the non-stick
      gel application on post-surgical fertility at 6, 12, and 24 months after scraping surgery
      using questionnaire asked by post, mail or phone.
