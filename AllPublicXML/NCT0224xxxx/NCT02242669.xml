    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to evaluate peer-led mutual help organizations (MHOs) that target
      individuals with psychiatric diagnoses such as mood disorders, and provide evidence either
      supporting the expansion of such groups and the development and testing of clinical
      procedures, or point toward reevaluation and development of alternative low-cost, community
      based approaches to promoting recovery among individuals suffering from these disorders.

      Participants will include up to 200 participants from The Depression and Bipolar Support
      Alliance (DBSA) for Aim 1. Aim 1 will measure characteristics of current DBSA members through
      cross-sectional surveys of demographics, clinical use history, and involvement in DBSA. 60
      new DBSA members who began attending in the past month will be enrolled for Aim 2. Aim 3 will
      consist of 100 matched controls of people who have never attended a DBSA meeting. Assessments
      will be completed at McLean Hospital, in which a study staff member will thoroughly explain
      the study to participants. If participants are eligible for Aim 2, study staff will receive
      written consent from the participant.

        We will recruit participants from a large DBSA chapter at McLean Hospital. Subjects will be
        recruited at the beginning of the weekly meetings, through flyers, the DBSA website, and
        word of mouth. 200 current DBSA members and 60 new DBSA members will be assessed for Aims 1
        and 2, respectively. 100 people who have never attended a DBSA will be assessed for Aim 3
        and will be recruited from MGH and McLean Hospitals through the use of flyers, clinic
        announcements, and via our online clinical and research infrastructures. Participants in
        all Aims must be 18 years or older and self-report a diagnosis of any type of mood
        disorder. For Aims 1 and 2, participants must have attended at least one DBSA meeting.
