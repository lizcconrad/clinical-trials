    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must sign an informed consent consistent with international conference of
             harmonization (ICH)-good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines prior to participation in
             the trial, which includes medication washout and restrictions

          -  All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and must
             meet the following spirometric criteria:

               -  Patients must have relatively stable* moderate to severe airway obstruction with
                  an FEV1 ≤ 60% of predicted normal and FEV1 ≤ 70% of FVC (Visit 1)

                  * Patients who have frequent exacerbations (at least three in the preceding year)
                  which could be expected to interfere with the patient's ability to participate in
                  the trial should be excluded. The enrollment of patients who have had an
                  exacerbation within the six-week period prior to planned study entry should be
                  postponed for at least six weeks

               -  Predicted normal values will be calculated according to european community for
                  coal and steel (ECCS):

               -  Males: FEV1 predicted (L) = 4.30 x Height (metres) - 0.029 x Age (years) - 2.49

               -  Females: FEV1 predicted (L) = 3.95 x Height (metres) - 0.025 x Age (years) - 2.60

          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older

          -  Patients must be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of more than 10
             pack-years

               -  patients who have never smoked cigarettes must be excluded

          -  Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and
             must be able to maintain records (Patient Daily Record) during the study period as
             required in the protocol

          -  Patients must be able to inhale medication from inhalation capsule delivery systems
             (the HandiHaler® for the tiotropium and placebo capsules and the Aerolizer® for the
             formoterol capsule) and from a metered dose inhaler

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study

          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry, or
             urinalysis if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion

          -  All patients with a serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) &gt; 80 IU/L, serum
             glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) &gt; 80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt; 17 µmol/L or creatinine
             &gt; 110 µmol/L (males) / 95 µmol/L (females) will be excluded regardless of clinical
             condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will not be conducted in these patients

          -  Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion 1

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception for the previous 3 months (i.e. oral contraceptives,
             intrauterine devices, diaphragm or subdermal implants e.g., Norplant®)

          -  Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a total
             blood eosinophil count ≥ 600 mm3. A repeat eosinophil count will not be conducted in

          -  Patients with significant alcohol or drug abuse within the past two years

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives
             (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Visit (Visit 1)

          -  Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program or who have completed
