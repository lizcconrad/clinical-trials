             psychiatric problems via a personal interview, a medical questionnaire, a physical
             examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and routine medical blood and urinalysis
             laboratory tests

          -  During the next year there is no foreseen likelihood for a major potentially
             life-altering event for her or himself or a close family member (e.g. retirement or

             unit on the mornings of psilocybin session days. If the participant does not routinely
             consume caffeinated beverages, he/she must agree not to do so on session days.

          -  Agree to refrain from using any psychoactive drugs, including alcoholic beverages and
             nicotine, 24 hours before and after each drug administration. The exception is

             investigators and will include acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
             and common doses of vitamins and minerals.

        General medical exclusion criteria:

             control.

          -  Cardiovascular conditions: coronary artery disease, stroke, angina, uncontrolled
             hypertension, a clinically significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality (e.g.,

             centrally-acting pharmacological effect on serotonin neurons or medications that are
             Mono amine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. For individuals who have intermittent or PRN use
             of such medications, psilocybin sessions will not be conducted until at least 5
             half-lives of the agent have elapsed after the last dose.

          -  More than 20% outside the upper or lower range of ideal body weight according to
             Metropolitan Life height and weight table
