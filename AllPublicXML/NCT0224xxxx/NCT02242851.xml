  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective: to characterize hypertensive patients treated for at least 1 month with
      Telmisartan (alone or in combination with other drugs) in order to define the beneficiary
      population (those actually receiving the treatment).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  to describe the patients' blood pressure values (when self-monitored) and satisfaction
           with the treatment (ease of use, efficacy, safety) on the basis of a patient
           self-questionnaire, filled out 4 weeks after consultation.

        -  to compare the characteristics of the beneficiary population to those of the initial
           target population defined in the SPC (summary of product characteristics) for
           Telmisartan
