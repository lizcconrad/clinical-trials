    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the physiology and immunology of new-onset post-transplant
      diabetes mellitus in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Oral glucose
      tolerance testing (OGTT), euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps, and immune assays will be used
      to define the mechanisms associated with abnormal glucose homeostasis following stem cell
      transplantation. Information from this clinical trial could be used to develop standardized
      screening procedures or to develop optimal treatment strategies for patients developing
      post-transplant diabetes mellitus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether pre-transplant insulin resistance predicts for the development of new
      onset post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) in individuals without diabetes undergoing
      matched related donor (MRD) hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT).

      II. To define the role of circulating tissue-specific Th1 cells in the development of PTDM.

      III. To characterize the phenotype and function of circulating tissue-specific regulatory T
      cells (Tregs) in HCT recipients with or without PTDM.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo OGTT and a standard 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure prior
      to HCT. Patients then undergo repeat OGTT and a 2-step euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp
      procedure once after HCT between days 90-100.

    <measure>Pre-transplant peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal as defined by the peripheral insulin sensitivity index among patients who do or do not go on to develop PTDM</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 21 days pre-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be followed for 100 days after transplant for development of diabetes. Wilcoxon rank sum test will be applied to compare the population mean difference between these two groups. Multivariable logistic regression will evaluate whether the peripheral insulin sensitivity index is an independent predictor of PTDM after adjusting for the following covariates: fasting C-peptide level, conditioning (ablative vs. reduced intensity), or acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring steroids. The estimated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval of the OR will be provided to measure the effect of the association.</description>
