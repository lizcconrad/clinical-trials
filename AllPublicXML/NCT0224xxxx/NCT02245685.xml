  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of the french priorities of the 2007-2011 addiction plan. Priority #2 of
      the plan underlines the need to improve practices and access to opioid substitution
      treatment. Priority 3 stresses the importance of articulation and coordination between
      specialized structures and community medicine to optimize the quality of care and to ensure
      continuity in the followup of these patients. This study focuses on the followup of patients
      under substitution therapy from the moment they enter a specialized care center for addicts
      to the period they are monitored by a general practitioner outside the specialized care
      center. The assessment described in this study should allow to harmonize and keep a
      continuity in patient monitoring.
