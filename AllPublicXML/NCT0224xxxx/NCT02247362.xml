  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One dose of escalating strengths of an investigational influenza vaccine, VAX2012Q
      (Quadrivalent Recombinant Hemagglutinin Seasonal Influenza Vaccine), will be evaluated for
      safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults 65 to 75 years of age in this placebo-controlled
      study.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a stepwise fashion, dose levels for an
      investigational quadrivalent influenza vaccine containing 2 influenza A strains and 2
      influenza B strains. This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      dose escalating study in which up to 200 healthy adults age 65-75 years will be administered
      a single dose of either placebo or an investigational influenza vaccine (VAX2012Q,
      Quadrivalent Recombinant Hemagglutinin Seasonal Influenza Vaccine) at one of up to 3 dose
      levels. Fifty or up to 75 subjects will be enrolled in each dose level. Data for safety and
      immunogenicity will be collected for all dose levels.
