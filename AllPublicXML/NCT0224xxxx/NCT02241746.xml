      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to diagnose malnutrition in Chinese hospitalized patients with four nutritional
           screening tools: mini-nutritional assessment - short form, subjective global assessment,
           malnutrition universal screening tool and nutritional risk screening 2002.

        -  to optimize the usage of nutritional screening tools based on data-mining methods.

    <description>The measure of prevalence of malnutrition on admission is a composite outcome measure. In our study, we used four nutritional screening tools: MUST(malnutrition universal screening tool), SGA(subjective global assessment), MNA-SF(mini-nutritional assessment-short form) and NRS2002(nutritional risk screening 2002) to assess the malnutrition risk among Chinese hospitalized patients.</description>
