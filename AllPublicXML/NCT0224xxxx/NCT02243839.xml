  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic heart valve thrombosis is a serious complication with high mortality and morbidity
      The best treatment of PVT is controversial, although surgery and thrombolysis options have
      been available. In this randomized and multicenter study, the investigators compared
      thrombolytic therapy versus surgery for the treatment of patients with obstructive prosthetic
      valve thrombosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two different randomization group have been defined and patients with obstructive prosthetic
      valve thrombosis are included in each group randomly. In the first arm, thrombolytic therapy
      (TT) is performed to the patients with obstructive prosthetic valve thrombosis. The TT
      regimen depends on the functional status of the patient. In patients with NYHA class III-IV
      dyspnea low dose, relatively faster TT regimen (25 mg tPA/6 hours) is performed. In patients
      with NYHA class I-II dyspnea TT with low dose and ultra slow infusion of tPA (25 mg tPA/25
      hours) is performed. During TT, patients are followed up with transesophageal
      echocardiography in every 24 hours. In the second arm, redo valve surgery is performed for
      obstructive valve thrombosis. This multicenter study is conducted in Cardiology and
      Cardiovascular Surgery Departments of Kosuyolu Kartal Heart Training and Research Hospital,
      Istanbul, Turkey, Siyami Ersek Heart Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, Ankara
      Heart Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, İzmir Atatürk Heart Training and
      Research Hospital, İzmir, Turkey, Erzurum Atatürk University Faculty of Medicine, Erzurum,
      Turkey, Diyarbakır Dicle University Faculty of Medicine, Diyarbakır, Turkey and Kars Kafkas
      University Faculty of Medicine, Kars, Turkey. Informed consent is taken from all patients.
