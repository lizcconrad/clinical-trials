        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent signed and dated prior to participation into the study

          -  Males and females aged 18 - 65 years. Female patients of child bearing potential
             cannot participate in this study. Female patients are eligible to participate only if
             they are surgically sterilized or two years post menopausal. Women entering into this
             trial will have a pregnancy test before and after participation in the trial. Testing
             will be done during visit 1 and visit 5

          -  A documented diagnosis of asthma as defined by the American thoracic society i.e.,
             episodic wheezing, chest tightness, cough and/or shortness of breath at least
             partially relieved by bronchodilator medication. No hospital admission in the last
             eight weeks for the treatment of asthma; no requirement for steroid therapy (systemic
             or inhaled) for the previous four weeks, nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate in
             the previous two weeks; asthma therapy stable and limited to intermittent use of
             inhaled Î²2-agonists or anticholinergics on an as required basis, or occasional use of
             antihistamines. Predicted equations for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
             of Caucasians and African - Americans are those of Morris et. al. and Glindmeyer et.
             al. At visit 2, 3, and 5, immediately prior to the induced sputum test, but following
             albuterol administration, a patient's FEV1 must be above 60 % of predicted

          -  The presence of, at least, 25 % of neutrophils in induced sputum during screening
             visit 2 (this requirement refers to the neutrophils percentage exclusive of squamous
             cells)

          -  Ability to produce an adequate induced sputum sample (visit 2) as defined by: Volume &gt;
             1 ml, squamous cells &lt; 80 % and ability to tolerate the procedure for at least 4
             minutes with no bronchoconstriction (a fall in FEV1 &gt; 20 %)

          -  Patients with PC20 methacholine &lt;= 8 mg/ml as determined at visit 1

          -  Non-smokers (patients who have never smoked) or ex-smokers for at least one year with
             a smoking history, no greater than five pack-years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes per
             day for 1 year)

          -  Ability to be trained in the proper use of peak flow meter (Mini Wright peak flow
             meter, Clement Clarke, Inc.) and in performing and recording technically satisfactory
             pulmonary function tests

          -  Willing to attend an outpatient clinic on a regular basis and undergo three induced
             sputum challenges during which they will be confined to the investigational unit for
             up to two hours

          -  Ability to comply with the concomitant therapy restrictions

          -  Patients will be off all prescription drug therapy other than that specifically for
             asthma or hay fever. Over the counter (O.T.C.) drugs must be discontinued for at least
             two weeks prior to participation in the study. If any O.T.C. medication is needed by
             patients throughout the study, the investigator will call the clinical monitor and
             this will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis

          -  Patients will have no evidence of clinically relevant concomitant disease based upon
             complete medical history, full physical examination, chest x-ray (if not done in
             previous 6 months), electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests. These tests
             should indicate that the patient is healthy except for changes related to asthma or
             atopy (e.g., eosinophilia based on a total eosinophil count). Patient may have a
             history of allergic rhinitis or urticaria.

               -  The following laboratory parameters must be within the normal range, or if not,
                  be documented by the investigator as not clinically relevant:

               -  Routine urinalysis, Complete blood cell (CBC) (excluding White blood cell (WBC))

                       aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT/AST), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase /

                       isolated raised bilirubin and diagnosis of &quot; suspected Gilbert's syndrome&quot;
                       will be accepted only after the effect of high carbohydrate meal or
                       bilirubin level has been determined) and alkaline phosphatase with a cut off
