    <textblock>
      The trial enrolls patients with early severe sepsis or septic shock displaying at least one
      newly developed organ dysfunction and showing clinical evidence of pulmonary or abdominal
      infection. The primary goal of the trial is to assess the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of the new monoclonal antibody CaCP29 and to characterize safety and
      tolerability as well as evaluate parameters of efficacy.

        Key Inclusion Criteria at screening:

          1. Male or female patients &gt;= 18 years old

          2. Written informed consent

          3. Occurrence of at least two criteria of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome
             (SIRS) not explained by other reasons. These criteria should be present within 12
             hours prior to screening

             dysfunction must have occurred within 12 hours prior to screening, cannot mainly be
             explained by other disease processes than sepsis and is judged by the investigator as
             being caused or directly related to an abdominal or pulmonary infectious focus:

               2. renal

               3. hematologic

        Inclusion Criteria at randomisation:

          1. At least one of the sepsis related organ dysfunction detected at screening is still

        Exclusion Criteria at randomisation:

          1. Time frame between detection of a non cardiovascular organ dysfunction and start of
             randomization procedure is more than 15 hours

          2. Time frame between detection of a cardiovascular organ dysfunction and start of
             randomization is more than six hours

          3. Organ dysfunctions are unlikely to be persistent for next three hours
