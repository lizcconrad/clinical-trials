      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of adding HIV
      testing and counseling (HTC) services to the family planning (FP) services provided by
      community health workers in Uganda.

      The Uganda Ministry of Health is implementing a Village Health Team strategy whereby lay
      volunteers, called VHTs, provide a government-endorsed platform for all community-based
      health programming. Where trained, VHTs already offered family planning services, including
      injectable contraceptives. In this project, VHTs already providing family planning services
      are trained to offer HIV testing and counseling services (HTC). The goal is to reach
      individuals whose sexual and reproductive health needs may be underserved by clinic-based
      services, while also attempting to mitigate some of the barriers to HTC like access and
      stigma.

      The study uses a two-arm post-test only randomized cluster design, with eight pair-matched
      health centers in two districts randomly assigned to intervention or control arm. VHTs
      supported by health centers in the intervention arm receive classroom training and supervised
      practical experience in HTC. Supervision and commodity supply occur through health centers,
      building on support mechanisms for family planning. External quality assurance is conducted
      quarterly through health centers as part of program implementation. VHTs receive refresher
      training after 8 months. VHTs in the intervention arm provide both family planning and HTC
      services during the study period, and then return to providing family planning only at the
      end of the project. VHTs in the control arm only provide family planning. HTC and/or family
      planning services, as applicable, are available to all adults in the communities served by
      the VHTs.

    <description>VHTs in the intervention arm provide both family planning and HTC services between May 2012 and September 2013, then return to providing family planning only at the end of the project. Services are made available to all adults in VHTs' communities. HIV testing is done using the national rapid testing algorithm. Clients who test positive for HIV are referred to a health center for care and treatment and receive disclosure support and information on peer support groups.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least six months of experience providing family planning services, including
             injectable contraceptives

          -  Attached to one of the eight health centers selected for the study for supervision,
             commodity supply, and referral management

          -  All VHTs in the intervention group are trained in HTC service provision and
             interviewed as part of the evaluation. VHTs in the control group are not interviewed.

        Services (family planning and/or HTC) are made available to all adults in VHTs'
        communities. Data collection involves a client survey. Inclusion criteria for participation
        in the survey are:

          -  Age 18 or more

          -  Female

          -  Revisit family planning clients of VHTs (will have received family planning services
             from the VHT more than once)

          -  Where this service is available, having received HTC from the VHT is not an
             eligibility criterion
