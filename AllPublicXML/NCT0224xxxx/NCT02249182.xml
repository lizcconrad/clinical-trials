  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will have two parts as follows:

      The PK Lead-in Phase of the study will evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      confirm the dose of ledipasvir/sofobuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed dose combination (FDC) in hepatitis
      C virus (HCV)-infected pediatric participants. The PK Lead-in Phase will also evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of 10 days of dosing of LDV/SOF FDC in
      HCV-infected pediatric participants.

      The Treatment Phase will be initiated by age cohort after confirmation of age-appropriate
      LDV/SOF FDC dosage levels. Participants from the PK Lead-in Phase will immediately rollover
      into the Treatment Phase with no interruption of study drug administration. The Treatment
      Phase will evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of LDV/SOF FDC +/-
      Ribavirin (RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks in pediatric participants with HCV.
