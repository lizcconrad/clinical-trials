  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PET tracer Fluoro-ethyl-methyl-amino-naphthyl-ethylidene-malononitrile ([F18]-FDDNP) has
      a specific affinity for lesions containing tau protein and beta-amyloid The study consists of
      two phases

        -  In a first transversal phase, 8 neurologically unimpaired controls, 15 patients with PD
           and no dementia (PDND) and 8 with PD and dementia (PDD) will undergo lumbar puncture for
           study of tau, phospho-tau and beta-amyloid levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well
           as positron emission tomography (PET) with ([F18]-FDDNP. Concentration of CSF markers
           and both the degree and topography of FDDNP-PET uptake will be compared among groups,
           along with correlation analysis between CSF and PET findings.

        -  During the second phase (18 months follow-up), the PDND patients will undergo the same
           procedures, and cognitive changes including incident dementia will be assessed. The
           correlation between cognitive impairment and neurochemical and neuroimaging changes will
           be established to determine the predictive value of these markers.

      Since the pathological lesions observed in Alzheimer disease (AD) are common in the PD and
      the concentrations of tau and beta-amyloid are altered in AD and PET with [F18]-FDDNP is able
      to separate patients with AD and cognitive impairment from controls, we hypothesized that:

        1. - Patients with PD will show a biomarkers profile similar to the AD (decreased levels of
           beta-amyloid and increased phospho-tau and tau) in CSF, and an abnormal uptake of
           [F18]-FDDNP PET compared to PDND patients and controls.

        2. -The distribution of cortical [F18]-FDDNP in the PD will be different from the AD and
           similar to dementia with Lewy bodies, predominantly in posterior cortical areas.

        3. PDND patients will show a [F18]-FDDNP PET uptake and levels of protein markers in CSF
           intermediate between controls and patients with PD.

        4. -In the subsequent follow-up, PDND patients will show cognitive impairment correlate to
           changes in the levels of protein markers in CSF and uptake of PET with [F18]-FDDNP

        5. - The predictive value for the development of dementia in PD of specific patterns of PET
           uptake and CSF proteins profile will be established.
