      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of 2 fixed doses of EVP-6124
      hydrochloride (HCl) compared to placebo for 24 weeks in subjects with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease who are concurrently receiving stable treatment with memantine and
      currently receiving stable treatment or previously treated with an acetylcholinesterase
      inhibitor.
