    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate if in the prevention of postoperative recurrence
      of ileal Crohn's disease immediate initiation of azathioprine postoperatively is superior to
      delayed (6- 12 mths.) introduction of azathioprine upon disease recurrence assessed by
      endoscopic criteria. The primary endpoint, disease recurrence, encompasses symptomatic and
      surgical recurrence as well as severe endoscopic lesions at the final, 2 year, assessment.

    <description>Patients randomized to the endoscopy-driven azathioprine group received no Crohn's disease specific treatment for 26 weeks postoperatively. A first ileocolonoscopy was performed at week 26. In case of endoscopic recurrence (Rutgeerts' score i2 or higher), azathioprine was introduced at a dose of 2.0-2.5 mg/kg until week 102. If not, an ileocolonoscopy was repeated at week 52, and azathioprine started in case of endoscopic recurrence. If no endoscopic recurrence was observed, no Crohn's disease-specific treatment was given until week 102.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Scheduled surgery for Crohn's disease (CD) with ileocolonic resection. Diagnosis of CD
             confirmed at least 4 months prior to surgery based on radiology and/or endoscopy.

          2. Having an increased risk for postoperative relapse for any of the following reasons:
             (1) active inflammatory disease with C-reactive protein level (CRP) elevated above 10
             mg/L, or the use of antibiotics, steroids or biological therapy including infliximab
             for active ileal disease within 2 months before surgery which were administered for
             Crohn's disease and not for another unrelated intercurrent inflammatory or infectious
             disease; (2) perforating disease defined as the presence of entero-enteric or
             enterocutaneous fistulas or perivisceral abscess formation within 2 months before
             surgery. Perianal fistulizing disease will not be considered as an indication of
             perforating disease in the ileum or right-sided colon. (3) Previous ileo-colonic
             resection, (4) active smoking, (5) age below 30.

          3. Males and females 16-75 years old.

          4. Curative surgical resection. All macroscopically inflamed colonic segments (except for
             anorectal involvement) are to be removed at surgery. Stricturoplasties in small bowel
             segments not involving the anastomotic region are allowed.

          5. Patients able to start oral nutrition and oral therapy within 14 days from surgery.

          6. Patients able and willing to give written informed consent

          7. Women of childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test at inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who only had strictureplasties or ileal/colonic resection without a new
             ileo-colonic anastomosis. Patients with ileorectal anastomosis.

          2. Patients with no increased risk of postoperative relapse as defined before.

          3. Patients with a known intolerance to azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine or with known
             homozygous thiopurine methyltransferase-low mutation.

          4. Patients in whom more than 100 cm of small bowel has been previously resected.

          5. Patients with active perianal disease or colorectal stenosis precluding
             ileocolonoscopy

          6. Patients with sepsis or other postoperative complications necessitating use of
             antibiotics for more than 14 days after surgery.

          7. Patients with liver test abnormalities (serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase,
             serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin &gt; 2 ULN),
             leucopenia (&lt;3000 white blood cell count /µL, &lt;1500 neutrophils /µL), thrombopenia
             with &lt; 50.000 platelets/mm3.

          8. Patients with severe renal, pulmonary or cardiac disease.

          9. Pregnant or lactating women.

         10. Ongoing alcohol or substance abuse.

         11. Ongoing or recent (within 6 months) infectious disease (viral hepatitis, tuberculosis,
             AIDS, Herpes zoster related disease).

         12. Known malignancy 5 years from surgery except for superficial epithelioma of the skin
             with curative resection.
