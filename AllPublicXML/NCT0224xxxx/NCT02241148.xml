  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will include patients attending outpatient clinic in the area of
      Orthopedics and Traumatology of our hospital with a diagnosis of unilateral Patellofemoral
      Pain Syndrome. Inclusion criteria are: age between fifteen and thirty-five years, presenting
      unilateral PFPS with six months of evolution, presenting anterior or retro knee pain that
      presents itself when undergoing two or more of the following activities: squatting, running,
      kneeling, jumping, or climbing stairs; physically active patients, with at least thirty
      minutes of physical activity at least three times per week. Exclusion criteria include
      patients with previous knee surgeries, chronic pain with more than one year of evolution,
      pregnancy or suspected pregnancy, application of intra-articular steroids in the three months
      prior to their evaluation, patients with meniscal injuries, ligament or intra-articular knee
      structures, degenerative diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, OA of the knee, hip
      or ankle, history of dislocation or subluxation of patella, Osgood Schlatter syndrome and
      patellar tendinitis or quadriceps.

      The investigators will divide patients into two groups. The control group will receive
      treatment with acetaminophen and physical therapy rehabilitation, closed chain exercises and
      stretches at home intended for the strengthening of quadriceps, abductors and internal
      rotators of the hip for the duration of six weeks. The experimental treatment group will
      receive the above plus the application of the technique NUCAP Medical Upper Knee Spider ®
      Kinesio taping on the affected knee. Both groups will be evaluated by an external
      consultation. They will be assessed by the Tegner Activity Scale, the Kujala score of the
      WOMAC and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment; these scales will be applied at the
      beginning, third and sixth week. The patients in the experimental group will be quoted each
      week to change the tape. The control group will be quoted at the beginning, at three weeks
      and after six weeks. During the first appointment we will take patients anthropometric
      measurements (weight, height, BMI) as well as general information. Radiographic studies
      (anteroposterior and lateral knee, plus the projection Merchant) will be sought to rule out
      other diseases and see the degree of contact of the patella on the patellofemoral joint. All
      patients will receive an explanation about their illness, and a booklet with the required
      exercises as well as their frequency.

      For patients to be included in the group of Spider ® Taping, Kinesio Tape pre-cut strips that
      were placed inferior to the head with no pressure applied, then two bands are placed at the
      ends of the tape and crossed on the edges of the patella and ending at the thigh to finish
      applying moderate tension to place them, then two strips were placed at each end of the edges
      of the first and second tape without applying pressure. The tapes can last up to five days on
      the extremities while maintaining their purpose, patients included in this group will be
      summoned each week to remove the tapes and place new ones.

    <measure>Closed kinect chain excersice with kinesio taping pain relief measured in the Kujala score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,3 weeks, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kujala patellofemoral score is a functional evaluation instrument to evaluate knee problems related to the patellofemoral system.It is a 13-item knee-specific self-report questionnaire.
It documents response to six activities thought to be associated specifically with anterior knee pain syndrome (walking, running, jumping, climbing stairs, squatting, and sitting for prolonged periods with knees bent), as well as symptoms such as limp, inability to weight bear through the affected limb, swelling, abnormal patellar movement, muscle atrophy and limitation of knee flexion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Closed kinect chain excersice with kinesio taping pain relief measured in the Tegner Activity Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner activity scale was designed as a score of activity level to complement other functional scores for patients with ligamentous injuries. The instrument scores a person's activity level between 0 and 10 where 0 is 'on sick leave/disability' and 10 is 'participation in competive sports such as soccer at a national or international elite level</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Closed kinect chain excersice with kinesio taping pain relief measured in WOMAC</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints.
The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68).[2] Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Closed kinect chain excersice with kinesio taping pain relief measured in the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity. For pain intensity, the scale is most commonly anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 10).</description>
