  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new research paradigm that involves sequencing tumor DNA/RNA to identify driver mutations,
      select among the Health Canada approved drugs (for adult cancers) known to block certain
      oncogenic pathways, and recommend these drugs to the treating physician, without taking into
      account the tumor histology.

      In this paradigm, the treatment is targeted to the actionable mutation(s) i.e. those driving
      oncogenesis. It is also personalized to the molecular signature of the patient's tumor,
      irrespective of its histopathological subtype. The experience of the investigators team in
      genomics, including next generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis combined with the
      clinical expertise, bring at last this approach within our technical capacities. In parallel,
      the number of Health Canada-approved drugs (which have been tested in a pediatric setting)
      designed to interfere with oncogenesis pathways is increasing exponentially.
