  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate safety, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity
      of a multi-peptide immunotherapy (BB-MPI-03) at three peptide+adjuvant dose levels. The
      peptides stimulate cytotoxic T-cells targeting oncofetal antigen (OFA). Subjects with AML,
      MM, sMM, or MDS who are off treatment and with stable disease or better, or who are not
      eligible for or refuse allogeneic HSCT are to be enrolled. The study will be conducted at 2
      to 4 study centers in the US.

      The current study is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation study designed to
      evaluate safety, immunogencity, and potential anti-tumor activity of BB-MPI-03 at three
      peptide plus adjuvant dose levels. Subjects with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), multiple
      myeloma (MM), smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are
      off treatment and with stable disease or better or who are not eligible for or refuse
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are to be enrolled. The study will
      be conducted at 2 to 4 study centers in the United States (US).

      The study employs a sequential group, open-label, 3+3 dose- escalation design to determine
      the safety and MTD of BB- MPI-03.

    <measure>Determine the safety, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and optimal biologic dose (OBD) of BB-MPI-03 and adjuvants in subjects with hematologic cancers who are off treatment and with stable disease (SD) or better.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months treatment, 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The safety and tolerability of BB-MPI-03 in Montanide emulsion preceded by sargramostim will be measured by:
The proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), DLTs, and AEs leading to study vaccine discontinuation.
The proportion of subjects requiring a modification of the study treatment dose or schedule.
Change from baseline in absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and platelet counts.
The proportion of subjects with local injection site reactivity.
Proportion of subjects experiencing infections or fevers requiring hospitalization and/or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the in vivo cellular immune response profile of BB-MPI-03 and adjuvants in subjects who receive 5 and 6 intradermal (ID) injections over a 6- month period.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Immunologic responses (change from Baseline) will be assessed by:
DTH reaction to the peptides, as measured and photographed at 7 months using the &quot;ballpoint pen&quot; method.
Peptide-specific T-cell proliferation to ELISPOT and tetramer assay.
Level of OFA expression on tumor cells at Month 7.
Anti-peptide (anti-OFA) antibodies in the serum. These parameters will be measured at D15, D29, M2, M3, M6, M9, and M12 and compared to pre-treatment Baseline. DTH reaction to the peptides and OFA expression will be measured and recorded at 1 month after the last injection (M7).</description>
