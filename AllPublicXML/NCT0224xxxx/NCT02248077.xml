    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate the outcome of complete ulcer closure of patients with
      Wagner Grade 1-4 DFUs, VLUs or Stage II-IV PUs using AutoloGel versus Usual and Customary
      Care (UCC).

    <description>AutoloGel consists of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel produced from the patient's own peripheral blood and pharmaceutical additives including calcium chloride, thrombin and ascorbic acid. The AutoloGel product is obtained by processing the patient's own blood using the AutoloGel System. After the final AutoloGel formulation is produced it is used immediately for patient's specific ulcer care.</description>

          3. Type I or II diabetes requiring medical treatment as determined by the physician

          4. The single wound to be applied Study Treatment (Index Ulcer) is a Wagner 1-4 DFU (see
             Section 17.12 Appendix 12 for Wagner Classification) that is located on the dorsal,
             plantar, medial, or lateral aspect of the foot (including all toe surfaces and the
             heel)

          5. Patients have been treated with UCC at the center for 2 weeks prior to randomization
             with no greater than 20% reduction in wound area or volume and documented wound
             measurements are available

          6. For patients with multiple potential Index DFUs, the largest ulcer will be selected.
             There must be at least 4 cm between the Index Ulcer and other ulcers; if all ulcers
             are closer than 4 cm, the patient should not be enrolled (screen failure)

          7. Demonstrated offloading regimen

          8. A wound age of ≥ 30 days at the Screening Visit

          9. Patient must be willing to comply with the protocol, which will be assessed by
             enrolling clinician.

         10. Patient must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to any study-related procedures.

        For VLU indication:

          1. Medicare beneficiary

          2. Males or females ≥ 18 years of age

          3. Diagnosed venous disease

          4. Patients have been seen at the center/site for 2 weeks prior to randomization with no
             greater than 20% reduction in wound area or volume and documented wound measurements
             are available

          5. The non-healing wound is located between the knee and ankle and may include ankle

          6. For patients with multiple potential Index VLUs, the largest ulcer will be selected.
             There must be at least 4 cm between the Index Ulcer and other ulcers; if all ulcers
             are closer than 4 cm, the patient should not be enrolled (screen failure)

          7. Demonstrated compression regimen

          8. A wound age of ≥ 30 days at the Screening visit

          9. Patient must be willing to comply with the protocol, which will be assessed by
             enrolling clinician

         10. Patient must sign an Informed Consent prior to any study-related procedures.

        For PU indication:

          1. Medicare beneficiary

          2. Males or females ≥ 18 years of age

             stage definitions)

          4. Patients have been seen at the site for 2 weeks prior to randomization with no greater
             than 20% reduction in wound area or volume and documented wound measurements are
             available

          5. The single wound to be applied Study Treatment (Index Ulcer) that is located on the
             heel, ischium, sacrum, coccyx or trochanter

          6. For patients with multiple potential PUs, the largest ulcer will be selected. There
             must be at least 4 cm between the Index Ulcer and other ulcers; if all ulcers are
             closer than 4 cm, the patient should not be enrolled (screen failure)

          7. Demonstrated pressure relief regimen

          8. A wound age of ≥ 30 days at Screening visit

          9. Patient must be willing to comply with the Protocol, which will be assessed by
             enrolling clinician.

          5. Patient has inadequate venous access for repeated blood draw required for AutoloGel
             processing

          6. Patients who are cognitively impaired and do not have a healthcare proxy
