    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>36-item Short-Form Health Survey: SF-36 Health Status Survey is a generic, health-related scale assessing participant's quality of life on 8 domains: physical functioning, social functioning, bodily pain, vitality, mental health, role-physical, role-emotional and general health. Domain scores: general health (range: 5-25); physical functioning (range: 10-30); role-physical (range: 4-8); role-emotional (range: 3-15); social functioning (range: 2-10); bodily pain (range: 2-12); vitality (range: 4-20); mental health (range: 5-25). Each raw scale score was converted to a scale score ranging from 0-100 points, , with higher values representing a better outcome [(Raw score) − min{raw score}] / (max {raw score} − min{raw score}) x 100]. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach including administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline data as covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Version of the European Quality of Life Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument and was completed on five dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) to measure health-related quality of life on a scale from 0-1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the participant. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a three level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These combinations of attributes were converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the Japan population-based algorithm. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using an ANCOVA approach including administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline data as covariate.</description>

        <description>36-item Short-Form Health Survey: SF-36 Health Status Survey is a generic, health-related scale assessing participant’s quality of life on 8 domains: physical functioning, social functioning, bodily pain, vitality, mental health, role-physical, role-emotional and general health. Domain scores: general health (range: 5-25); physical functioning (range: 10-30); role-physical (range: 4-8); role-emotional (range: 3-15); social functioning (range: 2-10); bodily pain (range: 2-12); vitality (range: 4-20); mental health (range: 5-25). Each raw scale score was converted to a scale score ranging from 0-100 points, , with higher values representing a better outcome [(Raw score) − min{raw score}] / (max {raw score} − min{raw score}) x 100]. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach including administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline data as covariate.</description>

        <description>The 24-question WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index assesses osteoarthritis symptoms using pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions) and physical function (17 questions) subscales. The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index version 3.1 was administered according to the study schedule. The WOMAC total score was calculated for each participant at each time point for analysis as the mean total score, range 0 (none) -96 (extreme). Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups and observation points as fixed effects, and baseline data as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Version of the European Quality of Life Instrument</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument and was completed on five dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) to measure health-related quality of life on a scale from 0-1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the participant. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a three level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These combinations of attributes were converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the Japan population-based algorithm. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using an ANCOVA approach including administration groups as fixed effects, and baseline data as covariate.</description>

        <description>BPI-S and BPI-I are self-reported scales measuring severity of pain and interference on function. Severity scores: 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) on each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in past 24 hours, and pain right now. Interference scores: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) on each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference = average of non-missing scores of individual interference items. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups and observation points as fixed effects, and baseline data as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on Weekly Mean of the 24-Hour Average Pain and Worst Pain Score</title>
        <description>24-hour average pain severity scores were recorded daily on an 11-point Likert scale, an ordinal scale, with scores ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The 11-point Likert scale was also used for assessment of average pain and worst pain within 24-hours. Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach including administration groups, observation points, and interaction between the administration groups and observation points as fixed effects, and baseline data as covariates.</description>
