  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the tolerance, safety, pharmakinetics, and possible
      clinical benefit of the good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade amyloid fibril-reactive
      chimeric (Ch) IgG1 mAb 11-1F4 in patients with amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis.

      The phase 1a part will involve at least 3 patients and a maximum of 18 patients. The first
      patient will receive the starting dose of the antibody and, if tolerated, the following
      patients will each receive (if tolerated) progressively higher doses of the antibody.
      Patients in part 1a of the trial will receive only one infusion of the drug. Patients treated
      in the phase 1a part receive lower dosage which might not be effective.

      Once the maximal tolerated dosage is established during the phase 1a part, the investigators
      will accrue patients to the phase 1b part of the trial. Patients will receive 4 infusions,
      once each week for 4 weeks. Patients who were treated in the part 1a of the trial and showed
      no toxicity can be also treated in the part 1b of the trial. The first patient will receive
      the starting dose of the antibody and, if tolerated, the following patients will each receive
      (if tolerated) progressively higher doses of the antibody. When the investigators reach the
      maximum tolerated dose without toxicity, the investigators e will enroll another 4 patients
      to receive the same dose. If there are no toxicities, another 4 patients will be treated at
      the next dose level, and so forth. Patients treated in Phase 1b may receive lower dosages
      which might not be effective. The goal of Phase 1b is to establish the tolerance and possible
      beneficial effects of 11-1F4. If successful, treatment with this antibody would represent a
      novel approach in the care of individuals with AL amyloidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, treatment of patients with amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis is limited to
      reducing production of the amyloid-forming light-chain protein by giving conventional or
      high-dose (with stem cell transplant) anti-plasma cell chemotherapy, as used for patients
      with multiple myeloma. Although this approach has extended survival, the prognosis remains
      poor due to the persistence or progression of the amyloid deposits in vital organs, such as
      the heart or kidney. A different treatment strategy would be to attempt to reduce and/or
      eliminate these deposits. This study evaluates this by administering an anti-amyloid
      monoclonal antibody, 11-1F4. This compound has been shown to reduce/destroy this material in
      an experimental animal model of amyloidosis.

    <description>Administration of Chimeric Fibril-Reactive Monoclonal Anti-body 11-1F4:
Subjects will receive four weekly infusions of the monoclonal anti-body at Dose Level 1 (0.5 mg/m2). If tolerated, the doses in the next patients will be increased to 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and finally, 500 mg/m2. When the highest tolerated dose is reached without toxicity in 2 patients, an additional 4 patients will be enrolled and infused at that dose. Escalation or de-escalation will continue until we have determined the highest dose level at which less than 2 patients experience toxicity. All individuals will be evaluated prior to each course of treatment, as well as at weeks 5, 8, and 12.</description>
