      The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of progression of paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation in patients with coronary artery disease after isolated CABG and CABG combined
      with pulmonary vein isolation.

      Hypothesis of the study - patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery
      disease after CABG in combination with isolation of the pulmonary veins have a better
      outcomes for the progression of AF compared with patients undergoing isolated CABG.

      This is a single blinded prospective randomized study involving 72 patients with paroxysmal
      AF and coronary artery disease. 72 patients are required to have a 80% chance of detecting,
      as significant at the 5% level, an increase in the primary outcome measure by 10% in the CABG
      + pulmonary veins isolation group over isolated CABG group. Patients are divided into two
      groups, group I - isolated CABG (36 patients), and group II - CABG and pulmonary veins
      isolation (36 patients). Randomization is conducted by using accidental sampling before
      operation. The blinding process is applied to a patient, who is informed about received
      coronary artery bypass grafting, but don't know about pulmonary vein isolation. Subcutaneous
      cardiac monitor is implanted to all patients for cardiac rhythm monitoring.
