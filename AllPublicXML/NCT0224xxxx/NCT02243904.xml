      Study for Promotion of Health in Recycling Lead (SPHERL) is a prospective 2-year follow-up
      study of lead workers with exposure levels varying between and within individuals. SPHERL
      addresses to what extent between-subject differences or within-subject changes in lead
      exposure may have a measurable impact on blood pressure, the cardiovascular system, renal
      function, the autonomic nervous system, peripheral nervous conduction velocity, and
      neurocognitive function.

      At the beginning of December 2015, 70 participants were included in the study.

      Background

        -  Whether low-level lead exposure impacts on blood pressure, regulation of the
           cardiovascular system, glomerular or tubular renal function, sympathetic nervous
           modulation, peripheral nervous conduction velocity, and neurocognitive function remains
           uncertain.

      Study Population

        -  SPHERL will enroll 500 lead recycling workers with changing lead exposure, who will be
           examined at baseline (2014-2015) and followed up at annual intervals for 2 years
           (2016-2017).

      Methods

        -  Volunteers eligible for the study are (i) new and existing hires without previous
           occupational lead exposure who will be performing tasks with or without occupational
           lead exposure and (ii) existing hires with occupational lead exposure who will be
           transitioning to job tasks without occupational lead exposure within the next 2 years.

        -  Blood lead concentration will be the main biomarker of exposure.

        -  The main outcome variables are (i) blood pressure measured conventionally and by
           ambulatory monitoring, and analyzed as continuous or categorical variable, both
           cross-sectionally and longitudinally; (ii) indexes of glomerular and tubular renal
           function, (iii) heart rate variability analyzed in the frequency domain as measure of
           autonomous sympathetic modulation, (iv) peripheral nerve conductivity, (v)
           neurocognitive performance, (vi) and quality of life [the EuroQOL five dimensions
           (EQ-5D) questionnaire].

      Expected Outcomes

        -  Assuming a 4-fold or higher surge in the blood lead concentration, the study is powered
           to demonstrate over 2 years an acceleration in the age-related rise of systolic blood
           pressure by 1 to 4 mm Hg or an increase of the coefficient of multiple determination
           (R2) from 0.22 to 0.24 by adding the change in the blood lead concentration to models
           relating changes in blood pressure to three other covariables. The longitudinal design
           of our study complies with the temporality principle of the Bradford-Hill criteria for
           assessing possible causality between outcomes and exposure.
