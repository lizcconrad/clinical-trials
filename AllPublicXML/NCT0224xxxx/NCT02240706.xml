             cytogenetic analyses of the bone marrow and peripheral complete blood count (CBC) and
             who are refractory to or are not amenable or eligible for approved MDS therapy. The

             treatment

             measurements (not influenced by RBC transfusion within 7 days of measurement) and
             having received &lt; 4 units of RBCs within 8 weeks prior to start of treatment OR,

             U/L.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &lt;=2.

                  to be relevant by the Investigator.

                  trial.
