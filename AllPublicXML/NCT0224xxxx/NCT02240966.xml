      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of signs and symptoms of
      hypogonadism in three groups of testicular cancer survivors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that metabolic syndrome is common among testicular cancer. Patients
      with low levels of testosterone appear to be at higher risk of metabolic syndrome.

      A substantial number of testicular cancer survivors might be in a state of &quot;compensated
      hypogonadism&quot; with testosterone levels low in the normal range due to an increased LH-drive
      from the pituitary gland.

      Whether this specific groups of testicular cancer survivors are at increased risk of
      cardio-vascular disease and might benefit from testosterone substitution is yet to be
      clarified.
