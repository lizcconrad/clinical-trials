    <textblock>
      This study will assess if the functional performance and musculoskeletal outcome of
      transfemoral amputees are improved after receiving a Microprocessor Knee (MPK) compared to a
      Non-Microprocessor Knees (NMPK).

      The study design is a reversal design whereby only the prosthetic knee joint will be changed.
      Each subject will be tested using their current NMPK, fit and tested with a MPK, and then
      tested again with their NMPK. MPK prostheses from all manufacturers will be considered
      appropriate for testing. Each MPK to be used in this study is FDA approved. The foot will be
      in the L5981 class, e.g. flex foot or equivalent. The same socket, suspension, and foot will
      be used throughout the study in order to eliminate these confounding variables. All
      prosthesis fittings will be performed by the subject's own certified prosthetist according to
      manufacturers' fitting guidelines.

    <measure>Daily posture and activity measured with triaxial accelerometers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (tested on subjects' current NMPK), 10 weeks (after 10 weeks acclimation time to the study MPK) , 14 weeks (subjects placed back on NMPK and tested after 4 weeks re-acclimation time)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements will be obtained three times using activity monitors attached to waist, and bilaterally to the ankle and thigh for a period of 4 consecutive days, including 2 weekdays and 2 weekend days. Primary outcome will be the difference in activity level between the NMPK and MPK measurements.</description>

    <description>The PEQ addendum (PEQ-A) will be administered to assess balance confidence, concentration, stumbles, and falls. The outcome will be difference in PEQ-A scores between the NPMK and MPK measurements.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient General Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (tested on subjects' current NMPK), 10 weeks (after 10 weeks acclimation time to the study MPK) , 14 weeks (subjects placed back on NMPK and tested after 4 weeks re-acclimation time)</time_frame>
    <description>The general health SF-36v2 questionnaire will be used to quantify general participant health status. The outcome will be difference in SF-36v2 scores between the NPMK and MPK measurements.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (tested on subjects' current NMPK), 10 weeks (after 10 weeks acclimation time to the study MPK) , 14 weeks (subjects placed back on NMPK and tested after 4 weeks re-acclimation time)</time_frame>
    <description>The condition-specific Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ) will be used to quantify patient satisfaction with each prosthesis. The outcome will be difference in PEQ scores between the NPMK and MPK measurements.</description>
