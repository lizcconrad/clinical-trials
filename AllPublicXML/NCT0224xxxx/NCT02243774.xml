  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether receiving a core letter signed by the Surgeon
      General or the Director of the National Vaccine Program that provides only information about
      influenza, or a core letter signed by the Surgeon General with an added basic or enhanced
      implementation prompt, will increase rates of influenza vaccination among Medicare
      beneficiaries when compared to a control group.

    <description>The core letter provides information about influenza and the risks associated with it, incorporating a number of behavioral insights. All four letters evaluated in this study will contain the same tops and bodies that are included in the core letter, but the signature and P.S. tag region will differ among the various intervention groups. In this intervention, the core letter is signed by and includes a picture of the Surgeon General. The letter ends after the signature line and the space beneath the signature line is left blank where a P.S. tag region could be appended.</description>

    <description>The core letter is signed by and includes a picture of the Surgeon General. Below the signature line of the core letter, an implementation intention prompt is provided in the P.S. tag region that invites the recipient to write in the day of week, month, day, and time at which he or she plans to get vaccinated.</description>

    <description>The core letter is signed by and includes a picture of the Surgeon General (SG). Below the signature line of the core letter, an enhanced implementation intention prompt is provided in the P.S. tag region that prompts recipients to &quot;decide now&quot; - by checking one of two boxes - indicating they will or will not get vaccinated. The options use language that highlights the losses incumbent in refusing to vaccinate. In addition, an implementation intention prompt is embedded into the checkbox for indicating a choice to be vaccinated.</description>
