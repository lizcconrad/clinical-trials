          <description>Additional interventions include the following: Radial Arterial Line placement involves introduction of a standard arterial catheter or angiocath into the radial artery. Since the arterial catheter is placed into the artery using a needle, there will be mild to moderate discomfort. The total amount of blood drawn during the procedure is less than 100cc.
Additionally, subjects are asked to perform motions with their hand. Standard motions include tapping and rubbing at aperiodic intervals with amplitudes of 1‐2 cm and 1‐4 Hz with a random variation in frequency. The subject is instructed to tap (or rub) with finger tips to maintain consistency of area of effect on the pressure pad and to prevent resting hand on pressure pad between motions so that only qualified taps are recorded by the pressure pad system. Each plateau will have both an interval of tapping and rubbing.</description>

        <title>SpO2 Accuracy During Motion Conditions - MaxN Sensor</title>
        <description>For each range specified, SpO2 accuracy of the pulse oximeter equipment is stated in terms of the Accuracy Root‐Mean‐Square (ARMS) difference between measured values (SpO2) and reference blood values (SaO2). The MaxN sensor has a different bandage from the MaxA sensor, and therefore a different form and fit.</description>
