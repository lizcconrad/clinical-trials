  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design of the study is post-marketing, observational, multi-centre and open-label. The
      study does not provide treatment; only patients to whom misoprostol 200 µg vaginal delivery
      system (VDS) is prescribed may be included. All directions for medication usage and patient
      monitoring are solely at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with their usual
      practice and must be consistent with the Dutch prescribing information of misoprostol 200 µg
      VDS. No other (invasive) study-related interventions or measurements are done, other than the
      procedures routinely performed during induction of labour. No effort is expected from the
      study subjects. 150 patients from 20 Dutch centres will be included.
