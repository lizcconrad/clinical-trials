    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the trial is to compare telmisartan 80 mg to valsartan 160 mg in lowering
      diastolic blood pressure in patients who missed a dose of their medication, as measured by
      ABPM (change from baseline in mean DBP over 24 hours), and to compare telmisartan 80 mg to
      valsartan 160 mg in lowering DBP during the last six hours of the dosing interval at the end
      of a 6 to 8-week treatment period, as measured by ABPM (change from baseline)
