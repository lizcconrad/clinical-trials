      The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of a selected food product rich in
      polyphenol on cognitive performance and mood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome (MetS) includes a cluster of dysfunctions that identifies subjects at
      risk of developing type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). A key feature appears to
      be chronic increased inflammation and activation of the innate system. Consequently,
      increased low-grade inflammation has been connected to adverse effects on insulin
      sensitivity, glucose- and lipid metabolism, and blood pressure, and circulating markers of
      inflammation such as IL-6. A growing body of evidence also link low-grade inflammation to
      poorer cognitive functioning. Type 2 diabetes, MetS, and glucose intolerance are increasingly
      being associated with impaired cognition.

      Dietary patterns which promote sub-clinical inflammation are increasingly being considered
      predictive of future risk of CVD and type-2 diabetes. Epidemiological data shows that a high
      consumption of vegetables and fruits is associated with a lowered risk of cancer and
      cardiovascular disease, which may be due to the high concentrations of polyphenols or other
      anti-oxidants that are found in such foods.

      In the presently described project it is hypothesized that four weeks daily consumption of a
      product specific high in flavanols can improve metabolic risk variables and cognitive
      functions in healthy subjects.

      The purpose is therefore to investigate effects of flavanols on cognitive functions and
      cardiometabolic risk, and to investigate relations between cardiometabolic risk markers and
      cognitive performance. The test product is a commonly used food product, known to be
      specifically rich in flavanols. The effects of the test product is compared with effects of a
      control product that is based on a similar food product but is lacking flavanols.

      Test parameters:

      Cognitive tests: Working memory tests (an oral test), selection attention test (measure also
      reaction time, a computerized test ), and stroop test (a computerized test.

      Mood is determined for 6 different mood sensations using VAS scales.

      Bio markers in blood: glucose regulation (glucose, insulin), markers of inflammation and
      oxidative stress (IL-6, MDA, oxLDL), blood lipids (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol,
      HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides), vascular function (P-Selectin, PAI-1, NO), gut hormones
      involved in metabolism and satiety (PYY, GLP-1) gut hormon involved in mucosa integrity
      (GLP-2), markers of brain function (BDNF, neurotensin).

      Blood pressure.

    <measure>working memory (WM) capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of the two intervention periods is 4 weeks. At the first and last day in each intervention periods, working memory capacity is determined four times in the postprandial phase up to 3.5h after breakfast.</time_frame>
    <description>The test food product or control is consumed fasting, and after 30 min a standardised breakfast is served. WM tests are performed at 60 min, 120 min, 165 min and 210 min after commencing the intake of test Product. One test takes approximately 8 min to carry out.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>mood assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Each of the two intervention periods is 4 weeks. At the first and last day in each intervention periods, subjects registered mood sensations at fasting and five times in the postprandial phase up to 3,5h after breakfast.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported sensations of mood and feelings of activation was assessed with a modified bipolar variant of the Swedish Core Affect Scales (SCAS) comprising six rating scales of two orthogonal dimensions of core affect: valence (unpleasantness-pleasantness) and activation (quietness-excitement).
Mood scales are filled out at fasting, prior to the standardised breakfast served after 30 min and directly after cognitive tests started at 60 min, 120 min, 165 min and 210 min after commencing the intake of test product.</description>
