  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design of this study is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Parachute percutaneous left ventricle partitioning
      system. The purpose of this trial is to use the Parachute percutaneous left ventricular
      partitioning system to isolate the malfunctioning portion of the left ventricle in patients
      with symptoms of heart failure due to ischemic heart disease and provide the data required to
      gain Chinese regulatory approval.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CardioKinetix has developed a catheter-based treatment method that can be used for treating
      patients with heart failure due to ischemic heart disease (left ventricle enlargement after
      anterior wall myocardial infarction). This implant device, called the &quot;Parachute,&quot; is a
      partitioning membrane placed inside the apex of an enlarged ventricle with motion
      abnormalities. The Parachute implant device can then isolate the dysfunctional apex region in
      the ventricle, reduce ventricular volume, and improve left ventricular diastolic compliance.

      Patients approved for enrollment after screening by cardiac CT or MRI will be implanted with
      a Parachute implant device (the study device). Patients will receive all appropriate medical
      therapy (AAMT) approved by their physician.

      The patient cohort will include patients with heart failure who have wall motion
      abnormalities due to previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%
      and ≥15%, and NYHA class II - IV（non-hospitalized). A maximum of 30 patients will be enrolled
      at seven centers. Patients who have passed screening with transthoracic echocardiography
      (TTE) and cardiac CT or MRI will be enrolled in the trial.

      After confirming that a patient meets the enrollment qualifications with cardiac CT or MRI
      evaluation, the patient will be enrolled in the trial and will be implanted with a Parachute
      device and treated with warfarin/aspirin anticoagulation therapy.

      In the follow-up periods 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery, clinical evaluation,
      TTE testing, functional assessment, 6-minute walk test, and evaluation of adverse events will
      be done.

    <description>Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) are defined as death from any cause, myocardial infarction, need for elective or urgent cardiac or thoracic aortic surgery or need for use of device or device surgery with a catheter as the basis of interventional therapy, or total renal failure requiring dialysis. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to evaluate event-free survival after Parachute implantation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in NYHA Class</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will undergo NYHA class evaluation at each time point. At the 3-month follow-up visit, the percentage of patients who have improvement in NYHA class (an improvement of at least 1 in comparison with NYHA class at baseline) will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in 6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in the distance of the 6-minute walk will be measured by comparing the distance walked at the 3-month follow-up visit with the baseline distance walked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in EQ5D score by comparing EQ5D score at the 3-month follow-up visit with the EQ5D score at baseline will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Procedural Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Technical success: Success in releasing the Parachute implant or successful completion of surgery.
Combined success：The release of all devices with no serious adverse events, additional intervention surgeries, embolisms, technical failures (displacement, loss, etc.) or other problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Long-term Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be invited to continue participating in an extended observation study at 6 and 12 months. Patients who agree to participate 6 months and 12 months after surgery will receive the same evaluations as described in the 3-month follow-up visit.
Descriptive reports of safety will be made using all the information gathered through the core research and the additional information from the extended observation period.</description>
