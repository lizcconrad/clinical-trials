    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy (ML0N128) as a possible treatment for
      anaplastic thyroid cancer.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved MLN0128 as a
      treatment for any disease.

      MLN0128 prevents tumor cells from dividing and growing by selectively and potently inhibiting
      a chemical, mTOR kinase, which regulates cell growth and survival. Patients with anaplastic
      thyroid cancer have been observed to sometimes carry genetic alterations in their tumor cells
      which may make the cancer more sensitive to inhibition by MLN0128.

      In this research study,the investigators are investigating usefulness of MLN0128 in
      metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer cases.

      Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive ML0N128.
      The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each treatment cycle. After the
      screening procedures confirm participation in the research study.

      - MLN0128 - Fixed doses daily per treatment cycle

      The treatment cycles will continue until the participants disease gets worse or is taken off
      treatment for any other reason.Once treatment has been discontinued the investigators will
      check on the participants health status by phone for the rest of their life.

The participant will be requested to maintain a medication diary of medication. The medication diary will be returned to clinic staff at the end of each cycle.
