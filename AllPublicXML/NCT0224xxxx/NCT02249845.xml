      The assessment of clinical dehydration scales diagnostic accuracy (CDS scale, WHO scale,
      Gorelick scale) among small children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eligible patient admitted to the hospital with acute diarrhea, after given written
      consent for participation in the study by the child's parents, will be clinically assessed.
      Dehydration syndromes noted by physician will be recorded in special form (in attachment).
      Than, the child will be weighted on a standard scale.

      The next body mass evaluation will take place, when patient's clinical condition will by
      classified as good by the attending physician and the child will be at least 24 hours after
      finishing intravenous or probe rehydration therapy.
