      Objectives: To study the immediate effect and the persistent effect of Lycium barbarum (LB)
      treatment on retinal functions, especially the cone function, and retinal structure in
      patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) Design: Randomised controlled double-masked trial

      Setting: Primary Care clinical trial

      Participants: 120 RP subjects will be recruited from Ophthalmology department at The
      University of Hong Kong and the Retina Hong Kong. Interventions: Subjects will be randomly
      allocated to LB (treated with LB granules) or control (treated with placebo) groups for 1
      year. After the 1st year, both groups will stop the treatment and all subjects will also have
      the same eye exam in 6-month period for the 2nd year.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome is the total sensitivity scores of 30-2 &amp; 60-4
      programmes of Humphrey Visual Field Analysis (HVFA). The secondary outcomes are the b-wave
      amplitudes of Full-field Electroretinogram (ffERG) responses, the amplitudes of direct
      component and induced component of Multifocal Electroretinogram (mfERG), and the ETDRS visual
      acuity.

      Results: Lycium barbarum treatment provides the immediate effect and the persistent effect on
      retinal functions and structure in patients with retinitis pigmentosa to improve the cone
      activity. It does not cause any harmful effect to the subjects.

      Conclusion: Cone rescue is an alternative approach to save the vision for RP patients. The
      result of this study will provide valuable information for the treatment of RP. The
      antioxidative effect of LB is believed to delay or minimize the cone degeneration in RP and
      the intake of LB will be a very economic way in the RP treatment.

    <description>Humphrey Visual Field Analyser will be used to measure the brightness sensitivity across the central visual field at time points of 0, 6, 12 and 18 months. The sensitivity (dB) will be provide to show the effects of interventions. The changes of the treatment group will be compared with the changes of the placebo group to illustrate the treatment effect of Lycium Barbarum</description>
