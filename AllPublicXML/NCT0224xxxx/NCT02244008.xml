  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effect of anteroposterior talus mobilization on
      range of motion, pain, and functional capacity in participants with sub-acute and chronic
      ankle injuries.

      The purpose of this study was to verify the acute effect (one session) and chronic (six
      sessions) and follow-up of the anteroposterior talus mobilization Maitland's grade III on
      range of motion, pain, and functional capacity in participants with sub-acute and chronic
      ankle injuries. Thirty eight volunteers subjects (male and female) participated of this study
      with minimum 18 and maximum 59 years old. The volunteers were allocated in two groups:
      experimental and control. The variables related to range of motion, pain and functional
      capacity were measured by biplane goniometer, Visual Analog Scale and Foot and Ankle Ability
      Measure respectively in four moments: 1- baseline; 2- after the first intervention; 3- after
      the sixth intervention (two weeks); 4- follow-up (one month). The experimental group received
      anteroposterior articular mobilization of the talus and the control group received manual
      contact.

    <description>The experimental group received joint mobilization (anteroposterior mobilization of the talus - Maitland grade III). During the mobilization cyclic movements were applied in an anteroposterior direction from the first tissue resistance barrier until the end of the accessory range of motion without any pain or discomfort. This mobilization maneuver was performed in 30-second duration sets with a 30-second interval between each set. The interventions lasted two weeks with three sessions each, completing six sessions.</description>
