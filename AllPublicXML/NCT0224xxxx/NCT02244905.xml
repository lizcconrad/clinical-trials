    <textblock>
      Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are a significant public health burden. Even with
      existence of recommendations on technical strategies to prevent these infections, there is a
      need for strategies to increase staff engagement within the local organizational and cultural
      context. Positive deviance is one such approach that engages people in improvement efforts.
      Positive Deviance is based on the observation that in every community there are certain
      individuals or groups whose uncommon behaviors and strategies enable them to find better
      solutions to problems than their peers, while having access to the same resources and facing
      similar or worse challenges. In the proposed study, the investigators plan to test the
      effectiveness of using positive deviance based horizontal infection prevention approach to
      achieve overall reduction of HAIs among hospital inpatients. The investigators hypothesized
      that a broad and horizontal approach to reduce opportunities for acquisition of nosocomial
      pathogens using PD will lead to greater reduction of HAI among hospital inpatients compared
      to standard-of-care infection control approach. The investigators objective was to test the
      investigators hypothesis and evaluate whether there is greater decline in rate of HAI in the
      experimental group of wards compared to the control group of wards.

      Objective: To evaluate whether positive deviance (PD) based horizontal infection prevention
      approach will result in a higher rate of decline in incidence density of patients with HAI
      (central line-associated bloodstream infection, healthcare-associated pneumonia,
      catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or Clostridium difficile infection) per 1000
      patient days per month in the intervention wards compared to control wards.

      Design: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted over a period of 24 months. Six
      medical wards were randomized and positive deviance intervention was randomly allocated to
      one of the two groups of three wards each. The baseline, intervention and follow-up periods
      were 6, 9 and 9 months respectively.

      Setting: A public safety-net major teaching hospital in United States.

      Participants: The ward staffs participated in the intervention.

      Intervention: Key components of the intervention were invitation to participate voluntarily,
      open-ended dialogues with staff members to discover barriers and seek solutions to prevent
      HAI, discussion of outcomes, and encouragement to prioritize and implement the solutions
      generated. Staffs of all six wards were asked to voluntarily participate in a modified
      hospital survey of patient safety climate (HSOPSC) and a social network survey at 6, 15, and
      24 months.

      Statistical analysis: Statistical methods used were time series modeling, summary of
      frequencies, Chi-square or Fisher's exact for testing difference in proportions and t-test.

        The intervention was performed on the staff members providing care in the three wards
        belonging to the intervention arm of the study. These staff members were invited to
        participate in the positive deviance intervention on a voluntary and anonymous basis.

        The primary outcome was measured in all the patients who received care in the three
        intervention wards and the three control wards.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Intervention: All staff members employed in the study wards assigned to the
             intervention arm.

               -  All patients admitted to any of the six study wards included in the study over
                  the 24-month study period. Vulnerable patients, such as the elderly, indigent,
                  and ethnic minorities were included.
