  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of oral pH on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oromucosal dose of
      Sativex (four sprays containing 10.8 mg Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 10 mg cannabidiol
      (CBD)) by comparing the PK profile of Sativex in healthy subjects.

      The primary clinical hypothesis is that there will be an effect of oral pH on the PK of
      Sativex when administered as a single oromucosal dose (four sprays).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomised, open-label, three-way crossover study to assess the effects of
      oral pH on the PK of Sativex. Subjects will receive each of the following treatments in a
      random order across three residential treatment visits:

        -  Treatment A (acidic oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with Coca-Cola;

        -  Treatment B (neutral oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with tap water;

        -  Treatment C (alkaline oral pH): Sativex (four sprays) after pre-treatment with an oral
           suspension of magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia).

      The target pH for each treatment will be determined from the results of a pilot study.

      Each dose administration will be separated by at least seven days. Study subjects will
      participate in a total of five study visits.
