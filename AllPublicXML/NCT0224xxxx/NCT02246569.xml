      For patients with emphysema lung volume reduction (ELVR) could be an expedient approach for
      the reduction of distension of the lung. ELVR may be performed using RePneu® Coils. After the
      insertion of the coils distended lung sections shrink so that healthy parts can expand.

      In the present study investigators intend to examine, whether the insertion of the coils
      improves diaphragm function and force of the breathing muscles. Investigators hypothesize
      that reduction of lung volume eliminates or reduces flattening of the diaphragm and relieves
      breathing muscles, respectively respiratory pump, which aims to reduce dyspnea.

      In line with routine explorations it is necessary to clarify whether a patient is suitable
      for the endoscopic lung volume reduction. To address this question lung function diagnostics,
      6-minutes-walk-test, blood withdrawal, CT of the thorax, lung perfusion scintigraphy and
      transthoracic echocardiography have to be performed.

      After confirmation of the suitability for the endoscopic lung volume reduction patients who
      fulfill all other eligibility criteria will be educated about the aim and performance of the
      study by an investigator. After reading the patient information patient may submit his
      informed written consent. After that information on the risks will be given by a treating
      physician.

      Following examination will be performed additional due to the study: determination of the
      strength of breathing muscles, determination of the life quality index via
      St.-George-questionary and determination of the depression score via SF-8-questionary (short
      form-8).

      After that coils will be implanted and a permanent post-operative examination will be
      performed for 24 hours.

      Three, respectively nine month after the implanting follow up exploration will be performed
      on the study patients.
