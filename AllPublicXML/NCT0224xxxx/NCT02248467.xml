    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate, in obese and hypogonadal patients eligible
      for bariatric surgery, the effect of testosterone replacement therapy in improving lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) assessed using the IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score)
      questionnaire, compared to hypogonadal untreated subjects and eugonadal subjects.

      Primary objective:

      - Evaluation in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates for bariatric surgery of the effect
      of testosterone replacement therapy in improving the symptoms of LUTS (assessed using the
      IPSS questionnaire) compared to hypogonadal untreated subjects and eugonadal subjects.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluation of the effect of testosterone in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates
           for bariatric surgery in improving metabolic parameters (glycaemia, oral glucose
           tolerance test, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, arterial
           pressure, BMI, waist circumference) compared to hypogonadal untreated subjects and
           eugonadal subjects

        -  Evaluation of the effect of testosterone in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates
           for bariatric surgery in improving uroflowmetric parameters compared to hypogonadal
           untreated subjects and eugonadal subjects

        -  Evaluation of the effect of testosterone in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates
           for bariatric surgery on the ultrasound characteristics of the prostate
           (macro-calcifications, intraprostatic arterial velocity, volume of the prostate gland).

        -  Evaluation of the effect of testosterone in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates
           for bariatric surgery on pre-adipocytes isolated from visceral adipose tissue samples
           collected during surgical procedures, as compared to hypogonadal untreated subjects and
           eugonadal subjects.

    <description>For each patient the presence of an improvement of LUTS, assessed by IPSS score, will be evaluated by calculating the difference between the scores of the IPSS questionnaire administered at V1 compared to that administered to V0, V2 as compared to V1, or V3 as compared to V2. The mean of this change will be then compared between different groups (eugonadal; untreated hypogonadal; treated hypogonadal)</description>

    <measure>Improvement of sexual function</measure>

    <description>Improvement of sexual function will be assessed by evaluating differences in the score obtained at the IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function), a questionnaire which assesses erectile function by 5 questions with a score from 0 to 5, by giving 5 to the best erectile function. Scores range from 1 to 25, and a cut-off of 21 defines erectile dysfunction (score &lt;21).</description>

    <measure>Improvement of symptoms of hypogonadism</measure>
    <time_frame>1 yr after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of sexual function will be assessed by evaluating differences in the score obtained at the AMS (Aging Male's symptoms). This questionnaire consists of 17 questions which investigate the disturbances of the psychological, somatic and sexual domain; for each question the patient gives a numerical answer ranging from 1 (no symptoms) to 5 (very severe symptoms). The assessment of symptoms is obtained from the numerical sum of 17 responses. The symptoms are classified as: • absent: score 17 to 26; • mild: score 27 to 36; • moderate: score 37 to 49; • severe: score ≥ 50.</description>
