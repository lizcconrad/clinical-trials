  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical trial in which 300 Police Officers who currently work midnight
      shifts in the participating police departments will be recruited to test the effectiveness of
      a new web-based program to address sleep and associated problems related to shift work,
      particularly night shift work. Recruitment letters will be sent to all officers currently
      working midnight shift, with the goal of recruiting 300 officers willing to participate in
      the study. The 300 participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group
      (receiving the web-based program) or the waitlist control group. Participants in the
      experimental group will be given access to the program site (COPing with Shift Work) and the
      mobile application (Sleep Tracker). Following completion of the field test, participants in
      the control condition (as well as all other interested officers) will have access to the
      web-based COPing with Shift Work program.

      All participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire containing multiple
      measures of sleep, dietary practices, physical activity and job performance. Participants
      will be asked to complete the posttest approximately three months following initial access to
      the intervention.

      Primary and secondary outcome measures: The Primary outcome measures are &quot;sleep quality&quot; as
      measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and &quot;sleepiness&quot; as measured by the
      sleepiness subscale of the widely used Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire (KSQ). The
      investigators have adapted the sleep measures to apply to individuals who work nights and may
      sleep during the day.

      Secondary outcome measures include the Nutritional Patterns Scale, a 13-item modification of
      the Block Self-Administered Diet History Questionnaire assessing the nutritional value of the
      respondent's diet; Attitudes Toward a Healthy Diet, a 17-item scale, based on the Health
      Belief Model and developed and validated by Trenkner and associates assessing perceived
      benefits and barriers to eating a healthy diet; the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise
      Questionnaire, a brief 4-item query of usual leisure-time exercise habits; and work
      productivity measured with the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ), developed and validated
      by Lerner and associates.

      It is expected that the program group participants will have significantly better outcomes
      than the control group at three months.

    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Three-Month Follow UP</time_frame>
    <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) will be one of two central outcome measures. The PSQI is a widely used and well validated 19-item self-report instrument that measures sleep disturbance in adults. It includes 7 subscale scores (sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleep medications, and daytime dysfunction), along with a global score ranging from no sleep difficulty to severe sleep difficulties.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Three Month Follow</time_frame>
    <description>A second primary outcome measure will be the Sleepiness subscale of the widely used Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire. In contrast to the PSQI, which focuses on the quality of sleep, this measure focuses specifically on sleepiness during waking hours over the past 3 months. It is a 5-item scale (with a 1-6 response scale, where 1 = no problems and 6 = problems every day), assessing sleepiness at work, sleepiness during leisure time, involuntary dozing off at work, involuntary dozing during leisure time, and the &quot;need to fight sleep to stay awake.&quot;</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caffeine Beverage Consumption at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Three Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the Mayo Clinic Nutrition and Healthy Eating questions, this measure ask how much caffeinated beverage the person consumes per day.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Attitudes Towards a Healthy Diet at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Three Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>This 17-item scale, based on the Health Belief Model and developed and validated by Trenkner and associates, assesses perceived benefits and barriers to eating a healthy diet.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Three Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire is a brief 4-item query of usual leisure-time exercise habits. The first three items ask the respondent to indicate the times per week they engage in strenuous, moderate, and light activities. The fourth item asks how often in a typical 7-day period the respondent engages in activity long enough to work up a sweat.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Eating Patterns at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Three Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Patterns Questionnaire includes 12 items answered using a 4-point Likert scale regarding the situations around eating such as &quot;How often do you eat too much?&quot; &quot;Do you have trouble controlling your eating when your favorite foods are in the house?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fat-Related Diet Habits at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Three Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>The Fat-Related Diet Habits questionnaire was adapted from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center questionnaire for self-administration. The questions relate to how often the person consumes specific types of food.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Work Limitations Questionnaire at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Three Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>Work productivity will be measured with the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ), developed and validated by Lerner and associates. The WLQ contains four separate scales: a 5-item scale assessing difficulty meeting time and scheduling demands, a 6-item scale measuring a person's ability to perform job tasks involving strength, endurance, and flexibility, a 9-item scale assessing difficulty managing cognitive and interpersonal job demands, and a 5-item scale measuring a person's ability to keep up with the quality and quantity job demands.</description>

    <description>COPing with Shift Work is an interactive, web-based program designed specifically for law enforcement officers to assist with the management of health and lifestyle challenges associated with shift work. The program will contain modules on sleep, physical activity, and nutrition in order to improve the health and safety of law enforcement officers and reduce their risk of chronic diseases associated with shift work. These modules will contain interactive assessments and cutting-edge scientific information on sleep, nutrition, and physical activity. Based on user input, officers will receive personalized feedback, tools, and strategies</description>
