  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tries to determine if stopping certain medications that are used to treat dementia
      will cause worsening from the patient and family perspective.

      All of the participants will take pills that look identical, and that may contain active drug
      or an inactive pill (a placebo). Half of the group will receive the same treatment they were
      taking before the study -- this is called the &quot;sham discontinuation&quot; arm. The other half will
      receive a reduced dose of their medication, and then an inactive pill (placebo) -- this is
      called the &quot;real discontinuation&quot; arm.

      Participants will be able to return to their previous dose of medication at any time during
      the study. The percentage of people who return will be measured and compared. Other medical
      events and factors such as behaviors, thinking, and caregiver distress, will be measured and
      compared between the groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no reliable findings from controlled trials about discontinuation of cholinesterase
      inhibitors from a patient and family perspective. It is unknown at what point these
      medications do not have effects, and how they can safely be discontinued.

      The investigators will identify Veterans who have been taking a cholinesterase inhibitor (CI)
      (donepezil or galantamine) for at least one year. After informed consent, the investigators
      will randomize them to Real Taper (half-dose of the CI they had taken for 3 weeks, then
      placebo for 3 weeks), or Sham Taper (continued full dose of the CI they had taken for 6
      weeks). The pills will be blinded by over-encapsulating of the drug or placebo.

      An intake interview will ascertain history and measure behaviors, cognitive symptoms, and
      mood, as well as caregiver burden. Phone calls will assess treatment use and adverse events
      at week 2 and week 4. An exit interview at week 6 will measure the same variables as at
      baseline. Participants will be unblinded at that point so they will know which treatment had
      been used. A follow-up call at 12 weeks will ascertain ongoing treatment and any further
      adverse events.

      At any point in the study, participants and caregivers will be able to return to their
      pre-study dose of medication.

      The primary outcome is the percentage of participants who successfully complete a 6-week
      discontinuation. This will be compared between arms. Other outcomes related to medical events
      (e.g. hospitalizations, falls), symptoms (e.g. cognition, behaviors), and caregiver distress
      will be measured and compared.
