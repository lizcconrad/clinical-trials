  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Families of adolescents struggling with comorbid mental illness and addiction problems
      typically experience considerable emotional, financial and social burdens. Concurrent
      disorders (CDs) within families contribute to added stress and interpersonal conflict, as
      well as disrupt normal routines such as social and occupational activities. Despite the
      difficulties associated with being a family member of youth with CD, current mental health
      and addictions practices neglect to address this population. The overall purpose of this
      project is to assess the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of a Dialectical Behaviour
      Therapy skills (DBT) based training group for families of youth with CDs. The following main
      hypothesis will be examined: Family members of youth with concurrent disorders who
      participate in a 12-week skills group led by therapists and/or peer facilitators will show
      reduced caregiver burden and parenting stress from pre to post treatment.

      This study is designed to assess whether a 12-week skills based intervention is feasible and
      effective in addressing issues experienced by families of youth with concurrent mental health
      and addiction problems. Eligible subjects will be invited to participate in the following
      intervention:

      The intervention is based on a DBT skills training model for families, the Family
      ConnectionsÂ© model. This model was originally developed for families of individuals with
      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and later adapted for this study for CD.The Family
      Connections model is a 12-week (90-minute once-weekly sessions) skills training group
      designed to be led by therapists and/or peer support facilitators. The family groups in this
      study will be facilitated by two family members with experience being part of a family group
      and training and they will work with or without a professional therapist. Groups will consist
      of a maximum of 16 family members. Family members will receive a manual which describes the
      skills to be covered.

      The skills-training will be delivered in two cities in collaboration with two organizations:
      CAMH, Toronto and the Children's Centre Thunder Bay. Participants will be recruited through
      advertisements posted on flyers and relevant websites.

      The family intervention will evaluate change over time and use a mixed between/within
      subject, pre/post and follow-up design. Assessments will occur at baseline, mid-skills
      training (4 weeks), after 12-week skills training (post intervention), and at 12-week post
      intervention follow-up.
