      Chronic foot wounds which is very difficult to treat are common especially in diabetic and
      peripheral arterial or venous insufficiency patients. This research is aim to observe the
      foot wound's recovery with 3% Sodium pentaborate pentahydrate hydrogel.

      Chronic foot wounds which is very difficult to treat are common especially in diabetic and
      peripheral arterial or venous insufficiency patients. For these reason we prepared a hydrogel
      formulations.

      Gel preparation:

      Hydrogel formulations were prepared by dispersing 1%(w/v) carbopol polymer (Carbopol
      Ultrez-21, Lubrizol, USA) in distilled water. Neutralization buffer (1.6g of 1M sodium
      hydroxide solution for 1L polymer-water suspension) was used for the gelation of the polymer.
      Sodium pentaborate pentahydrate (3% w/v), F68 (2% w/v) and F127 (2% w/v) were mixed into the
      blank hydrogel and stored at 4 Â°C until it completely dissolved (approximately 24 h). pH of
      the hydrogel formulation was set to 6.5-7.0 using 1M sodium hydroxide. The hydrogel without
      any active ingredient was used as negative control (vehicle).

      For the first group after wound dressing we applied hydrogel with 3% Sodium pentaborate
      pentahydrate, and for the control group after wound dressing we applied hydrogel without any
      active ingredient everyday for two months. The same doctor observed and took photo of the
      wounds every week in the outpatients clinic.
