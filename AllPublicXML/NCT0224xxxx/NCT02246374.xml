  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is primarily a safety protocol to evaluate the safety of unilateral subthalamotomy using
      Transcranial ExAblate in a staged, escalating dose titration manner; Stage I is
      subtherapeutic; Stage II is full, therapeutic unilateral lesioning.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medication-refractory motor symptoms and medication-induced side effects of advance
      Parkinson's disease can be safely treated with unilateral, staged subthalamotomy as performed
      with ExAblate Neuro Transcranial system. This staged approach of performing a
      subtherapeutic/test lesion first will identify patients who are at risk for involuntary
      movements following subthalamic ablation.

      Data will be collected to establish the basic safety and clinical efficacy of this type of
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate the full clinical efficacy.

    <description>Safety will be evaluated individually for each subject who is treated according to the Stage I procedure criteria to determine if it is safe for them to proceed to the Stage II procedure. A Stage I safety profile will be assessed to understand additional potential risk factors for subthalamotomy.</description>

    <measure>Severity of Device and Procedure Related complications</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of ExAblate Stage II transcranial procedure</time_frame>
    <description>An analysis of safety will be performed on all subjects who proceed to the Stage II procedures in order to generate an initial safety profile for a permanent subthalamic lesion in Stage II. Safety will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of device- and procedure-related complications within each stage of the protocol. All AEs will be reported and categorized by investigators as definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated to the device, subthalamotomy procedure, and/or Parkinson's disease progression.</description>
