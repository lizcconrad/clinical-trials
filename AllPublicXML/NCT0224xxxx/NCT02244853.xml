      The Cardiovascular disease research using Linked Bespoke studies and Electronic Records
      (CALIBER) e-health database was the data resource for this study. CALIBER links patient
      records from four different data sources: Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD), MINAP
      (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project registry) Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES),
      the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

    <description>Participants were followed until their first cardiovascular or complication event after their studyentry and after at least one previous cardiovascular event. Hazard ratios will be presenting associations between heart rate (analysed as quintiles and as continuous per 10bpm) and 8 different cardiovascular diseases (including mortality outcomes, complications such as bleeding events and composite cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease endpoints).</description>
