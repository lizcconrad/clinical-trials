  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sympathetic hyperactivity is a causal or a promoting factor in many diseases, under these
      conditions, some morphology changes due to the hyperactivity occur. Renal nerve is an
      important part in the autonomic nervous system regulation, especially in cardiovascular
      system, the modulation of the renal nerves used as a therapeutic strategy has been researched
      across the world. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and quantify the morphology
      changes in different diseases, make the modulation therapy more selective and effective.

      People eligible for this study will be divided into 4 groups according to the eligibility
      criteria(Resistant Hypertension Group,Essential Hypertension Group, Chronic Heart Failure
      Group and Control Group), about 15 objects for each, totally 60 objects are going to be
      recruited.

      Before the intravascular ultrasound examination, ambulatory blood pressure, ECG, plasma
      catecholamine hormones, renin-angiotension-aldosterone, ect. will be measured. An
      intravascular ultrasound examination will be taken after all of these have been done.
