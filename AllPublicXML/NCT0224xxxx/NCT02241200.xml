    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to determine whether the test product and the reference
      product are bioequivalent based on the pharmacokinetics after administration of ug/kg as a
      single intravenous dose and as a single subcutaneous dose of each of the formulations. The
      study is consisted of randomization, 2 parts, 4 treatments, 2 way cross over.
