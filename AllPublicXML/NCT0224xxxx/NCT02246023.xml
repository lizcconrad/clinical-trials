  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After randomization, the subjects undergo flexible bronchoscopy either with fractionated
      propofol administration or with propofol-TCI. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate,
      oxygen saturation, and oxygen requirement are measured continuously during the procedure and
      thereafter. Cumulative propofol dose, and induction, procedure, and recovery time are noted
      continuously during and after the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In daily clinical praxis, propofol sedation is given manually in repeated doses
      (fractionated) by a specially-trained nurse in attendance of the bronchoscopist. But,
      fractionated propofol administration (FPA) may lead to oversedation and enhanced side effects
      (oxygen desaturation and arterial hypotension), as a stable plasma concentration of propofol
      is not maintainable. In contrast to FPA, continuous infusions of propofol are commonly used
      to induce and maintain long-term sedation in intensive care units and general anesthesia.
      Recently, continuous propofol infusion for sedation in bronchoscopy has been shown comparable
      to FPA in terms of safety and efficacy. Generally, infusion devices can be manually
      controlled (MCI) or target-controlled (TCI). In the latter, the physician sets a target blood
      concentration and the computerized infusion device makes the necessary changes to the
      infusion rate.

      The objective of this study is to compare propofol TCI with FPA in flexible bronchoscopy
      concerning patient safety and sedation quality.

    <description>Flexible bronchoscopy in moderate sedation with TCI propofol perfusor:
Flexible bronchoscopy is started after reaching the initial targeted effect-site concentration (Ce) of 2.5 μg/mL using the Schnider pharmacokinetic model described elsewhere. Thereafter, Ce is adjusted by increments of 0.2 μg/mL depending on the clinical effect, in order to maintain the required level of sedation.

In the study, the Perfusor® Space of B. Braun AG, Melsungen is used exclusively.</description>
