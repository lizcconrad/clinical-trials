      Clinical Research Ethics Committee The Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CEIC) charged with
      assessing the project will be the CEIC of the San Carlos University Hospital.

      1.7. Responsible for Monitoring: MEDITRIALS 1.8. Experimental and control drug • Experimental
      group: Loading dose (LD) of intravenous lysine acetylsalicylate 450 mg and prasugrel 60 mg
      orally.

      • Control group: Loading dose (LD) of aspirin 300 mg orally and prasugrel 60 mg orally. Being
      a crossover study, subjects will receive both treatment arms in the two treatment periods
      with a gap of 15 days (washout period) between the two administrations.

      1.9. Study endpoints Primary endpoint To compare the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA)
      at 30 minutes after administration of prasugrel loading dose in association with intravenous
      lysine acetylsalicylate versus prasugrel plus aspirin.

      Secundary endpoints To compare the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) at 0 (baseline),
      1, 4 and 24 hours after the administration of both treatment groups.

      To compare the inhibition of platelet reactivity (IPR) throughout the time period in both
      treatment groups.

      To evaluate the safety of the treatment administered.

      1.10. Study design The ECCLIPSE study is a phase I, randomized, single center, open,
      two-period crossover trial in each of which subjects receive a single dose of certain drugs
      in each treatment group.

      1.11. Pathology study None. 1.12. Population and sample size The study population will be
      healthy volunteers (total 30 subjects). This is a pharmacodynamic study, with subsequent
      extrapolation of findings to patients with acute coronary syndrome 1.13. Duration of
      treatment In each period of treatment, subjects will received a single dose of drugs
      determined in each treatment arm and the analysis of the parameters under study will be
      processed over the next 24 hours. After the two weeks washout period, subjects will receive
      the other study drug regimen in a single dose and it will take place the analysis within 24
      hours of the parameters studied.

      1.14. Primary variable Inhibition of platelet aggregation measured by light transmission
      aggregometry at 30 minutes.
