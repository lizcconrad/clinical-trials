      The objectives of this Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) are:

        -  Evaluation of the treatment effect of pramipexole on Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
           severity as measured by International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLS) and Clinical
           Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI- I)

        -  Evaluation of the time to reaching maintenance dose of pramipexole

        -  Evaluation of work productivity impairment associated with RLS based on the Work
           Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) questionnaire
