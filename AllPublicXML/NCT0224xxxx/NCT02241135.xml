    <measure>Incidence and severity of serious adverse events (SAEs)/adverse events (AEs) and local tolerability assessment of the vaccination site</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 64 days after the last vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of AEs will be assessed by non-directive questioning of the subject at each visit. Further, AEs volunteered by the subject during or between visits - as subject diary card entries - or detected through observation, physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments during the entire observation period, will be documented. Subjects will be instructed that they must immediately report any AEs, subjective complaints or objective changes in their well-being to the Investigator or the clinic personnel, regardless of the perceived relationship between the event and the test product. The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs in the eCRF that are observed or described by the subject, regardless of their relationship to the trial vaccine or their clinical significance.</description>

    <description>Rabies virus neutralizing titers (VNTs) measured in serum blood samples taken 14 days after the the last vaccination (Visit 8).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of treatment discontinuation due to IMP-related AEs/SAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 64 days after the last vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Number of subjects discontinued from treatment after the first or second vaccination due to vaccination-related reactions or AEs/SAEs.
Period for observation in order to decide on withdrawal of subjects from next vaccination starts with Visit 1 (day 0, first vaccination) and lasts until the day of the third scheduled vaccination (pre-vaccination examination).</description>
