        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have histological evidence of a diagnosis of HCC (except HCC with fibrolamellar or
             mixed histology) not amenable to curative surgery.

             Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. A measurable or evaluable lesion
             showing demonstrable progression after locoregional therapy could be also included.

          -  Have not received sorafenib prior to enrollment.

          -  Have resolution to Grade less than or equal 1 by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 of all clinically
             significant toxic effects of prior locoregional therapy, surgery, chemoembolization,
             systemic chemotherapy.

          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are currently enrolled, or discontinued within 28 days prior to enrollment from, a
             clinical trial involving an investigational product or nonapproved use of a drug or
             device (other than the investigational product used in this study), or concurrently
             enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or
             medically compatible with this study.

          -  Have undergone major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Have undergone hepatic locoregional therapy (including radiation, surgery, hepatic
             arterial embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation,
             percutaneous ethanol injection, or percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy) within
             28 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Have moderate or severe cardiac disease.

               -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment, unstable angina

                  discretion within 28 days prior to enrollment.

               -  Major abnormalities documented by echocardiography with Doppler at investigator's
                  direction within 28 days prior to enrollment.

               -  Have persistently elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or elevated troponin I
                  within 14 days prior to enrollment.

               -  Predisposing conditions that are consistent with development of aneurysms of the
                  ascending aorta or aortic stress.

               -  Have a history of cardiac or aortic surgery.

          -  Have undergone liver transplant.
