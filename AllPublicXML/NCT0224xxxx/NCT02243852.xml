  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit healthy controls (who have normal GH production and growth hormone
      levels) and patients identified as having GHD, who are deemed eligible for GH replacement
      therapy according to NICE guidelines. The patients recruited will have been identified as
      starting on GH by their referring clinicians and a decision made on their replacement therapy
      prior to their potential enrollment in the study. The study, or its research team, will have
      no influence on the decision as to whether a patient will start on GH, or on which of the
      many GH formulations that the patients receives. The proposed study is an observational study
      to determine how GH affects the plasma levels of Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in
      response to treatment; and whether the change in FGF21 mirrors the improvement in body
      composition/fat deposition. FGF21 is a metabolic regulator that acts on multiple tissues to
      coordinate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and regulate energy balance.

      We hypothesize that FGF-21 is expressed and secreted from liver and skeletal muscle in humans
      in response to growth hormone administration and that levels may be reduced in patients with
      GHD compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, we believe that the beneficial effects of
      long-term GH replacement on body composition (reduction in visceral adipose tissue,
      subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver fat), on improvement in lipid profiles and on skeletal
      muscle mitochondrial function involve GH-induced release of FGF21.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growth hormone (GH) is involved in controlling people's general health and an underproduction
      of growth hormone (growth hormone deficiency or GHD) leads to people feeling generally unwell
      and having a lower feeling of well-being and quality of life scores. In addition, the
      investigators, and others, have demonstrated people with GHD have reduced muscle and bone
      strength and a greater storage of fat, particularly in unfavourable sites such as in the
      liver and within the abdomen (visceral fat), rather than beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat).

      Treatment of GHD is achieved by administration of GH replacement therapy, given as a once
      daily subcutaneous injection, which generally reverses these symptoms. Due to its high cost,
      patients are only started on GH replacement depending on the impact that the GHD is having on
      their quality of life. Patients must be severely affected to be eligible for replacement
      therapy. Patients are screened for quality of life using a well validated, disease specific
      questionnaire (AGHDA, Adult Growth hormone deficiency questionnaire) and there are specific
      criteria that govern whether a patient with GHD warrants GH replacement and also whether they
      continue treatment (NICE guideline: Growth hormone deficiency (adults) - human growth hormone
      (TA64)).

      This study will specifically determine whether the mechanism of action by which GH exerts its
      beneficial effects on metabolism (within adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) involves changes
      in serum FGF21 concentrations.

Anthropometric, biochemical including measurement of FGF21 and MR evaluation will be carried out in patients who are to be treated with GH as part of their routine clinical care immediately prior to GH therapy and after six months of replacement treatment. The type of GH and dose of treatment will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Standard doses will be used and patients will remain under the care of the supervising</description>

        All evaluations to determine eligibility into the study and for growth hormone replacement
        are performed as part of routine clinical care. It should be emphasised that no research
        specific screening tests will be performed. Patients deemed eligible for entry into study,
        who decline to participate in the research, will still be commenced on growth hormone in
        line routine clinical care.

        Inclusion criteria: Patients with confirmed GH deficiency who are deemed eligible for GH
        replacement as assessed by the AGHDA QOL questionnaire.

        Exclusion criteria: Claustrophobia or having significant metal work is a contra-indication
        to MRI scanning.

        Withdrawal criteria: Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they discontinue their
        growth hormone replacement therapy for any clinical reason.
