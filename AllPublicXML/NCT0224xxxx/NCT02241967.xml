  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proper control of acute and chronic pain is one of the most important areas in health
      care. Despite the profound advances in neuroscience over the past 20 years, the investigators
      still largely use opiate narcotics, much as was done in the Civil War. Total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed 1. While knee
      pain is often a complaint that precedes TKA, the procedure itself is associated with
      considerable post-operative pain lasting days to weeks. Adequate postoperative pain control
      is an important factor in determining recovery time and hospital length of stay. New
      analgesic strategies are needed that can be used adjunctively to existing strategies with the
      potential to reduce reliance on opioid analgesia. Several novel brain stimulation
      technologies including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) are beginning to demonstrate promise as treatments for a variety
      of pain conditions. Electricity has no metabolite or other residue, and can be delivered with
      minimal discomfort and without problems associated with drug-drug interactions. In two
      independent preliminary pilot studies, the Investigators have shown that tDCS can reduce
      post-operative PCA use by as much as 46% while simultaneously reducing subjective pain
      ratings. The present study aims to determine the effects of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) on post-operative pain, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use, and
      post-surgical complications during the 48-hour post-operative period following total knee
      arthroplasty.

      The proposed study employs a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design to evaluate the
      effects of tDCS on pain among Veterans receiving unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and
      unilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA). Further, this study will examine dose-dependency of
      the tDCS analgesic effects. 120 patients undergoing TKA will be randomly assigned to one of
      four groups: . Group 1 will have 4 sessions of real tDCS, Group 2 - 2 sessions of real tDCS
      (+ 2 sham-sessions), and Group 3 - 1 session of real tDCS (+ 3 sham-sessions). Group 4 is
      &quot;Sham&quot; tDCS, which does not involve any real stimulation. The participants will receive 2
      tDCS treatments on the day of their surgery, and 2 tDCS treatments the day after their
      surgery.
