    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, the EBBA-II trial, is to determine whether a 12 month exercise
      program comprised of strength and endurance training among newly diagnosed breast cancer
      patients undergoing adjuvant therapy, will influence factors associated metabolic profile,
      tumor growth and cardiopulmonary function. Secondary aims are to determine whether the 12
      month exercise program will influence disease-free survival, overall mortality and breast
      cancer specific mortality. Furthermore, the effect on QoL parameters, and dietary factors
      will be assessed and evaluated.

      The EBBA (Energy Balance and Breast cancer Aspects)-II study is a randomized clinical 12
      month physical activity intervention trial, including female breast cancer patients diagnosed
      with histologically verified invasive cancer stage I-II or with ductal carcinoma in situ
      (DCIS) grade 3.

        -  Participants are randomized to either control or intervention group 10 days +/- 2 days
           after surgery. The intervention start 3 weeks after surgery and continue throughout
           adjuvant treatments given (chemotherapy, radiation etc). The intervention group receive
           a detailed training program based on their own Ventilatory maximal oxygen consumption
           (VO2max) at baseline. They meet for supervised training sessions in groups for 60
           minutes x 2/ week during 12 month. In addition, they are informed to exercise at home
           for at least of total 120 minutes weekly aiming to perform a total of 240 minutes
           exercise, weekly. The control group are told to follow standard care regime.

        -  All participants will undergo a series of measurement before surgery, after surgery, 6
           month and after the 12 month exercise intervention trial. Clinical measurements will
           include anthropometric measurements, fasting blood, saliva, fecal and urine samples and
           cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). They will also use heart rate monitors and
           accelerometers and complete questionnaires (food diary/food frequency questionnaires
           (FFQ), quality of life).

        -  All participants will come to clinical examination and fasting blood sampling after 2,
           3, 4, 5 and 10 years follow up.

The exercise program is performed in parallel with standard breast cancer treatment, and take place in supervised exercise groups by experienced physiotherapists. The duration of the intervention exercise program is 12 months, and the participants will attend the exercise groups for training 60 minutes twice a week. Additionally, they will exercise at home for at least 120 minutes a week, aiming to perform a total of 240 minutes of exercise per week</description>
