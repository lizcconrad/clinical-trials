  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic valve thrombosis is a serious complication with high mortality and morbidity.
      However, the best anticoagulant treatment strategies for patients with prosthetic heart valve
      thrombosis have not been fully known. In this study the investigators wanted to identify the
      most effective and safe regimen among different anticoagulant regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three different anticoagulant treatment regimens for patients with prosthetic heart valve
      non-obstructive thrombosis have been described. Patients are included in each group randomly.
      In the first arm only warfarin is given to the patients with a target INR level of 2.5-4. In
      the second arm 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid and a proton pump inhibitor are added to treatment
      in combination with warfarin. In the third arm 300 mg acetylsalicylic acid and a proton pump
      inhibitor are added to treatment in ombination with warfarin. Also there is an observational
      follow-up group of patients who do not have prosthetic heart valve thrombosis. These patients
      also are followed under only warfarin therapy with INR level of 2.5-4 . All patients are
      followed by serial transesophageal echocardiography performed every 6 months. Follow-up
      period is at least 6 months (range 6-60 months). Informed consent is taken from all patients.
