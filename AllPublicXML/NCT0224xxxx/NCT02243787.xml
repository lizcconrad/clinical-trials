  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, ascending
      single-dose, parallel group study to evaluate safety, tolerability, biological activity, and
      systemic exposure of COVA322 (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) / interleukin 17 A (IL-17A)
      antibody fusion protein) in patients with stable chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.
      Patients will receive ascending single-doses of COVA322 or placebo as a constant-rate i.v.
      infusion, followed by 12 weeks of evaluation.
