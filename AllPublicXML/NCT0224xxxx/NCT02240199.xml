  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast tissue and the areas surrounding the breast contain many small to medium-sized nerves.
      During surgery on the breast, these nerves can be inadvertently cut or damaged. Chemotherapy
      and radiotherapy after surgery worsen the injury experienced by these nerves. These nerves
      eventually become abnormal and provide pain signals to the brain well beyond the healing
      period after surgery. Patients with these abnormal nerves suffer from chronic pain in the
      breast area that persists for several years after surgery. Chronic pain is associated with a
      reduced quality of life, daily functioning, psychological distress, and contributes to
      excessive health care expenditures. There is encouraging data suggesting that an infusion of
      Lidocaine during surgery and Pregabalin given around the time of surgery can prevent the
      development of chronic pain after breast cancer surgery. A large randomized controlled trial
      is needed to determine the efficacy of these two interventions on reducing chronic pain after
      breast cancer surgery (e.g. within 3 months of surgery). A pilot trial is first needed to
      determine the feasibility of undertaking such a trial.
