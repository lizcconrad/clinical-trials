      -  To characterize physiological biomarkers of positive response to rDTMS using EEG and
           functional MRI (fMRI) in patients with PD.

        -  To develop a set-up and algorithm for neurophysiological monitoring for PD patients
           using EEG and fMRI in patients treated by rDTMS.

        -  To integrate rDTMS stimulation with monitoring techniques with the ultimate goal of
           providing closed-loop feedback where monitoring informs the stimulation

      PD Patients aged 40 years or older, diagnosed as idiopathic PD according to the UK Brain Bank
      criteria will be treated by an established rDTMS protocol will be monitored before, during
      and after rDTMS using quantitative EEG and brain network analysis and fMRI while performing a
      series of cognitive and motor tasks.
