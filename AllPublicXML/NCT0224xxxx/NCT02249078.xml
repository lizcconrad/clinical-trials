    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      sequential-cohort, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 3 subcutaneous and 1 intravenous dose of
      E6011 in subjects with active Crohn's disease (CD). Thirty-two subjects will be randomized to
      one of 4 dose cohorts (8 per cohort) and will receive E6011 or placebo for 10 weeks. The
      first 3 cohorts will receive E6011 or placebo via subcutaneous injection and the last cohort
      will receive E6011 or placebo by intravenous injection. The ratio of E6011 to placebo within
      each cohort will be 3:1. The study has 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization.
