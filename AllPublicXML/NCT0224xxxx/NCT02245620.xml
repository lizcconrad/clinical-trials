    <textblock>
      This study will be a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling
      40 elderly subjects with previous evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction to evaluate whether
      the administration of MTP-131 will change either hand skeletal muscle energetics or muscle
      performance in age-related skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Are male and female adults aged ≥60 and ≤85 years

          2. Female subjects must be post-menopausal

          3. Have in vivo 31P MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) and OPS (Optical Spectra Scan)
             determined ATPmax (Maximal ATP synthetic rate) &lt; 0.70 mM/sec

          4. Have in vivo 31P MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) and OPS (Optical Spectra Scan)
             determined P/O (Phosphate/Oxygen ratio) &lt; 1.9

          5. Are ambulatory and able to perform activities of daily living without assistance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have significant disease(s) or condition(s) which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may put the subject at risk because of his/her participation in the study or may
             influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability to participate in
             the study.

          2. Have been hospitalized within 3 months prior to screening for major atherosclerotic
             events (e.g. myocardial infarction, target-vessel revascularization, coronary bypass
             surgery or stroke) or other major medical condition (as deemed by the primary
             investigator)

          3. Have any metal implants that cannot be removed from the body that in the opinion of
             the investigator are a contra-indication for undergoing the MRS procedure or any other
             protocol-related procedure)

          4. Have an implanted cardiac pacemaker or other implanted cardiac device

          5. Have chronic, uncontrolled hypertension as judged by the Investigator

          6. Have a BMI of &lt; 16 or &gt; 32 kg/m2

          7. Have a creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation

          8. Subject's right hand has history of mobility impairment, fractures, arthritis, hand
             surgery, muscle disease or other injury that may interfere with any study procedure

               -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
