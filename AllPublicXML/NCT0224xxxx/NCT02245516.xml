      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and effect of KPI-121 0.25%
      ophthalmic suspension and KPI-121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension on intraretinal or subretinal
      fluid secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion or Diabetic Macular Edema.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, single-masked study evaluating the safety and effect of
      topical ocular administration of either KPI-121 0.25% ophthalmic suspension or KPI-121 1.0%
      ophthalmic suspension in subjects with intraretinal or subretinal fluid secondary to Retinal
      Vein Occlusion or Diabetic Macular Edema.
