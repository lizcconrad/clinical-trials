      This study evaluates whether a diet rich in poly-unsaturated fats can compensate for the
      negative effects of high saturated fat meals on metabolic, inflammatory, and coagulation
      responses. Half of the participants will receive a high polyunsaturated fat diet )50%
      carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 35% fat. 21% of total energy will be poly-unsaturated fatty
      acids, 9% mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and 5% saturated fatty acids) for 7 days, while the
      other half will receive a control diet 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein 50%
      carbohydrate, 35% fat, and 15% protein. Only, 7% of total energy will be poly-unsaturated
      fatty acids, 15% of total energy will be mono-unsaturated fatty acids, and 13% of total
      energy will be saturated fatty acids.) for 7 days.

    <textblock>
      Eating more saturated fats has been shown to decrease how many calories an individual burns
      and increase chronic disease risk by increasing inflammation, coagulation (blood clotting)
      potential, blood pressure, and cholesterol. Conversely, eating more poly-unsaturated fats has
      been linked to decreased risk of chronic diseases. The goal of this study is to determine
      whether or not eating a diet containing a lot of poly-unsaturated fats can compensate for the
      damaging effects of eating occasional high-fat meals that are high in saturated fats. Those
      damaging effects we are interested in studying include how much fat and calories a person's
      body burns, and measuring some markers of chronic disease risk in the blood (inflammation
      markers and blood clotting markers).
