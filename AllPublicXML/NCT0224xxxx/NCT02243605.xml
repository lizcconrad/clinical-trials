    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works in treating patients with
      osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma that has grown or returned (come back) after a period of
      improvement. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that
      tumors need to grow.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib-s-malate (cabozantinib) for Ewing
      sarcomas, in terms of 6-month objectives response as per the Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors, Revised (RECIST version [v]1.1).

      II. To evaluate the antitumor activity of cabozantinib for osteosarcoma, in terms of 6-month
      objective response (complete response, partial response) and 6-month non-progression
      (complete response, partial response and stable disease), as per RECIST v1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. 6-month objective response. (Ewing sarcoma only) II. Best overall response (as per the
      revised RECIST v1.1). (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) III. 1- and 2-year progression-free
      survival. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) IV. 1- and 2-year overall survival. (Ewing sarcoma
      and osteosarcoma) V. Cabozantinib safety. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) VI. To assess the
      ability of metabolic tumor response as measured by fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission
      tomography (PET) at the end of one cycle of treatment to predict progression-free survival
      (PFS). (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma) VII. Translational research: to determine and compare
      tumor expression of MET, phosphorylated (phosphor)-MET and circulating levels of HGF, soluble
      MET (sMET), VEGF-A, and soluble VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (sVEGFR2) prior to and following
      administration of cabozantinib. (Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.

                         -  Major surgery within 12 weeks before the first dose of study treatment;
                            complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month
                            before the first dose of study treatment

                         -  Minor surgery (including uncomplicated tooth extractions) within 28
                            days before the first dose of study treatment with complete wound

                            subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior

             two additional electrocardiograms (EKGs) separated by at least 3 minutes should be
             performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =&lt; 500 ms,
             the subject meets eligibility in this regard

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully

             composition to cabozantinib
