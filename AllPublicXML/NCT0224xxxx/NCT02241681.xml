  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) have been used for many years as a good source of lipid to
      decrease potential for fat malabsorption. However, the pharmacokinetics of MCT and of their
      metabolites have not been explored in details.

      This is an exploratory study aiming at determining the plasma level of MCT and their
      metabolites after oral intake of Peptamen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 subjects will be given 250mL of peptamen 1.5 twice, with 4 hours of interval, on a single
      day.

      Plasma kinetics of MCTs and their metabolites will be made over 8 hours from baseline
