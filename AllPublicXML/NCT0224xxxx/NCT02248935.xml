    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the clinical cure rates of pelvic organ prolapse
      from subjects that had a robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy using Alyte Y mesh and Restorelle Y
      smartmesh lightweight mesh.

    <description>To be considered a &quot;clinical cure&quot; subjects must meet all of the following criteria: no re-operation for or non-surgical treatment of pelvic organ prolapse since the index surgery; no symptoms of vaginal bulge as measured by a validated symptom questionnaire; no Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) points greater than 0; POP-Q point C less than or equal to -5; an answer of &quot;satisfied&quot; or &quot;very satisfied&quot; on validated Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire</description>
