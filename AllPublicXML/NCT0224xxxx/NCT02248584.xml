  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementary antioxidant therapy
      on the levels of biomarkers and inflamatory citocines in patients with a previous history of
      non-melanoma skin cancer treated with surgery. This was a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized into two groups, one receiving placebo
      (n=34) and the other receiving supplementary antioxidant therapy (n=26) with vitamin C (50
      mg), vitamin E (60 mg), and zinc (40 mg) for 60 days. Blood samples were obtained from
      patients, and the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers, including 8-isoprostane, nitrite,
      thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and total antioxidant capacity, were measured, as
      well as the inflamatory citocines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF alfa) and it was evaluated at two
      different times: (1) one day before the start of supplementation or placebo administration
      and (2) at 60 days after intervention. Statistical analyses were performed with the SAS
      System for Windows 9.3 program and data were analyzed using ANOVA for repeated measures test.
