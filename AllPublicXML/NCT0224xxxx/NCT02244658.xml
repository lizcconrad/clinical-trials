  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-related myelosuppression usually occurs in AML patients, which induces severe
      thrombocytopenia and haemorrhage, a leading cause of death. This clinical trial aims at
      evaluating efficacy and safety of rhTPO in management of chemotherapy-induced
      thrombocytopenia in acute myelocytic leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomized controlled trial
      of 80 adults with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia from 8 medical centers in China. AML
      patients with PLT count &lt;30×10^9/L during the previous cycle of chemotherapy are randomized
      into two groups that one receives rhTPO at 1.0μg/kg·d subcutaneously for 7~14 consecutive
      days and the other receives no rhTPO or other thrombopoietic factor. Platelet count, bleeding
      and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also
      recorded throughout the study.
