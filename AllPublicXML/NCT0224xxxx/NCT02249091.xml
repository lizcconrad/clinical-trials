  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is currently treated with chemotherapy by combining several
      drugs with different ways of inhibiting the cell growth. In this trial, standard
      chemotherapeutics that have proven their effectiveness for years, Ara-C and Idarubicin, will
      be combined with a new drug called Selinexor.

      Selinexor inhibits the growth of cancer cells by keeping certain proteins in the nucleus
      which control the cell growth.

             leukemia (AML M3)

             transplantation is permitted) as defined as:

          6. Serum biochemical values with the following limits unless considered due to leukemia:
             creatinine ≤2 mg/dl; total bilirubin ≤2x ULN, unless increase is due to hemolysis or
             congenital disorder; transaminases (SGPT or SGOT) ≤2.5x ULN.

          7. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication

          8. Ability to understand and provide signed informed consent;

          9. Cardiac ejection fraction must be &gt;/=50% (by echocardiography).

             the study, including but not limited to:

               1. Presence of CNS leukemia

               2. Unresolved toxicity from previous anti-cancer therapy or incomplete recovery from
                  surgery.

             graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident or transient
             ischemic attack, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or other thromboembolic
             event.

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          9. Clinically significant bleeding within 1 month
