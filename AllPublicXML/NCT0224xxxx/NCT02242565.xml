      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of
      providing a reduced number of ShangRing sizes for adult voluntary medical male circumcision
      (VMMC) within routine service delivery in Lusaka, Zambia.

    <textblock>
      We conducted a randomized controlled trial and enrolled 500 HIV-negative men aged 18-49 years
      at 3 clinics. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 study arms (Standard Sizing arm vs
      Modified Sizing arm) in a 1:1 ratio. All 14 adult ShangRing sizes (40-26 mm inner diameter,
      each varying by 1 mm) were available in the Standard Sizing arm; the Modified Sizing arm used
      every other size (40, 38, 36, 34, 32, 30, 28 mm inner diameter). Each participant was
      scheduled for 2 follow-up visits: the removal visit (day 7 after placement) and the healing
      check visit (day 42 after placement), when they were evaluated for adverse events (AEs),
      pain, and healing.
