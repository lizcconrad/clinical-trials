  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to establish non-inferiority of lung function
      response to tiotropium 10 μg, formulated as inhalation powder in the polyethylene hard
      capsule and delivered via the HandiHaler® 2, compared to tiotropium 18 μg, formulated as
      inhalation powder in the hard gelatine capsule and delivered via the HandiHaler® (Spiriva®)
      following single dose inhalation in patients with COPD. A hard polyethylene (PE) capsule with
      half the strength (tiotropium 5 μg) was included to investigate a dose ordering effect.

      The secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of tiotropium inhalation
      powder hard PE capsule (delivered via HandiHaler® 2) and tiotropium inhalation powder hard
      gelatine capsule (delivered via HandiHaler®) and to compare the safety of the two
      pharmaceutical formulations.

         15. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six
             weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone
