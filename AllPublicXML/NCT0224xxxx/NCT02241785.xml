  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of natalizumab (Tysabri,
      BG00002) in participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) who have failed
      Gilenya or BRACET (Betaseron, Rebif, Avonex, Copaxone, Extavia, Tecfidera) as measured by the
      proportion of participants with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) at Year 1. The
      secondary objectives in this study population are: change in total T1 hypointense and total
      T2 hyperintense lesion volume; proportion of participants with NEDA at Year 2; evaluation of
      the impact of natalizumab on annualized relapse rate (ARR); and change in Multiple Sclerosis
      Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) physical impact score.

    <time_frame>Reset Baseline (Week 8) to Week 56</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with NEDA, defined as follows: no Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression (12-week sustained); no relapses; no gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) lesions; no new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions over 48 weeks after resetting the Baseline at Week 8 to remove contribution of combined unique active (CUA) lesions that occurred prior to Week 8, when natalizumab was not yet active. The EDSS quantifies disability in 8 functional systems. The final EDSS score is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments.</description>

    <description>Proportion of participants with NEDA from Week 8 (Reset Baseline) to Week 104 (with no 12-week confirmed EDSS progression determined at Week 116). NEDA was defined as follows: no EDSS progression (12-week sustained); no relapses; no Gd+ lesions; no new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions over 48 weeks after resetting the Baseline at Week 8 to remove contribution of CUA lesions that occurred prior to Week 8, when natalizumab was not yet active. The EDSS quantifies disability in 8 functional systems.

    <time_frame>From 12 months prior to natalizumab infusion and 12 months post-natalizumab infusion</time_frame>
    <description>An MS relapse was defined as the onset of new or recurrent neurological symptoms lasting at least 24 hours, accompanied by new objective abnormalities on a neurological examination, and not explained solely by non-MS processes such as fever, infection, severe stress, or drug toxicity. 95% confidence interval is based on a Poisson regression model.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) to Reset Baseline (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSIS-29 is a brief self-administered MS-specific instrument measuring physical (20 items) and mental/psychological (9 items) impact of MS. The physical score is generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate worse health.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception from Day -1
             and be willing and able to continue contraception for duration of the study.

          -  Must have documented diagnosis of relapsing MS (McDonald 2010 Criteria [Polman 2011])
             at Screening.

          -  Must have been treated with Gilenya or Betaseron, Rebif, Avonex, Copaxone, Extavia,
             Tecfidera (BRACET) for at least the 12 months prior to Screening with no interruption
             of treatment greater than 1 month. Prior treatment with natalizumab is allowed;
             however, there must be a minimum 1 year since last natalizumab infusion and the
             Screening visit of this study, and if discontinuation of natalizumab in the past was
             not due to intolerance, anti-natalizumab antibodies, or efficacy loss.

          -  Must have had disease activity in the 6 months prior to Screening while on Gilenya or
             BRACET (as defined by at least 1 gadolinium enhancing lesion OR at least 2 new T2
             lesions compared with magnetic resonance imaging done within 12 months of screening OR
             clinical relapse, or Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] progression of 1 point)

          -  Must have an EDSS score from 0 to 5.5 inclusive at Screening.

          -  Must have lymphocyte count that is documented as at or above the lower limit of normal
             (LLN) by the day before the first Tysabri infusion. If lymphocytes have not returned
             to LLN or above the day before the first Tysabri infusion (day 0), the subject has
             screen failed. The subject who screen fails is eligible to undergo Rescreening once;
             if additional Rescreening is considered, please contact the study medical monitor.

          -  History or positive test result at Screening for human immunodeficiency virus.

          -  History or positive test result at Screening for hepatitis C virus antibody or current
             hepatitis B infection (defined as positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and/or
             hepatitis core antibody).

          -  Prior treatment with natalizumab (either commercially or through a clinical study)
             within 1 year of Day -1.

          -  Known active malignancies (subjects with cutaneous basal cell carcinoma that has been
             completely excised prior to study entry remain eligible).

          -  History of severe opportunistic infections (including progressive multifocal
             leukoencephalopathy) or any clinically significant cardiac, endocrinologic,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic,
