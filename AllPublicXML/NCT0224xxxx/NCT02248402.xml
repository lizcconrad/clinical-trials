  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma remains incurable disease in most patients . Cellular immunotherapy using
      dendritic cells is emerging as a useful immunotherapeutic modality to treat multiple myeloma.
      Vax-DC/MM is an potent immunotherapeutic agent generated by dendritic cells loaded with the
      ultraviolet B-irradiated autologous human myeloma cells. The main purpose of this study is to
      examine the safety and efficacy of Vax-DC/MM in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  To create the Vax-DC/MM, myeloma cells will be obtained from the bone marrow of the
           participants, and leukapheresis will be performed to obtain dendritic cells

        -  Not everyone who participants in this study will be receiving the same dose of study
           vaccine. A small group of patients will be enrolled into the study and given a certain
           dose. If they tolerate it, the next group of patients enrolled will received a higher
           dose.

        -  Before the first injection of Vax-DC, low dose cyclophosphamide will be administered to
           stimulate immune response.

        -  Participants will be received a certain dose of Vax-DC weekly four times.
