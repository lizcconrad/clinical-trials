      In the present project we propose a large prospective study in heavy smokers volunteers based
      on plasma miRNA profiling to assess its efficacy as a first line screening test for lung
      cancer detection.

      The study will be articulated in different phases: i) analysis of 1000 plasma samples of
      disease-free smokers already collected in our biological repository in the last two years ii)
      de-novo enrollment of 4000 smoking volunteers, collection of their blood samples and
      inclusion in a program of active surveillance on the basis of their miRNA risk profile iii)
      assessment of miRNA expression profile using a custom made microfluidic card containing the
      24 miRNA previously identified in the diagnostic signatures iii) bioinformatic analyses of
      miRNA ratios in the cohort in order to determine which individuals are in presence or will
      develop lung cancer and in particular the aggressive form of the disease iv) assessment of
      the best diagnostic and treatment algorithm for subjects with suspicious miRNA profiles v)
      functional validation of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets using novel cellular genetically
      engineered models of transformation and patients' tumorgrafts models.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three decades of research have shown that radiological screening of heavy smokers can detect
      resectable early lung cancers with higher frequency but benefit on mortality is still
      debated. The preliminary results of the first two randomized spiral-CT screening trials
      appear conflicting, with one study showing no benefit and the other a limited mortality
      reduction (-7%). In the next 3-4 years the ongoing randomised trials in Europe will provide
      conclusive data on the efficacy of CT-screening for lung cancer. Nonetheless, no major impact
      on mortality is to be expected.

      A possible explanation of these finding is that not all aggressive lung tumors arise from
      identifiable slow-growing precursors, thus suggesting a possible paradigm shift in our
      understanding of the natural history of lung cancer. In this respect the identification of
      biologic and molecular features of indolent and aggressive disease could be useful to define
      clinical predictors of high risk lesions and select suitable cohorts of patients who might
      benefit of current treatments as well as to identify genetic signatures that might represent
      novel therapeutic targets.

      The investigators recently reported that microRNA (miRNA) expression expression profiles in
      tumors and, for the first time, also in normal lung tissue are indicative of aggressive lung
      cancer development and, of remarkable interest, that specific miRNA signatures can be
      identified in plasma samples of patients up to two years before spiral-CT detection of the
      disease, and able to identify the occurrence of early metastatic but spiral-CT invisible lung
      tumors or small spiral-CT detected lesions with aggressive potential.

      In the present project we propose a large prospective study in heavy smokers volunteers based
      on plasma miRNA profiling to assess its efficacy as a first line screening test for lung
      cancer detection.

      The study will be articulated in different phases: i) analysis of 1000 plasma samples of
      disease-free smokers already collected in our biological repository in the last two years ii)
      de-novo enrollment of 4000 smoking volunteers, collection of their blood samples and
      inclusion in a program of active surveillance on the basis of their miRNA risk profile iii)
      assessment of miRNA expression profile using a custom made microfluidic card containing the
      24 miRNA previously identified in the diagnostic signatures iii) bioinformatic analyses of
      miRNA ratios in the cohort in order to determine which individuals are in presence or will
      develop lung cancer and in particular the aggressive form of the disease iv) assessment of
      the best diagnostic and treatment algorithm for subjects with suspicious miRNA profiles v)
      functional validation of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets using novel cellular genetically
      engineered models of transformation and patients' tumorgrafts models.

      Overall, the results of this large prospective study will permit to establish the potential
      of our plasma microRNA assay as a first-line screening test for lung cancer detection in a
      routine clinical practice for high-risk population screening with a low cost, non toxic and
      non invasive procedure. Moreover, the related functional studies foreseen in the project
      could lead to the identification of novel, miRNA targeted, therapeutic approaches for this
      malignancy.

    <description>All subjects undergo baseline LDCT examination, spirometry and miRNA profiling. Individuals with negative miRNA profile repeat the plasma assay at 3 years. Individuals with low-risk miRNA profile repeat the plasma assay and LDCT at 2 years, without additional diagnostic examinations if not required by the screening protocol.
Individuals with high-risk miRNA profile undergo additional diagnostic examinations consisting in PET in case of concurrent suspicious or positive CT, or WB MRI +- needle aspiration biopsy in case of negative CT.</description>
