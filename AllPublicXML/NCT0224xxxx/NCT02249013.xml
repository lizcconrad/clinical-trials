    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open label, single arm clinical trial on safety and efficacy exploring an
      short-course regimen of intra-operative Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for
      patients with advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) undergoing fast-track Cytoreductive
      Surgery (CRS) after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of our protocol under the
      hypothesis that it may improve patient survival with low rates of morbidity and mortality. In
      these settings, CRS will be followed by an short-course regimen of intra-operative HIPEC for
      patients with stage III-IV EOC. Advanced CRS will be performed with standard peritonectomy
      procedures and visceral resections directed towards complete elimination of tumors from the
      abdominopelvic cavity. HIPEC will be performed according to the closed-abdomen technique
      using CDDP (25 mg/L of perfusate/m2, total limit of 240mg) or CDDP plus Doxorubicin (15mg/L)
      for 30 minutes, with an intra-abdominal target temperature of 41-43°C. Perfusate (2L/m2,
      ranging from 4L to 6L) will be circulated using an extracorporeal circulation device
      (Performer HT; RAND, Medolla, Italy) at a flow rate of 700 ml/min. Systemic chemotherapy will
      include the standard combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel as neo-adjuvant plus adjuvant
      regimens. A fast-track recovery strategy has also been applied to improve patient outcomes.
