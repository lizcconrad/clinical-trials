  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 1% of all baby's is born with a heart defect (CHD) and most of them survive. Even
      though outcomes are good, they need lifelong follow-up because of a higher risk for
      cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that patients with CHD are not active enough and
      that a substantial amount of patients is overweight. Hence preventive strategies and
      education should not only focus on the heart problem, but also on a healthy lifestyle
      including physical activity. Recently a new guideline introduced exercise prescription based
      on the absence/presence of certain key elements. However, a number of important questions
      remain that preclude implementation in clinical practice. Therefore a 'Start-to-Sport'
      program for adults with CHD, based on this new guideline, will be investigated. This study is
      a randomized controlled trial that investigates the effects of the program on daily physical
      activity, exercise capacity, quality of life and exercise self-efficacy both in short (12
      weeks) and long (52 weeks) term, along with possible mechanisms for the training effects by
      using a new exercise-testing protocol that looks simultaneously to all body parts that are
      involved during exercise. Ultimately, our findings will result in the implementation of the
      guideline in clinical practice.

    <description>During a 30 minute face-to-face motivational interview with an exercise specialist, the patient will be advised and coached about his exercise prescription, on how to implement it in his own daily life and on how to prevent relapse. Furthermore, the patients will receive instructions on how to monitor their exercise intensity and on recognizing adverse signals. During the following 12 weeks, patients will be asked to exercise 4.5 hours per week within the prescribed exercise intensity range according to the guidelines.</description>
