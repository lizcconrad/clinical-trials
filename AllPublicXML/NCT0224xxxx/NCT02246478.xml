      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic of TAS-205 in
      patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in
      childhood, affecting approximately 1 in every 3500 lives male births. DMD patients suffer
      from a relentless decline in muscle strength that impairs the ability of walking and
      breathing, resulting in their lives with wheelchairs and loss of upper body function. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic of TAS-205 after single
      and multiple doses in DMD patients. It is also evaluated if TAS-205 affects the urinary
      excretion of pharmacodynamic (PD) marker in DMD patients.
