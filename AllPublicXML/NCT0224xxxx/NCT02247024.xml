      Evaluation of pupillary reflex in patients on high-dose opioids. Clinical assessment of pain
      intensity, sedation score, and other side effects of opioids. Measurements of the
      concentration of opioids and their active metabolites in blood.

      Pupil size reflects the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Pupil size
      and reaction are also influenced by drugs, where opioids result in miosis, an effect that is
      not considered to be influenced by opioid tolerance. However, cancer patients on high-dose
      opioids do not always present small pupil size.

      We want to perform a dynamic assessment of pupillary reflex in patients on high-dose opioids.
      In addition to pupil size measurements under standard room light conditions, two pupil size
      reflexes will by assessed: the pupillary light reflex when the pupil is exposed to light, and
      the reflex dilation during a standardized noxious stimulus. On the same time we will assess
      pain intensity, sedation score, and other side effects of opioids while measuring the
      concentration of opioids and their active metabolites in blood. In addition we will register
      all concomitant medication that also might influence pupil size and reaction. Patients on
      more than 60 morphine equivalents pr day will be included.
