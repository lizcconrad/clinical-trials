  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with septic shock may have altered volume of distribution and metabolism of
      antibiotics which are crucial medications for treating infections. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the blood concentrations of Meropenem and Ciprofloxacin, two commonly used
      antibiotics, in patients with septic shock. The hypothesis is that standard dosing may
      produce insufficient levels of antibiotics in patients with septic shock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis may induce changes in renal function, increased capillary leakage and frequently
      blood-flow stasis in the peripheral tissues leading to an increase in the water space and
      diffusion distances. Significant changes have been observed in the distribution volume of
      certain antibiotics in patients with sepsis. The increased volume of distribution of
      water-soluble drugs is caused by a capillary leak syndrome that results in a net movement of
      fluid from the intravascular compartment into tissues. This capillary leak syndrome has been
      well described in patients with sepsis and may result in low trough serum concentrations.
      This, in turn, may result in a slow antibiotic penetration of tissues and a low tissue
      antibiotic concentration. Treatment failure may result if antibiotic choice or doses are
      incorrect and there is a lack of information which describes how to alter drug dosing in
      response to this increased volume of distribution in sepsis. Previous research has shown that
      some intensive care unit (ICU) patients have larger than normal between subject variability
      in drug clearance and volumes that can be attributed to supranormal renal clearances.

      Aims of the present study:

        1. To evaluate present meropenem and ciprofloxacin dosing and achieved plasma
           concentrations in relation to bacterial susceptibility.

        2. To evaluate how to accurately dose meropenem and ciprofloxacin in patients with sepsis
           The overall hypothesis for this project is that some patients admitted to ICU with
           severe sepsis are undertreated with meropenem and ciprofloxacin using the dosing based
           on that recommended by the Product Information
