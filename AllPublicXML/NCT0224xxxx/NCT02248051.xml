  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10, at potentially therapeutic doses, in the target patient
      population comprised of subjects with Stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney injury (CKI). In addition,
      associated pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CXA-10 will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, open-label study, single-dose study with CXA-10 in subjects with
      CKI. At total of 12 subjects will be enrolled into two equal groups according to their
      baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR: 15 - 39 or 40 - 59 mL/min/1.73m2). All
      subjects will receive a single dose infusion of CXA-10 emulsion. Since this is the first
      administration of CXA-10 to a non-healthy volunteer population, a conservative approach is
      being taken to ensure safety. Thus, the first 2 subjects from each group will be dosed at one
      dose level below the highest safe dose level administered in the FIH study. If this dose is
      found to be safe in this specific subject population, the remainder of the 4 subjects in each
      group will receive the highest safe dose from the FIH study; otherwise, the remainder will
      receive the initial dose. The doses administered in this study will not exceed the highest
      exposures achieved in the FIH study, and doses may need to be adjusted to lower levels, based
      on further evaluation of current pharmacokinetic data, to ensure the appropriate the exposure
      level. Safety, PK and PD assessments will be conducted over approximately 18 days following
      each dosing session. There will be a follow-up visit approximately 1 week after dosing.

             Outcomes Quality Initiative [NKF KDOQI] Stage 3 or 4, not receiving dialysis) as
             determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 15
             and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (according to the creatinine-cystatin C equation)
             within less than or equal to 3 months prior to the screening visit. Cause of the CKI
             should be recorded where possible.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 40 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          4. Subjects must have resting heart rates (HR) greater than or equal to 50 beats per
             minute at baseline

          5. QTcF interval (Fredericia's correction factor) of the baseline ECG must be less than
             or equal to 450 msec for males and less than or equal to 470 msec for females at
             screening and predose. Subjects with any other clinically relevant ECG parameter
             abnormality (e.g., PR interval, QRS deviation) or any clinically significant ECG
             abnormality will be excluded from the study. Subjects with a history of congenital
             long QT syndrome or short QT syndrome in the subject or in the subject's family will
             be excluded from the study.
