  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and define the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of momelotinib (MMB) combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in adults with
      relapsed/refractory metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the interval from first dose date of study drug to death from any cause.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from first dose date of study drug to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause; definitive disease progression is progression based on RECIST criteria v1.1.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of MMB</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose and postdose on Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>This composite endpoint will measure the plasma PK profile of MMB. The following parameters will be measured, where applicable:
Cmax: maximum observed concentration of drug in plasma
Ctau: observed drug concentration at the end of the dosing interval
AUCtau: concentration of drug over time (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing interval)</description>
