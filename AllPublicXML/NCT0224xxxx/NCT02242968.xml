      Background:

      - Vaccines and antiviral therapies help prevent and treat diseases. Researchers need a group
      of healthy volunteers for clinical trials. Clinical trials are studies that test these
      vaccines and therapies in people.

      Objective:

      - To screen volunteers for clinical trials for investigational or licensed vaccines or drugs
      to treat or prevent virus infections.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults age 18 65.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be asked questions about their health history, including sexual
           activity and drug use. They will give blood samples. They may have a physical exam. They
           may give a urine sample.

        -  Participants may have the inside of their nose either swabbed or washed with some fluid.
           The fluid will be collected. They may give a stool sample.

        -  Participants may have an electrocardiogram. Soft, sticky patches will be attached to
           participants chest, arms, and legs. They will lie still on a table while the patches
           detect the heart s electrical signals. A machine will record these signals.

        -  Participants may have lung function tests. These tests measure the volume of air moving
           in and out of the lungs. Participants will forcibly blow air into a machine.

        -  Participants will be told if any tests show a medical problem.

        -  If a participant is eligible and decides to join an investigational clinical trial,
           researchers will explain the study and the risks involved. Participants will sign a
           separate consent for that clinical trial.

      Vaccines and antiviral therapies are critical for prevention and treatment of viral diseases.
      Among other things, testing of vaccines or antiviral medications requires knowing whether the
      prospective subject has been previously infected by the virus to be studied. We will recruit
      healthy persons for this study and screen them for their eligibility to potentially
      participate in clinical trials of investigational or licensed vaccines or antiviral products.
      In most cases this will involve a medical history, physical examination, and obtaining blood
      to test for past exposure to one or more viruses being studied in ongoing and upcoming
      vaccine or antiviral therapy trials. In some cases blood may be tested for viral DNA or RNA
      and urine, stool, nasal swab, or nasal wash may be tested for viruses. Additional testing,
      such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) may also be done.
      Blood samples will also be stored for future research. This study should help us to identify
      a group of healthy volunteers who will be eligible, based on testing for their prior exposure
      to viruses, to participate in vaccine or antiviral therapy trials.

               3. Able and willing to complete the informed consent process

               4. Agree to have blood and/or urine, stool, nasal swab or wash samples collected and
                  stored for future studies of investigational or licensed products, the immune

               5. Agree to participate in procedures, such as electrocardiogram or pulmonary
                  function tests, as needed for the clinical trial screening process

               6. Do not have plans to become pregnant while on this study

               7. Able to provide a complete medical history and other relevant personal

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          3. Receipt of immunoglobulin within the past 6 months or anticipated within the next year
