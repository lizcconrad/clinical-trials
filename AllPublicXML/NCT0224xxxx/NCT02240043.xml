  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the growth hormone (GH) and adrenocorticotrophic hormone
      (ACTH) secretion in elderly without hypothalamic-pituitary disease using the glucagon
      stimulation test (using Glucagen® Hypokit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) and evaluate some
      parameters such as sarcopenia, nutritional state, bone mineral density, frailty criteria with
      secretion of GH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      subjects over 65 years old were recruited from the geriatric ambulatory unit of our hospital
      to voluntarily participate in a research study concerning the GH and ACTH axis in the
      elderly, which included the realization of the glucagon stimulation test as the first phase
      of the study.

      The GST (Glucagen® Hypokit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) was the chosen test to assess both
      ACTH and GH release because of its few known contraindications and mild side effects. It is a
      provocative test to evaluate GH and ACTH axis, i.e, a diagnostic test, without therapeutic
      effects.

    <description>The glucagon stimulation test (GST) was performed by intramuscular injection of 1 mg of glucagon (Glucagen® Hypokit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark). The blood samples were collected at baseline and after 90 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes and 180 minutes of glucagon injection for GH and cortisol measurements. The subjects were recumbent during the test, and a cannula was maintained in a vein in the arm or forearm with a saline solution slowly infused to avoid multiple punctures.</description>
