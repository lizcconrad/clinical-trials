      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the repeatability of SD-OCT (Spectralis™
      OCT, Version 6.0, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) RNFL thickness measurements with a new
      software (glaucoma premium module) with the well established peripapillary RNFL thickness
      measurements in patients with primary open angle glaucoma.

      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the repeatability of SD-OCT (Spectralis™
      OCT, Version 6.0, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) RNFL thickness measurements with the new
      software (method B) and with the previous method of measurement (method A) in patients with
      glaucoma.

      It is a prospective, not blinded, not randomised, monocentric study. Inclusion of 50 patients
      with a diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), that will be recruited from the
      ophthalmology outpatient department of the UniversityHospital Zurich, Switzerland. All
      patients will undergo a full ophthalmic examination including measurement of refraction, best
      corrected visual acuity, examination of anterior and posterior compartment and measurement of
      the intraocular pressure. On the same day they will have 3 OCT examinations with a new method
      of measurement (method B).On the same day the first 10 patients will undergo also 3 OCT
      examinations with the previous method (method A) and they will get an other 3 OCT
      examinations with method B by a second observer. For this 10 patients the next consultation
      (3 months +/- 1 month) the 3 OCT examinations with method B will be repeated by the first
      observer.

      Primary objectives are coefficient of variations (COV) of method A and B;
      Intra-class-correlations (ICC) of method A and B.
