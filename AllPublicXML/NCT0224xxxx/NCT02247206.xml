      The purpose of this research is to examine the preliminary efficacy, feasibility, and
      acceptability of Voice over Internet Protocol delivered behavior therapy for Tourette
      Syndrome through in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      A Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) is an emerging treatment for children
      with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and has been shown to be efficacious in separate randomized
      trials with children and adults; however, many families of children with TS are prevented
      from accessing it due to limited availability of adequately trained treatment providers.
      Recent research has shown that videoconference-delivered CBIT is as effective as face to face
      delivery, and that both modalities are efficacious. Despite its effectiveness, traditional
      videoconferencing has limitations including lack of portability, ease of access, the need for
      third party clinics, and cost. A newer, more convenient alternative to increase access is the
      use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) transmission, allowing for the direct delivery of
      CBIT to patients' homes.

      Therefore the objective of this study (the final phase of a three-phase project) is to
      establish the preliminary efficacy of VoIP-modified CBIT for reducing tics in children with
      TS relative to a waitlist-control. Twenty children (ages 9-17) with TS or Chronic Tic
      Disorder as a primary diagnosis will be recruited for a randomized, observer-blind, waitlist
      controlled trial of VoIP-delivered CBIT. Participants will be randomly assigned to 8 weekly
      sessions of CBIT-VoIP over a 10-week acute treatment period, or waitlist control condition.
      As an exploratory aim, the current study will investigate potential correlates of treatment
      outcome, including home computer equipment available (i.e., web camera type, microphone type,
      internet upload speed, and type of internet connection), prior computer experience, and
      comfort with study computer equipment.

    <description>The YGTSS is a clinician-rated tic severity measure, featuring a total severity score, with a rating from 0 to 50, and independent subtotals for motor and vocal tics each with ratings from 0 to 25. It also features a tic-related 0-50 point impairment scale.</description>

    <description>The child 1) learns to become more aware of any sensations, or urges that may trigger tics, and 2) learn some other behavior (competing response) to do every time he/she feels the urge to tic. The child's parent is trained to provide prompts and praise for use of the competing response. The parent and family also receive psychoeducation about tics, and learn ways to reduce the impact of environmental stimuli on tic severity. The child learns relaxation techniques to reduce stress and make it easier for him/her to resist his or her tics. Prior to treatment sessions, the parent and child spend about 10 minutes discussing with the therapist any problematic issues he/she is having. At the end of treatment sessions the child is assigned some tasks to practice prior to the next session.</description>

    <description>Participants in the waitlist-control group, do not receive behavior therapy for tics or any other treatment during the 10-week acute treatment period.

    <intervention_name>Behavior Therapy for Tics (CBIT)</intervention_name>
    <description>CBIT is an 8-session 10-week behavioral treatment for chronic tic disorders, including Tourette Syndrome. The first two sessions are 90 minutes, with subsequent sessions lasting 60 minutes. The treatment consists of Habit Reversal Training (awareness training, competing response training, and social support), and function-based assessment to reduce the impact of environmental or other stimuli on tic severity. The treatment also consists of relaxation techniques to reduce tic-related stress and tension, and behavioral rewards to motivate treatment compliance.</description>
