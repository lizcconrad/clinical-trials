  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This longitudinal study is being done to understand mechanisms underlying development of
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and the role of the gut bacteria in development of symptoms.
      This information will be used to determine whether temporal changes in gut microbial taxonomy
      and metabolism are associated with changes in symptom severity in IBS, and if targeted
      dietary interventions, including prebiotics, can reverse or moderate these changes.

        IBS-C and IBS-D SUBJECTS:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of IBS-C or IBS-D

          -  Age 18 to 65

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of abdominal surgeries (except appendectomy and cholecystectomy)

          -  Known diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease or
             other inflammatory condition

          -  Antibiotic use within the past 4 weeks (they can be enrolled after a four-week washout
             period and subsequent use during the 6-month study duration does not exclude them)

          -  Bleeding risk or medications which may increase risk of bleeding for patients who
             agree to undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy

          -  Bowel preparation for colonoscopy within the past week

          -  Pregnancy or plans to become pregnant within the study time frame

          -  Vulnerable adults

          -  Age greater than or equal to 66

          -  Any other disease(s), condition(s) or habit(s) that would interfere with completion of
             the study, would increase risks of flexible sigmoidoscopy (for those opting for this),
             or in the judgment of the investigator would potentially interfere compliance to this
             study or would adversely affect study outcomes

        HEALTHY SUBJECTS:
