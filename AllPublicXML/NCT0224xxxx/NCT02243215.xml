  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized study exploring the difference between off-site vs. on-site
      training in laparoscopic skills. The study will be performed using fifty surgical trainees
      from the departments of urology, surgery and gynecology. The participants will be recruited,
      enrolled and randomized during the introductory course in basic laparoscopic techniques held
      six times annually at Center of Clinical Education(CEKU).

      Participants will be able to train laparoscopic skills on a Box Trainer(BT) and on a Virtual
      Reality Simulator(VRS). They will practice until they reach a predefined level of proficiency
      on seven basic modules, the procedure module; &quot;salpingectomy&quot; on the LapSimâ„¢ and reach the
      passing level of 358pts on the Training and Assessment of Basic Laparoscopic
      Techniques(TABLT) technical test.

      The intervention group will have a portable trainer available to allow training at their
      convenience, be it at home or at work. The control group will only practice on-site at CEKU
      and at their local hospital.

      Participants will be asked to keep a training log with details of time spend on training and
      number of training sessions. The training log will contain information on any type practice
      involving laparoscopy be it on a BT or a VRS at the local hospital, at home on the tablet
      trainer or training at CEKU. Also time spend in the operation room, assisting or performing
      laparoscopic surgery will be registered.

      To pass the TABLT all participants will book a test session at CEKU for their final test at
      the end of their training. At the test sessions TABLT test scores will be established on site
      by the Chief Investigator and afterwards using video recordings of the test. A blinded rater
      will give scores based on the video recordings and this will be the decisive rating to
      determine whether the participant has passed the test.

      To pass the VRS training an employee at CEKU will monitor a VRS practice session in which
      proficiency level is reached.

      The enrollment of participants is expected to finish June 2015 a data analysis will be
      performed in July 2015.
