    <textblock>
      Prospective, open label, multi-center, non-randomized study designed to collect initial
      clinical data related to the safety and clinical performance of the Sinopsys Lacrimal Stent
      for use during repair of the lacrimal system in patients with functional or obstructive
      epiphora.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 10 patients will be enrolled and followed for six months. The primary objective is to
      demonstrate the safety and clinical performance of the Sinopsys Lacrimal Stent for use during
      repair of the lacrimal system for ethmoid sinus intubation and bypass to canalicular
      pathologies in this patient population. The primary outcome measure for performance is the
      relief of epiphora determined by both investigator assessment of stent patency and patient
      self-assessment of epiphora symptom improvement compared to baseline.
