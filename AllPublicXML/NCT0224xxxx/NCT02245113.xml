  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be comparing human body responses by the effects of diets cooked with
      NoveLin, virgin olive oil and RBD coconut oil.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NoveLin has high content of monounsaturate fatty acids - oleic acid (C18:1) which is the
      predominant fatty acid and in this study NoveLin is used as cooking fat in compare with olive
      oil. Olive oil is the world's most commonly eaten monounsaturated oil which contains 55 - 83%
      oleic acid. Consumption of olive oil gives numerous health benefits on lowering total and LDL
      cholesterol, reducing LDL cholesterol's, lowering blood clotting factors, and lowering blood
      pressure. Coconut oil is the richest source of medium chain fatty acid and it has greater
      than 90% of saturated fatty acid with dominant fatty acid of lauric acid (C12:0). RBD coconut
      oil is used as positive control in this study.
