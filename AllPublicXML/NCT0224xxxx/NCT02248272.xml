  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated any potential associations between two isocaloric diets with
      different meal frequency (3 meals versus 6 meals) and glycemic control in people at high
      diabetes risk (lean and overweight/obese women with PCOS, individuals with hyperinsulinemia,
      individuals with impaired glucose tolerance) and diagnosed with diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of meal frequency on diabetes risk markers (e.g. glucose and insulin metabolism)
      has been studied in several studies so far, both in healthy individuals and in individuals
      being at risk for diabetes mellitus, with or without concurrent weight loss. In addition, few
      studies have investigated the effect of different meal frequency on glycemic control in
      patients with diabetes mellitus under conditions of weight maintenance. However, the results
      regarding the ideal number of meals remain controversial.

      To our best knowledge, there is no study available that has investigated the effect of meal
      frequency on glucose and insulin metabolism in lean and obese women with PCOS, in lean and
      obese individuals with hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance, and in obese
      individuals with type 2 diabetes, independently of weight loss.

    <description>40 women with PCOS followed one of two isocaloric weight maintenance diets (isocaloric diet with 3 meals or isocaloric diet with 6 meals), tailored to individual energy needs, with the same macronutrient composition (40% carbohydrates, 25% protein, 35% fat). The energy and carbohydrate contribution for the 3 meals' diet was 20% at breakfast, 50% at lunch, 30% at dinner, whereas for the 6 meals' diet was 20% at breakfast, 10% at morning snack, 30% at lunch, 10% at afternoon snack, 20% at dinner, 10% at before bedtime snack. Each intervention lasted 12 weeks and there was no wash out period.</description>

The volunteers were free to choose the foods they used to consume before. However, in order to assist them to adapt to the different meal frequency, individualized instructions were given to all volunteers before their entry to the study. An example of a 7-day diet menu was prescribed for both diet programs and analytical food exchange lists of different food groups were also provided.</description>

             dissolved in water, or (d) a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) in
             patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis.

          -  PCOS was defined according to the Rotterdam criteria (Rotterdam 2004) which include
             the presence of two or more of the following features: chronic oligoovulation or
             anovulation (fewer than six menstrual periods in the previous year), androgen excess
             (serum total testosterone &gt;70 mg/dl) and polycystic ovaries.

          -  Insulin sensitizers, i.e. metformin, contraceptives, steroids or any medications known
             to affect glucose, insulin or reproductive hormones for at least the last 6 months.

          -  Serious health problems like cardiovascular, liver or kidney diseases.
