        Inclusion criteria:

        - Healthy CYP2C19 genotyped male volunteers according to the following criteria: Based upon
        a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR,
        respiratory rate, body temperature), 12-lead ECG, ophthalmologic exam, clinical laboratory
        tests

          -  Korean ethnicity according to the following criteria: be a current Korean passport or
             national identification card holder, and have parents and grandparents who were all
             born in Korea

             accordance with GCP and the local legislation.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR, respiratory rate, body
             temperature and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (longer than 24 hours) within at least one month
             or less than 10 half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration or during
             the trial

          -  Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong
             the QT/QTc interval based on the knowledge at the time of protocol preparation within
             10 days prior to administration or during the trial

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to
             administration or during the trial

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or more than 3 cigars or more than 3 pipes/day)

          -  Blood donation (more than 100 mL within four weeks prior to administration or during
             the trial)

          -  Excessive physical activities (within one week prior to administration or during the
             trial)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a
             QTc interval more than 450 ms)

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade des Pointes (e.g., heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Abnormality on color vision test or any other finding on ophthalmologic exam that is
             clinically deemed to potentially interfere with the safety assessment of this trial

          -  Subjects who do not agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming pregnant
             from the first dosing day until two month after the study completion. Acceptable
             methods of contraception comprises barrier contraception and a medically accepted
             contraceptive method for the female partner (intra-uterine device with spermicide,
