  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective chart review to follow our laser-assisted IVC filter retrieval
      patients. We intend to validate existing literature and scientific findings by publishing our
      own clinical experience in difficult IVC filter retrievals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, IL USA, IVC filters are successfully removed
      &gt;95%. Technical failures, although rare, are usually related to excessive endoluminal
      scarring at the point of IVC filter implantation. Adjunctive (or advanced) removal techniques
      are often employed in difficult cases. The excimer laser sheath has been successfully used at
      Northwestern for patients who had failed all other retrieval techniques.

      Before a patient is to undergo an IVC filter removal using the Excimer Laser Sheath they will
      be consented to participate in the chart review study and become a part of a registry kept at
      Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The procedure itself is not being used as part of the study.
      Chart reviews will be completed and data collected on the procedure to remove the filter.
      Follow up after the procedure by phone call and chart review will be completed at least once,
      1 week after the filter removal.
