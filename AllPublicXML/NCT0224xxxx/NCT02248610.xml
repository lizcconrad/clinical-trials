  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with acute clots (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) the investigators
      will collect real world data on their short and long term outcomes. The investigators
      hypothesise that in patients treated from the outset with rivaroxaban that: 1. treatment will
      be non-inferior to treatment with conventional anticoagulants (heparins and warfarin); 2.
      there will be less bleeding than when patients are on conventional anticoagulants; 3. there
      will be a lower long-term incidence of morbidity from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
      hypertension and post-thrombotic limb syndrome.

      United Kingdom-only prospective, non-interventional, investigator-led, multi-centre, single
      cohort, registry. The observation period for each patient covers the treatment period with
      rivaroxaban and follow up until study end. For each patient, the treating health care
      professional records patient demographics, medical history, signs and symptoms, diagnosis,
      treatment and safety parameters at an initial visit and subsequent follow-up visit(s). Data
      monitoring will be undertaken by the Sponsor.
