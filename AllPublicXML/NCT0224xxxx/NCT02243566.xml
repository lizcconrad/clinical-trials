    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of six- to eight-week treatment with
      MicardisPlus速 on blood pressure and the effect of patient self-monitoring on blood pressure
      control. In addition, the post-marketing surveillance study offered the possibility to obtain
      information about the influence on different laboratory parameters during treatment with
      MicardisPlus速 from an unselected patient group under office conditions
