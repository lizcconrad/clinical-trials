    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the safety of six cycles of cenersen treatment and to
      begin to test the hypothesis that intermittent administration of cenersen may lead to a
      reduced dependence on transfusion.

    <textblock>
      The study is a nonrandomized open-label treatment with varying doses of cenersen by
      intravenous administration to:

      Primary

      *To assess the safety profile and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of cenersen for each of
      three increasing dose levels as stipulated by the protocol in patients with lower risk MDS
      defined as low or intermediate-1 risk by IPSS.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the lowest pharmacologically active exposure from among three increasing
           dose levels as stipulated by the protocol that exhibits the desired activity on
           erythropoiesis after evaluation of all dose levels, and

        -  To determine if intermittent treatment with cenersen will reduce transfusion
           requirements for patients with lower risk MDS.

          -  Demonstrated refractoriness or intolerance to standard approved therapy (lenalidomide
             in del(5q) MDS patients &amp; azanucleosides in non-del(5q)patients).

          -  Recovered from acute toxicities of other treatments (≤ Grade 2). All other MDS
             treatments discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment except epoetin alpha

          -  Ability to understand &amp; willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at time of signing informed consent form.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;4 weeks following initiation.

          -  Must meet following requirements:

               -  total bilirubin: ≤2 x upper normal limit (UNL) (patients with Gilbert's disease
                  are eligible, hyperbilirubinemia is intermittent &amp; indirect)

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT): ≤3 x UNL

               -  creatinine: ≤2 x UNL

          -  &lt;1% peripheral blood blasts.

          -  &lt;10% bone marrow blasts.

          -  Medical history of RBC transfusion dependent anemia ≥4 units of RBCs during the 16
             weeks prior to admin of study drug &amp; ≥2 units of RBCs over prior 8 weeks (day -56 to
             day 1 prior to treatment; baseline period) for documented Hgb of ≤ 9g/dL (during
             baseline). Didn't have a 56 day RBC transfusion-free period during 16 weeks prior to
             administration of study drug.

          -  Teratogenic effects of cenersen are unknown, women of child-bearing potential &amp; men
             must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry &amp; for the duration of
             study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving MDS treatment except blood transfusion and/or iron chelation within 4 weeks
             prior to entering study or no recovery from adverse events due to agents administered
             more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Received hematopoietic growth factors within specified limits prior to treatment (2
             weeks for epoetin alpha (Procrit) &amp; 4 weeks for darbepoetin alpha (Aranesp)).

          -  Chronic use (&gt;2 weeks) of greater than physiologic doses of corticosteroid agent (dose
