      This is a Phase I, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity
      of INO-3106 alone or in combination with INO-9012 DNA vaccines delivered by Electroporation
      to subjects with HPV6 associated aerodigestive precancerous lesions and malignancies.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity
      of 3 mg or 6 mg INO-3106 alone or in combination with 1 mg of INO-9012 (DNA plasmid encoding
      human interleukin 12) delivered by electroporation (EP) in subjects with HPV6 associated
      aerodigestive precancerous lesions and malignancies. Subjects will be enrolled in 2 cohorts
      (3 subjects in each cohort):

      Cohort I: First 3 subjects will be enrolled sequentially and will receive INO-3106 alone or
      in combination with INO-9012.

      Cohort II: The next 3 subjects will be treated with 6 mg of INO-3106 and 1 mg of INO-9012, or
      at the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) determined in Cohort I.
