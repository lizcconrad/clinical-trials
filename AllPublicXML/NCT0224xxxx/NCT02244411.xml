  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EQUAL study has been designed for adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) who are overweight or obese. The purpose of this study is to see if diet and
      exercise can help people lose weight and improve other health problems. This two year study
      will compare two methods of informing participants about ways to lose weight.

    <description>Weight loss will be evaluated in an intent-to-treat analysis with a linear mixed effects model with robust standard errors and an unstructured covariance matrix(50) using weight measured at each time points (0, 12 months and 24 months after randomization) as the outcome modeled as a function of time, randomization arm, a history of CRT, gender, age, and race together with interaction terms between time and randomization arm.</description>

    <description>Participants will be assigned an individual diet &amp; physical activity counselor through Healthways at Hopkins. This counselor will stay with the participant for the 24 months. The primary communication with the counselor will be via website &amp; email. Participants will be encouraged to consume a low-calorie, low-salt diet with 7-12 daily servings of fruits, vegetables &amp; low-fat dairy products. Calorie goals are based upon weight at study entry &amp; whether or not the weight loss goal has been met. Participants will gradually build to ≥ 180 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, using the activity of their own choosing &amp; gradually adding bouts of ≥ 10 minutes in length. Monitoring &amp; Counselor Contacts: the first 3 months, the participants are encouraged to log into the web hub on a daily basis to record weight, food intake, &amp; physical activity. Participants who decline or drop out of the intervention program will remain on-study doing home visits &amp; questionnaires.</description>
