  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy has become one of the cornerstones of the treatment of
      heart failure. However, a large proportion of patients still fails to this type of therapy.
      This may be due to a suboptimal position of the left ventricular pacing lead, which may be
      caused by unfavorable cardiac venous anatomy. Implantation of the pacing lead using video
      assisted thoracic surgery is more flexible and evades the venous system altogether, resulting
      in a much more favorable position of the pacing lead, with better treatment results as e
      consequence.
