      Study to evaluate the therapeutic effect of tamsulosin and finasteride in symptomatic BPH
      patients, two medications indicated in BPH belonging to two different pharmacological
      classes, as evaluated from the point of view of patient's perception of his pathological
      condition and of the impact of the disease on general health and quality of life
