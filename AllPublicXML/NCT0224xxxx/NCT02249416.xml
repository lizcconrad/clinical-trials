    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of two dose combinations of
      tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV 500 mg/RTV 100 mg and TPV 750 mg/RTV 200 mg) administered twice
      daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of zidovudine (ZDV) and zidovudine-glucuronide (GZDV) as
      well as the effects of zidovudine on the pharmacokinetics of TPV/RTV
