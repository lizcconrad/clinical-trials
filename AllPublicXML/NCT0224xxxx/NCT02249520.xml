    <textblock>
      This is an extended pilot protocol to facilitate on-site calibration of the technical aspects
      of the new Siemens Biograph mMR (molecular MR) Positron Emission Tomography-Magnetic
      Resonance (PET-MR) scanner at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) Biomedical Imaging
      Research Institute (BIRI) Research Imaging Core after scanner installation. The mMR is a
      FDA-approved standard clinical device (non-experimental) and will be used in accordance with
      clearance and approval from the FDA.

      PET-MR Protocol on the Biograph mMR: This protocol requires the use of a radioisotope. To
      avoid administering radioisotope solely for the purposes of this calibration, we will recruit
      20 patients from the clinical population at the S. Mark Taper Foundation Imaging Center at
      CSMC who are already receiving an isotope dose for their standard-of-care examination and are
      willing to be scanned at the Research Imaging Core on the same day right after their clinical
      exam. Subjects who are having a PET-MR after receiving FDG will have the same body part
      scanned as they did for clinical testing.

      MR-only Protocol on the Biograph mMR:To set up MR-only protocols, we will enroll 20
      volunteers for MR-only on the mMR scanner. This is a standard MR scan with no isotope
      involved. Those volunteers who are participating in the MR-only scan will have major body
      parts and organs scanned as needed for calibration.

    <description>The mMR is a FDA-approved standard clinical device (non-experimental) and will be used in accordance with clearance and approval from the FDA. Results obtained from these tests will not be analyzed towards the end point of any study and will solely be used to finalize and calibrate the technical performance of the new scanner. All scans will be visually assessed for technique calibration.</description>
