  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate lung clearance index (LCI) by a standardized
      procedure in a well characterized study setting and to assess feasibility of LCI as a more
      sensitive method than forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) to measure effectiveness of
      antibiotic therapy in patients with CF aged 6 years and older with mild to moderate lung
      disease.
