  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAINBOW study is an NIH R01-funded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the clinical
      and cost effectiveness and implementation potential of a primary care integrated
      multicondition intervention program to help improve mood and weight for obese adults with
      clinically significant depressive symptoms. The ENGAGE study is a mechanistic investigation
      added to the main trial with funding through the NIH common fund for the Science of Behavior
      Change roadmap initiative. Beginning Jan 11, 2016, at least 100 of newly enrolled trial
      participants will be consented to undergo additional assays evaluating neurobiological
      mechanisms of self-regulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The large numbers of primary care patients affected by coexisting obesity and depression and
      common risk factors for diabetes and heart disease underscore the urgency of developing
      effective, accessible, and sustainable interventions that use an integrated, multicondition
      care management approach. The RAINBOW trial will rigorously evaluate the clinical and cost
      effectiveness and potential for &quot;real-world&quot; implementation of an innovative intervention
      that integrates a behavioral weight loss program and a collaborative stepped care program for
      depression, incorporates conventional clinic- and home-based modes of care delivery (e.g.,
      office visits plus phone consults and take-home DVD), and leverages low-cost, wide-reach
      health information technologies (e.g., Web, secure email, and mobile texting). Beginning Jan
      11, 2016, at least 100 of newly enrolled trial participants will also be consented to undergo
      additional assays evaluating neurobiological mechanisms of self-regulation, including
      emotional regulation, cognitive control and self-reflection. Given its focus on transforming
      primary care management of obesity and depression and common cardiometabolic risk factors to
      evidence-based, patient-centered care, as well as the likely scalability of the proposed
      intervention, the study has high potential for significant clinical and public health impact.
      Furthermore, elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of self-regulation will significantly
      advance precision lifestyle medicine by enabling mechanism-targeted individualization of
      treatment.
