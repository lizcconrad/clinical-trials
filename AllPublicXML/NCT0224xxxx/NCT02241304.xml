  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TetraGraph is a newly developed EMG-based, quantitative, battery-powered neuromuscular
      monitoring system intended for daily clinical use. The primary aim of this clinical
      investigation is to examine the applicability (ease of use, equipment need, etc.),
      repeatability (precision or internal consistency) and performance (signal quality, accuracy
      of outcome, voltage of stimulation output before and during a stimulus) of the Tetragraph
      device in patients undergoing elective surgeries requiring neuromuscular blockade.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TetraGraph will be tested in 50 consenting patients undergiong elective surgeries
      requiring neuromuscular blockade. The left of right hand of the patients will be randomly
      studied. After the induction of anesthesia but before the administration of muscle relaxant
      train-of-four (TOF) stimulation will be started with 30 mA current intensity, 0.2 msec pulse
      duration at 20 sec intervals. The stimulation will be left to run until extubation. The
      TetraGraph device will be set not to show measurement results on the screen but save them on
      the SD card for later analysis. This way TetraGraph will not influence clinical decisions and
      patient care. During the operations we will record the number of muscle twitches in return to
      stimulation, the time and dose of muscle relaxant and opioid administration, the time of use
      of electrocautery and the skin temperature.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to provide safety &amp; performance data of the TetraGraph device in anesthetized patients. Performance will be assessed post hoc by analyzing objective EMG data from the SD card and correlating the responses to annotations made during the surgical procedure (e.g., correlating the EMG responses to the time of NMBA or reversal agent administration). No clinical decisions will be made based on any objective measurements made by the TetraGraph. There are no specific timepoints concerning the primary outcome measure of the study.</description>

    <measure>Secondary performance assessment of TetraGraph Device</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of the hospital stay, an expected avarage of 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measures is a composite of several safety and performance data examined during the operations and the hospital stay:
Acceptable levels of electrical noise when no stimulus is being applied;
Ensuring that the stimulus artifact does not obscure the EMG response when a stimulus is applied;
Appearance of an EMG response at threshold stimulation levels, just sufficient to elicit a palpable twitch response;
Consistency of the EMG response amplitudes during repeated (ST and TOF) protocols (variability &lt;10%);
Consistency of EMG response characteristics independent of patient age, gender, or weight;
Consistency of EMG response characteristics independent whether the right or left arm is stimulated;
Skin reaction to stimulation or recording electrodes;
Overall usability of the device for clinicians and operators; collecting recommendations for improving ease of use.</description>
