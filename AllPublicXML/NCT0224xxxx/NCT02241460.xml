      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with Promescent Lidocaine
      Spray compared with placebo in patients with premature ejaculation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Promescent Lidocaine Spray is a non-prescription drug that is marketed under an
      over-the-counter drug monograph (21 CFR Section 348.10 Subpart B (a)(2)) for male genital
      desensitizing drug products. In addition the evaluating the efficacy of treatment with
      Promescent, this study will evaluate patients' subjective distress, perception of improvement
      and optimal dose, and safety and tolerability of Promescent for patients with premature
      ejaculation and their respective partners.

    <description>During the Double-Blind Treatment Period, patients randomized to placebo will receive three cycles of Promescent. The first and second cycle consists of three weeks of treatment using 30 mg and 50 mg, followed by one week of washout. The third cycle consists of three weeks of treatment using 70 mg. During the Open-Label Treatment Period, the patient will receive four weeks of Promescent (active treatment) in one-week cycles: 30 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg, and patient's self-selected dose.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent before screening.

          -  Subject is a male, 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject meets the diagnostic criteria for premature ejaculation as defined by the
             DSM-IV-TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text
             Revision; 2000).

          -  Subject has a stable, monogamous, heterosexual relationship and sexually active for at
             least the last 6 months.

          -  Subject and partner are willing and able to engage in sexual intercourse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has never achieved an intravaginal ejaculation during the past 6 months (i.e.,
             always ejaculates prior to penetration).

          -  Subject has other forms of ejaculatory dysfunction (e.g., retrograde ejaculation,
             anejaculation, painful ejaculation).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the subject has a condition or is in a situation
             that may put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may
             interfere significantly with the subject's ability to participate in the study.
