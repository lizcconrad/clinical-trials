  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soldiers deployed in peace-keeping missions as well as ex-combatants in conflict or former
      conflict regions were and are often exposed to multiple traumatic events and situations in
      which they are forced to engage in violent behavior. The treatment program Formation,
      Orientation and Rehabilitation by means of Narrative Exposure Therapy (FORNET) is a
      short-term, culturally sensitive treatment approach that aims to reduce Posttraumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) symptoms as well as the risk to engage in uncontrolled violent behavior.
      Addressing trauma-related mental disorders as well as emotions related to aggression by means
      of FORNET is expected to facilitate reintegration in civil life and reduce uncontrolled
      violence.

      The investigators want to provide evidence, that FORNET is an effective and efficient module
      to assist soldiers after deployment in Somalia and/or male and female ex-combatants who
      fought in the civil war in Burundi. In addition the investigators aim to explore how
      traumatic incidences and maltreatment during childhood may influence treatment outcomes.

    <description>During FORNET, the client, with the assistance of the therapist, constructs a chronological narrative of his or her entire life with a focus on exposure to traumatic stress and committed violence. Empathic understanding, active listening, congruency and unconditional positive regard are key components of the therapist's behavior. The therapist asks in detail for the client's emotions, cognitions, physiological reactions, and sensory informations during traumatic and aggressive events to link them to an autobiographical context, namely time and place. In total the individuals receive 8 sessions of FORNET, every session lasting between 1,5 and 2 hrs depending on the needs of the participant.</description>
