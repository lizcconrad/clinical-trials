      BACKGROUND In 2012 76,497 primary total knee (TKR) replacements were performed in England,
      Wales and Northern Ireland . Traditionally TKR surgery is undertaken with the aid of a
      surgical tourniquet. A surgical tourniquet is an occlusive device applied around a patient's
      leg. The tourniquet squeezes the leg (including blood vessels within the leg) and can
      therefore reduce the amount of bleeding that occurs while it is inflated. An intraoperative
      tourniquet can therefore help to improve the surgical field of view. Although the majority of
      surgeons prefer to undertake TKR surgery using a tourniquet a small but increasing number are
      now not pursuing these devices.

      There is robust evidence that the risk of deep vein thrombosis is increased if a tourniquet
      is used for TKR surgery. In addition embolic material in the venous system have been observed
      following TKR surgery and have been noted to be present in the right atrium with
      transoesophageal (TOE) echo intra-operatively. , Significant and potentially life threatening
      emboli have been documented to enter the cerebral circulation via pulmonary arterio-venous
      shunts and patent foramen ovale (PFO) (27% of patients at autopsy) , . The clinical
      manifestations of cerebral emboli post tourniquet deflation in TKR are not fully understood.
      Fat embolism syndrome and post-operative confusion in TKR patients may be the result of
      emboli formed during a TKR. ,

      AIM

        -  Is there evidence of emboli entering the cerebral circulation following tourniquet
           deflation in TKR surgery?

        -  Is there evidence of MRI detectable brain lesions and or any clinical change in
           cognition compared in patients undergoing TKR surgery with a tourniquet compared to
           those that do not have a tourniquet?
