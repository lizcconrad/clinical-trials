      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the performance of the Enlite 3 Sensor over 168
      hours (7 days) when inserted in the abdomen and used with the Guardian Mobile App and 640G
      Pump in subjects aged 14-75 years with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

      This study is a multi-center, randomized, in-clinic trial that aims to demonstrate the
      performance of the Enlite 3 Sensor over 168 hours (7 days) when inserted in the abdomen and
      used with the Guardian Mobile App and 640G Pump in subjects aged 14-75 years with type 1 or
      type 2 diabetes for at least one year.

      Subjects are randomized into either Group A or Group B. The groups assigned will determine
      when the subject will be participating in the in-clinic YSI frequent sample testing (FST).
      For example on Day 1: Group A begins FST 30 minutes after Enlite 3 Sensor Insertion. Group B
      begins FST 14 hours after Enlite 3 Sensor Insertion.

    <time_frame>7 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Enlite 3 Sensor accuracy using two real time devices: 1) 640G Pump and 2) Guardian Mobile with the minimum calibration requirements (every 12 hours after the second calibration) will be evaluated. Enlite 3 Sensor values will be compared to YSI plasma glucose values, which is considered as the gold standard, during the frequent sample testing days (Days 1, 3 and 7). MARD = Mean of ((Absolute difference of YSI reference and Sensor glucose values / YSI reference glucose values) * 100). Note that results from multiple testing days will be pooled together for reporting purpose.</description>

    <description>Retrospective re-analysis to simulate 640G Pump and Guardian Mobile 1-minute raw data collected by GST3C Transmitters and GST4C Transmitter: Enlite 3 Sensor accuracy with 3-4 calibrations throughout the day (derived from re-analysis of Enlite 3 Sensor data using actual fingerstick values). Enlite 3 Sensor values will be compared to YSI plasma glucose values, which is considered as the gold standard, during the frequent sample testing days (Days 1, 3 and 7). MARD = Mean of ((Absolute difference of YSI reference and Sensor glucose values / YSI reference glucose values) * 100).

Enlite 3 Sensor values will be compared to YSI plasma glucose values during YSI frequent sample testing. Enlite 3 Sensor values will be compared to YSI plasma glucose values, which is considered as the gold standard, during the frequent sample testing days (Days 1, 3 and 7).

        <description>Enlite 3 Sensor accuracy using two real time devices: 1) 640G Pump and 2) Guardian Mobile with the minimum calibration requirements (every 12 hours after the second calibration) will be evaluated. Enlite 3 Sensor values will be compared to YSI plasma glucose values, which is considered as the gold standard, during the frequent sample testing days (Days 1, 3 and 7). MARD = Mean of ((Absolute difference of YSI reference and Sensor glucose values / YSI reference glucose values) * 100). Note that results from multiple testing days will be pooled together for reporting purpose.</description>
