  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To optimize the nutritional care in the context of the limitations of available time and
      knowledge in medical practice, the present study proposes to develop a tool of nutritional
      guidelines for hypertension, easily accessible, based on evidence, and then evaluate its use
      among primary care physicians registered in a center telehealth. The use of the mobile
      application tool will aim to improve the nutritional counseling, helping with prevention of
      other chronic diseases in primary care context.

    <description>Participants will install and use a mobile application designed to provide nutritional recommendations for hypertensive patients. These recommendations will be based on the DASH diet guidelines appropriate to patient profile: consumption of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, milk or low fat dairy products, lean meats, poultry and fish, nuts, seeds and legumes, amount of fats, oils and sweets, as well as guidelines for salt intake and alcohol. The call service will be offered by the Center for Telehealth Rio Grande do Sul to answer clinic questions with qualified staff and in real time. All physicians who work in Primary Health Care in Brazil can use this call center when they have questions about diagnosis and management of their patients.</description>
