  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      single-dose study will assess the efficacy and tolerability of the active tablets versus
      placebo in participants suffering from cold and influenza. Eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment groups (active or placebo tablets) and enter a
      four-hour (hr) treatment phase. Each participant will be administered only once during each
      study period. Participants will use a questionnaire to record the symptom severity scores as
      described, as well as time.

    <measure>Symptom Severity Assessment at 15 Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom severity assessment was determined by Total Sum Score (TSS), TSS ranged from 0 to 21 with less severity score at the given time point represented a better outcome measure.
TSS was calculated as the sum of the non missing scores (all on a 0-3 scale measuring worsening or severity) of the following common cold symptoms: sore throat, headache, extremities pain, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and cough post treatment administration.
Participants self assessed symptoms severity using 4 points (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) categorical scale at 15 minutes post product use.</description>

        <description>Symptom severity assessment was determined by Total Sum Score (TSS), TSS ranged from 0 to 21 with less severity score at the given time point represented a better outcome measure.
TSS was calculated as the sum of the non missing scores (all on a 0-3 scale measuring worsening or severity) of the following common cold symptoms: sore throat, headache, extremities pain, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and cough post treatment administration.
Participants self assessed symptoms severity using 4 points (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) categorical scale at 15 minutes post product use.</description>

TSS was calculated as the sum of the non missing scores (all on a 0-3 scale measuring worsening or severity) of the following common cold symptoms: sore throat, headache, extremities pain, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and cough post treatment administration.
Participants self assessed symptoms severity using 4 points (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) categorical scale at 3 hours post product use.</description>

        <title>Cough Severity Assessment</title>
        <description>Participants self-assessed cough severity using 4 points (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) categorical scale at baseline and at 15, 30, 60, 120,180 and 240 minutes post product administration. All cough severity assessment values were recorded in a questionnaire and tabulated. A reduction in severity score from baseline represented a better outcome measure.</description>
