      Intubation must be done with utmost care in cervical trauma patients. cervical spine motion
      must be minimized and intubation must be fast. The aim of this study was to compare the
      effectiveness of fastrach and glidescope. 18-65 years of age , ASA I-II 100 patients
      undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in this trial. After standard monitorisation
      including EKG , noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, anesthesia was induced with
      propofol and fentanyl. rocuronium was then administered for muscle relaxation. Patients were
      divided into two groups glidescope and fastrach. Rigid collar was placed then patients were
      intubated with one of these devices. Mask ventilations with or without collar were recorded.
      insertion times, intubation times of the devices were recorded. Peroperative hemodynamic
      parameters and postoperative minor complications were also recoded.
