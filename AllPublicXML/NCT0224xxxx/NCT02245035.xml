        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females between 60-85 years of age.

          2. Good general health with no concomitant diseases, which would be expected to interfere
             with the study

          3. BMI range 20-35 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of any central neurological disease with the potential to impair
             cognition(e.g., brain tumor, stroke, epilepsy, motor neuron disease, multiple
             sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease) or prior major head trauma with
             loss of consciousness

          2. Presence of an active unstable and life-threatening systemic illness (e.g., cancer)

          3. Presence of major psychiatric disorder within the past 3 years including depression,
             anxiety, and alcohol (over 3 drinks per day or total of 18 per week) or drug abuse
             (DSM-IV criteria; Geriatric Depression Score&gt;6)

          4. Presence of diabetes mellitus (defined as a clinical diagnosis or use of an
             anti-diabetic agent) and metabolic syndrome

          5. Use of psychoactive and investigational medications

          6. Subjects with MRI contraindications such as pacemaker, aneurysm clips, artificial
             heart valves, metal fragments, foreign objects or claustrophobia. All subjects
             subjects will receive a structural MRI as part of this study. Individuals with
             evidence of infection, infarction, neoplasm or other lesions will be excluded.
             Individuals found to have abnormalities in their structural MRI will be referred to
             their primary physician for further evaluation and management.

          7. Pregnancy

          8. Special diet regimens such as lactose free or vegan
