    <textblock>
      Perioperative airway management is a top priority of anesthesiologists in daily work, and
      endotracheal intubation (ETI) is considered as the gold standard for providing safe glottic
      seal,effective ventilation and oxygen supplement during general anesthesia. But ETI related
      complications such as concomitant hemodynamic responses, damage to the oropharyngeal
      structures at insertion and postoperative sore throat. Laryngeal mask airway(LMA) for the
      anesthesia management brings new choice with invasive, lighter cardiovascular reaction and
      many other advantages, particularly suited to short and minimally invasive surgery. But LMA
      increased the risk of gastrointestinal reflux aspiration than using ETI and it may resulted
      in intolerance in high airway pressure, especially in elderly patients with increased lung
      compliance or reduced airway resistance. Furthermore, LMA could not entirely prevent the
      occurrence of postoperative sore throat and hoarse.

      To sum up, it is necessary to carry out a multicenter clinical trial to clarify the safety of
      LMA in elderly patients. The investigators protocol will focus on the incidence of
      postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) when applications of LMA and ETI in elderly
      patients.

      1. Introduction 1.1 Background It is essential for peri-operative patients to ensure airway
      patency and effective ventilation, and respiratory is the most important task in
      anesthesiologist's daily work. Endotracheal intubation(ETI) is the gold standard for
      maintenance patients' ventilation in general anesthesia. It can effectively send narcotic gas
      into the trachea and allow oxygen ventilation well controlled. However, ETI-related
      complications such as dental and oral soft tissue injury, intubation and extubation related
      cardiovascular reactions, hinder its application in some special populations such as elderly
      patients. Clinical application of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) has brought new options and new
      ideas for anesthesia management. LMA has the advantage of light damage, small trauma, simple
      operation and minor cardiovascular response, and it is especially suitable for airway control
      of patient in short and minimally invasive operation. In recent years, the application of LMA
      has a greater proportion compared with ETI in some areas. But with LMA application
      increasing, more and more problems have been reported.

      LMA has a greater risk of gastrointestinal reflux and aspiration, because of its inadequate
      airway tightness. For the same reason, LMA is of intolerance to high airway pressure, and
      this may lead to hypoventilation in elderly patients with lung compliance or increased airway
      resistance. At the same time the LMA can't completely prevent incidence of postoperative sore
      throat and hoarseness. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a multi-center clinical trial
      to clarify the peri-operative advantages and disadvantages of LMA to elderly patients, to
      preliminary explore the LMA complications occurred in elderly patients using predictive
      models, and to clarify the safety of the LMA in airway support of elderly patients.

      1.2 Research Aims The aim of the present research is to study the effects of LMA compared
      with conventional ETI on elderly patients considering postoperative pulmonary complications,
      anesthesia and recovery quality, oxygenation and airway support related complications.

      1.3 Primary endpoint events The morbidity and mortality of pulmonary complications associated
      with intra-operative or post-operative airway control.

      1.4 Secondary endpoint events and other pre-specified outcomes 1.4.1 Dosage of anesthetic
      drugs used during surgery 1.4.2 Recovery time 1.4.3 PACU residence time 1.4.4 ICU admission
      and stay time (patients who meet the ICU inclusion criteria are admitted into ICU, those who
      are admitted into ICU because of bed conversion are excluded, and those who should have been
      out of ICU are also excluded) 1.4.5 Time of hospitalization 1.4.6 Hospitalization costs
