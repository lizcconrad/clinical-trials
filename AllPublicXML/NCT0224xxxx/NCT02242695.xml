    <textblock>
      A clinical study to compare the clinical efficacy of vaginal tablets containing 10mg
      dequalinium chloride (Fluomizin) with the clinical efficacy of 100mg clotrimazole in patients
      suffering from vulvovaginal candidiasis, to assess safety of the two medications during the
      treatment, and to evaluate women's satisfaction with the two treatments.
