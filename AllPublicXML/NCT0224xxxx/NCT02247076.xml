      10 overweight adult men and women will eat according to two different eating schedules:
      grazing and time-restricting feeding (&quot;early eating&quot;). While on each eating schedule,
      metabolism (calories burned) will be measured during a 24-hour stay in a respiratory chamber.
      Glucose levels—as well as key diurnal rhythms such in heart rate—will also be measured
      continuously. This study requires two 1-week periods of participation.
