                  allergies).

               -  Physical examination including at least vital signs (blood pressure, pulse,
                  respirations, and oral temperature); weight; height; examination of the HEENT,
                  cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (abdominal), musculoskeletal,
                  lymphatic, and dermatologic organ systems; and documentation of fetal heart
                  tones.

               -  Clinical laboratory parameters including normal blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,

                  (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses and HIV (as required). Note that normal ranges for
                  vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters will be based on third trimester
                  values published in Sheffield et al. [2013] and/or reference ranges for the third
                  trimester of pregnancy of the central laboratory.

          4. Documentation that fulfills one of the following:

               -  Detailed (level II) second trimester or later anatomic ultrasound with no
                  significant anatomic or growth abnormalities identified; OR

               -  Routine second trimester or later ultrasound with no significant anatomic or
                  growth abnormalities identified, PLUS at least one of the following:

                    -  Normal first trimester screening (based on ultrasound + serum analytes); or

                       amniocentesis, or cell-free fetal DNA.

          5. Able to understand, and both willing and physically able to comply with study
             procedures. This includes anticipation of reasonable geographic proximity to the study
             clinic and adequate transportation to comply with scheduled and unscheduled study
             follow-up visits.

        evidence of any of the following criteria:

          1. Symptomatic cardiac or pulmonary disease requiring chronic drug therapy, including
             hypertension and asthma. Asthma will be exclusionary if the subject is receiving
             chronic systemic glucocorticoids at any dose or inhaled glucocorticoids at any dose
             &gt;500µg per day of beclamethasone or fluticasone, or &gt;800μg per day of budesonide.

          2. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) of ≥35 or &lt;18.5.

          3. Hemoglobinopathy (including known sickle trait or thalassemias, even if asymptomatic)
             or blood dyscrasias.

          4. Hepatic or renal dysfunction.

          5. Established diagnosis of seizure disorder, regardless of therapy.

          6. Auto-immune disease or known immunodeficiency syndrome.

          7. Endocrine disorders, including (but not limited to) hyperthyroidism, untreated
             hypothyroidism, and glucose intolerance (e.g., diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2)
             antedating pregnancy, or occurring during pregnancy and requiring interventions other
             than diet for control.

          8. History of major gynecologic or major abdominal surgery, including bariatric surgery.

             reporting, or receipt of pre-natal care; or requiring treatment with psychotropic
             drugs.

         15. History/presence of deep venous thrombosis or thromboembolism, or the use of
             anticoagulants during pregnancy.

         16. Untreated red blood cell allo-immunization.

         17. Prior stillbirth or neonatal death, or multiple (≥3) spontaneous abortions.

         18. Prior preterm delivery ≤34 weeks gestation or having ongoing intervention
             (medical/surgical) in current pregnancy to prevent preterm birth.

         19. Greater than five (5) prior deliveries.

         20. Previous infant with a known genetic disorder or major congenital anomaly.

         21. Receipt of investigational drugs or immune globulins (with the exception of
             prophylactic anti-Rho D immune globulin) within six (6) months prior to the
             administration of the study vaccine.

         22. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the
             study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a
             systemic dose ≥10mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical, inhaled,
             and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted except for the limit established in
             exclusion criterion #1.

         23. Any other physical, psychiatric or social condition which may, in the investigator's
             opinion, increase the risks of study participation to the maternal subject or the
             fetus/infant; or may lead to the collection of incomplete or inaccurate safety data.
