  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to assess the blood pressure lowering effects of two doses of telmisartan over a
      four-week treatment period; to determine potentially effective doses for pediatric patients
      for future studies; to assess the safety and tolerability of two doses of telmisartan.

      Pharmacokinetic objectives included the determination of the steady-state pharmacokinetics of
      telmisartan in children and adolescents aged 6 to &lt;18 years, and to determine if age-related
      differences exist
