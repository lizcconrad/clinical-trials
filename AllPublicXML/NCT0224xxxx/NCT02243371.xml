      The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall survival (OS) of subjects with
      previously treated metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with cyclophosphamide
      (CY)/nivolumab/GVAX pancreas vaccine followed by nivolumab/CRS-207 (Arm A) to subjects
      treated with CY/GVAX pancreas vaccine followed by CRS-207 (Arm B).

          -  Conditions, including alcohol or drug dependence, intercurrent illness, or lack of
             sufficient peripheral venous access, that would affect the patient's ability to comply
             with study visits and procedures

          -  Unable to avoid intimate contact with another individual known to be at high risk of
             listeriosis (e.g., newborn infant, pregnant woman, HIV-positive individual) during the
