  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to evaluate, through the use of Home blood pressure monitoring
      (HBPM), the degree of BP control in the early morning hours after 8 weeks of treatment in
      patients with essential hypertension under treatment with Micardis®, Telmisartan or Micardis
      Plus®, Telmisartan hydrochlorothiazide.

      The co-primary endpoints were the degree of BP control, and change from baseline until study
      end in mean systolic blood pressure (mSBP) and mean diastolic blood pressure (mDBP) HBPM in
      the early morning hours after 8 weeks of treatment with Micardis®, Telmisartan or Micardis
      Plus®, Telmisartan hydrochlorothiazide.

      Secondary endpoints were office BP control rates, office BP response rates, and reduction in
      mSBP and mDBP Office blood pressure measurement (OBPM) from baseline to final visit,
      discontinuations and tolerability
