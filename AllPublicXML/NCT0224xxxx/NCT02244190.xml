  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the bioequivalence of the new tipranavir oral solution formulation with the
      current tipranavir oral solution formulation following single-dose administration. In each
      case, 500 mg tipranavir was coadministered with 200 mg ritonavir.
