  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality
      and health-care costs in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
      These infections are often caused by a patient's own microbial flora. Hence reduction of
      microbes in the skin could lessen the risk of contamination of central venous catheters,
      Central Line Associated Blood-Stream Infections (CLABSI), and bacteremia due to compromise of
      skin integrity.

      Theraworx™ (herein referred to as experimental wipes) is a self-drying, leave on cleansing
      agent that combines a specialized surfactant with skin healthy ingredients, including aloe,
      allantoin, vitamin E, and silver, which is the main antimicrobial ingredient. It can be used
      on all parts of the body including burns, abraded skin, and on patients with skin
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). It is user friendly and obviates the risk of antimicrobial
      resistance. Microbiologic studies have shown several log fold reduction of bacteria including
      vancomycin-resistant enterococci, carbapenem resistant Escherichia coli, and activity against
      Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile, Candida albicans, and
      viruses including influenza A and Herpes Simplex. There is no data regarding the use of
      Theraworx™ (experimental) bath wipes in children or the HSCT population.

      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to learn if daily bathing with
      experimental bath wipes will be well tolerated and associated with reduction in microbial
      skin colonization in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to receive either a daily bath with the experimental bath
      wipes, or the standard bath wipes, beginning on the day of admission, and to be used once
      daily for a period of 60 days post-HSCT. In the first 12 patients randomized to the
      experimental wipes, if no patient has grade IV skin toxicity that is attributable to the
      experimental wipes, then the trial will continue until a total of 250 evaluable participants
      have been enrolled. Assessment of skin colonization will be performed before admission, at
      the time of discharge, and post-HSCT.

      Randomization will take place at the time the participant is enrolled and will be performed
      by staff within the Nursing Research Department. Participants will be assigned to either
      experimental or standard bath wipes in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization may be stratified for
      nature of transplant (autologous vs. allogeneic); and in the case of allogeneic transplant
      stratified for total body irradiation vs. no total body irradiation. The investigators,
      practicing clinician and the clinical research staff will remain blinded to the treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the safety of the experimental bath wipes in 12 patients.

        -  Assess the skin colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci in patients using the
           experimental wipes compared to standard bath wipes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess skin colonization with bacterial pathogens.

        -  Compare the skin colonization with multi-drug resistant organisms (MRDO) and central
           line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates.

    <description>In the first 12 evaluable patients in the Theraworx™ arm of the randomized controlled trial, we will closely monitor for the safety of experimental bath wipes. Since no grade IV toxicity attributable to the wipes is expected in the standard bath wipes arm, if at any time during the study in the first 12 evaluable participants in the experimental arm we observe one patient with grade IV skin rash toxicity in the experimental arm which is attributable to the experimental bath wipes , then the study will be stopped and the use of experimental bath wipes for HSCT patients will be considered unsafe. If the use of experimental bath wipes for HSCT patients is considered feasible, the trial will continue. 95% Blyth-Still-Casella will be provided.</description>
