      The purpose of this study to assess efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy
      FOLFOXIRI with Bevacizumab (BV) as a first-line therapy in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicentre phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      Bevacizumab (BV) in combination with oxaliplatin, irinotecan hydrochloride, fluorouracil, and
      leucovorin calcium regimen ( FOLFOXIRI +BV ; Falcone et al. ASCO2013) as first-line treatment
      for Japanese metastatic colorectal cancer patients.

      This study is composed two steps because of collecting safety issue in Japanese patient.

      As First step (Step 1), It assess on the initial safety information in ten Japanese patients
      of the end of 2nd cycle. it is evaluated by DMC.

      In parallel with the confirmation of the initial safety issue, register up to 65 cases in
      total and Step 1 patient, to evaluate the efficacy and safety (Step2).
