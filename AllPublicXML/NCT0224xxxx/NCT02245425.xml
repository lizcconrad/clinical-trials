  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the short-term effects of two different thoracic spine
      thrust manipulation techniques on neck range-of-motion, pain, and self-reported disability in
      people with neck pain.

      The null hypothesis is that there will be no differences between the two manipulation
      techniques for short-term effects on neck range-of-motion, pain, and self-reported disability
      in people with neck pain.

      Patients will be involved in the study over a 4 week period. Each participant will be asked
      to attend 4 sessions, with one week in between each session as follows: Week 0 = baseline
      assessment and treatment 1; Week 1= treatment 2; Week 2 = treatment 3; and week 4 = follow-up
      assessment.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to either a supine or
      prone thoracic spine thrust manipulation intervention.

             corresponds to &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 corresponds to &quot;worst pain possible&quot;.

          -  Neck Disability Index (NDI) score &gt; 10 points (measure of self-reported disability

             spinal cord)

          -  History of spinal tumors, spinal infection, cervical spine fracture, or previous neck
             surgery

          -  Pending legal action related to current episode of neck pain

          -  Contraindications to thoracic spine thrust manipulation

               2. hyperreflexia

               3. unsteadiness during gait

               4. Nystagmus

               5. Loss of visual acuity

               6. Impaired sensation of the face
