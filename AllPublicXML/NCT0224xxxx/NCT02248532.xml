  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of REMEDIUM project is to develop personalized stem cell therapy for patients with
      chronic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The main focus of the project is
      (1) on repetitive administration of cell therapy that would allow for long-lasting
      improvements in heart function and outcome in this patient population. In parallel, the
      investigators aim to (2) develop a standardized patient-specific stem cell product that could
      be cryopreserved and stored in a stem cell bank for prolonged time periods, and used for
      therapeutic application when clinically indicated. By using a unique multimodality imaging
      platform, the goal of this project is also to (3) define standardized clinical criteria that
      would serve as a guideline for evaluation of the effects of stem cell therapy in future
      clinical trials and everyday clinical settings. Finally, to improve the clinical
      implementation of cell therapy,the investigators aim to (4) develop a stem cell delivery
      technique that could be used to treat both left and right and ventricular failure and could
      be implemented in a standardized fashion designed for a widespread clinical use.

    <description>The echocardiography data will be recorded and analyzed at the end of the study by an independent echocardiographer who will be blinded to the patient's treatment status and the timing of the recordings. Left ventricular end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume and LVEF will be estimated using the Simpson's biplane method and left ventricular end-systolic dimension and end-diastolic dimension will be measured in the parasternal long axis view. All echocardiographic measurements will be averaged for 5 cycles.. The change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between randomization and 1 year thereafter will be assessed by 2D echocardiography.</description>

    <description>Bone marrow cells will be mobilized into peripheral blood by daily subcutaneous injections of G-CSF (10 µg/kg daily) and collected by leukapheresis. Positive immunomagnetic selection of CD34+ cells will be performed. Electroanatomic mapping of the left ventricle will be performed using the Biosense NOGA system (Biosense-Webster®, Diamond Bar, CA). The target area for cell delivery will be defined as the myocardial segments with unipolar voltage potentials ≥8.3 mV, bipolar amplitudes &gt;1.9 mV, and linear shortening &lt;6%. Intramyocardial delivery of cell suspension will be performed with the MyoStar (BiosenseWebster®, Diamond Bar, CA) injection catheter. Each patient will receive 20 injections (0.3 mL each; total volume of 6 mL). All the procedures will be repeated 6 months after baseline.</description>
