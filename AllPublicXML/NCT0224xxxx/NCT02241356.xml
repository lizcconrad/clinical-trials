      Visual acuity at near improves in children with Down syndrome using bifocals
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The accommodation is consistently reduced in 50 to 100% of children with Down syndrome and
      does not improve with age.

    <description>We will calculate the percentage of participants with strabismus at baseline and at the end of the study, 16 months later. Then we can calculate the difference in percentage of participants with strabismus.</description>

    <measure>• Change in score of task readiness of the children</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 months later</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure task readiness in scores of attention, reaction time, inhibition and working memory at baseline and at the end of the study 16 months later. Then we calculate the difference in this score.</description>
