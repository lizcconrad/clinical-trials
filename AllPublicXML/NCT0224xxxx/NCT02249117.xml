  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of escalating dosages of
      recombinant human pyro-Glu MCP-1 (BIWH 3) in Duffy positive vs. Duffy negative healthy male
      volunteers: plasma levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and markers of leukocyte,
      coagulation, platelet and endothelial activation will be quantified; To examine the safety of
      BIWH 3 in this setting
