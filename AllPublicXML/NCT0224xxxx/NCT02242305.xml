      In contrast with Hyoscine Butylbromide Capsule 10mg, Study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Hyoscine Butylbromide tablets 10 mg (20mg, 3 times daily, orally) over a period of
      3 days for the treatment of occasional or recurrent episodes of self-reported gastric or

    <measure>Change of the Mean Pain Intensity Score Measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Within 3 Days (and Within 1 Day) - ANCOVA</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint presents change of the mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain intensity score, recorded daily by the patient in the evening in his/her patient diary describing pain intensity during the previous 24 hours, from the baseline pain intensity. The baseline pain intensity was the pain intensity of first episode on Day 1 after randomization before taking study medication. The mean VAS pain intensity score was calculated for the 3-day treatment period. A VAS for describing the pain intensity was used (VAS: maximum score of 10 cm, the score from 0 - 10 cm reaching from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;the most severe pain imaginable&quot;).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the Pain Frequency Assessed on 4-stage Verbal Rating Scale (VRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint presents frequency improvement, change of the pain frequency from baseline pain frequency for each of Day 1 - 3. Baseline pain frequency meant the pain frequency before randomization on visit 1. VRS score of Day 3 change from baseline was calculated. A retrospective assessment was entered by the patient in the patient diary, again once daily in the evening, of the pain frequency over the preceding 24 hour period. This was based on a 4-stage Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) with the following scores to the question: &quot;How many times have the spasm-like pains occurred today?&quot; 0 = not at all, 1 = 1-2 times, 2 = 3-5 times, 3 = more than 5 times.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Assessment of Efficacy by Patient on 4-point Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Post 3 days of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint presents global assessment of efficacy: by the patient after 3 days of treatment using a 4-point rating scale (good, satisfactory, not satisfactory, and bad).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint presents number of patients with Adverse Events (AEs). Subjects were required to report spontaneously any AEs as well as the time of onset, end and intensity of these events. Specific questions were asked wherever required or useful to more precisely describe an AE. An Adverse Event was termed serious when one of the following applied: death, directly lifethreatening, continuous or severe impairment, in-patient treatment or prolonging of hospitalization, congenital deformity and other similar medical criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Assessment of Tolerability by Investigator on a 4-point Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3.</time_frame>
    <description>The endpoint presents global assessment of tolerability by subject on a 4-point scale. Global assessment of tolerability regarding all episodes treated by the subject after 3 days of treatment (good, satisfactory, not satisfactory, bad).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Clinical Relevant Abnormalities for Laboratory, Vital Signs, ElectroCardioGram (ECG) and Physical Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of patients with findings in clinical relevant abnormalities for laboratory, vital signs, ElectroCardioGram (ECG) and physical examination. Relevant findings or worsening of baseline conditions were reported as Adverse Events (AEs).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Event for Time to Therapeutic Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of the first dose to the time that the first VAS reduction occurred, up to 180 minutes after the first dose on Day 1.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure presents percentage of event for time to therapeutic effect defined as the time that the first VAS reduction occurred.</description>

        <description>The endpoint presents change of the mean Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of pain intensity score, recorded daily by the patient in the evening in his/her patient diary describing pain intensity during the previous 24 hours, from the baseline pain intensity. The baseline pain intensity was the pain intensity of first episode on Day 1 after randomization before taking study medication. The mean VAS pain intensity score was calculated for the 3-day treatment period. A VAS for describing the pain intensity was used (VAS: maximum score of 10 cm, the score from 0 - 10 cm reaching from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;the most severe pain imaginable&quot;).</description>

Baseline pain frequency meant the pain frequency before randomization on visit 1. VRS score of Day 3 change from baseline was calculated.

This was based on a 4-stage Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) with the following scores to the question: “How many times have the spasm-like pains occurred today?” 0 = not at all, 1 = 1-2 times, 2 = 3-5 times, 3 = more than 5 times.</description>
