  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to quantify and compare changes in lung volumes (as measured
      by functional residual capacity) in premature infants stable on continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP), and then randomized to two additional weeks of CPAP and room air versus room
      air alone. We hypothesize that infants randomized to additional CPAP will demonstrate an
      increased functional residual capacity (at the end of the two week study period and prior to
      discharge) compared to those randomized to room air.
