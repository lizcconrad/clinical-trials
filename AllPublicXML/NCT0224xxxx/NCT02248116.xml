          -  Patient is able to understand the patient information and give written informed
             consent in accordance with GCP (good clinical practice) and local legislation. In case
             of doubt, a study independent physician should assess the patient. If in the opinion
             of study independent physician the patient is unable to provide written inform
             consent, a legal guardian may provide consent on behalf of the patient

          -  Patient has a relative or caregiver who has given written informed consent to provide
             trial related information for self and patient and is willing and capable of

          -  Patient and caregiver are able to complete the trial examinations, to hear, speak,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient developed a medical condition during the preceding talsaclidine trial which,
             in the opinion of the investigator may be worsened by participation in this trial

          -  Patient experienced any serious drug related adverse event (s) in the preceding
             talsaclidine trial

          -  Patient dropped out of the preceding talsaclidine trial

          -  Patient was a major protocol violator in the preceding talsaclidine trial

          -  Untreated or non-compensated hypertension (BP systolic &gt; 180 and/or diastolic &gt; 110
             mmHg)

          -  Hypertension being treated with ß-blockers

          -  Severe heart failure (NYHA: III and IV)

          -  Any arrhythmias including bradycardia with a rate of &lt;50 bpm, arrhythmias due to
             second or third degree blocks and low II-IV, ECG &lt;30 ventricular extra systoles/hour,
             multifocal or multiform and repetitive forms of ventricular extra systoles

          -  Bronchial asthma with phases of exacerbation or inducible by aspirin or other NSAIDSs

             gender, age and weight)

          -  Acute hepatic disorder (liver enzymes above 50% upper normal limit)

          -  Patient has obvious symptoms of dehydration

          -  Neoplasm currently active or likely to recur (except basal cell carcinoma, squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin and clinically significant meningioma)

          -  Pregnant and lactating women, women of childbearing potential not using an approved
             method of contraception

             clearance below 50 ml/min. (It will be calculated by the central laboratory - values
             below normal range will be flagged by the central laboratory)

          -  Patients with abnormal urinalysis results such as infection or proteinuria as defined
             by:

               -  A positive urinary bacterial culture, equal or greater than 10exp5 colony forming
                  unit (CFU)/ml or

             infection during their participation in the study 506.203 without any sign of kidney
             failure, then they are allowed to enter the study. Patients may continue in the trial
             only if the infection is confined to the lower urinary tract and without any sign of
             kidney failure, but must be discontinued otherwise

          -  Patients with a history of renal stones within the past six months

        Concomitant Therapy exclusion

          -  Benzodiazepines (brotizolam, oxazepam, temazepam, or triazolam are allowed)

          -  Antidepressants including all tricyclics (trazodone is allowed; for clinically
             relevant depressed mood the Selective Serotonine Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)
             fluoxetine or paroxetine or sertraline are allowed)

          -  Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) is excluded

          -  Use of neuroleptics within the trial: If the use of any neuroleptic is required during
             the course of the trial, the reason should be documented as an adverse event and the
             use of such medication should be limited. Use of neuroleptics should be stopped as
             soon as the patient's clinical status allows this to happen
