  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see whether or not a drug called ibrutinib can be given to
      patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) as maintenance therapy after induction chemotherapy.
      This drug blocks an enzyme that affects how the lymphocytes grow and survive. The
      investigators hope to learn how safe and effective ibrutinib is for treating patients with
      MCL after responding to induction chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate after 2 years.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess toxicity. II. Determine rates of conversion from partial response (PR) to complete
      response (CR).

      III. Determine median overall survival (OS) after 4 years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare minimal residual disease (MRD) results overtime by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      and correlate these with PFS and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days for up to 4 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      patient preference.

      After completion of study treatment, patients who completed 4 years of treatment are followed
      up at 30 days. Patients who did not complete 4 years of treatment are followed up for up to 4
      years post-first dose of treatment (every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 4
      years).
