    <textblock>
      Hypnosis may reduce patient anxiety. The main goal of this study is to determine in what
      extent, hypnosis decreases propofol requirement to induce induction of general anesthesia.

      Two particular aspects of this study are

        -  the inclusion of women undergoing one day gynecological surgical procedures

        -  the use of a closed-loop system which delivers propofol according to bispectral index to
           provide induction of anesthesia.

quality of the hypnotic trance (very deep, deep, medium, superficial, not obtained).</description>
