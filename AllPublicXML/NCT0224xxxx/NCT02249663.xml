          -  Documented positive allergic skin test, performed within the previous 12 months, to
             one or more of the allergens in season at the time the study is being conducted.

          -  A minimum of two consecutive years of previous history of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis
             (SAR) to the pollen/allergen in season at the time the study is being conducted.

          -  Eligibility requirements for placebo lead-in period: A total (composite) score of at
             least 6 on the reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) with a minimum of at least
             2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; and a minimum score of at least 2 for one of the remaining 3
             symptoms and total (composite) score of at least 4 on the reflective Total Ocular
             Symptom Score (rTOSS). These scores represent the 12 hours before the screening visit.

          -  In addition to requirements above, patients should have the following at the end of
             the placebo lead-in period and before randomization: 1) average composite score of at
             least 6 on the rTNSS with a minimum average score of at least 2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot;
             and a minimum average score of at least 2 for one of the remaining 3 symptoms, and 2)
             average composite score of at least 4 on the rTOSS. These scores represent the 3 days
             of the 7 day placebo run-in period before the Randomization visit and the morning of
             the first day of the Randomization visit.

          -  Patients who suffer from chronic signs and symptoms of Perennial Allergic Rhinitis
             (PAR) should be excluded from the study unless the Investigator assesses that the
             patient's current signs and symptoms are a clear exacerbation of Seasonal Allergic
             Rhinitis (SAR) rather than the chronic PAR.

          -  Patients who suffer only from PAR or SAR to a different allergen than that in season
             at the time the study is conducted.

          -  Previous history of less than 2 years of SAR to the pollen/allergen in season at the
             time the study is conducted.

          -  Before the placebo lead-in period, the patient has a total score of less than 6 on the
             rTNSS or a score less than 2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot;. Any patient who meets the minimum
             individual nasal symptom score requirements at the start of the placebo lead-in period
             but no longer meets the requirements prior to the randomized active treatment period
             of the study cannot continue in the active treatment period.
