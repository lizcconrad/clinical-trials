  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to show that telmisartan is not inferior to metoprolol succinate in
      respect of the percentage change from baseline in LVMI(H) after a 6.5 months treatment
      period. As secondary objectives, the improvement in left ventricular systolic and diastolic
      function and blood pressure reduction were assessed
