  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test the hypothesis that ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in
      hypertensive subjects is more effective when a ROX coupler is inserted concurrently.

  <detailed_description>

      The single blinded, randomised study is planned to commence in October 2014 after obtaining
      Research Ethics Committee and NHS Research and Development approval. A target of 20
      participants with symptomatic paroxysmal AF will be recruited. All participants will be
      blinded and randomised to AF ablation only or AF ablation + ROX coupler implant. All
      participants will have right and left heart catheterisation prior to AF ablation +/- ROX
      coupler insertion. Participants will be followed up 6 weeks, 3, 6 months and 12 months after
      the ablation. The study will take place at Eastbourne District General. The study duration
      per patient is 13months. The overall study duration will be 18 months.
