      The trial is composed by 3 parts: 1) On-boat screening period for seasickness and safety
      tests will be evaluated in minus one day. 2) 4 weeks of washout period to eliminate the
      impact of voyage experience. 3) On-boat drug testing period. The subjects will be
      administered the drug before voyage. The seasickness symptoms will be evaluated during
      voyage. The safety test will be conducted before and after one day of on-boat testing.
