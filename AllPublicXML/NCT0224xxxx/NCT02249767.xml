    <textblock>
      This was a double-blind, randomized, three-treatment, parallel study. Normal, healthy male
      and female children and adults (i.e., ages 12 to 40 years) with at least Grade 2 (i.e., mild
      severity) acne vulgaris were treated on the full face once daily for 84 days with the
      Tretinoin Gel 0.05%, Brand (tretinoin) Gel 0.05%, or Gel Vehicle. Acne lesions were graded by
      a single blinded observer at screening and at Weeks 0 (i.e., baseline), 2, 4, 8, and 12 at
      each location.

      This was a double-blind, randomized, three-treatment, parallel study conducted at three
      locations with a single investigator. Normal, healthy male and female children and adults
      (i.e., ages 12 to 40 years) with at least Grade 2 (i.e., mild severity) acne vulgaris were
      treated on the full face once daily for 84 days with the Tretinoin Gel 0.05%, Brand
      (tretinoin) Gel 0.05%, or Gel Vehicle. Acne lesions were graded by a single blinded observer
      at screening and at Weeks 0 (i.e., baseline), 2, 4, 8, and 12 at each location.

      The assigned study treatment was self-applied topically once daily for 84 consecutive days.
      Scheduled study visits included:

        -  Visit 1 (Baseline Visit, Day 0)

        -  Visit 2 (First Interim Visit, Day 14)

        -  Visit 3 (Second Interim Visit, Day 28)

        -  Visit 4 (Third Interim Visit, Day 56)

        -  Visit 5 (Forth Interim Visit, Day 84)

      A window of ± 4 days was considered acceptable for each scheduled visit following the
      Baseline Visit. Subjects were admitted into the study if they had a clinical diagnosis of
      acne vulgaris and if they met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. During the study visits, the
      following procedures were performed:

        -  Counts of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and nodulocystic lesions

        -  The Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA)

        -  Assessment of application site reactions Safety was assessed by the monitoring of AEs
           and documenting signs and/or symptoms of application site reactions.
