        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients have to sign and date an informed consent consistent with International
             committee on harmonisation (ICH) - Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines prior to
             participation in the trial, which included medication washout and restrictions

          2. All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and must
             meet the following spirometric criteria:

             Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an
             FEV1 ≤ 60% of predicted normal and FEV1 ≤ 70% of FVC (Visits 1 and 2)

          3. All patients must have an increase in FEV1 of at least 12% from baseline 45 min after
             inhalation of 80 μg of ipratropium inhaled via Hydro Fluoro Alkane (HFA) - Metered
             Dose Inhaler (MDI)

          4. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older. Female patients of child bearing
             potential could not participate in this study

          5. Patients must be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of more than 10
             pack/years

               -  (Patients who have never smoked cigarettes must be excluded)

          6. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with significant diseases other than Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
             (COPD) must be excluded. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the
             opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of
             participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study
             or the patient's ability to participate in the study

          2. Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry, or
             urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a significant disease

          3. Patients with significant prostatic hyperplasia

          4. Patients with a recent history (i.e. one year or less) of myocardial infarction

             been hospitalized for such an event within the past year

          6. Patients with a history (less than 3 years) of cardiac failure, cor pulmonale or
             cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy

          7. Patients with a malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation
             therapy or chemotherapy within the last five years. Patients with treated basal cell
             carcinoma are allowed

          8. Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma

          9. Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or who have a total blood
             eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3. A repeat eosinophil count was not conducted in these
             patients

         10. Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or clinically evident bronchiectasis

         11. Patients with known active tuberculosis

         12. Patients with a history of and/or active significant alcohol or drug abuse

         13. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history of thoracotomy for other reasons must be excluded

         14. Patients who have completed a pulmonary rehabilitation program in the six weeks prior
             to the Screening Visit (Visit 1)

         15. Patients who regularly used daytime oxygen therapy

         16. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within one month or six half lives
             (whichever is greater) prior to Screening Visit (Visit 1)

         17. Patients who are being treated with oral beta-adrenergic

         18. Patients who are being treated with beta-blockers

         19. Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium

         20. Patients who are being treated with antihistamines (H1 receptor antagonists),
             antileukotrienes or leukotriene receptor antagonists for asthma or excluded allergic
             conditions

         21. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable doses (i.e., less than six
             weeks on a stable dose) or at doses in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone
             per day or 20 mg every other day

         22. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, beta-adrenergic,
             lactose or any other components of the medication delivery systems

         23. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential. Female patients have to
             be either:

               -  Surgically sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or

               -  Post-menopausal for at least two years

         24. Patients with previous participation (receipt of randomized treatment) in this study

         25. Patients who are participating in another study

         26. The randomization of patients with any respiratory infection or COPD exacerbation in
             the six weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period
             must be postponed. Patients could be randomized six weeks following recovery from the
             infection or exacerbation
