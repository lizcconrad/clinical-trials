      The purpose of study is to investigate if yoga exercise improve life quality and immune
      status in breast cancer patients after complete treatment (including surgery and / or
      radiotherapy and / or chemotherapy)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well-known that exercise promote immune regulation for better life quality. However,
      the mechanism for better immunity and life quality is not clear. We postulate that Ayurveda
      yoga might benefit breast cancer women with completion of operation and/or chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy. The benefits could be due to immune modulation, and improve health perception
      and life quality, and even potential decrease of cancer relapse.

      The study patients will do yoga twice a week for 12 weeks. The study primary endpoints are 1)
      to improve personal health perception, 2) to improve life quality and 3) to enhance human
      immunity. The study secondary endpoint will follow up the immunity changes 3 months after the
      intervention.

      We anticipate to reach the primary endpoints and to publish the primary results in one year,
      the secondary endpoint will complete in the second year.
