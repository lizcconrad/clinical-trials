      Purposes are to determine whether various cohorts of bladder cancer patients have detectable
      tCTC's, determine it tCTC levels vary with the natural history of bladder cancer and to see
      if tCTC's provide novel information.Study population are various cohorts of patients
      diangosed with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.Procedures include a venous blood draw, up
      to two times, over a 6 month period for collection of tCTC's. Up to 15 mL's of blood will be
      collected at each blood draw.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a.Urothelial carcinoma or mixed urothelial carcinoma arising from the bladder

          -  b.Age 18 or older

          -  Inclusions by cohort Cohort 1. Patients with localized muscle-invasive disease
             (cT1,cN0, M0) at the time of initial diagnosis or who have progressed from superficial
             disease (cT2) who have not had any systemic chemotherapy and who will be treated with
             upfront radical cystectomy. PriorTURBT and intravesical therapies are allowed but
             should not have been done within one week of CTC measurement. If the patient is found
             to have no evidence of tumor (pT0) upon evaluation of the cystectomy specimen, the
             patient will not be dropped. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression
             by any clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the
             patient will be dropped from Cohort 1 and included in Cohort 9 instead.

          -  Cohort 2. Patients with localized muscle-invasive disease (cT1, cN0, M0) at the time
             of initial diagnosis prior to definitivechemo-radiation. Prior TURBT and intravesical
             therapies are allowed but should not have been done within one week of CTC
             measurement. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression by anyclinical
             evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the patient will be
             droppedfrom Cohort 2 and included in Cohort 9 instead.

          -  Cohort 3. Patients with localized muscle-invasive disease (cT1, cN0, M0) at the time
             of initial diagnosis or who have progressed from superficial disease (cT2) who have
             not had any systemic chemotherapy and who will be treated with neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy. Prior TURBT and intravesical therapies are allowed but should not have
             been done within one week of CTC measurement. If the patient is found to have evidence
             of progression by any clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the
             post-treatment sample, the patient will be dropped from Cohort 3 and included in
             Cohort 9 instead.

          -  Cohort 4. Patients with metastatic disease (anyT, anyN, M1) at initial presentation or
             recurrent after definitive treatment prior to any salvage systemic chemotherapy. If
             the patient is found to have evidence of progression by any clinical evaluation
             performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the patient will be dropped
             from Cohort 4 and included in Cohort 9 instead.

          -  Cohort 5. Patients with newly diagnosed non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (T2) prior
             to any intravesical therapy. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression
             by any clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the
             patient will be dropped.

          -  Cohort 6. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy with
             or without peri-operative systemic chemotherapy (pT2, anyN, M0) who will be treated
             with adjuvant radiation. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression by
             any clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the
             patient will be dropped from Cohort 6 and includedin Cohort 9 instead.

          -  Cohort 7. Patients with a history of muscle invasive bladder cancer (cT1, any N,M0)
             who have no evidence of disease at least 2 years after the date of radical cystectomy.
             If the patient is found to have evidence of progression by any clinical evaluation
             performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the patient will be dropped
             from Cohort 7 but may be considered for inclusion in Cohort 4.

          -  Cohort 8. Patients with a history of muscle invasive bladder cancer (cT1, any N, M0)
             who have no evidence of disease at least 2 years after the completion of definitive
             chemo-radiation. If the patient is found to have evidence of progression by any
             clinical evaluation performed within 2 months of the post-treatment sample, the
             patient will be dropped from Cohort 8 but may be considered for inclusion in Cohort 4.

          -  Cohort 9. Patients who were initially included in Cohorts 1-6 but were found to have
             progression at the time of their post-treatment blood draw. Of note, patients may be
             included in more than one cohort over time so long as inclusion and exclusion criteria
             are met. In addition, twenty samples from normal controls without any history of
             malignancy will be used for this study but havealready been collected as part of a
             separate protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pure squamous or pure adenocarcinoma bladder cancer histology. This exclusion may be
             waved at the discretion of the protocol PI. 2. Prior cancer diagnosed within 3 years
             of enrollment other than a prior bladder, prostate, or skin cancer. This exclusion may
             be waved at the discretion of the protocol PI.
