  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that bilateral handgrip force training would result in
      significant improvements in paretic hand, arm movements and daily functional performances. In
      order to investigate whether the improvement of paretic hand could facilitate the motor
      recovery of paretic arm and functional performances, the investigators also hypothesized that
      motor recovery and functional performances improvements of paretic arm and hand have strongly
      correlation.

      Objective: To investigate the training effects of interlimb force coupling training on
      paretic hand and upper extremity outcomes in patients with chronic stroke; to analyze the
      relationship between motor recovery of paretic hand, arm and functional abilities.

      Design: A double-blind randomized controlled trial with outcome assessment at baseline and
      after 4 weeks intervention.

      Setting: Department of physical medicine and rehabilitation in Taipei Veterans General
      Hospital.

      Participants: Thirty-three subjects (mean age = 55.1 ± 10.5 y/o) with chronic stroke were
      recruited and randomized assigned to training (n=16) and control group (n=17).

      Interventions: Interlimb force coupling training task included different gripforce generation
      on the both hands.

      Main Outcome Measures: Barthel Index (BI), and the upper extremity motor control of
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), Motor Assessment Score (MAS), and the Wolf Motor Function
      Test (WMFT). All assessment was executed by a blinded evaluator, and data management and
      statistical analysis was also conducted by a blinded statistic researcher.
