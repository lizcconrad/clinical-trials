  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of treatment with telmisartan on patients in
      whom the systolic BP is approximately 12 weeks after starting treatment under control for the
      first time between patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) at the beginning to
      patients with systolic/diastolic hypertension (SDH)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 55, with no upper limit

          -  Patient who has been treated and followed up for more than 12 months by the same
             general practitioner (GP)

          -  Hypertension measured at least once during the past 12 months and not under control at
             the time of inclusion in the study:

               -  isolated systolic hypertension, namely systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and
                  diastolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or

               -  systolic/diastolic hypertension, namely systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and
                  diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg; or

               -  systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mmHg, if the
                  patient has diabetes or chronic renal insufficiency

          -  Treatment with one or more antihypertensives which remains unchanged during the month
             prior to collecting the data

          -  Decision by the GP to add telmisartan (either in combination with hydrochlorothiazide
             (HCTZ) or not) to the antihypertensive treatment; this decision is made by the
             treating doctor regardless of participation in the study. The prescription is issued
             in the normal way, in accordance with the conditions set down in the marketing
             authorisation

          -  Written informed consent of the patient to collect his/her data

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient refuses to allow his/her data to be collected

          -  Change in the antihypertensive treatment during the month prior to collection of the
             data

          -  Blood pressure under control

          -  The recommended target values corresponding to control of diastolic and systolic blood
             pressure are important because of the diseases associated with hypertension
             consequently, and in order to prevent the collection process becoming too complicated,
             data from patients with severe renal insufficiency or with proteinuria of ≥ 1 g/L or
             more are not collected in the context of this study
