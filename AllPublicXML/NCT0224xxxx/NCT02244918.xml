  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are testing if counseling alone or counseling plus over-the-counter nicotine
      replacement therapies (NRT), like the patch,gum, or lozenge, helps African American non-daily
      smokers quit smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-daily smokers represent a growing number of racial/ethnic minority smokers. 1 out of 4
      African Americans are non-daily smokers. African Americans seem to have a harder time
      quitting and have greater medical problems related to smoking even at lighter usage rates
      compared to Whites.

      Current tobacco treatment guidelines target daily smokers. There are no guidelines for
      non-daily smokers. This study will allow the researchers to explore treatment options for
      African American non-daily smokers and find out if some treatments work better than others.

      Participation in this study will last about 6 months. Over this course of time, participants
      will be asked to visit the study location 3 times and will talk with a member of the study
      team on the phone 4 times.
