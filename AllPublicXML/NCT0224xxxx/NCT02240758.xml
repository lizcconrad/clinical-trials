  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) could be a useful tool for real-time diagnosis of brain
      lesions (initial diagnosis or follow-up post resection to check for residual dysplasia) and
      real-time assessment of resections margins during surgery. Probe-based CLE using the
      CELLVIZIO® has never been used for glioma surgical guided resection. Before assessing the
      potential of this technique in improving surgical resection outcome, a feasability study has
      to be performed.

    <intervention_name>confocal endomicroscopy with the CELLVIZIO® system (Mauna Kea technology)</intervention_name>
    <description>The CELLVIZIO® system (Mauna Kea technology) will be used for confocal endomicroscopy during a surgical procedure (either open surgical approach or stereotaxic biopsy). The probe dedicated to the CELLVIZIO® system will be positioned against the surface of the brain, sequences will be acquired, and finally compared with anatomapathology exams. Two specific medications will be used as contrast agent in the study: Fluorescein FAURE 500mg/5mL IV with a maximum of two doses per patient OR 5 amino-levulinic hydrochloride (GLIOLAN, MEDAC) orally at the dose of 20mg/kg of body weight.</description>
