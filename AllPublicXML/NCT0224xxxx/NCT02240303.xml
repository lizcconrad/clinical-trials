  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project will be to document the central and peripheral mechanisms, which may
      predict clinical pain characteristics and associated physical performance in older adults.
      Although chronic pain is common among older adults, there is limited understanding on the
      processing of pain and the mechanisms by which it affects physical function in these
      individuals. The first aim of this study will be to examine predictors of clinical pain in
      older adults. These will include a comprehensive somatosensory assessment battery including
      mechanical and thermal detection and pain thresholds in older adults with and without chronic
      pain. The investigators will also assess basal cognitive and physical function to determine
      their associations with chronic pain. Finally, brain structure and function will be assessed
      in these older adults with and without pain.

      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about how pain in older individuals
      changes the brain and impacts a person's mobility and function. Pain is influenced by biology
      (like hormones), psychology (thoughts and feelings), and habits (like sleep or exercise) that
      may make older adults more likely to have higher or lower levels of pain.

    <description>Participants that experience chronic pain will have the following procedures performed: A sensory assessment called quantitative sensory testing or QST that will assess in detail your ability to feel sensations due to touch, vibration, and changes in temperature on the skin; Pressure sense will be produced by a device that will be pressed against the skin for several seconds; Pinprick pressure will be applied to determine if the pain can be rated; a Physical Performance test will be performed; and an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be done. In addition, blood sample, blood pressure, heart rate, and skin temperature will be taken during the procedures.</description>
