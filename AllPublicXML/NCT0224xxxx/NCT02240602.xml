  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain control is required after major abdominal surgery, including laparoscopic
      colorectal surgery. Intravenous oxycodone is widely used for postoperative acute pain control
      mainly in Europe. The aim of this study is to evaluate the optimal dose of intravenous
      oxycodone for pain control after laparoscopic colorectal surgery in Korean.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxycodone is known to be effective in pain control and has less sedative effect than morphine
      does. It has been described that distribution of cytochrome P450, which is associated with
      metabolism of oxycodone, differed between the races. Proper dose of intravenous oxycodone
      after major abdominal surgery has not been well defined in Korean. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the optimal dose of intravenous oxycodone for pain control after laparoscopic
      colorectal surgery in Korean based on pain score and side effects.
