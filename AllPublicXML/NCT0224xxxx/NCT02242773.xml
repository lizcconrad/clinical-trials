      1. Multiparametric MRI ultrasound (MRIus)-guided or direct MRI-guided biopsies will allow
           for more directed sampling of the tumors from compartments with distinct
           multiparametric-MRI (MP-MRI) characteristics, termed habitats, that will increase the
           rate of &quot;progression&quot; on early (first and second) surveillance biopsies and decrease the
           rate of &quot;progression&quot; on late (third and further) surveillance biopsies compared to
           historic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy rates.

        2. Identifying higher risk tumor early on will reduce the proportions of patients with poor
           response to delayed primary treatment.

        3. Radiomics signatures from MP-MRI will define patterns that are associated with
           progression.

        4. Genomic signatures based on RNA from tumor tissue will define patterns that are
           associated with habitats and radiomics signatures, as well as progression.

      Single arm therapeutic trial investigating the impact of MRI and MRI-US fusion biopsy to
      identify higher grade or volume tumors early on for better selection of patients for active
      surveillance and improved outcomes for those undergoing delayed treatment after initial
      observation.. MRI-US fusion biopsy will include targeting of suspicious areas seen on MRI as
      well as segmented sampling of the remaining gland. Patients will undergo MRI and MRI-US
      fusion biopsy within 3 months of enrollment in the trial and have repeat MRI-US fusion
      biopsies every year to assess overall rates and the temporal distribution of progression.
      Serum, urine and prostate biopsy tissue will be serially collected to investigate the
      association between various molecular biomarkers and radiologic and histological progression.

    <description>To determine if multiparametric MRI and MRI-US fusion biopsies increase the rate of progression (conversion to treatment) within the first two non-diagnostic biopsies after undergoing active surveillance as compared to historical cohorts using standard ultrasound guided biopsies.
Progression refers to a repeat surveillance biopsy indicating any one of the following:
More than 4 positive cores involving any grade of cancer,
At least two core with Gleason 3+4 cancer,
Any single core with Gleason 4+3 cancer or higher,
A Gleason 3+3 at diagnosis that is upgraded to Gleason 3+4, or
Undergoing treatment, regardless of histological progression.</description>
