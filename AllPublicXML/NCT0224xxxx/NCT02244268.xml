      The aims of this observational study are to identify the primary BPH symptoms responsible for
      the patients to consult a urologic practice, resulting in the prescription of ALNA®, to
      assess the clincial efficacy on an improved occupational performance of the patients being
      still employed. Additionally to obtain relevant information for the 5-year report of
      experience with this product according to the requirements in § 49, para 6 of the German
