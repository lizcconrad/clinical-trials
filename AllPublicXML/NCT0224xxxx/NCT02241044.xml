      Background:

      A second endoscopic method added to injection therapy is recommended for high-risk bleeding
      peptic ulcers. Many endoscopic devices have been proved as useful hemostatic instruments,
      whereas the hemostatic efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) has not been widely
      investigated.

      Aim:

      This study was designed to know whether additional APC treatment could influence the
      hemostatic efficacy after endoscopic injection therapy in treating high-risk bleeding ulcers.

      Methods:

      From October 2010 to January 2012, eligible patients who had high-risk bleeding ulcers were
      admitted to our hospital. They prospectively randomly underwent either APC therapy plus
      distilled water injection or distilled water injection alone. Pantoprazole infusion was
      conducted during the fasting period after endoscopy and orally for 8 weeks to encourage ulcer
      healing. Episodes of rebleeding were retreated with endoscopic combination therapy. Patients
      who did not benefit from retreatment underwent emergency surgery or transarterial
      embolization (TAE).

      Patients and methods Study cohort Patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB)
      who were admitted to Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital between January 2011 and January
      2012 were screened. Inclusion criteria were (i) over 20 years of age and (ii) patients with
      high-risk peptic ulcer bleeding. Acute hemorrhage from upper gastrointestine was defined as
      classical presentation with hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, and/or melena. High-risk
      bleeding ulcers were defined as participants with stigmata of a bleeding visible vessels (eg,
      spurting, oozing), a non-bleeding visible vessels (NBVV) or adherent clot.4 A NBVV at
      endoscopy was defined as a raised red, red-blue or pale hemispheric vessel protruding from
      the ulcer bed, without active bleeding. An adherent clot was defined as an overlying blood
      clot that was resistant to vigorous irrigation.

      Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) the presence of another possible bleeding site (eg,
      gastroesophageal varix, gastric cancer, reflux esophagitis); (ii) coexistence of actively
      severe ill diseases (eg, septic shock, stroke, myocardial infarction, surgical abdomen);
      (iii) treatment with an anticoagulant (eg, warfarin); (iv) pregnancy; (v) the presence of
      operated stomach or; (vi) refusal to participate in the study.

      In current study, baseline characteristics of both study groups were collected at the first
      24 hours after admission. Some definitions of events were expressed herein: smoking was
      defined as inhalation of smoke from burning tobacco daily in recent 3 months; habitual
      consumption of alcohol was defined as participants imbibing alcohol twice or more per week in
      recent 3 months; shock was considered systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or diastolic
      less than 60 mmHg, and heart rate over 100 beats per minute; comorbid diseases included
      unresolved malignancy, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, uremia, congestive heart failure,
      chronic pulmonary obstructive disease and pneumonia; and coagulopathy was defined as
      prothrombin time &gt; 14 seconds and/or activated partial thromboplastin time &gt; 45 seconds.

      Randomization In this prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, eligible
      patients were randomized into two groups using opaque-sealed envelopes numbered according to
      a table of random numbers before the fist therapeutic endoscopy (index endoscopy): the
      Combined group and the Injection group. Informed consent was obtained from each enrolled
      participant. Combined group patients received APC therapy following distilled water injection
      at index endoscopy. Injection group patients underwent distilled water alone at index
      endoscopy. Thereafter both treatment groups were treated with intravenous pantoprazole
      (Pantoloc i.v., Nycomed GmbH, Singen, Germany) 40 mg every 12 hours during the first 3 days,
      followed by oral pantoprazole (Pantoloc, Takeda GmbH, Oranienburg, Germany) 40 mg daily until
      the end of 56-day study period. Primary end point was rebleeding. Secondary end points
      included initial hemostasis, the need for surgery, transfusion requirements, the period of
      hospitalization, severe adverse event (stricture, obstruction or perforation) and death at 30
      days postrandomization.

    <description>Argon plasma coagulation therapy was realized by an Olympus electrosurgical unit/APC unit (PSD-60/Endoplasma, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and its catheters were 2.3mm and 3.5 mm equipped with different endoscope channels.7 APC treatment used a coagulation mode at gas flow/power settings of 1.5L/min and 40 watt for duodenal ulcers and 40-60 watt for gastric ulcers.10 Operative distance between the probe and target bleeding ranged from 2 to 8 mm. Air warranted to be sucked frequently at endoscopy in an attempt at decrease of APC-induced smoke and gastric decompensation, with appropriate treatment of high-risk bleeding ulcers.</description>
