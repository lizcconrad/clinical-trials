      Background and Objectives: Patients with liver cirrhosis are more prone to develop reduced
      bone mineral density i.e. hepatic osteodystrophy (HOD). It includes both osteopenia and
      osteoporosis and may lead to increased fracture risks. There is scanty data on prevalence of
      HOD in Indian population and its treatment outcome. The investigators aimed to determine
      prevalence of HOD, factors associated with it and the impact of bisphosphonates on bone
      mineral density in patients with liver cirrhosis.

      Patients and Methods: Consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis admitted at Sir Ganga Ram
      Hospital, New Delhi between August 2012 and July 2013 were enrolled. Patients with chronic
      kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism and those on steroids were excluded. Bone mineral density
      (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the lumbar spine and femoral
      neck. Osteopenia and osteoporosis were defined according to WHO criteria. All patients also
      underwent 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D, sex hormone (testosterone in male and LH and Estradiol in
      female) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) along with routine investigations. Transient
      elastography was also done in all patients. Ibandronic acid 150 mg per day orally for six
      months was given in patients with osteoporosis and DEXA scan repeated.
