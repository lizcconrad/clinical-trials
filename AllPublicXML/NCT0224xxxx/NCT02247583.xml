      Prospective non-interventional non-controlled multicenter observational study to evaluate
      aspects of pharmaceutical care in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with an
      oral anti-cancer drug.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the patient perspective in the treatment of
      advanced renal cell carcinoma with an oral anti-cancer drug.

      The following aspects will be investigated:

        -  Intrinsic desire for information about treatment.

        -  Patient satisfaction with treatment information.

        -  Patient satisfaction with treatment.

        -  Medication adherence.

        -  Health-related quality of life.

        -  The role of different health care professionals in the treatment of RCC with oral drugs

      This study should reveal information necessary for the development of pharmacotherapeutic
      care concepts that meet the needs of cancer patients treated with an oral anti-cancer drug
      over a long period.

    <description>At the first visit patients will receive their anti-cancer medication by the hospital in a pill box which electronically records openings cf. Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMSÂ®, Aardex). The recorded information in this chip will be read in the hospital pharmacy each time the patient gets new capsules. This information is strictly confidential and can only be consulted by the research team at the KULeuven.</description>
