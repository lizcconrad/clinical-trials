      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if inhaled granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
      factor delay the increase in alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, compared to no treatment,
      for adult patients with mild-to-moderate autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in China
      over a two-year period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP, previously known as idiopathic PAP) is a rare
      interstitial lung disease elicited by the formation of autoantibodies which neutralize the
      activity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) which decreases
      macrophage clearance of surfactant.

      Currently, the standard treatment strategy for PAP is whole lung lavage (WLL)，which is
      invasive and has limitations. Inhaled GM-CSF therapy became a new option for PAP patients not
      only because of its effectiveness and safety, but it is convenient way for patients who are
      reluctant to do operation as well. We are planning to prospectively evaluate if inhaled
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor would delay the increase in
      alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (A-aDO2, which is the most sensitive factor in evaluating
      APAP5), compared to placebo, for patients with mild-to-moderate autoimmune pulmonary alveolar
      over a two-year period.

      A total of 42 subjects with APAP who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled at Peking
      Union Medical College Hospital and Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. After observe APAP patients
      for 3 months to rule out patients who resolved spontaneously, the participants will undergo
      randomization (by random number table)and stratified into two different groups by their DSS.
      Then they will be treated by GM-CSF (using nebulizer, 150ug bid) every other week or no
      treatment for 6 months, and will be followed on an outpatient basis at 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6,
      9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months after initiation of therapy.

        Accessible population:

        Adult patients with mild-to-moderate autoimmune pulmonary alveolar and without spontaneous
        remission will be enrolled at Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Nanjing Drum Tower
        Hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult autoimmune PAP subjects will be included: 1) a positive PAS stain from BALF or
             lung biopsy; 2) high level of serum anti-GM-CSF antibody (&gt;2.39ug/ml, the cut-off
             point in our hospital); 3) age above 18 years old; 4) exclude hereditary and secondary
             PAP.

          -  Able to give written informed consent and comply with the requirements of the study.

          -  Patients are not eligible for the whole lung lavage (WLL), decided by clinicians.

          -  Eligibility for GM-CSF inhalation: 1) Disease severity score (DSS) is 1-3; 2) No
             treatment with GM-CSF therapy or WLLin the 3 months prior to enrollment. Definition of
             DSS2: 1, no symptom and PaO2&gt;=70mmHg；2, PaO2&gt;=70mmHg with symptoms；3, PaO2&gt;=60 and

          -  Patients will be observed for 3 months and all APAP patients who resolved
             spontaneously will be excluded from our study.
