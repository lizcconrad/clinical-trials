        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma (International Classification of
             Disease for Oncology [ICD-O] morphology 9500/3) confirmed by MSKCC pathologic review

          -  Patients must have high-risk neuroblastoma as defined by the COG Risk Stratification
             Schema

             o Patients with International agreement on staging (INSS) stage 4 are eligible with
             the following:

          -  MYCN amplification, regardless of age or additional biologic features

          -  Age &gt;18 months, regardless of biologic features OR

          -  Age 12-18 months, with any of the 3 following unfavorable biologic OR features: MYCN
             amplification, unfavorable pathology, and/or DNA index = 1

             o Patients with INSS stage 3 are eligible with the following:

          -  MYCN amplification, regardless of age or additional biologic features OR

          -  Age &gt; 18 months with unfavorable pathology, regardless of MYCN status

             o Patients with INSS stage 2a or 2b are eligible with the following:

          -  MYCN amplification, regardless of age or additional biologic features

             o Patients with INSS stage 4s are eligible with the following:

          -  MYCN amplification, regardless of additional biologic features Patients must have
             undergone chemotherapy and surgery for high-risk neuroblastoma prior to enrollment on
             trial.

          -  Age at time of enrollment of ≥1 year and ≤18 years

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within
             14 days of radiation start.

          -  Female patients who are lactating must agree to stop breast-feeding.

          -  Sexually active patients of childbearing potential must agree to use effective
             contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with gross residual tumor after surgical resection

          -  Patients who have received prior radiotherapy at or adjacent to the primary tumor bed

          -  Patients with any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition or disease which, in the
             investigator's judgment, would make them inappropriate candidates for entry into this
             study.
