  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial with a crossover design to determine patients' preference for
      capecitabine in combination with bevacizumab or everolimus in combination with exemestane for
      advanced breast cancer patients and to evaluate, if any combination is associated with a
      better quality of life.

      To identify patients' preference for either therapy in this trial, patients without disease
      progression or other reasons for early discontinuation will be asked for their treatment
      preference and their treatment satisfaction. To correlate patients' preference with other
      patient reported outcomes (PROs), quality of life (QoL) will be assessed at baseline and
      throughout the study, using dedicated questionnaires.

      With similarly active treatment options, it is of utmost importance to identify the treatment
      that has the least negative impact on the patients' quality of life.
