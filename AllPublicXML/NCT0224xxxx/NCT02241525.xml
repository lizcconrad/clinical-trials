      Examine the feasibility and efficacy of individually optimized uniform contrast enhancement
      in CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolic disease.

    <textblock>
      Patient characteristics, qualitative image quality scores, and quantitative contrast
      enhancement and CNR will be described using mean values and standard deviations for
      continuous variables, and frequencies and percent for categorical variables. Difference
      between the two patient groups will be compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests and
      chi-square statistics for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. All statistical
      tests will be performed at a significance level of 0.05.

    <description>A secondary endpoint is to quantitatively evaluate (by comparison analysis) the contrast enhancement and CNR of CTPA scans. Twenty patients (20) will be enrolled and scanned with the RESEARCH procedures. Another twenty retrospective patients (20) with matching age and BMI will be selected from existing patients with a CLINICAL STANDARD of Care CTPA scan and enrolled on retrospective protocol:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 18 years old or older

          -  Patients who have been recommended for CTPA scan for the diagnosis of pulmonary;
             thromboembolic disease (PE) in the Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear
             Medicine at the University of Maryland-Patients whose body mass index (BMI) is greater
             than 30 kg/m2.

          -  Patients whose body mass index (BMI) is greater than 30 kg/m2

          -  Patients who signed the University of Maryland Medical Center Consent for Intravenous
             Contrast Administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women; Female participants of childbearing age (10 - 60
             years) will be screened for their pregnancy status prior to study registration, by
             following the Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine CLINICAL
             STANDARD Procedure DI-AOP-003 &quot;Pregnancy Screening Documentation&quot;; - Patients with
             decreased renal function34-36. This is evaluated by blood work checked within 30 days
             prior to the CTPA scan with contrast. Patients cannot receive contrast if their BUN
             index is not within [7-20] or creatinine is not within [0.5 - 1.4] mg/dL

          -  Patients with decreased renal function34-36. This is evaluated by blood work checked
             within current admission for inpatients or within 30 days for outpatients prior to the
             CTPA scan with contrast. Patients cannot receive contrast if their serum creatinine
             level exceeds 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Patients with known moderate or severe allergic reactions to contrast, including but
             not limited to: shortness of breath, a change in baseline vital signs, such as a
             change in blood pressure, tachycardia, increased respirations that can progress to
             major respiratory distress, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, arrhythmias, convulsions,
             and cardiopulmonary arrest.
