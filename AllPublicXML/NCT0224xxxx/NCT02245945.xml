    <description>Participants will be instructed to use TFV 1% vaginal gel according to the BAT 24 regimen (2 gel doses) at least twice per week, regardless of sexual frequency.
The BAT24 dosing regimen when used with sex is defined as one dose of gel within 12 hours before sex and a second dose of gel as soon as possible within 12 hours after sex and no more than two doses in a 24 hour period. Participants who do engage in sexual intercourse should use the BAT24 regimen with each sex act.
If used without sex, the BAT24 dosing regimen is defined as 2 doses of gel administered 2-24 hours apart, with no more than two doses in a 24 hour period.</description>
