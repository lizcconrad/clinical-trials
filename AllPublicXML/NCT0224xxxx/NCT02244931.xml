      The purpose of this study is to compare three assisting devices to propel personal
      wheelchairs (Servomatic A©, Servomatic B© and E.Motion©) to the standard personal manual
      wheelchair in patients with spinal cord injury.

      The objective of the study is to compare three assisting devices to propel personal
      wheelchairs (Servomatic A©, Servomatic B© and E.Motion©) to the standard personal manual
      wheelchair in patients with spinal cord injury.

      The study consists of three distinct and independent phases:

        -  Phase 1: Performance evaluation on wheelchair ergometer in order to compare the energy
           expenditure and kinetic characteristics in comparable situations with regard to speed
           and workload imposed to the wheelchair-patient couple.

        -  Phase 2: Comparison of maneuverability and ease of crossing usual obstacles in outdoor
           and indoor paths with standardised obstacles. Trajectories are to be recorded in order
           to allow analysis by independent experts.

        -  Phase 3: Comparison of the autonomy of patients afforded by the devices by comparing the
           patient's ability to transfer from wheelchair to car seat and from car seat to
           wheelchair, as well as ease of wheelchair packing in car, in the context of a standard
           city transport involving a car and the wheelchair.

      The three phases are to be performed using the standard manual wheelchair and the three
      assisting devices in a randomized order.

      Three different groups of patients are included in the three phases of the study.
