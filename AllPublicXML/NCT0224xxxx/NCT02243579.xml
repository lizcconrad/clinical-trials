  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with stage
      IB-IVB mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome that has returned after a period of improvement
      or has not responded to at least one type of treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in subjects with
      relapsed/refractory mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the clinical activity of MK-3475 in subjects with relapsed/refractory MF and SS
      with respect to the following endpoints: duration of response (DOR); progression-free
      survival (PFS); overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (6 months for patients achieving complete response [CR]) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.

             of study medication

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
                  pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication;
                  if the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum
                  pregnancy test will be required

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of
                  birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity
                  from the time of the pre-study visit, through the course of the study and for 120
                  days after the last dose of study medication; patients of childbearing potential
                  are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from
                  menses for &gt; 1 year

               -  Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they
                  are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior
                  to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to
                  baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not

             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study; the use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be
             approved after consultation with the protocol principal investigator (PI) and Cancer
             Immunotherapy Trials Network (CITN); patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1, anti-PD-ligand

             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  History of other pulmonary disease such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease, (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] &lt; 60% of predicted for height
             and age); pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are required in patients with prolonged
             smoking history or symptoms of respiratory dysfunction

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-study visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment; breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with MK-3475

               -  Men and non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are
                  willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to
                  conceive; highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or
                  2) postmenopausal (a woman who is &gt;= 45 years of age and has not had menses for
                  greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually
                  active for the duration of the study; the two birth control methods can be
                  barrier method or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy;
                  patients should start using birth control from the time of the pre-study visit,
                  through the course of the study and for 120 days after the last dose of study
                  medication; the following are considered adequate barrier methods of
                  contraception: diaphragm, condom (by the partner), copper intrauterine device,
                  sponge, or spermicide; appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any
                  registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a
                  progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or
                  intramuscular agents)

               -  Patients should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown
                  risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study; in
                  order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception
                  requirement (described above) for the duration of the study and during the
                  follow-up period; if there is any question that a patient will not reliably
                  comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be
                  entered into the study

               -  If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with MK-3475, the
                  patient will immediately be removed from the study; the site will contact the
                  patient at least monthly and document the patient's status until the pregnancy
                  has been completed or terminated; the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported
                  without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience
                  (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or
                  life-threatening complication to the mother or newborn); the study investigator
                  will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the
                  pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn; if a male patient
                  impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed
                  immediately and the pregnancy reported and followed

          -  Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive may participate IF they
             meet the following eligibility requirements:

               -  They must be stable on their anti-retroviral regimen, and they must be healthy
                  from an HIV perspective

               -  They must have a CD4 count of greater than 250 cells/mcL
