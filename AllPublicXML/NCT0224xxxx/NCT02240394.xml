  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased intracranial pressure is a cause of disease progression in patients with brain
      disease, a common cause of poor prognosis. Intracranial pressure monitoring is the
      observation of the disease, treatment, evaluation and important way to improve the prognosis.
      Non-invasive intracranial pressure monitoring can be used to stroke, intracranial hemorrhage,
      brain trauma, encephalitis and other patients. Ophthalmic artery originated from the internal
      carotid artery, the optic canal into the orbit, the entire process can be divided into
      intracranial optic tube segment and orbital segment. investigators' preliminary experiments
      show that when intracranial pressure, intracranial ophthalmic artery segment velocity
      increases with increasing velocity difference orbital segment. Accordingly, the investigators
      speculate, may be judged by the level of intracranial pressure intracranial and orbital
      velocity difference between the ophthalmic artery segment, and accordingly calculate the
      specific values of intracranial pressure. The investigators will collect brain trauma
      surgery, performed invasive intracranial pressure monitoring cases, the use of transcranial
      Doppler ultrasound velocity and different segments of the ophthalmic artery pulsatility
      index, the invasive intracranial pressure and comparing the measured values to calculate the
      the critical value of the ophthalmic artery segment intraorbital and intracranial velocity
      difference when intracranial pressure, thus fitting Based on projections of mathematical
      formulas intracranial pressure. This study will provide a non-invasive intracranial pressure
      monitor new approach.
