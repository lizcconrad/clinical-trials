  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is a frequent feature of peripheral neuropathy causing a significant impact
      on patients' quality of life and health care costs. Not all individuals with neuropathy
      develop pain and it is not possible to predict who is more or less susceptible among those
      with similar risk exposure. Current inability to identify high-risk individuals hinders
      development and application of therapies to counteract neuropathic pain and to address
      targeted prevention strategies. Recently, the investigators Consortium has identified novel
      pathogenic mutations in genes encoding for two sodium channels (Nav1.7 and Nav1.8) known to
      play a critical role in the generation and conduction of action potentials in nociceptors and
      their terminal axons. This study was undertaken in a carefully selected group of patients
      with painful neuropathy using a candidate gene approach and directly revealed targets for new
      therapeutic strategies. This discover widened the spectrum of sodium channel-related pain
      disorders including conditions more common in the general population than those known so far.
      PROPANE STUDY, starting from the hypothesis of a common origin of neuropathic pain in a
      cohort of patients with predominantly small fibre neuropathy, aims to develop this original
      idea in a larger and well characterized study population, to provide evidence for the
      reliable stratification of patients at high risk and potential new treatments tailored on
      patients' clinical features, in order to improve their quality of life.
