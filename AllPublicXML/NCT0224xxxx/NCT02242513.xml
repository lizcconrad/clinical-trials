  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there are many conservative method for plantar fasciitis, patients might spend 2
      years to achieve resolution. Recent study have shown that pulsed radiofrequency (PRF)
      lesioning of peripheral nerve can alleviate kinds of pain condition. However there are no
      studies of PRF lesioning of the tibial nerve in patients with plantar fascilitis by using
      ultrasound-guided (UG) techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with unilateral plantar Fasciitis will be enrolled and randomized into intervention
      and control group. One dose of sono-guided PRF is applied in the intervention group and
      xylocaine in control group. Outcome measurements included visual analog scale (VAS)、foot
      health status questionnaire and the thickness of plantar fascile measured by musculoskeletal
      ultrasonography at different follow-up frame (4th week, 2nd month, 3rd month after
      treatment).
