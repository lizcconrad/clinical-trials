      The purpose of this IRB approved study is to allow patients to undergo surgery with the SR™
      MCP (Metacarpophalangeal) Implants. This is NOT a research study, but rather, a requirement
      by the FDA for humanitarian use of device. Use of the SR™ MCP is approved for humanitarian
      use by the FDA when either the patient is in need of a revision of failed MCP prothesis(es)
      or the patient expects to place his/her hand under loading situation which preclude the use
      of an alternative implant in the painful osteo-arthritic and post traumatic arthritic MCP
      joint.
