  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of HCV treatment using the standard regimen of pegylated-interferon plus
      ribavirin in HIV co-infected patients participating in the PHPT cohort study. The treatment
      will be implemented in conjunction with gastro-enterologists/hepatologists by internists
      responsible for the participant's HIV treatment.

      Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is responsible for several severe and life
      threatening complications, which are worsened by HIV co-infection. HIV-HCV co-infected
      patients are at a higher risk of death compared to HIV mono-infected individuals, even if HIV
      replication is suppressed on antiretroviral treatment.

      The goal of HCV antiviral treatment is to cure HCV infection. Curing HCV infection allows
      fibrosis regression, improved clinical outcomes. In addition, individuals who have been cured
      are no longer contagious to other individuals, therefore widespread access to HCV treatment
      may contribute to the control of the HCV epidemic.

      A combination of injectable pegylated-interferon with oral ribavirin is currently the
      recommended regimen for the treatment of hepatitis C in the setting of HIV co-infection. They
      are administered for 24 weeks in HCV mono-infected patients but need to be administered for
      one year in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Newer drugs, such as the first generation HCV
      protease inhibitors (boceprevir, telaprevir), administered concomitantly, are used in
      patients who have not been cured using peg-interferon + ribavirin, and may allow for shorter
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      1. To determine the percentage of patients according to genotypes with sustained virological
      response 6 months after treatment discontinuation (SVR).

      HCV TREATMENT

        -  Peg-interferon alpha 2-b (a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 micrograms/kg once a week)

        -  Ribavirin dosing according to HCV genotype and body weight; dose adjustment in case of
           anemia.

      A total of 60 patients could be enrolled in the study: 15 HCV-HIV co-infected patients in a
      first part (starting in August 2014) and 45 patients in a second part, depending on funding.

      Study Population Screening: HIV infected patients with a positive anti-HCV test will be
      approached for screening if they are at least 18 years old, participate in the PHPT cohort
      study, have evidence of control of HIV replication and have a CD4 cell count ≥200 cells/mm3
      if currently receiving antiretroviral HIV treatment (on the same anti-HIV regimen for at
      least 12 weeks); or HIV RNA load ≤5000 copies/ml CD4 cells ≥500 cells/mm3if not receiving
      antiretroviral treatment.

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  Evidence of chronic HCV infection for at least 6 months before study entry (at least one
           detectable HCV viral load, i.e. ≥17 IU/mL, with an antibody test positive at least 6
           months before the HCV RNA load result)

        -  Fibrosis Stage F2-3-4 determined by transient elastography (Fibroscan or other similar
           equipment). During the first part of the study, priority will be given to patients with
           Fibrosis Stage F2-3.

        -  Negative pregnancy test (on the day of inclusion). Main exclusion criteria

        -  Anemia and thrombocytopenia

        -  Severe liver damage, advanced stage cirrhosis or cancer

        -  Uncontrolled diabetes, Uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction

        -  Retinopathy

        -  Creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min (Cockcroft)

        -  Disease associated with the immune system

        -  Significant heart problems

        -  Severe neuropsychiatric conditions

        -  Contra-indication to study treatment (including pregnancy or lack of effective
           contraception in the participant or female partner)

        -  Other exclusion criteria related to the use of ribavirin and peg-interferon

        -  Any conditions that, in the investigator's judgment, may compromise the follow up.

      Follow up After HCV treatment initiation, patients will be monitored for safety and antiviral
      efficacy at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48 weeks (end of treatment) and 6
      months after treatment discontinuation.

      Treatment will be discontinued earlier in patients who do not achieve early viral response,
      i.e. a decrease of at least 2 log10 HCV RNA IU/mL after the first 12 weeks of HCV therapy.
