      1. To study the symptomatic improvement in LUTS afforded by FLOMAX® capsules, 0.4 mg daily
           compared to placebo, in female patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with a
           significant component of voiding symptoms

        2. To study the improvement afforded by FLOMAX® capsules versus placebo, in this patient
           population, in quality of life

        3. To assess the safety and tolerability of FLOMAX® capsules, 0.4 mg compared to placebo,
           in women suffering from LUTS with a significant component of voiding symptoms
