      This prospective randomized, single blind intervention study aims to proof a cognitive
      rehabilitation program for patients with mild dementia in Alzheimers Disease (AD). The
      investigators modified a manualized and established German behavioural therapy program
      (KORDIAL) to use in a group context. The respective modules contain multimodal and
      multiprofessional approaches to improve capabilities relevant to activities of daily living
      (external memory support, compensation strategies, training of everyday competence,
      communication training). The intervention group receives this therapy for 12 weeks. Age and
      gender matched participants with AD serve as active control sample receiving a standardized
      cognitive training in the domesticity. The primary outcome are measurements of skills in
      activities of daily living prior the intervention as well as at the end of the intervention
      (after 3 months) and after 6 months (Follow up).
