      Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat,
      barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed
      patients and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. Patients with CD show
      circulating autoantibodies (anti-transglutaminase, anti-tTG) and suffer from the destruction
      of a specific tissue cell type (the enterocytes) by CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, other
      autoimmune diseases have been reported in association to CD in 20-30% of the cases. In the
      last few year, a new clinical entity emerged, which seems include patients who consider
      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named &quot;Non-Celiac
      Gluten Sensitivity&quot; (6), but, in a recent paper, the investigators suggested the term
      &quot;Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity&quot; (NCWS), since, to date, it is not known what component of
      wheat really causes the symptoms. The doubt areas about the NCWS regard also its pathogenesis
      as, despite some papers evidenced an intestinal immunologic activation, others excluded it.
      To explore the presence of autoimmunity in NCWS, the investigators evaluated: a) the
      frequency of autoimmune diseases and b) the frequency of serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
      positivity in newly diagnosed NCWS, compared to CD patients.

      Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat,
      barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed
      patients and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. Although CD is not surely
      placed among the autoimmune diseases, patients with CD show circulating autoantibodies
      (anti-transglutaminase, anti-tTG) and suffer from the destruction of a specific tissue cell
      type (the enterocytes) by CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, other autoimmune diseases have been
      reported in association to CD in 20-30% of the cases. In the last few year, a new clinical
      entity emerged, which seems include patients who consider themselves to be suffering from
      problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have CD or wheat
      allergy. This clinical condition has been named &quot;Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity&quot; (6), but, in
      a recent paper, the investigators suggested the term &quot;Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity&quot; (NCWS),
      since, to date, it is not known what component of wheat really causes the symptoms. The doubt
      areas about the NCWS regard also its pathogenesis as, despite some papers evidenced an
      intestinal immunologic activation, others linked NCWS to the dietary FODMAPs (Fermentable
      Oligo-di and Mono-saccharides, And Polyols) load, thus excluding an immunologic involvement
      in the NCWS. To explore the presence of autoimmunity in NCWS, in the present study the
      investigators evaluated: a) the frequency of autoimmune diseases and b) the frequency of
      serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) positivity in newly diagnosed NCWS and CD patients.

    <description>The presence of autoimmune disorders was evaluated by a structured questionnaire, with the assistance of ad hoc-trained personnel, and review of patient' clinical records. The presence of one of the following diseases was looked for in all subjects: connective tissue diseases, autoimmune endocrinological diseases, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, epilepsy with cerebral calcification, unexplained cerebellar ataxia, alopecia, psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiform, atrophic autoimmune gastritis, and immune anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia. The hospital records of all patients diagnosed for an autoimmune disorder were thoroughly examined to verify whether the recognized diagnostic criteria for each disorder had been fulfilled, together with age at diagnosis of the diseases and treatment received.</description>

        The study included consecutive adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like
        clinical presentation, according to Rome II criteria, and a definitive diagnosis of NCWS,
        referred at the Internal Medicine Department of the University Hospital of Palermo, Italy,
        and at the Internal Medicine Department of the Hospital of Sciacca, Agrigento, Italy,
        between July 2011 and July 2013.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To diagnose NCWS the recently proposed criteria were adopted. All the patients met the
             following criteria

          -  negative serum anti-transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysium (EmA) IgA and IgG
             antibodies

          -  absence of intestinal villous atrophy

          -  negative IgE-mediated immune-allergy tests to wheat (skin prick tests and/or serum
             specific IgE detection)

          -  resolution of the IBS symptoms on standard elimination diet, excluding wheat, cow's
             milk, egg, tomato, chocolate, and other self-reported food(s) causing symptoms

          -  symptom reappearance on double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge. As we
             previously described in other studies, DBPC cow's milk protein challenge and other
             &quot;open&quot; food challenges were performed too.

          -  Additional inclusion criteria were:

          -  age &gt;18 years

          -  follow-up duration longer than six months after the initial diagnosis

          -  at least two outpatient visits during the follow-up period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  positive EmA in the culture medium of the duodenal biopsies, also in the case of
             normal villi/crypts ratio in the duodenal mucosa

          -  self-exclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it, before entering
             the study

          -  other &quot;organic&quot; gastrointestinal disorders

          -  nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder

          -  physical impairment limiting physical activity

          -  menopause

          -  steroid and sex steroid therapy, hormone replacement therapy or ovariectomy.
