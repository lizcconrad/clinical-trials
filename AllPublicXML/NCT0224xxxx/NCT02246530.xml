  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to identify an effective and conservative approach to treating
      partial thickness rotator cuff tears (PTRCT) that otherwise would end with a surgical
      correction needed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based off literature and clinical practice, the majority of rotator cuff tears continue to
      progress to surgical correction despite conservative measures. These include physical
      therapy, medication management and minimally invasive procedures such as subacromial bursa
      injections and intra-articular injections with steroids. Recently a popular treatment of
      common musculoskeletal injuries (including tendinopathies) has emerged throughout the US and
      has been utilized worldwide for many years with good empiric evidence known as Platelet-Rich
      Plasma (PRP) injections. In partnership with UAB Orthopedics and Radiology, the UAB
      Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation aims to compare PRP to corticosteroid
      injections for patients with partial rotator cuff tears or tendinopathy. Outcome measures are
      ultrasound imaging, pain and disability over the course of 6 months.

    <description>Day of procedure, 60 cc blood draw will be taken for processing and isolation of PRP. PRP sample will be injected peri-tendinous / intra-tendinous area at location of the PTRCT under ultrasound guidance to ensure accurate placement at site of injury.
PRP is an autologous blood product that is being re-injected into the same patient and is considered a non-invasive interventional procedure. PRP is classified as a procedure and not a drug.</description>
