    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive

          2. A Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 29 kg/m2

          4. Ability to swallow numerous large capsules without difficulty

          5. Acceptable laboratory values that indicate adequate baseline organ function are
             required at the time of screening. Laboratory values are considered to be acceptable
             if severity is less than or equal to Grade 1, based on the AIDS Clinical Trials Group
             Grading Scale. All abnormal laboratory values greater than Grade 1 are subject to
             approval by the trial clinical monitor.

          6. Acceptable medical history, physical examination and ECG, and chest X-ray (if not
             conducted within the last 12 months) are required prior to entering the treatment
             phase of the study

          7. Willingness to abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to Study Day 0 and abstain from
             alcohol for the duration of the study. In addition, red wine must not have been
             ingested within 5 days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2)

             the study

         10. Willingness to abstain from over the counter herbal medications for the duration of
             the study

         11. Reasonable probability for completion of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are of reproductive potential who:

               -  Have positive serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin at Visit 1, or on Day 0 or
                  Day 1

               -  Have not been using a barrier contraceptive method for at least 3 months prior to

             to Day 0 (Visit 2)

          3. Use of any medication listed in the protocol within 30 days prior to Day 0 (Visit 2)

          4. Use of any other pharmacological contraceptive (including oral, patch or injectable

             heart rate below 50, due to a high fitness level, the investigator may discuss
             exclusion with the medical monitor on a case-by-case basis

         15. Subjects with a history of any illness or allergy that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in
             administering Tipranavir, Ritonavir or NET/EE to the subject

         16. Subjects who have had an acute illness within 2 weeks prior to Day 0 (Visit 2)

         17. Subjects who are currently taking any over-the-counter drug within 7 days prior to Day
             0,(Visit 2) or who are currently taking any prescription drug that, in the opinion of
             the investigator in consultation with the clinical monitor, might interfere with
             either the absorption, distribution or metabolism of the test substances

         18. Known hypersensitivity to TPV, RTV, or NET/EE

         19. Inability to comply with the protocol
