      The purpose of this study:

      Determining the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics
      characteristic, and dosage regimen of phase II/III of Chlorogenic acid for injection in the
      advanced malignant tumor subjects;

      1. Investigate the tolerance of Chlorogenic acid for injection in human body, determine the
           Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of Chlorogenic acid for
           injection in the advanced malignant tumor subjects;

        2. Determine the human pharmacokinetics characteristic of Chlorogenic acid for injection;

        3. Preliminary observation the effectiveness and effective dose;

        4. Provide the basis for the dosage regimen of phase II/III.

    <description>Chlorogenic acid for injection is polyphenols, micromolecular and un-endogenous substance. It might play the role of cancer treatment via balancing tumor micro-environmental immune status according to the stability and rationality of immunodeficiency and endogenous immune material expression around the tumor. Chlorogenic acid for injection is made from chlorogenic acid (purity≥98%) which is extracted from folium cortex eucommiae.Chlorogenic acid and its preparations have not been reported as chemical drug and marketed around the world.</description>
