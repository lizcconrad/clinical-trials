  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase III clinical trial, approximately 320 eligible patients with OA of the knee
      will receive Ampion™ 4 mL or Saline 4 mL (1:1) administered as three IA injections, 2 weeks
      apart at Day 0, Week 2, and Week 4.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 320 male or female subjects, aged from 40 to 85 years, with OA knee
      pain, will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 across two study arms, to receive three (3) IA
      injections of either the active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or a placebo injection at Baseline (Day
      0) and Weeks 2 and 4 after confirming eligibility regarding the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      listed below. Enrollment of Kellgren subjects will be limited to Kellgren III and IV only.

      There will be seven (7) in-clinic visits and three (3) phone visits. Subjects will receive
      three (3) IA injections of active drug (Ampion™ 4 mL) or placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and
      Weeks 2 and 4. Subjects will also attend in-clinic visits at Week 6, Week 12, Week 20, Week
      24 (final assessment). Post-treatment follow-up telephone calls will be made to each subject
      within 24 hours of each IA injection (Baseline (Day 0) and Weeks 2 and 4) with each call
      documented.

      The clinical effects of treatment on OA knee pain will be evaluated during clinic visits at
      Weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, 20, and 24 using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis
      Index (WOMAC®) osteoarthritis Index 3.1 (pain subscore and function subscore) and an overall
      global severity assessment (Subject's Global Assessment [PGA]).

    <description>The primary study objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ampion™ 4 mL versus a placebo injection from Baseline to Week 20 when administered as three IA injections (at Baseline Day 0 and Weeks 2 and 4) in improving knee pain in subjects suffering from OA of the knee.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study requirements and instructions of the site
             study staff.

          -  Male or female, 40 years to 85 years old (inclusive).

          -  Must be ambulatory.

          -  Index knee must be symptomatic for greater than 6 months with a clinical diagnosis of
             OA and supported by radiological evidence (x-ray) acquired at screening and assessed
             by a central reader. Subjects must have a Kellgren Lawrence Grade of III or IV for
             inclusion in the study.

          -  Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the index knee (rating of at least 1.5 on the
             WOMAC® Index 3.1 5-point Likert Pain Subscale) assessed at screening and confirmed at
             randomization.

          -  Moderate to moderately-severe OA pain in the index knee (even if chronic doses of
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID], which have not changed in the 4 weeks
             prior to screening, have been/are being used).

          -  No analgesia taken 24 hours before efficacy measure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of medical review and screening investigation, the Principal Investigator
             considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  Previous Ampion™ injection in the index knee.

          -  Known clinically significant liver abnormality (e.g., cirrhosis, transplant, etc).

          -  A history of allergic reactions to excipients in 5% human albumin (N-acetyltryptophan,
             sodium caprylate).

          -  Presence of tense effusions in the index knee.

          -  Inflammatory or crystal arthropathies, acute fractures, history of aseptic necrosis or
             joint replacement in the index knee, as assessed locally by the Principal
             Investigator.

          -  Major injury to the index knee within the 12 months prior to screening.

          -  Severe hip OA ipsilateral to the index knee.

          -  Any pain that could interfere with the assessment of index knee pain (e.g., pain in
             any other part of the lower extremities, pain radiating to the knee).

          -  Any pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment targeting OA started or changed
             during the 4 weeks prior to treatment or likely to be changed during the duration of

          -  IA injected pain medications in the study knee during the study;

          -  Analgesics containing opioids. NSAIDs may be continued at levels preceding the study
             and acetaminophen is available as a rescue medication during the study from the
             provided supply;

          -  Topical treatment on osteoarthritis index knee during the study;

          -  Significant anticoagulant therapy (e.g., Heparin or Lovenox) during the study
             (treatment such as Aspirin and Plavix are allowed);

          -  Systemic treatments that may interfere with safety or efficacy assessments during the
             study;

          -  Immunosuppressants;

          -  Use of corticosteroids &gt; 10 mg prednisolone equivalent per day (if ≤ 10 mg
