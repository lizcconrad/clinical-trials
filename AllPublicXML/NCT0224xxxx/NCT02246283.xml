  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The elderly demographic is on the rise - and this includes elderly living with schizophrenia.
      Yet very little is known about their lives, how they cope with their condition and how it
      develops over time.

      Research in this patient-group is sparse; overall there seem to be a tendency for elderly
      patients to manifest fewer psychotic symptoms and experiencing an increase in the
      psychological quality of life with older age. Opinions are divided on the degree and extent
      to which this tendency reflects remission and/or recovery in older patients.

      In order to identify factors associated with a positive outcome we:

        -  Investigate the course and the outcomes of the illness over the lifespan, as well as the
           life course and outcomes.

        -  Investigate the current status of mental and physical health, quality of life as well as
           functional competence of elderly (55+ yr) with schizophrenia.

      Also the investigators

      - Compare the trajectory and prognosis of schizophrenia (a chronic mental illness) with type
      1 diabetes (a chronic somatic illness).

      This study will yield vital insights into how schizophrenia develops over time, isolating
      factors that determine how well patients fare. The perspective is to advance knowledge of
      elderly with schizophrenia with a view to optimizing and increasing the effectiveness of the
      interventions offered to this group.
