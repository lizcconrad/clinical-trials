      1. To study the early onset of symptomatic relief afforded by FLOMAX® capsules, 0.4 mg
           daily as compared to HYTRIN® capsules, 5 mg (with titration) daily in patients with the
           signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)

        2. To evaluate patient's tolerability to the use of FLOMAX® capsules 0.4 mg daily in
           comparison to HYTRIN® capsules, 5 mg (with titration) daily for the treatment of the
           symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia
