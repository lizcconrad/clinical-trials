  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been little progress for effective treatment of pain in sickle cell disease (SCD)
      patients. Many organizations have recognized that understanding the causes and reducing the
      burden of pain in SCD is critical in order to improve the quality of life in SCD patients. As
      patients with SCD face the challenge of living with both acute and chronic pain which is
      often improperly treated, our translational and interdisciplinary project aims to identify
      objective measures of pain sensitivity and its biochemical and genetic correlates. We
      hypothesize that SCD patients will have decreased tolerance to thermal and electrical
      stimuli.
