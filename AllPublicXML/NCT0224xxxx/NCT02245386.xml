      To evaluate levator ani muscle morphology following normal vaginal delivery and cesarean
      section (elective and emergent), using three-dimensional (3D) transperineal ultrasound, and
      to study the effect of mode of delivery on female sexual function.

      1. transperineal pelvic floor ultrasound applied for the submitted 120 women &quot;primiparae&quot;
           (40 women after normal vaginal delivery), (40 women after urgent cesarean section), (40
           women after elective cesarean section), in early postpartum period (48 to 72) hours
           postpartum, to evaluate levator ani morphology.

        2. answering of the validated female sexual function index (F.S.F.I) three months
           postpartum period for same cases submitted to ultrasound.
