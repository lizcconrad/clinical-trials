  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the toughest decisions faced by the frail elderly in Canada is whether to stay at home
      or move to a care facility. It is certainly difficult to make this decision alone, but can be
      even harder if someone else makes it for you. Shared decision making is when, instead of
      making decisions for the patient, healthcare professionals share information about what the
      evidence says, and they talk about what's important with the patient, and then make the
      decision together. In the case of the frail elderly in home care services, there are many
      health care professionals involved, e.g. the doctor, nurse and social worker. In this case
      decisions should be shared by all the professionals involved with the elderly person along
      with his or her caregivers. Unfortunately, in this context, shared decision making rarely
      occurs.

      We have designed a training program that teaches interprofessional teams how to share
      decisions with their frail elderly patients, and tested it in one Quebec City and one
      Edmonton home care team. This project tests the training program on a broader scale with 16
      home care teams attached to community health centres across the province of Quebec, and will
      compare the results with what happens when no one has completed the training (usual care).
      Home care is a rapidly growing sector and this study will lay the foundations for a national
      strategy to ensure that no one has to make this difficult decision alone.
