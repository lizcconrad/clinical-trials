  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of adductor canal block (ACB) vs. placebo
      on muscle strength, mobility and pain on the first postoperative day after total knee
      alloplastic (TKA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be included on the first day after TKA surgery and randomized in two groups.
      Each group will receive 2 ACB with a 1 hour interval, one ACB with an active drug,
      Ropivacaine, and another ACB with a placebo drug, Saline.

      At T0, arm ACB_active/placebo will receive the active ACB with Ropivacaine followed by the
      placebo ACB at T60 (60 minutes after T0).

      At T0, arm ACB_placebo/active will receive the placebo ACB with Saline followed by the active
      ACB with Ropivacaine at T60 (60 minutes after T0).

      Outcome measurements will be made at T60, 1 hour after the first ACB, and the difference in
      outcome between the groups will be compared.

      Baseline values will be measured prior to the first ACB. Final measurements at T120 (120
      minutes after the initial ACB), will determine if the differences between the groups are
      eliminated, since both groups then have received an active ACB.

    <description>Muscle strength is assessed as maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) using a hand-held dynamometer.3 consecutive measurements will be made and the average used. Results for each group will be presented as percentage of baseline values. The primary outcome is the difference in MVIC between the groups.</description>

    <measure>Sub-group analysis of muscle strength and mobility acconding to baseline VAS during active flexion of the knee prior to the first block</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes after first ACB (T60)</time_frame>
    <description>According to their specified VAS (0-100 mm) pain score during active flexion of the knee prior to the first block, patients will be divided into two groups. Group 1 VAS 0-59 mm and group 2 with VAS 60-100 mm. Results within the two groups will be compared: e.g is there a difference in MVIC in the subgroup of patients scoring VAS 0-59 during active knee flexion at baseline? and is this difference larger in the subgroup of patients scoring VAS 60-100?</description>

    <description>Patients will receive the first ACB with a active drug, 30 ml bolus Ropivacaine 7,5 mg/ml at T0. First outcome measurement are made one hour after the first ACB, prior to their second ACB. At T60 (60 minutes after T0), patients will receive their second ACB with the placebo drug, 30 ml bolus Saline and outcome measures performed again at T120(120 minutes after T0).
The measurements for baseline and outcome will be made in following order:
VAS pain score at rest - VAS pain score during active flexion of the knee - Muscle strength - TUG test - Highest VAS pain score during TUG test</description>
