  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to establish non-inferiority of lung function
      response to 25 μg salmeterol, administered as the xinafoate salt, in an inhalation powder
      delivered from hard polyethylene (PE) capsules via the HandiHaler® 2 compared to Serevent®
      Diskus® (salmeterol 50 μg, administered as the xinafoate salt) following single dose
      inhalation in patients with COPD.

      The secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol inhalation
      powder delivered by HandiHaler® 2 from the PE hard capsule and salmeterol xinafoate delivered
      by Serevent® Diskus®, and to compare the safety of the two pharmaceutical forms.
