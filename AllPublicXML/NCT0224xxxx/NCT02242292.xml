    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult males and females 18 years of age and older

          2. Have at least a 3-month self-reported history of recurrent episodic symptoms, usually
             lasting for 1 hour or more, of self-described abdominal pain or discomfort associated
             with cramping, which they routinely either have not treated or treated using
             Over-the-counter (OTC) medications, in which subjects suffered these symptoms at a
             frequency of at least twice monthly to several times weekly, but not on a daily basis.
             The episodes of abdominal pain or discomfort may have been associated with other
             symptoms of GI dysfunction, such as diarrhea, constipation, and bloating

          3. Symptoms typically have a moderate or greater severity (moderate, severe, very severe)
             and are sufficiently bothersome to require treatment or intervention

          4. Symptoms are not associated with abdominal tenderness, swelling, fever, weight loss,
             or passage of blood per rectum. The onset of symptoms may or may not have been
             associated with ingestion of food or beverages

          5. The episodes of abdominal pain or discomfort may have been associated with other
             symptoms of GI dysfunction, such as diarrhea, cramping, constipation, and bloating

          6. Subjects are required to be able to comprehend and participate in the activities
             required for participation in the trial, to have the ability to attend required site
             visits, and to be available and have the facility to participate in a daily telephone
             call or computer entry (using a touch-tone phone or computer IVRS entry), which served
             as the mechanism for diary entry, during the 6-week course of the study. Subjects were
             required to successfully complete an Interactive voice response system (IVRS) training
             session prior to entry into the study

          7. All subjects completed and signed an informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who reported having these symptoms for the first time, particularly if they
             were 50 years or older, as this may have been a sign of a more serious organic disease

          2. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity or allergy to hyoscine butylbromide or any of
             the inactive ingredients

          3. Subjects who are currently under a physician's care for abdominal symptoms and/or not
             using medication or using prescription or OTC medications prescribed by a physician to
             treat symptoms of abdominal pain, cramping and discomfort or taking prescription
             medication(s) for the treatment of Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (Bentyl® or other
             antispasmodics, Zelnorm® [tegaserod], Lotronex® [alosetron], prokinetic agents).
             Current physician's care was defined as the subject presently following clinician
             advice regarding treatment and management of the abdominal pain or discomfort
             associated with the cramping symptom

          4. Subjects who are having symptoms of abdominal swelling, fever associated with symptoms
             of abdominal pain or discomfort associated with cramping, and/or experiencing passage
             of blood per rectum associated with symptoms of abdominal pain or discomfort
             associated with cramping, or who have any evidence of abdominal tenderness (or any
             other evidence of an acute abdomen), abdominal masses, organomegaly or any other
             abnormality on abdominal examination

          5. Subjects with a history of colon or other GI cancer or malignancy, inflammatory bowel
             disease, or Crohn's disease

          6. Subjects with chronic constipation

          7. Subjects with myasthenia gravis or megacolon

          8. Subjects who have undergone abdominal surgery within the past 2 years, having GI
             surgery resulting in removal of all or part of the colon, small intestine, or stomach,
             or having a history of GI by-pass surgery for weight reduction

          9. Prior history of gallbladder removal, appendectomy, and/or surgery for peptic ulcer
             disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), was not exclusionary.

         10. Subjects whose major symptoms were retrosternal burning, acid reflux, acid
             regurgitation, or heartburn are excluded

         11. Subjects using prescription anticholinergic medications or medications for the
             treatment of myasthenia gravis, glaucoma, or ocular hypertension are excluded

         12. Subjects who were currently participating in other trials or who participated in a
             clinical trial within the prior 30 days are excluded

         13. Women who reported being pregnant, are nursing, or who are of child-bearing potential
             and not using an adequate method of birth control (medication, device, abstinence,
             sterilization for either partner) for 30 days before enrollment and did not agree to
             continue using an adequate method of birth control for 30 days after completion of the
             trial are excluded

         14. Any women of childbearing potential who have a positive serum pregnancy test are
             excluded

         15. Post-menopausal women who have been post-menopausal for a duration of less than 2
             years and did not have a hysterectomy or tubal ligation procedure are excluded

         16. Subjects who have tachyarrhythmia (defined as any disturbance of the heart's rhythm,
             regular or irregular, resulting in a rate over 100 beats per minute) during a physical
             examination are excluded

         17. Subjects who have been previously diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or
             subjects who experienced urinary retention are excluded

         18. Subjects with clinically significant cardiovascular disease in the opinion of the
             investigator (including hypotension, hypertension, severe coronary artery disease,
             congestive heart failure, angina pectoris) are excluded
