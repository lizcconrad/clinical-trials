  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an insulin bolus for use to cover higher fat meals.

      Subjects will have several admissions during which the investigators will apply an iterative
      dose escalation protocol to derive an optimized insulin bolus dose (carbohydrate-to-insulin
      ratio for fat to minimize postprandial hyperglycemia following higher fat meals. The
      investigators hypothesize that the incremental insulin dose required to cover dietary fat in
      patients with type 1 diabetes will be related to total daily insulin dose (U/kg).

      Subjects for this study will be adults with type 1 diabetes who use an insulin pump for
      diabetes self-management.

      Subjects will be admitted to the clinical research center in the morning in the fasting
      state. Subjects will have several admissions. During the initial two admissions, subjects
      will receive either pizza-low fat or pizza-high fat, covered with insulin doses calculated
      from their usual insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. Study subjects in whom the bolus did not
      provide adequate insulin coverage for pizza-high fat will then undergo an additional 1-5
      admissions during which they will receive the pizza-high fat meal with progressively
      increasing insulin doses until ≥ 90% of all postprandial glucose values are within the target
      range 80-180 mg/dL.

    <description>To test the hypothesis that incremental dose increase required to cover dietary fat in patients with type 1 diabetes will be related to total daily insulin dose (TDD; U/kg) we will perform regression analysis with TDD as independent variable and the increase in insulin requirements (calculated as percent change for high fat vs low fat meal) as the dependent variable.</description>
