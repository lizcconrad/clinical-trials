    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laser tattoo removal with
      picosecond pulse durations as compared to treatment with nanosecond pulse durations using a
      single novel Q-Switched (QS) Nd:YAG laser.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, split-tattoo, open-label, single-center study of up to 25 subjects with
      tattoos containing black or dark blue ink, alone or in combination with other colors. It will
      compare the safety and efficacy of nanosecond and picosecond pulse durations with the Cutera
      Picosecond Q-Switched Nd:YAG laser for tattoo removal.
