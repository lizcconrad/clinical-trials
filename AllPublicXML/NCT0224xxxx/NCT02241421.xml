  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: The relation between gut microbiota and obesity originates from animal studies,
      showing that the change of gut microbiota can induce changes in both insulin resistance and
      body composition. In addition, these studies have shown changes in gut permeability inducing
      a pro-inflammatory state, changes in adipose tissue function and inflammation, effects on
      energy harvesting and metabolism, skeletal muscle fatty acid partitioning and fat oxidation.
      Human data is lacking, although several studies suggested that the composition of the gut
      microbiota differs between lean and obese, and between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

      OBJECTIVE: To provide insight in the physiological significance and underlying mechanisms
      involved in the relation between gut microbiota, energy balance and insulin sensitivity in
      overweight men with impaired glucose homeostasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The view on the putative significance of gut microbiota in metabolism emerged from animal
      studies. Bäcked et al. showed that germ free mice had 40% less body fat compared to
      conventionally raised mice. Transplantation of a cecum-derived microbial community of
      conventional mice into germ free mice, resulted in a significant increase of body weight and
      insulin resistance within 2 weeks. Application of metagenomic techniques in leptin-deficient
      ob/ob mice showed a different proportion of bacteria belonging when compared to lean,
      wild-type or heterozygous mice, with a greater representation of Firmicutes and fewer
      Bacteroidetes. This obese gut microbiome showed an enrichment in genes involved in energy
      extraction from food, less energy left over in the faeces and higher contents of the
      short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) propionate, acetate and butyrate in the cecum.

      Furthermore, microbiota composition may alter gut permeability, and may play a role in the
      development of metabolic endotoxemia (inflammation) and related impairments in glucose
      metabolism. In addition, the gut microbiota may determine AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
      levels in muscle and liver, thereby affecting fatty acid oxidation (substrate metabolism) and
      fat storage. However, underlying mechanisms are not completely understood.

      Therefore, researchers within the Top Institute Food and Nutrition (TIFN) have designed a
      multidisciplinary project ('Microbiota, energy balance and metabolism'), to fill the unmet
      gap between gut microbiota and human energy metabolism. The current protocol is designed to
      clarify the role of the gut microbiota in host energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity,
      with the main focus on underlying mechanisms.

    <measure>Insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Before and after the intervention, insulin sensitivity will be measured by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique including a glucose tracer to accurately quantify glucose fluxes at the whole body level. Glucose and Insulin levels will be determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatty Acid Handling in the muscle</measure>
    <time_frame>up to two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Because skeletal muscle is responsible for almost 80% of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, and comprises up to 40% of total body mass, it can be considered to be a major tissue in the etiology of insulin resistance. Therefore, it is important to study the role of skeletal muscle substrate metabolism (fatty acid handling)in the context of this study. Fatty acids, glycerol, triacylglycerol and labelled palmitate in the chylomicron fraction will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Markers of inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Low-grade inflammation seems to contribute to insulin resistance in obese insulin resistant subjects. Therefore, muscle and adipose tissue expression/secretion of inflammatory molecules (i.e. TNFα, IL-6) will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>up to two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Indirect calorimetry measurements will be done to determine energy expenditure (O2 and CO2). While the gut microbiota plays an important role in nutrient metabolism and energy extraction from the diet, the determination of energy expenditure and energy content in faeces will provide important insight into the role of the gut microbiota in body weight regulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Microbiota composition and energy content in faecal samples</measure>
    <time_frame>up to two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The composition of bacteria in the gut will be determined before and after intervention to link the composition to the primary and other secondary parameters. The energy content in the faeces will provide insight in the energy extraction capacity of the bacteria present.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gut wall permeability</measure>
    <time_frame>up to two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A proposed hypothesis is that gut permeability plays an important role in the induction of inflammation in obese insulin resistant subjects. A multi-sugar whole gut permeability assay will be performed.</description>
