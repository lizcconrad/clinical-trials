          -  A repeated positive urine drug screen at baseline for any illegal substance except
             marijuana.

          -  Individuals diagnosed with a current &quot;severe&quot; Substance Use Disorder (SUD) diagnosis,
             other than alcohol or nicotine

          -  Meet DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other
             psychoses

          -  An active illness within the past six months of the screening visit that meets the
             DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Anxiety Disorder,
             or history of attempted suicide

          -  Clinically significant medical abnormalities: unstable hypertension, clinically
             significant abnormal ECG, bilirubin &gt;150% of the upper normal limit, ALT/AST &gt;300% the
             UNL, creatinine clearance ≤60 dl/min

          -  Current use of psychotropic medications that may have an effect on alcohol consumption

          -  Current use of any medication involved in the metabolism of alcohol such as aldehyde
             dehydrogenase (ALDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and CYP2E1: Cefamandole, Cefotetan,
             Sulfamethoxazole, Nitroglycerin, Chlorpropamide, Glyburide.

          -  Current use of any medication (CYP3A4 inhibitor and substrate) that may interact with
             mifepristone: cyclosporine, fentanyl, heparin, escitalopram, lovastatin, simvastatin,
             warfarin

          -  Current use of any medication (CYP2D6 inhibitor and substrate) that may interact with
             yohimbine: amitriptyline, doxepin, nortriptyline, venlafaxine

          -  Medical contraindications for use of mifepristone or yohimbine

          -  A history of adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to mifepristone or yohimbine

          -  History of suicide

          -  History of seizure disorders

          -  Hypokalemia (low potassium level)&lt;3.5mEq/L

          -  Participated in any behavioral and/or pharmacological study within minimum the past 30
             days

          -  Neuroendocrine disorders

          -  Taking corticosteroids

          -  Bleeding disorders

          -  Pre-existing QT prolongation on ECG

          -  History of porphyria (Mifepristone progesterone receptor antagonist is an inducer of
             CYP-450 and therefore may have the ability to precipitate or exacerbate attacks of
             acute porphyria)

          -  Not willing to engage in protected sex (condom). This risk includes both women and
             men. Mifepristone long half-life (t1/2 = 18 hrs) and its three main metabolites retain
             considerable affinity toward human progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors, with
             serum level similar to the parent mifepristone and there are no studies on the
             presence of mifepristone or metabolites in semen
