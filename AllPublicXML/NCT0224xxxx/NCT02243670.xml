    <textblock>
      This study uses an artificial intelligence platform to automatically confirm medication
      ingestion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant platform
      can be downloaded as an 'app' onto any smartphone to automate directly observed therapy
      (Automated DOT®). Real-time patient adherence data are encrypted and automatically sent to a
      centralized web-based dashboard for use by healthcare professionals or research staff. Unlike
      Facetime® or Skype®, the system relies on computer vision algorithms to confirm the process
      of medication administration; no human review is necessary.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability, and measure the
      accuracy, of the AiCure platform (&quot;platform&quot;) in patients being treated for opioid dependence
      with Zubsolv® over the course of 12 weeks. The following aims will be tested: 1) to assess
      the feasibility and acceptability to both participants and study staff in using AiCure to
      monitor medication adherence; 2) to evaluate the acceptability of using AiCure to optimize
      care pathways; and 3) to measure the reliability and validity of AiCure in detecting
      interruptions in treatment. To assess feasibility and acceptability of the platform, we will
      measure rates of physician satisfaction and user acceptance. Optimization of care pathways
      will be measured by assessing the sustainability of AiCure use over 12 weeks (retention
      rates) and measuring illicit opioid use (urine drug screens) compared to historical data.
      Reliability and validity of AiCure will be measured by comparing AiCure adherence against
      pharmacokinetic data.

      All participants will be requested to take each of their prescribed doses using the app.
      Participants will be able to download the app onto their own smartphone or will be
      provisioned a device at the start of the study. The data captured during the medication
      ingestion process will be automatically encrypted and stored on the participant smartphone
      and uploaded wirelessly to a cloud-based dashboard. If a participant is non-adherent (missed
      dose, incorrect dosage) or if suspicious behavior is detected, an automated alert will be
      sent to study staff via email or SMS to prompt immediate intervention. In addition, all
      participants will receive treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a multi-site, single-arm design. A total of approximately 50-100
      participants - patients stable for at least 2 weeks on their current opioid replacement
      medication - will be recruited for the study. All participants will receive their doctor's
      treatment-as-usual. Patients not currently prescribed Zubsolv® will be switched to Zubsolv®.

      Study visits include a screening visit, one baseline visit (which ideally will occur between
      7 and 14 days after the screening visit), and bi-weekly visits for the 12 weeks (six visits)
      following the baseline visit. During the baseline visit, participants will be trained on how
      to use the AiCure app. Training consists of a number of interactive training steps to teach
      the participant how to use the app correctly. Participants will be provided with three
      placebo tablets for the training.

      Study participants will be reimbursed to cover their time and transportation costs in
      accordance with Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines. Participants will receive
      contingency management (CM) to reinforce regular use of the app. Orexo AB will provide the
      study drug, Zubsolv®, to all participants throughout the 12-week treatment duration.

      For the length of the study, participants will be requested to take each dose of their
      prescribed Zubsolv® regimen using the AiCure app. Each medication administration event will
      be saved onto the participant's smartphone and encrypted data (including de-identified video
      and time and date of administration) will be automatically transmitted to the centralized
      dashboard. Research staff will have access to the dashboard to view real-time and detailed
      dosing histories for each participant. Access to the dashboard is roles-based and
      password-protected. If a participant does not dose using the AiCure app (misses/skips a
      dose), self-reports on the device or over the phone, or is tagged for suspicious behavior,
      the participant will receive a combination of automated SMS text messages and tailored SMS
      text messages / phone calls from research staff based on the pre-defined escalation protocol.
