      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of rifaximin DR tablets vs. placebo for
      the induction of clinical remission and endoscopic response following 16 weeks of treatment
      in subjects presenting with active moderate Crohn's disease. A key secondary objective is to
      evaluate clinical and endoscopic remission following an additional 36 weeks of treatment.

      RECD3125 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, multiregional,
      52-week study to assess the efficacy and safety of rifaximin DR tablets for the induction of
      clinical remission and endoscopic response at 16 weeks followed by clinical and endoscopic
      remission after 52 weeks of continuous therapy in subjects with active moderate Crohn's
      disease.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to rifaximin or placebo at the beginning of
      the treatment period and will maintain treatment assignment throughout the duration of the
      study. Ileocolonoscopy will be performed on all subjects at baseline, between Weeks 16 and 17
      (end of the Induction Phase), and following completion of the 36-week Long Term Treatment
      Phase (Week 52).
