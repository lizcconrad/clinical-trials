      A pilot phase II study with brentuximab vedotin as pre-ASCT induction therapy in
      relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma patients non-responding to IGEV salvage treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brentuximab vedotin emerged as active single-agent in the treatment of relapsed or refractory
      HL.

      Some patients don't reach a complete response after salvage treatment with IGEV (ifosfamide,
      gemcitabine, vinorelbine) and remain PET positive so the idea is to treat this subset of
      patients with brentuximab vedotin with the aim of achieving a complete remission before
      transplant.

    <description>Patients with FDG-PET positive after IGEV will be treated with brentuximab vedotin as followed: 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks as a 30-minute outpatient IV infusion for a total of 4 cycles of treatment
Growth factors may be used at the discretion of investigators but are not routinely advised.
Patients with FDG-PET negative after brentuximab vedotin treatment will be addressed to high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT.</description>
