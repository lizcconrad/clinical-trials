  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the attachment of a transparent hood (&quot;cap&quot;) on
      the sigmoidoscope. The investigators hypothesis is that this will reduce pain, reduce
      investigation time, and increases the success rate of the sigmoidoscopy. The study focus on
      the less-experienced endoscopist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators randomize study subject to sigmoidoscopy +/- the attachment of the cap.

      Using a 100mm VAS scale the investigators record pain when the sigmoidoscopy reaches its
      intubation end-point (60cm from anus). The investigators also register the time spent to this
      point and the rate of examinations not achieving this endpoint.
