  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numbers of postoperative PCA related side effects among three groups will be determined by
      comparing and analyzing frequency distributions. To determine whether the patients with
      hypertension require less post operative opiate analgesics than others, multivariate analysis
      with repeated measures will be performed to identify the major and the minor factors
      predicting the use of postoperative pain therapy. The major aim of the study is to test the
      hypothesis that the morphine comsumpted by the hypertension group is less than those of the
      normotension group. The minor aims for the study are the difference related to pain
      intensity, or the incidence of side effects among groups.

        Those patients enrolled will be divided into three groups as follows As the treatment and
        choice of drugs for hypertension is complex but internation guideline-oriented. We would
        like to enroll enough sample size in the hypertensive groups and subgroups.

          1. Normaltension group (control group)

          2. Hypertension without treatment

          3. Hypertension with treatment as follows (according to subject's daily routine Tx, the
             PI not involved into the choice and further manitence of drugs) I. Hypertension with
             treatment with ACEI II. Hypertension with treatment with Î² blocker III. Hypertension
             with treatment with Ca channel blocker IV. Hypertension with treatment with diuretics
