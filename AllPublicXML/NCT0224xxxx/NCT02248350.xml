  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of an exercise intervention to
      counteract adverse side effects related to Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in prostate
      cancer patients. Specifically, a supervised and home-based exercise program will be used to
      assess its impact on clinical and behavioral variables related to ADT in prostate cancer
      patients.

      This study will assess the feasibility of an exercise intervention to counteract adverse side
      effects related to ADT in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Specifically, we will use an
      exercise intervention and assess its impact on bone mass density, Body Mass Index (BMI),
      hip/waist circumference levels, biomarkers (i.e., glucose, lipids), step count, grip
      strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Patient Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS®). In this 8-week two-arm randomized clinical trial,
      40 PCa patients receiving ADT will be randomly assigned to an exercise (n=20) or a stretching
      control group (n=20) with a follow-up at 8-weeks.
