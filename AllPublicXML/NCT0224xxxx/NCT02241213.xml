    <textblock>
      Aphasia is one of the most disabling complications in language production in patients with
      left hemisphere stroke. About 19% of patients who experience aphasia may have a spontaneously
      recovery after several weeks or months. Some studies have reported that repetitive low
      frequency Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS-r) in patients with ischemic stroke
      generates left modulation of cortical excitability by facilitating and promoting functional
      reorganization and recovery of language production. In spite of this, most of the studies in
      patients with post-stroke aphasia, are small cases series without controls that correspond to
      a descriptive design and does not perform long-term follow up. Currently the population is
      heterogeneous respect to etiology, type of stroke and aphasia severity; also several authors
      have concluded that the exact location of the site, would be possible through the
      neuronavigation technique, to obtain better results.

      OVERALL OBJECTIVE Determine the efficacy of repetitive low-frequency TMS on oral language
      recovery in post-ischemic stroke patients with non-fluent aphasia

      ESPECIFIC OBJETIVES

        -  Estimate the effect of repetitiveTMS treatment on right Lowe Frontal Gyrus (GFI), in the
           evolution of the neuropsychological language test results in patients with non-fluent
           aphasia, compared to placebo.

        -  Describe the behavior of depression and anxiety levels in both treatment groups (active
           and placebo), through Zung anxiety and depression test, to establish their correlation
           with production testing language.

        -  Evaluate the effect of repetitiveTMS technique compared to placebo, on the overall
           functionality of the subject through Barthel scale.

        -  Describe the impact of language behavior on the quality of life of patients treated with
           placebo and active EMT, assessed by the EuroQol test.

      METHODOLOGY A placebo double blind controlled and randomize trial, to evaluate the efficacy
      of low frequency EMT-r in language recovery in 100 patients with first ischemic stroke event
      among the first 4-8 months postinfarction and non-fluent aphasia. The patient will agree and
      will sign the informed consent, in order to application aphasia diagnosis Boston test,
      Edinburgh test, Barthel scale, Zung anxiety and depression test, and EuroQol scale, Neuropsi.
      Subsequently the subjects will be randomizate to any of two arms of the study. A week before
      the start of the stimulation sessions, the following tests will be applied to assess language
      production: Boston Test and Verbal Fluency (FAS). Each patient will have a daily session
      EMT-r low-frequency active or inactive coil with a biphasic stimulator pulses applied for ten
      days in two weeks on the triangular area - homologous to injury Lower Front Gyrus (LFG),
      (right brain hemisphere). Complete the treatment schedule of two weeks, the language
      production will be evaluate again, and also scales as Barthel an Rankin-m, Zung anxiety and
      depression and EuroQol. This monitoring will be achieved in five stages: after one week, one
      month, 4 months, 8 months and 12 months post-stimulation, with the intention of determining
      the duration and effectiveness effects in language production of the EMT-r.

      Some studies have reported that low frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in
      patients with ischemic stroke generates left modulation of cortical excitability by
      facilitating, and promoting functional reorganization and facilitate the language production.

      Stroke is a major public health problem, one-third of patients do not survive the first year
      after the vascular event, cause of severe disability and also is the third leading cause of
      death worldwide. Two-thirds of the survivors have neurologic deficits including aphasia (19%)
      generating functional disability, compromise on their daily living activities, and impact on
      the quality of life (93% of patients with aphasia after stroke compared with 50% of those
      survive without aphasia). Aphasia is an additional risk factor for depression (prevalence
      5-63%), and also interfering with the functional and cognitive recovery, increasing the risk
      of mortality.

      Generally the treatment of aphasia is based on speech therapy and drug therapy oriented
      comorbidities such as depression or anxiety. However, it has studied different interventions
      in an effort to improve the speech recovery of aphasia, as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS), which facilitates recovery by stimulating contralesional and lesional regions. Most
      studies have been based on the transcallosal disinhibition theory, which consist on blocking
      homotopic regions through low frequency stimulation in the right posterior GFI (triangular
      portion) to produce a GFI disinhibition from right to left and facilitate neuroplasticity
      brain process.

      EMT technique is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, proposed by Michael
      Faraday (1831), in which posits that magnetic field depends on the stimulation time,
      generating an electric field that eventually causes neuronal excitability.The strength of the
      electric current produced in the coil between 5-10 Ka (Kiloamperes), while the strength of
      the induced magnetic field is about 1 to 2 Tesla, and the cortical area to stimulated is
      about 3 cm² and 2 cm depth. The magnetic field generated may have sufficient magnitude and
      density to depolarize cortical neurons tract, directly through axonal cone or indirectly
      through interneurons. When TMS pulses are applied repeatedly, which is known as repetitive
      TMS (r-TMS) produce modulation of the cortical excitability, increasing or decreasing,
      depending on the stimulation parameters. Those effects may persist beyond the train
      stimulation; defined as repetitive series of regular pulses.

      Fundamental mechanisms of EMT, are not yet fully understood, because due inter-session and
      inter-subject variability have been observed in the modulation of induced excitability. The
      EMT-r may also induce changes in hormonal and neurotransmitter systems, such as, serotonin,
      dopamine, NMDA receptors, taurine, aspartate, serine axis and can regulate the expression of
      some genes; cfos, c-jung, which are important for synaptic plasticity. It has been studied
      several possible mechanisms involved in the functional regulation exerted by the EMT-r, such
      as synaptic plasticity, which is the most explored one, changes in excitability of neuronal
      networks, activation of feedback loops and metaplasticity, understood plasticity as synaptic
      plasticity. However, although but not yet, been established whether the source of the
      clinical benefit of any scheme of stimulation is a direct or indirect result of the
      modulation of the excitability, is believed to be associated with neuromodulators release and
      growth factors such as neurotrophic factor derived from the brain, which play an important
      role in the mechanism of EMT.
