    <textblock>
      The trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the influence of
      semaglutide on the pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of single
      doses of atorvastatin and digoxin in healthy subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female, age between 18 and 55 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing
             informed consent

          -  Body mass index between 20.0 and 29.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant or is of
             child-bearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method. Women of
             child-bearing potential must use an effective method of birth control throughout the
             trial including the 5 weeks follow-up period. Only highly effective methods of birth
             control are accepted (i.e. one that results in less than 1% per year failure rate when
             used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, some intrauterine device), or sexual abstinence or vasectomised
             partner

          -  Any clinically significant disease history, in the opinion of the investigator, or
             systemic or organ disease including: cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic,
             neurologic, renal, genitourinary and endocrine, dermatologic or hematologic diseases

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription systemic or topical medicinal products
             (including routine or non-routine vitamins or herbal supplements, but excluding
             paracetamol and contraceptives) within 3 weeks (or within 5 half-lives of the
             medicinal product, whichever is longest) prior to Visit 2 (first dose administration)

          -  History of drug/chemical substance abuse within 1 year from screening, or a positive
             result in the urine drug test

          -  History of alcohol abuse within 1 year from screening, or a positive result in the
             alcohol urine test, or consumption of more than 21 units (male)/14 units (female) of
             alcohol weekly (one unit of alcohol equals about 250 mL of beer or lager, one glass
             (120 mL) of wine, or 20 mL spirits)

          -  Smoking in the last 3 months prior to screening or a positive nicotine test
