    <textblock>
      Approximately 300 patients have to be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until the
      end of ICU stay. Usually in clinical routine, patients suspected to have infection and
      simultaneously renal dysfunction making CVVHDF necessary. After enrolment blood and dialysate
      specimens are drawn and sent for analysis on specific time points. The analysis results are
      sent back to the study team at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin and enable them to
      optimize antiinfectiva treatment of the study patients.

      Data are used to test calculation tools and modify them if necessary.

      Little data exist whether desired and necessary blood levels of antiinfective drugs are
      reached during renal replacement therapy. Drug producing companies are not able to come
      forward with appropriate dosing recommendation in patients needing renal replacement therapy.

      To achieve our study goal we plan:

        1. To measure serum-concentrations of antiinfective drugs applied to the patients

        2. To measure concentrations of antiinfective drugs in hemofiltration fluids.

        3. To compare the actual measured concentrations with concentration predicted in known
           calculation tools.

        4. To modify these calculation tools if necessary for better prediction.
