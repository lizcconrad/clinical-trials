  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective clinical trial with random distribution that intends to investigate
      maternal and fetal effects of ephedrine, phenylephrine and metaraminol during cesarean
      delivery in patients with pre-eclampsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia has become the main anesthetic technique for cesarean delivery due to
      avoidance of failed tracheal intubation risk, improvement of post-operative analgesia and
      promotion of early mother-neonate bonding. Spinal anesthesia should be safe and comfortable
      for mother and child when referring to the side effects, including hypotension. The choice of
      the best vasopressor in this context is approaching to a resolution, favoring phenylephrine
      use. However, studies on high-risk pregnancies are still required, such as uteroplacental
      insufficiency, preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction cases. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the effects of the vasopressors ephedrine, phenylephrine and metaraminol
      on maternal cardiac output, uteroplacental and cerebral fetal blood flow in patients with
      preeclampsia under spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Sixty pregnant patients will be
      recruited and randomly assigned to receive either ephedrine, phenylephrine or metaraminol,
      making a total of three groups with 20 patients each. Variables to be analyzed are uterine
      arterial pulsatility index, umbilical arterial pulsatility index, fetus middle cerebral
      artery pulsatility index, maternal cardiac output, maternal cardiac frequency, maternal mean
      arterial blood pressure and maternal peripheral vascular resistance. These variables will be
      recorded in three moments: before the spinal anesthesia with the patient in dorsal recumbent
      and left displacement of the uterus, after spinal anesthesia in dorsal recumbent and after
      vasopressor bolus. Averages will be calculated in these intervals and then compared to the
      alteration caused by spinal anesthesia and the return to basal levels after drug
      intervention.
