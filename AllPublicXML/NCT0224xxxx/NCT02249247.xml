  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria.
             Patients had to have relatively stable airway obstruction with a FEV1 ≥ 20 % and ≤ 70
             % of predicted value and FEV1/ FVC ≤ 70 % at screening Visit 1. Predicted normal
             values were based on the guidelines for standardised lung function testing of the
             European Community for Steel and Coal (ECSC) for patients of the Caucasian race and on
             the predicted equations for patients belonging to the Black race. Patients had to have
             lung hyperinflation as demonstrated by thoracic gas volume box (TGVbox) ≥ 100 % of
             predicted value (same as predicted value for functional residual capacity (FRC)
             measured by body plethysmography)

          -  Males or females aged 40 years or older. Female patients of childbearing potential
             could not participate in this study. Female patients had to be either:

               -  surgically sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or

               -  post-menopausal for at least two years

          -  A smoking history of more than ten pack-years (p.y.). A p.y. was defined as the
             equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year

          -  Patients had to be able to perform pulmonary function testings (PFTs), exercise
             endurance test not terminated due to leg discomfort alone or other restrictions
             diseases (e.g. claudicatio intermittens, etc.) only and maintain records during the
             study period as required in the protocol

          -  All patients had to sign both informed consent forms (one on specific study
             procedures, one related to DNA derived determinations) prior to participation in the
             trial i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications if they
             agreed to participate in both portions of the trial. The patient was not obligated to
             participate in the DNA collection portion of the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical and/or radiographic evidence and/or antibiotic treatment of an upper or lower
             respiratory tract infection within the previous four weeks or during the screening
             period of this study

          -  Significant diseases other than COPD were excluded. A significant disease was defined
             as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator could either put the patient at
             risk because of participation in the study or a disease which could influence the
             results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study. Patients
             with inflammatory diseases, e.g., Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, and those
             with autoimmune diseases were excluded

          -  Clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, liver function, blood chemistry
             or urinalysis. If the abnormality defined a disease listed as an exclusion criterion
             the patient was excluded

          -  A recent history (i.e., within six months) of myocardial infarction

          -  A recent history (i.e., within three months) of refractory heart failure or unstable
             arrhythmia requiring treatment

          -  Patients with known tuberculosis

          -  A history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated basal cell
             carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma were allowed

          -  A history of life-threatening airway obstruction or a history of cystic fibrosis

          -  Previous thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a history of a
             thoracotomy without pulmonary resection were evaluated as per exclusion criterion No.
             2

          -  A change in pulmonary therapy, including rehabilitation therapy, within the four weeks
             prior to the first screening Visit (Visit 1) in order to control the patient's COPD

          -  A history of asthma or a total blood eosinophil count ≥ 600/mm3. A repeat eosinophil
             count was not conducted in these patients

          -  A history (within the past five years) of and/or current alcohol abuse and/or drug
             abuse

          -  Use of an investigational drug within one month or six half lives (which ever is
             greater) of the first Screening Visit (Visit 1)

          -  Patients requiring oxygen therapy 24 hours a day or requiring oxygen during exercise.
             Patients that desaturated during exercise were only excluded upon medical judgement of
             the investigator
