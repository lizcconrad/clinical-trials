      Shivering is one of the most commonly recognized problem associated with anesthesia, It is
      believed to be thermoregulatory in origin. Studies suggest that pre-warming the patient prior
      to the surgery can reduce the chances of hypothermia induced shivering during the post
      operative period.

      Forced air warmers are the most frequently used active warming devices in the peri-operative
      setting. Currently, our hospital does not pre-warm patients but if our study shows that
      pre-warming reduces post-operative shivering, we will be able to make an evidence based
      decision to start this practice.

      Inadvertent peri-operative hypothermia (IPH) and shivering is one of the most commonly
      recognized problem during anesthesia which is believed to be thermoregulatory in origin.
      Although shivering is uncomfortable for most patients, it is unlikely that this relatively
      small increase in total body oxygen consumption in the average shivering patient is
      associated with increased peri-operative morbidity. It is common for patients to complain
      that their worst memory from the recovery room is the intense cold sensation and
      uncontrollable shivering. New guidelines recommend that patients core temperature has to be
      maintained at &gt;36Â°C, postoperatively. Studies suggest that pre-warming the patient prior to
      the surgery can reduce the chances of hypothermia induced shivering during the post operative
      period.

      Forced air warmers are the most frequently used active warming devices in the peri-operative
      setting. They are effective at preventing hypothermia induced shivering when used before
      induction of anesthesia, during anesthesia and surgery, and after emergence in the
      post-anesthesia care unit. Other methods such as warm fluids, opioids, blankets and warm
      light devices can be used but are less effective as compared to the forced air warming
      devices.

      Currently, our hospital does not pre-warm patients but if our study shows that pre-warming
      reduces post-operative shivering, we will be able to make an evidence based decision to start
      this practice.

    <description>A forced air warmer device will be used to pre-warm patients for 10 minutes in holding bay before surgery. Air warming device is an electrically powered control unit, hose, and inflatable &quot;blanket&quot;. The control unit has an air filter and heater, which warms air entrained from the environment. The hose connects to a blanket.</description>
