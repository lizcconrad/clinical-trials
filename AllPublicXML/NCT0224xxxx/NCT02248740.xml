    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to perform a randomized, prospective trial comparing the two current
      methods of treatment for chronic venous insufficiency related to the Small Saphenous Vein
      (SSV) to evaluate complications and outcomes for each method, and ultimately, to see if one
      is superior to the other.

    <textblock>
      Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is estimated to affect 25 million Americans. This
      condition leads to varicose veins, aching, fatigue, swelling, ulcerations, and bleeding in
      the lower extremities. The second most common cause is a refluxing or incompetent Small
      Saphenous Vein (SSV). This condition results in pooling of deoxygenated blood in the lower
      extremities rather than successful transport of the blood back to the heart and lungs. The
      historical treatment has been to surgically remove or 'strip' the SSV so that blood is
      rerouted through the healthier deep veins. A less invasive treatment option, Endovenous
      Thermal Ablation, has emerged over the last decade and has virtually replaced stripping. This
      involves advancing a catheter under ultrasound guidance through the SSV and then advancing a
      laser fiber or radiofrequency probe through the catheter. These devices then produce the
      energy to destroy the vein as the catheters are slowly pulled back. While both radiofrequency
      ablation and laser ablation are accepted treatments, neither technology has been definitively
      proved to have fewer complications or superior results. This is in part because very few
      practices have the ability to make a head to head comparison between the two technologies and
      must choose one or the other secondary to financial constraints. The aim of this study is to
      perform a randomized prospective trial comparing the two modalities so that more definitive
      information to evaluate complications and outcome can be obtained and then recommendations on
      which, if either, technology is superior can be made.

    <description>For each patient, the Small Saphenous Vein (SSV) will be accessed from the midcalf. After liberal use of tumescent anesthesia, ablation of the incompetent small saphenous vein will be performed. Half the patients will have this procedure performed using the Laser Ablation device and half will be performed using the Radiofrequency Ablation device. They will be randomly assigned to treatment.</description>
