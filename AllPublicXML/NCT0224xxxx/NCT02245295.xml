  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of data concerning the impact of the sedation technique used for
      endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) on diagnostic
      accuracy. The aim of this retrospective study is to compare diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNA
      in deep and moderate sedation, and to investigate other possible determinants of diagnostic
      accuracy in three lymph node locations (mediastinal, subcarinal, and hilar).

      The first consecutive patients at the University Hospital Zurich undergoing EBUS-TBNA for
      selective sampling in deep sedation are compared with the first consecutive patients in
      moderate sedation between 2006 and 2014. Diagnoses based on EBUS-TBNA were compared with
      those on surgical or radiological follow-up.

      Between September, 2007 and January 31, 2014, all consecutive patients who undergo EBUS-TBNA
      at the University Hospital Zurich for selective assessment of enlarged (â‰¥ 1 cm by CT or
      ultrasound) or suspected (enhanced fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity in PET/CT) lymph nodes
      were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data, procedural reports and cytological findings
      were collected from medical records. Computed tomography (CT) or PET/CT scans were
      prospectively reviewed to gather the size and standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG of each
      sampled lymph node. The cytological findings obtained with EBUS-TBNA were verified by
      histological examination, if a surgical biopsy (mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, or
      thoracotomy) was carried out following EBUS-TBNA, or alternatively by clinical and
      radiological follow-up data.
