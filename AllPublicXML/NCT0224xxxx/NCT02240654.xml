  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive, observational, multi-country European cross-sectional study of new
      users of dabigatran etexilate that aims to characterise on- and off-label status and other
      medical characteristics at the time of the first captured prescription of dabigatran
      etexilate in each database. The study will be conducted using Cegedim Strategic Database
      (CSD, France), Danish National Databases (Denmark) and Clinical Practice Research Datalink
      (CPRD, UK).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Potential Off-label Use Estimated Among New Users of Dabigatran Etexilate in Each of the Data Sources.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time period since approval of the SPAF indication in, France: 01 August 2011 to 30 June 2014; Denmark: 01 August 2011 to 30 November 2013; UK: 01 August 2011 to 30 August 2015.</time_frame>
    <description>Definition of off-label use of oral dabigatran etexilate (DE) was based on use for a disease/medical condition other than labelled indications,as described/documented in the data source used in the respective countries, taking into account the changes in the label within the study period. The prevalence of potential off-label use among new users of DE during the overall study period is calculated as the proportion of patients meeting the definition of off-label use by dividing the number of index prescriptions that represented off-label use by the total number of index prescriptions.
Two definitions were applied to estimate potential off-label use based on either recorded diagnoses or proxies: a broad definition of on-label prescribing using codes for disease indication e.g.atrial fibrillation(AF) and a restrictive definition excluding patients with conditions for which the drug is not indicated e.g.valvular AF.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Potential Off-label Use Estimated Among New Users of Dabigatran Etexilate in Each of the Data Sources.</title>
          <description>Definition of off-label use of oral dabigatran etexilate (DE) was based on use for a disease/medical condition other than labelled indications,as described/documented in the data source used in the respective countries, taking into account the changes in the label within the study period. The prevalence of potential off-label use among new users of DE during the overall study period is calculated as the proportion of patients meeting the definition of off-label use by dividing the number of index prescriptions that represented off-label use by the total number of index prescriptions.
Two definitions were applied to estimate potential off-label use based on either recorded diagnoses or proxies: a broad definition of on-label prescribing using codes for disease indication e.g.atrial fibrillation(AF) and a restrictive definition excluding patients with conditions for which the drug is not indicated e.g.valvular AF.
SPAF:Stroke &amp; systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular AF</description>
          <population>The study population included new users of dabigatran etexilate in the study period. New users were defined as those patients who initiated treatment with dabigatran etexilate during the study period and who had not used it during the previous year.</population>
