  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: 5% 5-fluorouracil cream (5-FU) is a well-established treatment for actinic
      keratosis (AK) and ingenol mebutate gel (IMB) is a new topical field therapy.

      Objective: To compare tolerability and safety of IMB with 5-FU for the treatment of facial
      AKs.

      Methods: Open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with 100 patients
      with AKs within 25-cm2 contiguous field on the face. IMB was applied daily for three
      consecutive days. 5-FU was applied twice a day for four weeks. Treatment effect was evaluated
      at baseline and on days 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43, considering ITT populations.

    <description>Primary endpoint was to compare the total local skin reaction grading scale (LSR) and the area under the curve (AUC) with respect to duration of effects, using a generalized linear model, assuming a logarithmic link function. Age, Fitzpatrick skin type and site of the treatment were considered as covariates. The scale ranged from 0 to 4 (with higher numbers indicating greater severity) for the following six local skin effects: erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration (maximum score of 24).</description>

    <description>A secondary endpoint was to evaluate and compare the AUC for each component of the total LSR using generalized linear models. The effect of treatment on the proportion of patients that completed the assigned treatment regimens was compared using generalized estimating equation model and logarithmic link function.</description>

          -  the presence of four to eight clinically typical, visible, and discrete AKs within
             25-cm2 contiguous field on the face (cheek or forehead region)

          -  Women with childbearing potential had to be using effective birth control and have a
             confirmed negative urine pregnancy test prior to trial treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:
