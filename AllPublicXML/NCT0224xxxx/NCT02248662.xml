  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the large number of women affected, the optimal treatment strategy for DCIS is not
      known. To enable informed decision-making by DCIS patients, we seek to provide individualized
      data about outcomes following breast conserving-surgery with and without radiation therapy -
      in terms of recurrence, disease-free and overall survival, and likelihood of long-term breast
      conservation. To do this, we will study patient-specific risk factors for having a new breast
      cancer after DCIS and the likelihood of breast-conserving surgery versus mastectomy if a
      woman has a 2nd cancer diagnosis after DCIS and has not received radiation upfront, using 4
      large datasets. The results of these analyses will then be combined into a model which will
      generate individually tailored predictions of the long-term likelihood of breast conservation
      with and without radiation therapy for DCIS. We will then design a web-based decision aid to
      present the tradeoffs and compare expected treatment outcomes with and without radiation
      therapy. This decision aid will enable patients and their physicians to choose the treatment
      most consonant with patient preferences, and will improve both the quality of decision-making
      and quality of life for patients diagnosed with DCIS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With greater use of screening mammography, the incidence of pre-invasive breast carcinoma or
      ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has increased by 560% over the past 35 years. By the year
      2020, more than 1 million women will be living with a DCIS diagnosis. Despite the large
      number of women affected, the optimal treatment strategy for DCIS is not known. DCIS does not
      spread to the lymph nodes or other sites in the body, but left untreated, can progress to
      invasive breast cancer. Mastectomy, or removal of the breast, had been the standard of care
      for treatment of DCIS and is curative in almost all patients; however, it is an extreme
      surgery for a diagnosis that may not progress to invasive breast cancer. Currently over 70%
      of women with DCIS receive breast-conserving surgery, but they then have a risk of being
      diagnosed with a second cancer in the same breast. Some women with DCIS undergo radiation
      therapy delivered to the breast after breast-conserving surgery to decrease the risk of
      another diagnosis in the affected breast. But if a woman undergoes radiation for DCIS and
      then has a 2nd diagnosis in the same breast, she will need a mastectomy since radiation can
      only be given once due to limits of normal tissue tolerance. Therefore, radiation therapy may
      also reduce the long-term likelihood of breast conservation. The important outcome of
      lifetime breast conservation with or without radiation has not been studied, resulting in
      patients and physicians choosing treatment without complete information about expected
      treatment outcomes. Across the United States, the use of radiation therapy for DCIS varies by
      region of the country. Instead, the choice to add radiation should vary according to the
      values and preferences of each DCIS patient. To enable informed decision-making by DCIS
      patients, we seek to provide individualized data about outcomes following breast
      conserving-surgery with and without radiation therapy - in terms of recurrence, disease-free
      and overall survival, and likelihood of long-term breast conservation. To do this, we will
      study patient-specific risk factors for having a new breast cancer after DCIS and the
      likelihood of breast-conserving surgery versus mastectomy if a woman has a 2nd cancer
      diagnosis after DCIS and has not received radiation upfront, using 4 large datasets. The
      results of these analyses will then be combined into a model which will generate individually
      tailored predictions of the long-term likelihood of breast conservation with and without
      radiation therapy for DCIS. So that patients and physicians can access the results of the
      model, we will then design a web-based decision aid to present the tradeoffs and compare
      expected treatment outcomes with and without radiation therapy. This decision aid will enable
      patients and their physicians to choose the treatment most consonant with patient
      preferences, and will improve both the quality of decision-making and quality of life for
      patients diagnosed with DCIS.
