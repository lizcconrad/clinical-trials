  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of intermittent positive airway
      pressure breathing (specific lung expansion technique) to conventional chest physiotherapy
      chest drainage is effective to accelerate the reabsorption of pleural effusion and
      consequently decrease the duration of chest tube drainage and respiratory system impairment.
      These effects would decrease hospital stay lengths and the incidence of pulmonary
      complications.

    <description>The blind assessor will use a portable spirometer according previously established implementation and acceptability criteria. The following variables will be considered: forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in the 1st second, and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the curve. The predictive values for the Brazilian population will be used</description>

    <description>The patients will be required to breath room air (without supplemental oxygen) for at least 10 minutes prior to the assessments. The blind assessor will use a portable pulse oximeter.</description>

    <description>The occurrence of the following complications will be monitored until the day of hospital discharge by a physician blinded to the intervention groups: pneumonia (chest radiography with pulmonary infiltrate associated with two of the following signs: purulent expectoration, temperature above 38.3°C and a greater than 25% increase in baseline leukocyte count with hyperthermia); atelectasis (RX associated with abnormal chest acute respiratory symptoms); and hypoxemia (peripheral oxygen saturation associated with respiratory symptoms below 85%)</description>

    <description>The patients allocated to this group will undergo bronchial hygiene treatments administered with a high-frequency oscillator for 5 sets of 10 repetitions, lung expansion exercises using flow oriented incentive spirometry for 5 sets of 20 repetitions and walking for 100 meters (i.e., the same treatment that will be administered to the Conventional Chest Physiotherapy group). Additionally, this group will receive positive airway pressure breathing with 15 mmHg by a device via a rubber facial mask for 30 minutes in a sitting position.</description>

    <description>In the sitting position, the patients allocated to this group will undergo bronchial hygiene treatments administered with a high-frequency oscillator for 5 sets of 10 repetitions, lung expansion exercises using flow oriented incentive spirometry for 5 sets of 20 repetitions and positive airway pressure breathing with 4 mmHg via a rubber facial mask for 5 minutes in a sitting position. These patients will also walk for 100 meters.
The use of positive pressure breathing with 4 mmHg has no therapeutic value, but will help keep the blinding of assessors by the presence of the equipment in the room and mark the patient's skin.</description>

The use of positive pressure breathing with 4 mmHg has no therapeutic value, but will help keep the blinding of assessors by the presence of the complete kit of equipment in the room.</description>
