    <textblock>
      Exposure, relaxation, and rescripting therapy (ERRT) is a promising psychological
      intervention developed to target trauma-related nightmares and sleep disturbances. Though
      further evidence is needed, ERRT has shown strong support in reducing the number and
      intensity of nightmares, as well as improving overall sleep quality in both civilian and
      veteran samples. This study will assess the efficacy in individuals diagnosed with bipolar
      disorder.

      This pilot study will examine the efficacy of Exposure, Relaxation, &amp; Rescripting Therapy
      (ERRT) on chronic nightmares in trauma-exposed adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder
      (B-ERRT), as these individuals have been excluded from past clinical trials. Eligible
      participants will be assessed prior to starting treatment. B-ERRT will be conducted once a
      week for approximately five consecutive weeks for approximately two hours per session. Each
      treatment session focuses on one of the following topics/skills: psychoeducation regarding
      trauma, nightmares, and sleep disturbances on bipolar disorder, relaxation techniques,
      exposure to the trauma-nightmare, and relapse prevention. Participants will then be asked to
      complete two to three follow-up assessments, 1-week, 3-months, and potentially 1-year after
      the end of the treatment.
