      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of P-321 Ophthalmic
      Solution in subjects with mild to moderate dry eye disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, dose escalation, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled,
      Phase 1/2a trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of P-321 Ophthalmic
      Solution in subjects with mild to moderate dry eye for up to 4-weeks of treatment and up to 8
      scheduled in clinic visits. This study will conduct a consecutive dose escalation of the
      following concentrations of P-321 Ophthalmic Solution given two times a day via ocular
      instillation: 0.0005% (Cohort 1), 0.0015% (Cohort 2), 0.005% (Cohort 3), and 0.01% (Cohort
      4). Up to 48 subjects will be enrolled in four consecutive cohorts. Subjects will be
      randomized to P-321 Ophthalmic Solution or placebo in a 3:1 ratio.

      Safety and tolerability assessments, drug plasma concentrations and drug urine concentrations
      will be evaluated throughout the study in all cohorts.
