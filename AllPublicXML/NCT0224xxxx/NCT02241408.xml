  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact that treatment with a cellular
      concentrate derived from an individual's own fat, known as the stromal vascular fraction
      (SVF), has on joint pain and functionality in people with Osteoarthritis (OA). SVF contains
      components with &quot;regenerative&quot; properties, including stem cells that have shown promise for
      ameliorating specific disease conditions. This study is designed to evaluate joint pain and
      functionality changes in individuals with OA for up to 12 months following SVF treatment.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Overall Knee Assessment Over the Course of a 12 Month Period as Measured by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS LK 1.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline over the course of 12 months using participants' assessment of their knee and associated problems. Mean scores will be used for baseline (day 0) and all interviews up to month 12 (months 1, 3, 6, and 12). Answer options are graded on a 5 point Likert scale and each question gets a score from 0 to 4.</description>
