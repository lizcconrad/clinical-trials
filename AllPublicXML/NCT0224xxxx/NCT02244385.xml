  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      25-30% of women with preexisting vascular disease (chronic hypertension/diabetes/obesity)
      will develop pre-eclampsia and or growth restriction. In addition, the frequency of
      stillbirths in this group is dramatically increased over the general population. Pregnancy
      complications in this very heterogeneous group are likely to be a combination of a failure of
      the maternal vasculature to adapt to pregnancy and/or a failure of placental development. The
      relative contribution of these two mechanisms is poorly understood and current preventative
      strategies (aspirin) in this group only prevent a small number of adverse outcomes. This
      important and complex group have been inadequately investigated to date mainly because of the
      diversity of their underlying disease complicating prospective research studies.

      The evolution of tools which allow more detailed assessments of both uteroplacental blood
      flow and maternal vascular function will enable us to perform prospective studies in these
      women and to develop targeted preventative measures. Recent biomarker studies have also
      identified a number of biomarkers which have not yet been assessed in these high risk groups.
