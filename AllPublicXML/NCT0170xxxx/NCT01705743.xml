  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to investigate the effect of a combination effect of sevoflurane and nitrous oxide
      on cerebral electrical activity, the investigators determined the MAC of sevoflurane combined
      with nitrous oxide inducing isoelectric electroencephalogram (EEG) in 50% of the subjects
      (MACie) in middle aged subjects.

    <textblock>
      Anaesthesia was induced by sevoflurane in oxygen. Cisatracurium 0.15 mg kg-1 was administered
      after loss of the lash reï¬‚ex, then ventilated manually until the amplitude of T1 decreased to
      0. Intubation was performed and switched to mechanical ventilation with a fresh gas flow of 2
      L min-1. Anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane or sevoflurane+60% nitrous oxide
      respectively. The surgical incision was performed at least 30 min after tracheal intubation,
      provided that the predetermined end-tidal sevoflurane concentration had been constant for at
      least 30 min and that the difference between inspired and end-tidal concentrations was less
      than 10%.

      Brain electrical activity was measured using Narcotrend Monitor and S/5 Compact Anaesthesia
      Monitor, which displayed unprocessed EEG and burst suppression ratio, respectively. The
      design of the experiment is referred to the &quot;Dixon up-and-down&quot; method. To avid anaesthesia
      awareness, the first subject was designed to receive end-tidal sevoflurane concentration of
      2.5 %. The presence or absence of isoelectric EEG (Entropy Module) of the preceding patient
      determined the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane given to the next patient (with an
      increment size of 0.2%). The isoelectric EEG was considered as significant when the
      isoelectric state last for more than 1 min. The maximal burst suppression rate was recorded
      if isoelectric EEG was not reached.
