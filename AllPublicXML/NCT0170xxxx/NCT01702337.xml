  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the health and economic impact of the bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV-1) and
      the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV-2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a prevalence-based model (by using efficacy data from each vaccine's
      respective trials and published cost data for Taiwan) which estimates the differences in
      lesions, genital warts, cervical cancer and costs from a healthcare payer's perspective
      prevented between HPV-1 and HPV-2 vaccines during one year (when all women are vaccinated).
      It also analyses costs from a societal perspective.
