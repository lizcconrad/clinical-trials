    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Akt inhibitor MK2206 and
      lapatinib ditosylate when given together with trastuzumab in treating patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast,
      gastric, or gastroesophageal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Akt inhibitor MK2206
      and lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for tumor growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving Akt
      inhibitor MK2206 and lapatinib ditosylate together with trastuzumab may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of MK-2206
      (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in combination with trastuzumab and lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate)
      in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast or gastric cancer;
      two schedules of lapatinib administration will be examined-continuous daily dosing and
      pulsatile dosing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide preliminary assessment of the safety and tolerability of MK-2206 administered
      in combination with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/HER2 blockade via trastuzumab and
      lapatinib in adult patients with a locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast or
      gastric tumor.

      II. To explore the anti-tumor activity of MK-2206 in combination with trastuzumab and
      lapatinib in patients with advanced HER2-positive solid tumor.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the anti-tumor activity of MK-2206 in combination with trastuzumab and
      lapatinib in HER2-positive solid tumor patients with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway
      activation events, e.g., phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit
      alpha (PIK3CA) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and other related gene mutations and
      expressions; to compare the HER2 and PI3K-PTEN mutation status of the primary tumor to
      metastatic tumor biopsy when available.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK2206 and lapatinib ditosylate.

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15; lapatinib ditosylate
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21 or on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17; and trastuzumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  The effects of MK-2206 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately

          -  Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets; nasogastric or gastrostomy (G) tube
             administration is not allowed; tablets must not be crushed or chewed

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; if
             the patient has residual toxicity from prior treatment, toxicity must be =&lt; grade 1

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents; no concurrent use of
             endocrine therapy is permitted; patients on bisphosphonates or denosumab for bone
             metastases or osteopenia/porosis are considered eligible

          -  Patients with active brain metastases requiring radiation should be excluded as they
             may develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events; patients with stable brain metastases (mets) (&gt; 6
             months without change in steroids or seizure medications) will be considered eligible

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to MK-2206, trastuzumab, or lapatinib

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP450 3A4) are ineligible

          -  Preclinical studies demonstrated the potential of MK-2206 for induction of
             hyperglycemia in all preclinical species tested; patients with diabetes or in risk for
             hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials with MK-2206, but the hyperglycemia
             should be well controlled on oral agents or insulin before the patient enters the
             trial; patients with poorly controlled diabetes with hemoglobin (Hgb)A1C &gt; 9% will be
             excluded

          -  Preclinical studies indicated transient changes in corrected QT interval (QTc)
             interval during MK-2206 treatment; prolongation of QTc interval is potentially a
             safety concern while on MK-2206 therapy; cardiovascular baseline QTc &gt; 480 msec will
             exclude patients from entry on study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because MK-2206 an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with MK-2206, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with MK-2206; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients with unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or with a history of a
             myocardial infarction within 6 months; patients with high-risk uncontrolled
             arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, high-grade atrioventricular [AV] block,
             supraventricular arrhythmias which are not adequately rate-controlled); patients with
             uncontrolled hypertension (i.e., over 160/90 mmHg); patients who are controlled on
             anti-hypertensive medication will be allowed to enter the study

          -  Patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and are on
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with MK-2206; in addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and
             as such patients with cluster of differentiation (CD)4 counts &lt; 200 will be excluded;
             HIV-positive patients not on anti-retrovirals and with an adequate CD4 count will be
             considered eligible
