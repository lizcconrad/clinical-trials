  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare efficacy of bevacizumab monotherapy with standard
      chemotherapy (DTIC) in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. In addition, we want to
      evaluate the predictive value of a set biomarkers associated with vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) dependent angiogenesis. Also, we aim to identify mechanisms causing acquired
      resistance to treatment with bevacizumab and escape mechanisms caused by other angiogenic
      growth factors than VEGF. Finally, we want to analyze safety and influence on outcome
      variables by primary prevention of bevacizumab induced hypertension by low dose beta blockers
      in comparison with an ACE inhibitor.
