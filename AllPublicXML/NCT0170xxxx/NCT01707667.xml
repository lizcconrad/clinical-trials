    <measure>The Number of High-Amplitude Propagating Contractions (HAPC)</measure>
    <time_frame>over 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Manometry recordings were read by an experienced gastroenterologist who was blinded to the treatment each subject received. The tracings were analyzed using computer-based validated software. HAPC and manometry data were available for every sensor as well as average values for each HAPC and manometry time point. The primary outcome analysis of HAPC data used the following threshold: Mean amplitude ≥100mmHg and extension ≥20cm (9 sensors).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Concentration Curve (AUC) of All HAPCs</measure>
    <time_frame>over 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC of all HAPCs during the first 12 hours after treatment was calculated as the sum of the AUC at all sensors of each HAPC at the ≥100mmHg and ≥20cm threshold.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mean Amplitude of HAPC</measure>
    <time_frame>over 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The mean amplitude of all HAPCs was calculated as the sum of the mean amplitude for each HAPC divided by the number of HAPCs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First HAPC</measure>
    <time_frame>over 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The median (95% CI) time to first HAPC after administration of investigational product with amplitude ≥100mmHg and extension ≥20cm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Propagation Velocity of HAPC</measure>
    <time_frame>over 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Propagation velocity was calculated as the extension divided by the duration for each HAPC. Mean propagation velocity is the sum of the propagation velocities divided by the number of HAPCs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of HAPC</measure>
    <time_frame>over 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The mean duration of all HAPCs was calculated as the sum of the duration of each HAPC divided by the number of HAPCs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motility Index</measure>
    <time_frame>over 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Motility index (mmHg) was summarized for the following 3 time points: pre-dose, 0-5 hours post-dose, and 5-12 hours post-dose. The motility index is defined as the natural logarithm of all peak amplitudes of every contraction +1.</description>

        <description>Manometry recordings were read by an experienced gastroenterologist who was blinded to the treatment each subject received. The tracings were analyzed using computer-based validated software. HAPC and manometry data were available for every sensor as well as average values for each HAPC and manometry time point. The primary outcome analysis of HAPC data used the following threshold: Mean amplitude ≥100mmHg and extension ≥20cm (9 sensors).</description>
