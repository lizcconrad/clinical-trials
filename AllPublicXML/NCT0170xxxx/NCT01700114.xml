  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to collect data to describe the real-world use and safety and
      effectiveness of MelaFind® in a post-approval clinical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study to test the hypothesis that, among eligible and evaluable
      lesions with central histological reference standard status melanoma or high-grade lesion,
      the relative sensitivity ρ comparing enrolling dermatologists after MelaFind use with
      enrolling dermatologists if MelaFind were not available is greater than 110%. This represents
      a clinically meaningful increase in sensitivity.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate real-world use and safety and
      effectiveness of MelaFind in a clinical setting.

        All patients of any age, race, ethnicity, or gender, presenting with pigmented skin lesions
        that that meet the Indications for Use and Lesion Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria,
        including signing the Informed Consent Form, are eligible to participate in this study.
        This single-arm study has one study group consisting of eligible lesions on eligible
        patients.

        Up to six clinical sites in the US will participate in this study, one in each of the six
        states in which MelaFind is commercially available. Some of the sites will be located in
        urban settings, and some will be located in a suburban or rural setting. At least 50% of
        the sites will new, i.e., they did not participate in the MelaFind pivotal study. Some
        sites will be academic centers and some private practices.
