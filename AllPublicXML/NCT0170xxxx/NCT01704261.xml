  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of the addition of omarigliptin in
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control on metformin and
      glimepiride. The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the addition of treatment with
      omarigliptin provides a greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) compared with the addition
      of placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A1C is blood marker used to report average blood glucose levels over a prolonged periods of time and is reported as a percentage (%). Thus, this change from baseline reflects the Week 24 A1C minus the Week 0 A1C.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Blood glucose was measured on a fasting basis. FPG is expressed as mg/dL. Blood was drawn at predose on Day 1 and after 24 weeks of treatment to determine change in plasma glucose levels (i.e., FPG at Week 24 minus FPG at baseline).</description>
