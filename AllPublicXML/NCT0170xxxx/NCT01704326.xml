      The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Journey Deuce
      Bicompartmental Knee System. Patients will be examined clinically at time intervals
      throughout the study duration. Exams will include completion of clinical assessment, x-rays,
      and completion of patient questionnaires.

        The patients eligible for this study are non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease
        patients requiring a primary unilateral knee surgery. The affected areas must be limited to
        the medial and patellofemoral compartments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient presents with non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease of the medial and
             patellofemoral compartments requiring a unilateral knee replacement.

          -  Patient is 30 to 75 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Patient is willing to consent to participate in the study by signing and dating an
             IRB-approved consent form.

          -  Patient plans to be available for follow-up through five years postoperative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is known to have insufficient femoral or tibial bone stock resulting from
             conditions such as cancer, distal femoral/proximal tibial osteotomy, significant
             osteoporosis or metabolic bone disorders.

          -  Patient is immunosuppressed, has an autoimmune disorder, or an immunosuppressive
             disorder (i.e. chronic condition characterized by markedly inhibited ability to
             respond to antigenic stimuli.) Examples of such conditions include patients who are on
             immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroid hormones in large amounts, cytotoxic drugs,
             antilymphocytic serum or irradiation in large doses) or patients with acquired
             immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  Patient has inflammatory arthritis (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis)

          -  Patient has BMI greater than or equal to 40.

          -  Patient has had major knee surgery in the past i.e. HTO, unicondylar knee replacement,
             failed fracture fixation.

          -  Patient has an active infection, local or systemic.

          -  Patient has physical, emotional or neurological conditions that would compromise the
             patient's compliance with postoperative rehabilitation and followup (e.g.: drug or
             alcohol abuse, serious mental illness, or general neurological conditions such as
             Parkinson, Multiple sclerosis, etc.).

          -  Patient has ACL deficiency in the study knee.

          -  Patient has hip arthritis and/or replacement.

          -  Patient has lateral compartment disease.

          -  Patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Patient has a known sensitivity to materials in the device.
