  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions, short term safety
      and efficacy of standard dose lopinavir/ritonavir 200mg/50 (two tablets twice daily) given
      with ritonavir 100 mg three tablets twice daily given in combination with rifampin in
      HIV-infected persons with tuberculosis
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label non-randomized pharmacokinetic study of 10-12 HIV-infected
      patients co-infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

      Enrollment: Potential subjects with active tuberculosis who have tolerated a rifampin
      containing regimen for at least 2 weeks. Potential subjects will be referred from the
      surrounding communities to Laboratorio de Pesquisa Clinica em Micobacterioses(LAPCLINTB)

      Visit 1: Subjects will then be started on lopinavir/ritonavir containing HAART regimen with
      standard twice daily dosing. Ritonavir 100 mg capsules will be added to the regimen and the
      dose escalated until the patient is taking 3 capsules twice daily. The time between
      enrollment and visit 1 will be determined by the treating physician.

      Visit 2: They will return about 1 week after dose escalation has been completed to sample
      lopinavir and rifampin concentrations.

      Visit 3: Subject will return in 2 weeks to have repeat to review results of lopinavir
      concentrations and response to therapy. Ritonavir will be adjusted as needed.

      Visit 4: Subject will then return in 4 weeks for last visit for evaluation. Lopinavir and
      rifampin PK will be done.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Antiretroviral naive

          -  If not antiretroviral naïve they must meet the following criteria:

               -  Taking Kaletra containing regimen with suppressed viral load.

               -  Taking an NNRTI or integrase containing regimen without prior history of use of
                  PI for more than 2 weeks

               -  Taking an NNRTI or integrase containing regimen with prior exposure to PI greater
                  than 2 weeks. It must be clearly stated in the source document that PI was
                  switched to another agent for convenience.

               -  Taking another PI containing regimens with suppressed viral load. It must be
                  clearly stated in source document that if another PI was used for greater than 2
                  weeks the regimen was switched to another agent for convenience. Subjects with
                  prior history of PI use may be enrolled, if there is a genotype showing no
                  resistance to Kaletra Other Inclusion criteria

          -  Be at least 18 years of age and able to give informed consent.

          -  Diagnosed with TB by criteria per Brazilian Ministry of Health

          -  Have a good clinical response to TB.

          -  Tolerating tuberculosis therapy containing rifampin for the 2 weeks prior to
             screening,except for persons taking protease inhibitors at time of diagnosis of TB.,.
             Subjects taking protease inhibitors will be screened and initiate visit 1 within 3
             days of starting TB medication

          -  HIV positive with documentation present in source document.

          -  Have a CD4 cell count greater than 50 cells/mm3if not taking ART. Persons with cd4 &lt;

             enrollment in the study will allow for quicker initiation of antiretroviral therapy
             than referral to another treatment center.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-compliance with DOTPlus. Alternatively DOT can be done by telephoning patient on a
             daily basis 5 times a week and having patient annotate taking drug in a log which
             would be reviewed by clinic staff

          -  Liver enzymes greater than 2 times ULN.

          -  Bilirubin greater than 2 times ULN.

          -  Fasting triglycerides greater than 400 mg/dL.

          -  Fasting cholesterol &gt; 1.6 upper limits of normal.

          -  GI intolerance of tuberculosis medications requiring discontinuation of tuberculosis
             medications.

          -  Fasting glucose greater 150 mg/dL.

          -  Pregnant women.

          -  Use of one of the prohibited medications

          -  Have a CD4 cell count of 50 cells/mm3or less

          -  Hepatitis B or C infection
