  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether buprenorphine is a beneficial, safe, cost
      effective treatment alternative to morphine sulfate in the treatment of Neonatal Abstinence
      Syndrome (NAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal abstinence syndrome is a condition that affects newborns who are exposed to chronic
      opioid drugs while they are in a mother's uterus (womb) prior to birth. The current standard
      of care treatment includes morphine sulfate. Buprenorphine is a drug used in adults to treat
      narcotic dependence and withdrawal, but has not yet been approved for use in newborns as a
      treatment alternative for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. This investigation is designed to
      measure if sublingual (under the tongue) buprenorphine is able to reduce hospital length of
      stay and decrease number of days of drug treatment currently required in treatment of NAS.
      Another goal will be to understand buprenorphine as a cost effective treatment for NAS.

    <description>The injectable formulation of buprenorphine (Buprenex; Reckitt Benckiser) will be prepared to a final concentration of 0.075 mg/mL in 100% ethanol and simple syrup USP to create a sublingual preparation.
Infants initial dose: 15.9 µg/kg per day in 3 divided doses with escalation/weaning based upon standardized scoring of NAS symptoms, using standardized Finnegan scoring Maximum dosage: 60 µg/kg per day Duration: Infants will receive buprenorphine until they are successfully weaned off of opioids and no longer show withdrawal symptoms, evidenced by low Finnegan scores. Mean use in other investigations was 24 days.</description>
