      Mesenchymal stem cells have capability to differentiate into myocardium, vascular endothelial
      cell, vascular smooth muscle cell and will be useful for heart regeneration. Adipose tissue
      is relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cell compared to bone marrow tissue. In this
      trial, eligible ischemic heart failure patients will be proceeded intracoronary
      administration of autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells by cardiac catheterization.

      The population of the ischemic heart failure patients is enormous in Japan and the only
      radical treatment for them is heart transplantation: however, the number of giving donor is
      extremely limited. Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into
      mesodermal-lineage cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as myocardial cell. They
      reside in the mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues. The latter
      tissues are relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow cells. In
      this study, the ischemic heart failure patients will undergo intracoronary administration of
      autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells through cardiac catheterization.
