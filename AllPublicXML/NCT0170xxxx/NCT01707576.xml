  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to estimate the prevalence of depression and subsyndromal states among
      adolescents 13 to 17 years consulting to hospital emergency rooms for any reason, for they
      are another way of tracking this suffering, as they host many troubled teens at once for
      health problems and accidents sometimes iterative, reflecting their risk behaviour.

      Secondary purposes are to assess the feasibility and desirability of a post-emergency medical
      consultation for adolescents who scored high on a self-administered questionnaire, and to
      assess the impact of this approach by later monitoring.

      This is a multicenter longitudinal survey in three emergency centers in Ile-de-France, with 2
      periods of daily collection and comprehensive three weeks spread over one year, followed by a
      remote evaluation.

      The project is as follows:

      Phase A :

      - Evaluation of the prevalence: systematic execution of self-administered questionnaire by
      all adolescents consulting, night and day in each center.

      Phase B :

        -  For adolescents whose outcome questionnaire exceed 4, a post-emergency consultation will
           be proposed within 15 days.

        -  Telephone survey, 12 months after the passage of emergency every teenager who completed
           self-administered questionnaire and presenting himself to the post-emergency
           consultation. This survey will aim to assess the psychological status of adolescents and
           the impact of any specific treatment.
