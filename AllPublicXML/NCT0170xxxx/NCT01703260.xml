    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of roflumilast and pioglitazone therapy
      on serum transaminase (ALT) levels in adults with Nonalcoholic SteatoHepatitis.

      This proof of concept study will evaluate the effect of roflumilast and pioglitazone on
      transaminase levels and liver fat content.

      Takeda has chosen not to continue this Study, however, randomized subjects were allowed to
      complete the study per protocol.

      The decision to terminate the study is not related to any safety concerns with either of the
      study medications.

    <description>Liver fat content was quantitatively measured by evaluating the percentage of proton density fat fraction (PDFF) from an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On the basis of Couinaud classification (a classification used to describe functional liver anatomy), the liver was divided into 8 segments: caudate, left superolateral, left inferolateral, left superomedial (4a), left inferomedial (4b), right anteroinferior, right posteroinferior, right posterosuperior and right anterosuperior.</description>

        <description>Liver fat content was quantitatively measured by evaluating the percentage of PDFF from an abdominal MRI. On the basis of Couinaud classification (a classification used to describe functional liver anatomy), the liver was divided into 8 segments: caudate, left superolateral, left inferolateral, left superomedial (4a), left inferomedial (4b), right anteroinferior, right posteroinferior, right posterosuperior and right anterosuperior.</description>
