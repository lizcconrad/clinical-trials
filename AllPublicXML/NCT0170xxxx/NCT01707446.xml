  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium after cardiac surgery is reported in a range of 3-47% of patients. Delirium is a
      serious complication that results in prolonged length of stay, increased health care costs
      and is associated with higher death rates. The exact cause involved in the development of
      delirium after cardiac surgery is unclear. The latest advancement in near-infrared
      spectroscopy (NIRS) Oximetry offers real-time management of patients at risk of brain injury.
      This approved device will monitor cerebral oxygenation during and 24hr after cardiac surgery,
      recording oxygenation in real time allowing the clinical team the opportunity to intervene
      early to prevent ischemia and possibly preventing untoward events. Adverse events followed
      include, but are not limited to, stroke, (transient ischemic attacks), heart attack,
      (myocardial infarction), clots found in lungs (pulmonary embolism), kidney failure,
      pneumonia, cause of death for 30-days after surgery (all cause mortality).

      Hypothesis: Perioperative restoration of rSO2 desaturation to baseline values results in
      lower delirium rates after complex cardiac surgery.

    <description>Bilateral NIRS (The INVOS® Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter)will be used to measure rSO2 intraoperatively and during the 24h postoperative period in the intensive care unit. In the intervention group, an alarm threshold at 75% of the baseline rSO2 value will be established.</description>
