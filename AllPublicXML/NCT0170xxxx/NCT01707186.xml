    <textblock>
      PRISM (Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure) has been developed since the
      mid-1990s; the task was first developed as a simple measure of how a person was coping with
      his or her experience of illness. This is an international, multicentre study to evaluate the
      PRISM tool for the assessment of suffering in rheumatoid arthritis at different stages of the
      illness and the effect of treatment intervention. There are 5 sites: Berlin, Oxford, Limoges,
      Montreal and Queensland. The study will recruit 200 patients in total.

      In addition to the procedures for the patient's routine clinical visit, the patients will be
      invited to answer a series of questionnaires and donate 20ml blood sample. Patients will be
      asked to attend 3 times over 24 weeks
