    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies hypofractionated image guided radiation therapy in treating
      patients with stage IV breast cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor
      cells. Giving radiation therapy in different ways may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of correlating changes in the number of circulating tumor
      cells in metastatic breast cancer patients with time to progression following
      hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all known sites (=&lt; 5) of disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival, overall survival, pattern of failure, and
      toxicity of hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all active sites (=&lt; 5) of
      metastatic disease.

      II. To assess the feasibility of the Interferon-Related DNA Damage Resistance Gene Signature
      (IRDS) for its predictive value in treatment failure, both in and out of the radiation field.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients with metastases in the lung, liver, abdomen, and extremities undergo 10 fractions or
      less of hypofractionated radiation therapy and patients with brain metastases undergo a
      single fraction of stereotactic radiosurgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 2 months, at
      3 months, every 3 months for a year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

             residual

             to study entry

          -  Patients with prior metastatic treatment are eligible if they have been disease free
             for &gt; 3 years; participants may receive hormonal and Herceptin treatment at any time

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are ineligible if they have had prior treatment for their metastatic disease
             within 3 years

          -  Prior radiotherapy that would result in overlap of radiation therapy fields

          -  Co-existing or prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless
             disease free for a minimum of 3 years (for example, carcinoma in situ of the breast,
             oral cavity, or cervix are all permissible)

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

          -  Clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, any history of
             clinically significant congestive heart failure (CHF), unstable angina pectoris, or
             cardiac arrhythmia

             registration

          -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
             requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration

          -  Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects; note,
             however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation parameters are not

          -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease
             Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             testing is not required for entry into this protocol; the need to exclude patients
             with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this
             protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive; protocol-specific requirements may
             also exclude immunocompromised patients

          -  Pregnancy, breast feeding or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually
             active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during
             treatment and for at least three months following completion; this exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic

          -  Prior treatment with anti-angiogenic therapy

          -  Significant atelectasis such that CT definition of the gross tumor volume (GTV) is
             difficult to determine

          -  Exudative, bloody or cytologically malignant effusions

          -  Evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion prior to study start; patients with
             pleural effusion that is transudative, cytologically negative, and non-bloody are
             eligible; if a pleural effusion is too small for diagnostic thoracentesis, the patient
             will be eligible
