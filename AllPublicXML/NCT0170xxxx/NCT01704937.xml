  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the reconstitution of normal flora by a &quot;stool
      transplant&quot; from a healthy individual to a C. difficile-infected recipient, and has long been
      a successful approach to recurrent/refractory C. difficile. The purpose of this project is to
      generate a frozen FMT inoculum from well-screened healthy volunteer donors which can be used
      repeatedly, particularly in those who do not have a healthy intimate partner or other related
      donor. Delivery of FMT has been performed colonoscopically, by fecal retention enema, or by
      the nasogastric route. This study will evaluate the safety and secondarily the efficacy of a
      frozen inoculum administered by nasogastric tube vs administered by colonoscope.

      Subjects with recurrent/relapsing C. difficile infection (10 per group) will receive FMT via
      either:

        -  colonoscopy

        -  NGT

      The primary endpoint is assessment of safety as measured by clinical events (GI, procedural,
      systemic). Efficacy will be defined as a resolution of diarrhea off antibiotics for C.
      difficile, in the absence of a need for OTHER systemic antibiotics, i.e. resumption of a
      normal bowel status for the individual. Secondary efficacy endpoints include weight,
      subjective well-being and relative clinical improvement per standardized questionnaire, and
      subject qualitative assessment of, and satisfaction with, the transplant procedures. Subjects
      will be monitored for clinical safety by history and standard exams and the follow-up
      questionnaire as well as followed closely by phone and in person.
