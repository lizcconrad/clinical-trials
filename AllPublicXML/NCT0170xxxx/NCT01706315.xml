  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, single blind study to investigate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of GSK2140944 following repeat oral doses in
      healthy adult subjects. The study will include a Screening period (40 days), Treatment period
      (16 days) and a Follow-up period (26 to 30 days). A single dose will be administered on Day 1
      for characterization of single dose PK, followed by twice-daily (BID) or thrice-daily (TID)
      dosing on Days 3 to 16. Subjects may only be randomized to one cohort per the randomization
      schedule. Up to 6 cohorts will be enrolled using a sequential panel. Subjects in Cohort 1
      will receive GSK2140944 (6) and placebo (2). Subsequent cohorts will enroll 16 subjects such
      that 12 subjects will receive GSK2140944 and 4 subjects will receive placebo, per dose level
      according to the randomization schedule. Dose escalations are planned to run in successive
      weeks. Cohort 2 may begin dosing once subjects in Cohort 1 have completed 7 days of BID
      dosing, PK data is reviewed and safety data from at least 6 subjects is available. Each
      subsequent dose escalation will commence only when GSK2140944 safety data and available PK
      data of at least 12 subjects dosed at the previous dose level have been reviewed. The number
      of cohorts may be reduced or expanded if needed. The first planned dose is 400 milligram (mg)
      BID but may be modified based upon emergent PK, safety and tolerability data from ongoing
      clinical study BTZ115198 evaluating single and repeat intravenous (IV) doses of GSK2140944.
      The projected dose for Cohort 2 is 800 mg BID, Cohort 3 is 1500 mg BID, Cohort 4 is 2300 mg
      BID or 1500 mg TID and Cohort 5 and cohort 6 will be decided later. The planned maximum dose
      is 2500 mg TID but may be modified based upon emergent safety, tolerability and PK data.
      Doses of GSK2140944 or placebo will be administered following a moderate fat meal.

             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GlaxSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor agree that the finding
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 60 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential

             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  A screening or Day -2 urinalysis positive for protein or glucose (greater than &quot;trace&quot;

          -  History of drug abuse within 6 months of the study

          -  History of smoking or use of nicotine containing products within 3 months of
             screening, or a positive urine cotinine indicative of smoking at screening.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine
             or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current
             study medication.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, or use of St. John's Wort within 14 days prior to the first
             dose of study medication. By exception, the volunteer may take paracetamol or
             acetaminophen (&lt;=2 grams/day) up to 48 hours prior to the first dose of study
             medication. However, the Investigator and GSK study team can review medication on a
             case by case basis to determine if its use would compromise subject safety or
             interfere with the study procedures or data interpretation.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (if the clinical
             research unit uses heparin to maintain intravenous cannula patency).

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 ml within 12 weeks prior to dosing.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, pummelos,
             exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices containing such products from
             7 days prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Screening ECG: Heart rate &lt;40 and &gt;100 bpm for males and &lt;50 and &gt;100 bpm for females.
             PR Interval &lt;120 and &gt;220 msec, QRS duration &lt;70 and &gt;100 msec, QTcB or QTcF interval
             &gt;450msec. Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (does not include ST segment
             changes associated with repolarization); any conduction abnormality (including but not
             specific to left or right complete bundle branch block, atrioventricular (AV) block
             [2nd degree or higher], Wolf Parkinson White [WPW] syndrome), sinus pauses &gt;3 seconds,
             non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (&gt;=3 consecutive ventricular
             ectopic beats) or any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal
             investigator and GSK medical monitor, will interfere with the safety of the individual
             subject.

          -  Screening holter monitoring shows one or more of the following: any symptomatic
             arrhythmia (except isolated extra systoles); sustained cardiac arrhythmias (such as
             atrial fibrillation or flutter, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) [&gt;10 consecutive
             beats]); sinus tachycardia (or SVT) &gt;150 bpm; non-sustained or sustained ventricular
             tachycardia (defined as &gt;=3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats); any conduction
             abnormality (including but not specific to left or right complete bundle branch block,
             AV block [2nd degree or higher in an awake subject], WPW syndrome, other
             pre-excitation syndromes); symptomatic sinus pause or sinus pause &gt;3 seconds - unless
             patient is straining, vomiting, or having some other type of hypervagal response; 300
             or more supraventricular ectopic beats in 24 hours; 250 or more ventricular ectopic
             beats in 24 hours; Ischemia, diagnosed by a sequence of EKG changes that include flat
             or down sloping ST-segment depression &gt;0.1 mV, with a gradual onset and offset that
             lasts for a minimum period of 1 minute. Each episode of ischemia must be separated by
             a minimum duration of at least 1 minute, during which the ST segment returns back to
             baseline (1x1x1 rule).

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          -  Neutrophil count &lt;2000 cells per microliter (a single repeat is allowed for
             eligibility determination).
