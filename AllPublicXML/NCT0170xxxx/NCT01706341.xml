    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of administering a small dose of
      glucose on the pregnant women and their neonates during cesarean section. We investigate the
      safety and efficacy of use of a glucose-containing solution for the pregnant women and the
      neonates.

      Rapid infusion of large amount of glucose is associated with fetal hyperglycemia,
      hyperinsulinemia, and neonatal hypoglycemia. However, the effect of small dose of glucose is
      unclear. We conducted a pilot study of small dose of glucose. We investigated the effect of a
      glucose-containing fluid on the blood sugar of the umbilical artery. We found that in the
      case of no-glucose-containing fluid, there were some cases in which umbilical arterial
      concentration of glucose was less than 50 mg/dl, which might cause neonatal hypoglycemia. In
      addition, in the case of 1%-glucose-containing fluid, mean umbilical arterial concentration
      of glucose was 97 mg/dl.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of administering a small dose of
      glucose on the pregnant women and their neonates during cesarean section. We investigate the
      safety and efficacy of use of a glucose-containing solution for the pregnant women and the
      neonates.
