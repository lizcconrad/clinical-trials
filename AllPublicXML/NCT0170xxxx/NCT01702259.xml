  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the application of green diode low level
      laser light therapy is effective in reducing the appearance of cellulite in the thighs and
      buttocks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellulite is a common term used to describe superficial pockets of trapped fat, which causes
      uneven dimpling or &quot;orange peel&quot; skin. It appears in 90% of post-adolescent women. In
      advanced stages of cellulite, heaviness and pain may occur.

      Currently available treatments for cellulite have minimal to no demonstrable effect and some
      involve risky invasive procedures. Therefore, the potential advantages of the application of
      low level laser light therapy to reduce the appearance of cellulite over current treatment
      options include a risk free procedure that is non-invasive and pain free. Since low level
      laser light within the green spectrum has been proven to increase the synthesis of collagen,
      it is believed that its application may serve to decrease the appearance of cellulite by
      tightening the skin. Moreover, newly synthesized collagen may alter the irregular pattern of
      the connective tissue responsible for the formation of cellulite.

    <measure>Number of Subjects That Met the Individual Success Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The individual subject success was defined as a decrease of one or more stages on the Nurnberger-Muller Scale (NMS) from baseline to 2 weeks post-assessment for both of the right and left thighs. The NMS is a four-stage scale used as an industry standard to classify stage or degree of cellulite and to determine change in stage or degree of cellulite following treatment intervention. The NMS ranges from Stage 0 (no cellulite) to Stage III (worse cellulite). A decrease in NMS Stage indicates reduced appearance of cellulite and is positive for study success. An increase in NMS Stage indicates worsened appearance of cellulite and is negative for study success. Overall study success was defined as 35% more subjects in the test group than in the control group attaining individual subject success. Results are reported below as the number of subjects in each group that met the individual subject success criteria.</description>

    <measure>Bilateral Upper Thigh Circumference Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Circumference of the upper right and left thighs was recorded in inches (ins) using a flexible tape measure and the two measurements were summed, at baseline and 2 weeks. A decrease in bilateral upper thigh circumference measurements is positive in support of study success and an increase in bilateral circumference measurements is negative in support of study success.</description>

    <measure>Change in Percent (%) Body Surface Area (BSA) Covered by Cellulite.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The % Total Body Surface Area (% TBSA) covered by cellulite was marked and quantified according to the Lund and Browder Chart and methodology. The Lund and Browder chart is widely considered the most accurate method of determining Body Surface Area (BSA). It consists of an anterior and posterior diagram of a patient that is divided into sections. The % TBSA is the sum of the marked areas. The % TBSA of the buttocks and bilateral thighs area, front and back combined, affected by cellulite was calculated according to the Lund and Browder Chart.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction With Study Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At completion of the treatment administration phase, the subject was asked to indicate how satisfied he or she was with any overall perceived change in the appearance of cellulite in his or her thighs and buttocks using the following five-point scale:
Very Satisfied Somewhat Satisfied Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied Not Very Satisfied Not at All Satisfied
Results are reported as the number of subjects who reported being 'Very Satisfied' or 'Somewhat Satisfied' with the study outcome.</description>

          <title>Stage on the Nurnberger-Muller Scale (NMS)</title>
          <description>The Nurnberger-Muller Scale (NMS) is a four-stage scale to classify stage or degree of cellulite. Stage II is defined as dimpling appearing spontaneously when standing but not when lying down. Orange peel appearance of the skin is evident to the naked eye without need for manipulation. Stage III is defined as dimpling spontaneously present with standing and lying down, evident to the naked eye without manipulation. Orange peel skin surface appearance with raised areas and nodules. NMS is assessed for both legs of each participant, and the worse of the stages is reported.</description>

          <description>The % Total Body Surface Area (% TBSA) covered by cellulite was marked and quantified according to the Lund and Browder Chart and methodology. The Lund and Browder chart is widely considered the most accurate method of determining Body Surface Area (BSA). It consists of an anterior and posterior diagram of a patient that is divided into sections. The % TBSA is the sum of the marked areas. The % TBSA of the buttocks and bilateral thighs area, front and back combined, affected by cellulite was calculated according to the Lund and Browder Chart.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects That Met the Individual Success Criteria</title>
        <description>The individual subject success was defined as a decrease of one or more stages on the Nurnberger-Muller Scale (NMS) from baseline to 2 weeks post-assessment for both of the right and left thighs. The NMS is a four-stage scale used as an industry standard to classify stage or degree of cellulite and to determine change in stage or degree of cellulite following treatment intervention. The NMS ranges from Stage 0 (no cellulite) to Stage III (worse cellulite). A decrease in NMS Stage indicates reduced appearance of cellulite and is positive for study success. An increase in NMS Stage indicates worsened appearance of cellulite and is negative for study success. Overall study success was defined as 35% more subjects in the test group than in the control group attaining individual subject success. Results are reported below as the number of subjects in each group that met the individual subject success criteria.</description>

        <description>The % Total Body Surface Area (% TBSA) covered by cellulite was marked and quantified according to the Lund and Browder Chart and methodology. The Lund and Browder chart is widely considered the most accurate method of determining Body Surface Area (BSA). It consists of an anterior and posterior diagram of a patient that is divided into sections. The % TBSA is the sum of the marked areas. The % TBSA of the buttocks and bilateral thighs area, front and back combined, affected by cellulite was calculated according to the Lund and Browder Chart.</description>

        <population>The number of subjects analyzed for % TBSA covered by cellulite is less than the total number enrolled as this measure was not recorded for all subjects.</population>
