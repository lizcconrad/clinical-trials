      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of hydromorphone hydrochloride
      administered by intrathecal delivery.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm safety study to evaluate the safety of hydromorphone
      hydrochloride given by continuous intrathecal infusion using an implantable pump device. This
      study will enroll both subjects on a current opioid intrathecal medication as well as na√Øve
      subjects now current on intrathecal opioid medications. All subjects currently on intrathecal
      opioid treatment will be converted from their current intrathecal therapy to intrathecal
      hydromorphone hydrochloride according to standard medical practice. After an optimal dose for
      pain relief is achieved, subjects will remain on therapy for a total of 12 months or until
      discontinuation from the study. During this continuous dosing period, dose adjustments (up or
      down) are permitted to manage pain or side effects provided a maximum dose of 10 mg/day is
      not exceeded. Subjects will be assessed for pain intensity using a visual analog scale of
      pain intensity (VASPI) instrument at each study visit.

      Subjects will be evaluated for side effects and clinical complications associated with the
      use of intrathecal hydromorphone. Events will be classified by intrathecal drugs used and
      concentrations.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this trial is Safety. There is no formal efficacy assessment planned in this open-label safety study. The patient status will be assessed by providing a VASPI score at each study visit. Subjects who drop out provide a VASPI assessment prior to discontinuation from the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included:

          1. Subjects must be at least 18 years of age and no more than 75 years old.

          2. Clinically diagnosed with severe chronic pain for at least a 6-month period.

          3. Subject is reasonably expected to benefit from intrathecal pain medication and has a
             programmable implantable intrathecal pump or meets clinical criteria for implantation
             of an intrathecal pump per Standard of Care.

          4. Subject agrees to sign a Pain Treatment Agreement (Narcotic Contract) limiting
             narcotic prescriptions to the study medication prescribed by the investigator.

          5. Subject must be cognitively intact and, in the opinion of the investigator, capable of
             participation in the trial.

          6. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable
             and effective double-barrier method of birth control.

          7. Subjects who can receive an MRI if required by the study protocol.

          8. Provides written Ethics Committee approved informed consent.

          9. Willing to comply with all study procedures and requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded:

          1. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          2. Subject has any known or suspected allergy to hydromorphone hydrochloride or to the
             materials of the infusion pump or intrathecal catheter.

          3. Subject has a history of dependence and abuse of opioids, stimulants, alcohol, or
             benzodiazepines, as defined by DSM-IV criteria, within the past year (physical
             dependence on prescribed opioid analgesics is allowed but abuse of opioids according
             to DSM-IV is not permitted, i.e. opioid addiction for recreational use).

          4. Subjects who show signs of active systemic infection.

          5. Subjects with a metastatic cancer to the spinal canal or a known central nervous
             system contraindication to intrathecal therapy.

          6. Subjects have a condition requiring diathermy procedures.

          7. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 12 months.

          8. Subjects who are unable or unwilling to return to all of the required follow-up
             visits.

          9. As a result of medical review and physical examination, the Investigator considers the
             subject unfit for the study.
