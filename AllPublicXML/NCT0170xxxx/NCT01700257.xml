  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in the USA. Early stage lung cancer is
      asymptomatic. Most patients with lung cancer are usually symptomatic at diagnosis and already
      have advanced stage disease. Low dose CT screening (LDCT) for high risk individuals has
      recently been shown to decrease lung cancer mortality by 20%. However, 4 out of 5 lung cancer
      deaths are not prevented with LDCT screening alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the addition of a blood biomarker test is being combined with early LDCT to
      determine if screening with combination may result in detection of more lung cancer at an
      earlier stage of disease.The study will also assess if the blood test is able to detect lung
      cancers in high risk individuals when the LDCT is negative for cancer. There will be
      health-economic costs included in the final analysis of study data.
