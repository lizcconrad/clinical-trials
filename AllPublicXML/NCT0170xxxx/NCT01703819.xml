      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of acutely dosed Neurexan using an
      experimental stress test called the Trier Social Stress Test

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An acute stress reaction is a biopsychological condition arising in response to an event
      which is individually regarded as emotionally stressful. The onset of a stress response is
      associated with specific physiological actions in the sympathetic nervous system, both
      directly and indirectly through the release of adrenaline and to a lesser extent
      noradrenaline from the medulla of the adrenal glands. These catecholamine hormones facilitate
      immediate physical reactions by triggering increases in heart rate and breathing,
      constricting blood vessels. The other major player in the acute stress response is the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

      Although stress has been described as a non-specific psychophysiological response to
      environmental stimuli, it is possible to discern specific bodily stress responses caused by
      specific emotional reactions to novel, ambivalent or uncontrollable situations and stimuli.
      For example, social stress induces elevated cortisol levels, particularly if the stressor is
      uncontrollable, unpredictable, and constitutes a social-evaluative threat due to the judgment
      of others such as in the Trier Social Stress Test. Usually, the TSST induces a two-fold
      increase in saliva cortisol with peaks around 10-20 min. after stress test termination. Also,
      an average increase in heart rates of around 20 beats per minute (bpm) is observed during the
      TSST. In addition, emotional states and feelings have been shown to be affected by this
      stress test, such as marked increases in stress perception,anxiety and emotional insecurity
      as well as decreases in mood, calmness and feeling awake.

      Preliminary results indicate that Neurexan® may improve coping abilities in stressful
      situations. This study aims to investigate the effect of Neurexan® on subjectively perceived
      nervousness and tension during an acute stressful situation and to characterize the efficacy
      profile of Neurexan®.

    <description>Tension and nervousness were self-assessed by the participants on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) before and after a stress test. The VAS is used to determine the subjective impression of tension and nervousness on a 10 cm bipolar visual scale ranging from 0
= &quot;not at all&quot; to 100 = &quot;highly&quot;. The measurements started with first intake of Neurexan or Placebo and were repeated until 100 minutes after the end of the stress test. The total stress was then summarized with the area under the curve (AUC) method.</description>

    <measure>State Anxiety and Stress Perception Measured by STAI-X1</measure>
    <time_frame>-90 minutes, +15 minutes, +100 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>State anxiety and stress perception were measured by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory X1 before and after a stress test. The measurements took place 90 minutes before the stress test and were repeated at 15 and 100 minutes after the end of the stress test. The German version of the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory was used and differentiates between temporary/emotional state anxiety versus personality trait anxiety. The two scales with 20 items each assess (1) anxiety as a trait (STAI-X2) and (2) anxiety as a state (STAI-XI). Answers are given in a 4-point rating scale ranging from 1 =&quot;not at all&quot; to 4 =&quot;very true&quot;. For analysis of each, STAI-scale single scores were summed up to one total score, representing the state and trait anxiety. Score range is 20-80 and higher scores indicate a higher anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Psychological Questionnaire (Modified Somatic SCL90)</measure>
    <time_frame>-210 minutes, +100 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The SCL90 has 90 items with dimensions like depression, somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social insecurity, anxiety, phobic anxiety, aggression/hostility, paranoid ideation, psychoticism and each item in a subscale ranged from 0 to 4. The lower range values are favorable outcomes and higher are worse outcomes. The modified somatic SCL90 uses the SCL90 somatization items, but instead of a 7 day timeframe asks for &quot;now&quot;. The corresponding items from SCL90 were: 1, 4, 12, 27, 40, 42, 48, 49, 52, 53, 56, 58 and the introductory question: &quot;How much do you currently suffer from&quot; (&quot;Wie sehr leiden Sie momentan unter:&quot;). The median of the average Modified Somatic SCL90 score is reported. The average score was calculated at each time point as the sum score divided by the number of non-missing individual question results for subjects with no more than 2 missing responses. The lower values in the range represent favorable outcomes while the higher values represent worse outcomes.</description>

        <title>State Anxiety and Stress Perception Measured by STAI-X1</title>
        <description>State anxiety and stress perception were measured by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory X1 before and after a stress test. The measurements took place 90 minutes before the stress test and were repeated at 15 and 100 minutes after the end of the stress test. The German version of the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory was used and differentiates between temporary/emotional state anxiety versus personality trait anxiety. The two scales with 20 items each assess (1) anxiety as a trait (STAI-X2) and (2) anxiety as a state (STAI-XI). Answers are given in a 4-point rating scale ranging from 1 =&quot;not at all&quot; to 4 =&quot;very true&quot;. For analysis of each, STAI-scale single scores were summed up to one total score, representing the state and trait anxiety. Score range is 20-80 and higher scores indicate a higher anxiety.</description>

        <title>Psychological Questionnaire (Modified Somatic SCL90)</title>
        <description>The SCL90 has 90 items with dimensions like depression, somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social insecurity, anxiety, phobic anxiety, aggression/hostility, paranoid ideation, psychoticism and each item in a subscale ranged from 0 to 4. The lower range values are favorable outcomes and higher are worse outcomes. The modified somatic SCL90 uses the SCL90 somatization items, but instead of a 7 day timeframe asks for &quot;now&quot;. The corresponding items from SCL90 were: 1, 4, 12, 27, 40, 42, 48, 49, 52, 53, 56, 58 and the introductory question: “How much do you currently suffer from” (&quot;Wie sehr leiden Sie momentan unter:&quot;). The median of the average Modified Somatic SCL90 score is reported. The average score was calculated at each time point as the sum score divided by the number of non-missing individual question results for subjects with no more than 2 missing responses. The lower values in the range represent favorable outcomes while the higher values represent worse outcomes.</description>
