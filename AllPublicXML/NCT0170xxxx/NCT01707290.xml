    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of long-term ivacaftor treatment in
      participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) from Studies 110 (NCT01614457), 111 (NCT01614470), and
      113 (NCT01685801).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ivacaftor is the first Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulator
      to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical benefit in participants with CF. Results
      from Phase 3 studies (NCT00909532 [Study 102] and NCT00909727 [Study 103]) showed that
      ivacaftor is effective in the treatment of participants with CF who have the G551D-CFTR
      mutation, as evidenced by sustained improvements in CFTR channel function (measured by
      reduction in sweat chloride concentration) and corresponding substantial, durable
      improvements in lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, respiratory symptoms, and weight
      gain. Ivacaftor was also well tolerated, as evidenced by the rates and reasons for premature
      discontinuation and results of safety assessments.

      Ivacaftor (Trade Name Kalydeco; 150 mg tablets) was initially approved in the United States
      for the treatment of CF in participants 6 years of age and older who have a G551D mutation in
      the CFTR gene.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in Ivacaftor Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Week 108 (Study 112)</time_frame>
    <description>AE: any untoward medical occurrence in a participants during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency after informed consent form is signed. AE includes serious as well as non-serious AEs. SAE (subset of AE): medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to the study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, In-patient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event. TEAEs were defined as adverse events with start date or increased severity on and after the first dose of study drug through Week 108.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 2, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 104</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and 104 (Study 112)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Hankinson and Wang standards were used to calculate percent predicted FEV1 (for age, gender, and height). The Hankinson standard was used for male participants 18 years and older and female participants 16 years and older. The Wang standard was used for male participants aged 6 to 17 years and for female participants aged 6 to 15 years. Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement before intake of the first dose of study drug (Ivacaftor) in Study 112. Results were planned to be reported for Ivacaftor arm and were stratified by parent study 110, 111 and 113.</description>

    <description>BMI was defined as weight in kg divided by height in m^2. Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement before intake of the first dose of study drug (Ivacaftor) in Study 112. Results were planned to be reported for Ivacaftor arm and were stratified by parent study 110, 111 and 113.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 24, 48 and 104 (Study 112)</time_frame>
    <description>Sweat samples were collected using an approved collection device. Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement before intake of the first dose of study drug (Ivacaftor) in Study 112. Results were planned to be reported for Ivacaftor arm and were stratified by parent study 110, 111 and 113.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change From Baseline in Respiratory Domain of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire Revised (CFQ-R) at Week 2, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and 104</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and 104 (Study 112)</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R is a validated participant reported outcome measuring health related quality of life for participants with CF. Respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms (for example, coughing, congestion, wheezing), score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and better health related quality of life. Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement before intake of the first dose of study drug (ivacaftor) in Study 112. Results were planned to be reported for Ivacaftor arm and were stratified by parent study 110, 111 and 113.</description>

    <description>Pulmonary exacerbation events include those events which require treatment with new or changed antibiotic therapy (intravenous, inhaled, or oral) for greater than or equal to 4 sinopulmonary signs/symptoms. The number of events were reported. Results were planned to be reported for Ivacaftor arm and were stratified by parent study 110, 111 and 113.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Hankinson and Wang standards were used to calculate percent predicted FEV1 (for age, gender, and height). The Hankinson standard was used for male participants 18 years and older and female participants 16 years and older. The Wang standard was used for male participants aged 6 to 17 years and for female participants aged 6 to 15 years. Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement before intake of the first dose of study drug (Ivacaftor) in Study 112. Results were planned to be reported for Ivacaftor arm and were stratified by parent study 110, 111 and 113.</description>

          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug (Ivacaftor). Here, &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at the specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>

        <description>The CFQ-R is a validated participant reported outcome measuring health related quality of life for participants with CF. Respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms (for example, coughing, congestion, wheezing), score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and better health related quality of life. Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement before intake of the first dose of study drug (ivacaftor) in Study 112. Results were planned to be reported for Ivacaftor arm and were stratified by parent study 110, 111 and 113.</description>
