  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chinese bayberry, one of six Myrica species native to China, is rich in anthocyanins, and
      cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) was identified as a major anthocyanin component. In previous
      animal studies from us and other investigators, anthocyanins have been shown to ameliorate
      dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in different rodent models. The aim of the present study
      was to examine the effects of Chinese bayberry juice (CBJ) on the serum lipid profile and on
      levels of biomarkers related to antioxidant status in young adults with features of fatty
      liver disease.
