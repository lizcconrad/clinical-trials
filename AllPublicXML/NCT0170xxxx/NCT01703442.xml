    <textblock>
      A single-center prospective observational study. This study examines urine flow and
      haemodynamic parameters during abdominal surgery and analyses the association to
      postoperative renal function and markers and to postoperative clinical outcome.

      Primary hypothesis:

      • Within a goal-directed haemodynamic protocol during gynecologic cancer surgery there are
      phases of temporary anuria.

      Secondary hypothesis:

        -  Perioperative anuric phases are directly associated to the postoperative increase of
           NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and creatinine

        -  Perioperative renal dysfunction is directly associated to postoperative complications
           and functional recovery of patients

        -  A response of urine flow to a standardized postoperative diuretic bolus can identify
           patients who benefit from a pharmaceutical fluid mobilization

        -  Within a goal-directed haemodynamic protocol during gynaecologic cancer surgery, the
           methods for the measurement of stroke volume of the heart differ
