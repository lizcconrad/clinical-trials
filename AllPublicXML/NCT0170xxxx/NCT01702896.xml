      In this phase II trial, the previously described IL-2 schedule (daily IL-2 for 5 days (per
      week) every 3 weeks) will be tested in a larger cohort of patients with melanoma to attempt
      to determine the response rate, median duration of response, and median survival. The dose
      intensity of this schedule would allow a patient treated on this regimen to achieve the
      target threshold (&gt; 1440 million IU/m2/year).

    <description>Radiographic studies to evaluate for response were done after every 2 cycles (6 weeks) until disease progression or death from any cause up to 2 years. Standard RECIST response criteria were utilized. Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT scan: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response Rate (ORR) = 100%(CR + PR/total number of patients receiving Interleukin-2).</description>

    <description>Duration of response is calculated as the time (months) from the date at which response is first observed (per standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] to the date of first observed disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years. The actual date of tumor assessments was used for this calculation. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Patients may have
             received prior systemic therapy or may be previously untreated.

          2. Patients must have bi-dimensional measurable disease on physical exam or radiologic
             studies.

          3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and estimated survival of at least 3 months.

          4. White blood count of &gt; 3500/mm3, platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 gm/dl;

          5. Patients must undergo a low-level cardiac stress test as a screen for possible
             atherosclerotic heart disease. Patients with a positive stress test would be excluded
             from this trial.

          6. Patients with elevated temperatures &gt; 100.5 F must have sources of occult infection
             excluded.

          7. Patients must be felt to have recovered from effects of prior therapy, such as &gt; 2
             weeks after prior chemotherapy.

          8. Patient consent must be obtained prior to entrance onto study.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must take
             adequate precautions to prevent pregnancy during treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical illness requiring corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents (such as
             cyclosporin or methotrexate.

          2. Autoimmune disease such as inflammatory arthritis which could be exacerbated by
             immune-based therapy.

          3. Prior history of psychiatric disorder which could be exacerbated by interleukin-2.

          4. Lactation or pregnancy.

          5. Evidence of significant cardiovascular disease including history of recent (&lt; 6 months
             prior) myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, primary cardiac arrhythmias
             (not due to electrolyte disorder or drug toxicity, for example) beyond occasional
             PVC's, angina, positive low-level stress test, or cerebrovascular accident.

          6. Current brain metastasis.
