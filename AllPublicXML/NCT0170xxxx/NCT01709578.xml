      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate that sarilumab added to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were
      effective for:

        -  reduction of signs and symptoms at Week 24 and

        -  improvement of physical function at Week 12

      in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were inadequate responders or
      intolerant to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonists.

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives were to investigate the effects of SAR153191 (REGN88) when added to
      DMARD therapy, in participants with active RA who were inadequate responders or intolerant to
      TNF-α antagonists, for:

        -  Reduction of signs and symptoms at Week 12;

        -  Improvement in physical function at Week 24;

        -  Improvement in disease activity score as measured by other American College of
           Rheumatology (ACR) derived components at Weeks 12 and 24;

        -  Improvement in quality of life as measured by participant reported outcomes (PROs) at
           intermediate visits and Week 24.

      To assess the exposure of sarilumab added to DMARD therapy in this population.

      To assess the safety of sarilumab in this population.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 240 centers in 27 countries. A total of 1224 participants were screened between 29 October 2012 and 7 August 2014, of whom 546 participants were randomized and 678 were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to failure to meet inclusion criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized 1:1:1 (placebo q2w : sarilumab 150 mg q2w : sarilumab 200 mg q2w) via a centralized randomization system using an interactive voice response system stratified by region and number of previous anti- tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy (1 versus &gt;1).</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Physical function was assessed by HAQ-DI. It consisted of at least 2 questions per category, participant reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week rated on a 4-point scale where 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of category scores and divided by the number of categories answered, ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = no disability and 3 = unable to do, high-dependency disability. Least-squares (LS) means and standard errors (SE) at Week 12 were obtained from a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline HAQ-DI as a covariate.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12</title>
          <description>Physical function was assessed by HAQ-DI. It consisted of at least 2 questions per category, participant reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week rated on a 4-point scale where 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of category scores and divided by the number of categories answered, ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = no disability and 3 = unable to do, high-dependency disability. Least-squares (LS) means and standard errors (SE) at Week 12 were obtained from a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline HAQ-DI as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score for 28 Joints ­C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-­CRP) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>DAS28 is a composite score that includes 4 variables: TJC (based on 28 joints); SJC (based on 28 joints); General health (GH) assessment by the participant assessed from the ACR rheumatoid arthritis (RA) core set questionnaire (participant global assessment) in 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Marker of inflammation assessed by the high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in mg/L. The DAS28 score provides a number indicating the current disease activity of the RA. DAS28 total score ranges from 2-10. A DAS28 score above 5.1 means high disease activity, whereas a DAS28 score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity and a DAS28 score below 2.6 means disease remission. LS means and SE at Week 24 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline DAS28-CRP score as a covariate.</description>

          <description>ACR responses are assessed with a composite rating scale of the American College of Rheumatology that includes 7 variables: TJC; SJC; levels of an acute phase reactant (CRP level); participant's assessment of pain; participant's global assessment of disease activity; physician's global assessment of disease activity; participant's assessment of physical function by HAQ-­DI. ACR70 is defined as achieving at least 70% improvement in both TJC and SJC, and at least 70% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 other assessments of the ACR.</description>

        <description>DAS28 is a composite score that includes 4 variables: TJC (based on 28 joints); SJC (based on 28 joints); GH by the participant assessed from the ACR rheumatoid arthritis core set questionnaire (participant global assessment) in 100 mm VAS; marker of inflammation assessed by hs-CRP in mg/L. The DAS28 provides a number indicating the current activity of the RA. DAS28 total score ranges from 2-10. A DAS28 score above 5.1 means high disease activity, whereas a DAS28 score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity and a DAS28 score below 2.6 means disease remission.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>CDAI is a composite index constructed to measure clinical remission in RA that does not include a laboratory test, and is a numerical summation of 4 components: TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (in cm), and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease VAS (in cm). Total scores ranges from 0 to 76 with a negative change in CDAI score indicating an improvement in disease activity and a positive change in score indicating a worsening of disease activity. LS means and SE at Week 24 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline CDAI as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary Scores (PCS) at Week 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 summary measures: PCS and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales. The PCS had 4 subscales: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, and general health perception. The MCS had 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; 0= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health and well-being. LS mean and SE at Week 24 by MMRM with treatment,region,number of previous anti TNFs,visit,and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline SF-36 (PCS) as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Morning Stiffness VAS at Week 24</title>
        <description>RA is associated with stiffness of joints, especially in the morning after prolonged stationery state. The degree of stiffness can be an indicator of disease severity. The severity of morning stiffness was assessed on a VAS scale from 0 mm (no problem) to 100 mm (major problem). LS mean and SE at Week 24 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline Morning Stiffness as a covariate.</description>

        <description>The WPS-RA is a validated questionnaire that evaluates productivity limitations within work and within home associated with RA over the previous month. The questionnaire was interviewer-administered and was based on participant self-report. It contains 9 questions addressing employment status (1 item), productivity at work (3 items), and within and outside the home (5 items). Number of work days missed in the last month by the participant was reported. LS mean and SE at Week 24 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline WPS-RA as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WPS-RA at Week 24: Days With Household Work Productivity Reduced by ≥ 50% Due to RA</title>
        <description>The WPS-RA is a validated questionnaire that evaluates productivity limitations within work and within home associated with RA over the previous month. The questionnaire was interviewer-administered and was based on participant self-report. It contains 9 questions addressing employment status (1 item), productivity at work (3 items), and within and outside the home (5 items). Number of days with reduced household work productivity by ≥ 50% in the last month by the participant was reported. LS mean and SE at Week 24 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline WPS-RA as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID) Scores at Week 24</title>
        <description>RAID is a composite measure of the impact of RA on participants that takes into account 7 domains: pain, functional disability, fatigue, physical and emotional well being, quality of sleep, and coping. The RAID is calculated based on 7 numerical rating scales (NRS) questions. Range of the final RAID value is 0-10 where 0= not affected, very good and 10 = most affected weighted and calculated with a total score range of 0 (not affected, very good) to 10 (most affected). A higher RAID value indicate worse status and lower indicate not affected. LS mean and SE at Week 24 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline RAID as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimension 3 Level (EQ-5D-3L) VAS Scores at Week 24</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, generic measure of health outcome. It was designed for self-completion by participants. It was specifically included to address concerns regarding the health economic impact of RA. The EQ-5D-3L comprises 5 questions on mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status with 3 possible answers for each item (1=no problem, 2=moderate problems, 3=severe problems) and a vertical VAS that allows the participants to indicate their health state today that can range from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). LS mean and SE at Week 24 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline EQ-5D-3L Scores as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DAS28-CRP at Week 12</title>
        <description>DAS28 is a composite score that includes 4 variables: TJC (based on 28 joints); SJC (based on 28 joints); GH by the participant assessed from the ACR rheumatoid arthritis core set questionnaire (participant global assessment) in 100 mm VAS; marker of inflammation assessed by hs-CRP in mg/L. The DAS28 provides a number indicating the current activity of the RA. DAS28 total score ranges from 2-10. A DAS28 score above 5.1 means high disease activity, whereas a DAS28 score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity and a DAS28 score below 2.6 means disease remission. LS mean and SE at Week 12 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline DAS score as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 at Week 12</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a generic 36-item questionnaire measuring HRQL covering 2 summary measures: PCS and MCS. The SF-36 consists of 8 subscales. The PCS is represented by 4 subscales: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, and general health perception. The MCS is represented by 4 subscales: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Participants self-report on items in a subscale that have between 2-6 choices per item using Likert-type responses (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; 0= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health and well-being. LS mean and SE at Week 12 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline SF-36 as a covariate.</description>

        <description>The WPS-RA is a validated questionnaire that evaluates productivity limitations within work and within home associated with RA over the previous month. The questionnaire was interviewer-administered and was based on participant self-report. It contains 9 questions addressing employment status (1 item), productivity at work (3 items), and within and outside the home (5 items). Number of work days missed in the last month by the participant was reported. LS mean and SE at Week 12 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline WPS-RA as a covariate.</description>

          <description>The WPS-RA is a validated questionnaire that evaluates productivity limitations within work and within home associated with RA over the previous month. The questionnaire was interviewer-administered and was based on participant self-report. It contains 9 questions addressing employment status (1 item), productivity at work (3 items), and within and outside the home (5 items). Number of days with reduced household work productivity by ≥ 50% in the last month by the participant was reported. LS mean and SE at Week 12 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline WPS-RA as a covariate.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, generic measure of health outcome. EQ-5D was designed for self-completion by participants. The EQ-5D was specifically included to address concerns regarding the health economic impact of RA. The EQ-5D-3L comprises 5 questions on mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status with 3 possible answers for each item (1=no problem, 2=moderate problems, 3=severe problems) and a vertical VAS that allows the participants to indicate their health state today that can range from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). LS mean and SE at Week 12 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline EQ-5D-3L scores as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in RAID Scores at Week 12</title>
        <description>RAID score is a composite measure of the impact of RA on participants that takes into account 7 domains: pain, functional disability, fatigue, physical and emotional well being, quality of sleep, and coping. The RAID is calculated based on 7 NRS questions. Range of the final RAID value is 0-10 where 0= not affected, very good and 10 = most affected weighted and calculated with a total score range of 0 (not affected, very good) to 10 (most affected). A higher RAID value indicates worse status and lower indicates not affected. LS mean and SE at Week 12 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline RAID scores as a covariate.</description>

        <description>ACR components were: TJC, SJC, physician global VAS, participant global VAS, pain VAS,HAQ-DI &amp; CRP. 68 joints were assessed for tenderness (TJC scoring 0-68) and 66 joints for swelling (SJC scoring 0-66). The 66 SJC evaluated the following joints: temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, interphalangeal of thumb, distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, knee, ankle mortise, ankle tarsus, metatarsophalangeal, interphalangeal of great toe, and proximal/distal interphalangeal of the toes. The TJC examined hip joints, in addition to the joints assessed for SJC. Increase in number of tender joints/swollen joints indicated severity.

        <description>ACR components were: TJC, SJC, physician global VAS, participant global VAS, pain VAS,HAQ-DI &amp; CRP. HAQ-DI consisted of at least 2 questions per category, participant reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week rated on a 4-point scale where 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of category scores and divided by the number of categories answered, ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = no disability and 3 = unable to do, high-dependency disability.
