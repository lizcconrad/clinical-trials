  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether the new inactivated polio vaccine that is
      based on attenuated poliovirus strains is safe and to evaluate the immune response in healthy
      adults.

      The goal of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of Sabin-IPV and adjuvanted
      Sabin-IPV produced with the production process set up for technology transfer by the National
      Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM, formerly the Netherlands Vaccine
      Institute (NVI).

        -  The primary objective is to evaluate safety (local and systemic reactions) of
           intramuscular injection with Sabin-IPV and adjuvanted Sabin-IPV in healthy adults (first
           in human).

        -  The secondary objective is to evaluate immunogenicity of Sabin-IPV and adjuvanted
           Sabin-IPV in healthy immunized adults.
