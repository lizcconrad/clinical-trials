  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of early treatment with Tysabri
      in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) participants on their quality of life (QoL)
      as measured by Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) over 2 years. The secondary
      objectives of the study are: to evaluate the impact of early treatment with Tysabri in RRMS
      participants over 2 years on the following: annualized relapse rate (ARR), Expanded
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS), work productivity, quality of life (QoL) by EuroQol
      5-Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D), QoL by Subject Global Assessment of Wellbeing visual
      analog scale (VAS) and to evaluate clinical disease-free status (relapses, EDSS) over 2
      years.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a patient-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a patient's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. The physical score is generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate worse health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Annualized Relapse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical relapse is defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms, not associated with fever, lasting for at least 24 hours, and followed by a period of 30 days of stability or improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 5 sets of 3 questions pertaining to specific health states (i.e., mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, anxiety), and a visual analog scale that records the respondent's self-rated health from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Patient Global Assessment of Wellbeing Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Assessment of Wellbeing measures quality of life on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) where 0 is the worst imaginable health state and 100 is the best imaginable health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with Clinical Disease-Free Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Freedom from clinical disease activity is defined as the percentage of participants with no relapse and no EDSS progression, defined as a 1-point change from baseline. EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>
