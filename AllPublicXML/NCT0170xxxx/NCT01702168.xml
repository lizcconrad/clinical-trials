      Aim: To identify, assess, and address organizational context and provider-level barriers and
      facilitators of implementation of Evidence-based treatments (EBTs) using a mixed-methods
      approach in a diverse community mental health center (CMHC), Massachusetts General Hospital
      Chelsea Health Clinic (MGH Chelsea).

      Hypothesis: Anticipated barriers may include, but are not limited to, organizational climate,
      heavy case-loads, community mental health workers (CMHW) beliefs about EBTs, and provider
      motivation to learn EBT.

    <description>Evidence Based Practice Attitudes Scale (EBPAS-50) is a brief, validated measure of clinician attitudes towards evidence based treatments (EBTs) containing four subscales: 1) Appeal measures whether the provider would adopt a new practice if it is intuitively appealing, or is being used by colleagues who are happy with it; 2)Requirement measures whether provider would adopt a practice if it is required by an agency, supervisor, or state; 3)Openness measures whether the provider is generally open to trying new interventions and would be willing to try or use new types of therapy, and 4)Divergence measures whether the provider perceives research-based interventions as not clinically useful or less important than clinical experience.</description>

    <description>Organizational Readiness for Change (ORC) measures organizational climate. The ORC is defined as the organizational and staff factors related to adoption of new technologies. ORC is conceptualized as a set of factors that are necessary for sustained change. These factors include motivation, resources, staff attributes, and organizational climate. Readiness for change has been associated with successful dissemination.</description>

    <measure>OSC</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Organizational Social Context (OSC) measures the following domains: structure, culture, psychological and organizational climate, and work attitudes. The OSC measurement system is a validated measure guided by a model of social context that composes both organizational(structure and culture) and individual (work attitudes and behavior) level constructs, including individual and shared perceptions (psychological and organizational climate) that are believed to mediate the impact of the organization on the individual. The OSC measurement system includes 105 items that form 16 first order factors and seven second order factors confirmed in national samples of social and mental health service organizations. These factors are grouped by the domains of structure, culture, psychological and organizational climate, and work attitudes.</description>
