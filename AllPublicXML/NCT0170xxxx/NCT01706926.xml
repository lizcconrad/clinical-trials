  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 3 subcutaneous doses of
      mavrilimumab compared with placebo in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in subjects with
      moderate-to-severe adult onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the therapeutic improvements with recent biologic agents approved for rheumatoid
      arthritis, there is still significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects with
      this chronic disease to achieve a faster, more complete response, and higher rates of
      remission. The aim of the study is to explore the optimum dose of mavrilimumab for further
      clinical development and more fully investigate the efficacy and safety profile of
      mavrilimumab after longer drug exposure (that is, 24 weeks). The results of this study will
      form the basis for future clinical studies with mavrilimumab.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints Using C-Reactive Protein (DAS28 [CRP]) Score at Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 (CRP) calculated swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) using the 28 joints, general health (GH) using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst), and CRP (milligram per liter [mg/L]). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score= more disease activity. DAS28 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 3.2 = low disease activity, greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission. A Day 85 responder was defined as a participant who experienced more than 1.2 decrease from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) score at Day 85.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue (FACIT-fatigue) at Day 169</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 169</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire questionnaire to measure the degree of fatigue experiences by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score) where higher sore represent less fatigue.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score of 28 Joints Using C-Reactive Protein (DAS28 [CRP]) Score at Day 85</title>
        <description>DAS28 (CRP) calculated swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) using the 28 joints, general health (GH) using participant assessment of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity using the numerical rating scale with 0 = best, 10 = worst), and CRP (milligram per liter [mg/L]). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score= more disease activity. DAS28 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 3.2 = low disease activity, greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high disease activity and &lt;2.6= remission. A Day 85 responder was defined as a participant who experienced more than 1.2 decrease from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) score at Day 85.</description>

          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and Day 169 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Pulmonary Function Test Values Below Threshold Values at Day 169</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function testing were performed by spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in 6 second (FEV6), and forced vital capacity (FVC). FEV1 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FEV6 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in the six second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. FVC was the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. The percentage of predicted values of these pulmonary function tests were calculated based on decreases from baseline and categorized as less than or equal to (=&lt;) 15 percent (%), more than (&gt;) 15 to =&lt;20%, and &gt;20%.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Continuous American College of Rheumatology (ACRn) Score at Day 169</title>
          <description>ACR score - continuous (ACRn) was defined as the minimum of the percentage improvement in TJC, SJC and the median of the percentage improvements in the other five components of the ACR criteria (participant assessment of pain; participant global assessment of disease activity; physician global assessment of disease activity; disability index of the HAQ; and CRP). Total score range was -100 to 100, where negative numbers indicated worsening and positive numbers indicated improvement.</description>
          <population>The mITT population analysis set included all participants in the treatment group corresponding to their randomized treatment group. Here &quot;N&quot; (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <description>Number of swollen joints was determined by examination of 66 joints and identifying when swelling was present. The number of swollen joints was recorded on the joint assessment form, no swelling = 0, swelling =1. Number of tender joints was determined by examining 68 joints and identified the joints that were painful under pressure or to passive motion. The number of tender joints was recorded on the joint assessment form, no tenderness = 0, tenderness = 1.</description>

        <description>CRP is a substance produced by the liver that increases in the presence of inflammation in the body. The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement in underlying disease.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue (FACIT-fatigue) at Day 169</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire questionnaire to measure the degree of fatigue experiences by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Larger the participant’s response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant’s fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant’s response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score) where higher sore represent less fatigue.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue (FACIT-fatigue) at Day 169</title>
          <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire questionnaire to measure the degree of fatigue experiences by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Larger the participant’s response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), greater was the participant’s fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant’s response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score) where higher sore represent less fatigue.</description>
          <population>The mITT population analysis set included all participants in the treatment group corresponding to their randomized treatment group. Here &quot;n&quot; signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure for the specified time point for each arm, respectively.</population>
