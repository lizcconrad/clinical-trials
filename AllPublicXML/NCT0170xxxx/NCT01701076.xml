    <textblock>
      Almost all patients with multiple myeloma who survive initial treatment will eventually
      relapse and require further therapy.

      Background: Treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone has proven efficacy in two large
      randomized trials (MM-009 and MM-010) leading to a time to progression (TTP) of 17.1 months
      for patients with only one prior therapy and a TTP of 10.6 months for 2 and more prior
      therapies, respectively [1-3]. Continuous treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone until
      disease progression is therefore considered a standard therapy for second line treatment in
      multiple myeloma patients. However, only a relatively low rate of high quality response (CR,
      complete response and VGPR, very good partial response) is achieved. High quality responses
      are associated with with improved progression-free survival and overall survival [4].

      Trial: The aim of this trial is to improve high quality response rates for patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the 2nd line treatment. This aim shall be achieved
      by the addition a third anti-myeloma drug (bendamustine) to the established backbone of
      lenalidomide/ dexamethasone.

      Treatment regimen:

        -  Induction Treatment Phase: Cycles 1-6 Bendamustine 75mg/m2/d day 1 and 2, lenalidomide
           25mg/d 1-21, dexamethasone 40mg / 20mg (for patients &gt; 75years) d 1, 8, 15, 22.

        -  Maintenance Treatment Phase: Cycles 7-18 lenalidomide 25mg/d 1-21, dexamethasone 40mg /
           20mg (for patients &gt; 75 years) d 1, 8, 15, 22.

      Due to hematoxicity of bendamustine and lenalidomide, administration of pegfilgrastim is
      mandatory in the induction treatment phase (BRd-regimen)for all patients experiencing severe
      neutropenia.

      The aim of this study is to achieve high quality response rates (CR, VGPR) of ≥ 40%. If this
      aim is achieved, the treatment of bendamustine in combination with the established
      lenalidomide/ dexamethasone regimen will be considered promising.

      Besides efficacy, the safety of this three-drug regimen is evaluated in this trial.

      Assessments for efficacy / response evaluation:

        -  M-protein quantitation in serum and 24 h urine collection samples by serum- and urine
           protein electrophoresis

        -  Quantitation of immunoglobulin levels by nephelometry

        -  Serum and urine immunofixation

        -  Free light chain concentrations and ratio in the serum

        -  Plasma cell percentage in the bone marrow by conventional cytology and biopsy with
           immunohistochemistry

        -  Radiologic assessments of the skeleton

      Response criteria: Response will be assessed according to IMWG criteria
