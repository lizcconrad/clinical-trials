    <textblock>
      We have added objectives 4-6 to our updated study:

      Study Objective 1: To determine whether the distribution of MelaFind scores is different for
      different patients with multiple nevi, and whether such distributions can be utilized to
      identify &quot;signature&quot; lesions for a given patient.

      Study Objective 2: To investigate whether distributions of quantitative ABCD parameters
      differ among patients and whether these qABCD parameters identify &quot;signature&quot; lesions.

      Study Objective 3: To determine the feasibility of defining and using relative thresholds to
      improve the specificity of MelaFind without sacrificing its high sensitivity.

      Study Objective 4: To determine the repeatability of MelaFind scores for a given lesion for
      different patient and lesion characteristics.

      Study Objective 5: To identify patient and lesion characteristics that result in the highest
      variability of MelaFind scores for a given lesion.

      Study Objective 6: To use standard errors of MelaFind scores to propose a robust individual
      threshold for lesions to be considered for biopsy to rule out melanoma on patients with
      multiple nevi.

      <textblock>
        Patients who have at least one lesion that meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see
        eligibility criteria below) AND each lesion enrolled must be clinically atypical (i.e.,
        contain at least one of the following ABCDEPRU characteristics: Asymmetry, Border
        irregularity, Color variegation, Diameter &lt; 6 mm, Evolving, Patient's concern, Regression,
        Ugly duckling).

        Lesions should be selected to have characteristics that may affect the repeatability of
        lesion scores: anatomic site (often exposed to UV - sun or tanning beds - or not;
        sun-damage may affect the repeatability); lesion diameter (6 mm, e.g. ~5 mm or &gt; 6 mm,
        e.g., 10 mm); and melanin content relative to normal skin (dark pigmentation or light
        pigmentation).

        A maximum of 8 lesions may be enrolled per patient

      <textblock>
        Cutaneous lesions examined with MelaFind must satisfy all of the following inclusion
        criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The lesion is pigmented (i.e., melanin, keratin, blood)

          -  The diameter of the pigmented area is not &lt; 2 mm, and not &gt; 22 mm

          -  The lesion is accessible to the MelaFind

          -  The patient, or a legally authorized representative, has consented to participate in
             the study and has signed the Informed Consent Form;

        Cutaneous lesions that meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be accepted:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a known allergy to isopropyl alcohol

          -  The lesion has been previously biopsied, excised, or traumatized

          -  The skin is not intact (e.g., open sores, ulcers, bleeding)

          -  The lesion is within 1 cm of the eye

          -  The lesion is on mucosal surfaces (e.g., lips, genitals)

          -  The lesion is on palmar hands

          -  The lesion is on plantar feet

          -  The lesion is on or under nails

          -  The lesion is located on or in an area of visible scarring

          -  The lesion contains foreign matter (e.g., tattoo, splinter, marker)
