    <textblock>
      Corticosteroids are one of the mainstays of treatment for subjects with
      corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses such as psoriasis. This study has been designed to
      determine and compare the efficacy and safety of a formulation of 122-0551 versus the
      corresponding Vehicle in subjects with stable plaque psoriasis after twice daily dosing for
      14 consecutive days.

    <description>The proportion of subjects with ODS &quot;treatment success&quot; at EOS where EOS is the subject's last completed visit. &quot;Treatment success&quot; is defined as an ODS of 0 or 1. ODS is measured on a 5-point scale: 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe/very severe.</description>
