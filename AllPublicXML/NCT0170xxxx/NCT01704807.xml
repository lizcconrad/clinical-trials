      Purpose of study: To assess the effects of wearing custom orthotics as opposed to placebo
      foot inserts on the duration of chiropractic correction of spinal fixations and muscle
      imbalances using applied kinesiology techniques.

    <textblock>
      Participants with chronic lower back pain of greater than one month duration will be
      randomized to receive custom foot orthotics or placebo flat inserts. Both groups will receive
      chiropractic treatment 5 times over the course of 4 weeks following receipt of orthotics.
      Subjects and treating doctor will be blind to the insert type. Patients will report present,
      average, best and worst pain at each visit, and complete a Roland-Morris questionnaire.
      Secondary outcome measures will be number of fixated vertebral levels identified by motion
      palpation and challenge and number of muscles testing grade 4 and below from a list of 5
      muscles to be tested bilaterally before and after each treatment.
