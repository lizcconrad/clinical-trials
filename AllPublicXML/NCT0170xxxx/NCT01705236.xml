  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year, prospective, multi-center, open-label study to describe the long term
      changes of optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters in RRMS patients under treatment
      with Fingolimod. It is designed to longitudinally study the degeneration of retinal axons by
      measuring change in RNFL thickness by latest OCT-technology. Correlations of OCT findings
      with available MRI data and clinical findings may enhance our understanding of the
      relationship between CNS inflammation, tissue injury, regeneration and neurological deficit
      in the context of fingolimod therapy.
