  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is an acquired skin disease that significantly impacts the quality of life of
      patients. Medical treatment of vitiligo includes the use of melanocyte transplantation but
      the results are variable.

      This single center, single blind clinical trial comparing another treatment and also no
      treatment was designed to assess the efficacy of autologous monocyte transplantation in
      monolayers on a substrate of amniotic membrane for the treatment of stable vitiligo. Patients
      will receive the two interventions, melanocyte suspension and monolayer on amniotic membrane
      and will provide an untreated area as a control.

      Main Objective:

      The main objective is to assess the efficacy of autologous transplantation of monocytes in
      monolayers grown on a biological substrate of amniotic membrane in the treatment of stable
      vitiligo. Using a system of digital imaging analysis the percentage of re-pigmentation
      obtained will be studied after 3, 6 and 9 months of treatment.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To demonstrate differences in efficacy (as measured by the percentage of re-pigmentation) of
      each of the 2 techniques used: pure melanocytes in suspension and amniotic membrane with
      melanocytes in monolayers.

      To assess how rapidly epithelialization occurs and the cosmetic result in the short and long
      term of the areas treated with each of the techniques.

      To assess if de-epidermization with CO2 laser may be by itself a stimulus for the reservoir
      of melanocytes in the adjacent epidermis or hair follicles or if the re-pigmentation obtained
      with this procedure is merely postinflammatory as a result of trauma to the epidermis.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Patients must voluntarily provide informed consent before any of the tests included in
             the trial which do not form part of standard treatment can be performed.

          -  Mentally stable patients, suffering from piebaldism, vitiligo of metameric
             distribution, focal or generalized vitiligo which has remained stable for at least one
