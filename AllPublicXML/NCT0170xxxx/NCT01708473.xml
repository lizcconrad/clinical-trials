  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, single-site, double-blinded, randomized trial. All study
      subjects will receive a full face and neck Ultherapy treatment. Subjects will be randomized
      to receive one of two pain medications prior to treatment. Each subject will be asked to rate
      the level of discomfort during the Ultherapy treatment. All study subjects will be followed
      for 90 days following treatment.
