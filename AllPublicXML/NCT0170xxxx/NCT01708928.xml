  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled. All subjects will receive one Ultherapy treatment to the
      lower two thirds of the face and neck. Subjects will be equally grouped into those with a
      history of submentoplasty and or rhytidectomy and those naive to submentoplasty and or
      rhytidectomy. Follow-up visits will occur at 14, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days following treatment.
      Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, 30-60 minutes post-treatment, and at each
      follow-up visit.

      This is a prospective single center study. Subjects will be enrolled one per group as they
      present. Efficacy will be determined by the change in submental volume and cervicomental
      angle. GAIS and patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained.
