  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NSABP FB-9 is a Phase II, multi-center, randomized study of eribulin or weekly paclitaxel
      followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) as neoadjuvant therapy for women with
      HER2-negative, operable and locally advanced breast cancer (stage IIb and III). Patients in
      the control arm will receive neoadjuvant weekly paclitaxel (WP) followed by AC. The primary
      aim of the study is to determine the pathologic complete response (ypCR) in breast and
      axillary lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy. The secondary aims include
      determination of the ypCR in axillary nodes, clinical complete response (ycCR) rate after
      eribulin or paclitaxel and after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, two-year
      recurrence-free interval, two-year overall survival, and toxicity of the neoadjuvant
      regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to one of two neoadjuvant therapy regimens. Patients in Arm 1
      will receive WP 80 mg/m2 for 12 doses followed by standard AC every 21 days for 4 cycles.
      Patients in Arm 2 will receive 4 cycles of eribulin 1.4 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day
      cycle followed by standard AC every 21 days for 4 cycles. As soon as possible following
      recovery from chemotherapy, the patient will have either lumpectomy or mastectomy and
      axillary staging.

      In both arms, clinical response will be assessed by physical exam on day 1 of each study
      therapy cycle. MRI of the breast is required within 4 weeks prior to randomization and
      following completion of eribulin or WP (before starting AC). Following recovery from surgery,
      patients will receive radiation therapy and hormonal therapy as clinically indicated. Other
      postoperative therapies are prohibited.

      Patients will be randomized to the control arm (Arm 1) and to the investigational arm (Arm 2)
      in a 1:2 ratio. The sample size will be up to 50 patients with about 30 patients in Arm 2 and
      about half that number in Arm 1. Accrual is expected to occur over 15 months.

          -  Any psychiatric or addictive disorder or other condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude her from meeting the study requirements.
