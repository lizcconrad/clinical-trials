  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this 3-year randomized, single-blinded clinical trial are to compare the effect
      of high and low feedback about performance on the bedside exercise device in heart or liver
      transplantation recipients during the hospitalization immediately after transplantation. The
      hypotheses of the study are heart/liver transplantation recipients who have high feedback
      about performance on the bedside exercise device will progressively increase their level of
      exercise over the course of their hospitalization, more independent in ambulation level,
      better walking speed and 6-minute walk test at discharge, and better cardiorespiratory
      fitness at 4-8 weeks after transplantation than those who receive low feedback. The adult
      patients who newly receive heart or liver transplantation at National Taiwan University
      Hospital will be evaluated for eligibility of the study in the acute postoperative period.
      The study will be conducted in both the intensive care unit and ward environments. The study
      subjects will be randomized to either high or low feedback about performance on the bedside
      exercise device which uses hand/foot pedals that record exerted forces against adjustable
      resistances, measure repetitions of upper and lower extremity cycling movements, and give
      feedback about performance via a wireless internet connection. The study will also monitor
      the amount of daily movement activity of all subjects in this trial by using triaxial
      accelerometers, and the activity recognition algorithms developed by engineers and computer
      scientists at University of California Los Angeles. The outcome measures include level of
      independence for walking, walking speed, 6-minute walk test, and cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing by the blinded observers. The study expects to enroll at least 50 heart
      transplantation recipients and 60 liver transplantation recipients in 3 years. The results of
      this study will offer much insight into activity levels of heart or liver transplantation
      recipients during early postoperative period. Besides, heart transplantation recipients will
      receive routine phase I cardiac rehabilitation program by the physical therapists during the
      study but not liver transplantation recipients. We might be able to evaluate the interaction
      effects of routine physical therapy and UCFit exercise among our study subjects. Our data
      will also provide insight into just how active or inactive transplantation recipients may be
      and help generate ideas of organ transplantation rehabilitation program to increase their
      fitness-related activity prior to discharge.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects assigned to higher feedback will be encouraged to look at the summary of daily data about pedaling and will be encouraged to progress activity - more repetitions per minute (RPM range from 10-60), more frequent sessions (up to 3 times daily), longer sessions (from 5-20 minutes), and exertion against larger forces (no resistance, mild, moderate) for the legs. These subjects will also be encouraged to carry out pedaling with the upper extremities once a day, if the arms are free of lines that could be damaged. Progression of leg exercises would be within the capability and motivation of each subject, but would not exceed increments of 10% from one day to the next in any one of these parameters. Graphical displays that can be used for feedback will be available at the patient's bedside. The staff, patient and family will be able to view these bar graphs.</description>
