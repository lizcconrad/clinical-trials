    <textblock>
      Early detection of lung cancer and early removal of the cancer nodules facilitates the
      diagnosis and treatment. However, not all nodules are malignant. Currently the standard
      method to diagnose lung cancer is to remove any suspicious nodules from the lung in a
      surgical procedure.

      This study is being conducted to evaluate the performance of a laboratory test to detect
      changes in lung cells that might be an early indicator of lung cancer. The test uses mucus
      (sputum) which is collected in a non-invasive method. This study will compare the results of
      the lung biopsy with the laboratory test to determine if the test can detect cancer or the
      lack of cancer.

      The laboratory test will not be shared with the treating physician or the patient as the
      current standard for lung cancer diagnosis is a biopsy. Approximately 330 patients will be
      enrolled in the study. There is one visit involved and includes the collection of a sputum
      specimen by coughing into a cup. The medical records of patients who are negative for cancer
      by biopsy will be reviewed for 2 years to detect any changes in diagnosis.

    <description>Subjects suspected of having of having lung cancer and who are to undergo biopsy will undergo sputum sampling. The sputum will be assayed using the BioView test kit. Biopsy results will be compared with the assay results, each being a dichotomous response (positive or negative for cancer by biopsy, positive or negative assay result using client-supplied cut-off). Since the assay may detect cancer before a biopsy is positive or because the sputum sampling may be more representative of the condition of the lung than just the biopsied nodule, it will be necessary to follow thte negative biopsy subjects for up to two years to either rule in or rule out lung cancer.</description>
