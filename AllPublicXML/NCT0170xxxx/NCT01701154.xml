  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if respiratory muscle strength training will be
      beneficial for inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength in adults and children with Pompe
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory muscle weakness results in substantial morbidity and mortality in individuals
      with almost all forms of neuromuscular disease (NMD), including both the infantile and adult
      phenotypes of Pompe disease. Although individual patterns of involvement vary, respiratory
      weakness in Pompe disease typically affects both the inspiratory and expiratory muscle
      systems. Our pilot data in two individuals with late-onset Pompe disease suggest that RMST
      may be a treatment for the progressive respiratory weakness encountered in this condition.

      Purpose of the Study

        -  Determine the effect of respiratory muscle strength training on maximum inspiratory
           pressure, maximum expiratory pressure, upright % predicted forced vital capacity, and
           aspects of cough function.

        -  Determine the effect of RMST on functional outcome measures of gross motor function
           appropriate for individual participants in terms of age and motor skills.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  include skin fibroblast acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity ≤1% of the normal mean, a
             minimum age of 3 years, the ability to participate in an intensive RMST research
             program, and the ability to maintain a consistent amount of nonresearch related
             physical activity over the course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  include medical problems which preclude meaningful participation in the study, the
             inability to perform high effort respiratory tasks using maximum intensity,
             respiratory weakness so profound that RMST cannot be completed at the minimum pressure
             thresholds of available respiratory trainers, and the inability to safely perform the
             protocol. For example, high effort respiratory tasks are occasionally associated with
             mild, transient dizziness which quickly dissipates following a brief rest. If severe
             and/or prolonged dizziness were to occur in a particular case, then exclusion from the
             study would be necessary.
