      One of the main success factors in acne therapy is user compliance with treatment, product
      cost, availability and ease of use. Poor compliance may translate into decreased efficacy
      (either not improving symptoms well enough or not improving symptoms fast enough),
      tolerability issues or adverse effects (eg, erythema, dryness, or peeling of the skin), a
      lack of understanding of the instructions for use, or product cost/availability. Whatever the
      reason, poor compliance translates to decreased efficacy and increased frustration on the
      part of the user.

      The current study will evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of 2
      over-the-counter, topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) product lines in subjects with acne:
      MAXCLARITY II (2.5% BPO) Foam Cleanser and Foam Treatment and (0.5% Salicylic Acid) Toner
      Foam compared with PROACTIV (2.5% BPO) Renewing Cleanser and Repairing Lotion and
      Revitalizing Toner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is an extremely common dermatological disease that is found typically in
      adolescence and young adulthood. Acne vulgaris manifests with open and closed comedones
      (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts on the face, neck, and
      trunk. Scarring can occur, particularly if the lesions are inflamed and deep, even in the
      absence of external manipulation (eg, picking and squeezing) of the skin.

      Acne vulgaris can be treated with a variety of agents that are selected to address the
      pathogenic factors assumed to be responsible for the type and degree of manifested acne
      lesions. Monotherapy and combination therapy regimens are both useful. Topical agents are
      generally used as first-line therapy and include retinoids, antibiotic preparations (eg,
      erythromycin and clindamycin), benzoyl peroxide (BPO), alpha and beta hydroxy acids (eg,
      glycolic and salicylic acid preparations), and azelaic acid. Systemic therapies are initiated
      in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne that does not respond to topical
      therapy.

      Benzoyl peroxide has antimicrobial and anti inflammatory properties and is often considered
      an important component of acne treatment. Benzoyl peroxide is frequently the first product
      that adolescents will use for acne because it can be purchased without a prescription in
      several different concentrations and formulations.

      One of the main success factors in acne therapy is user compliance with treatment, product
      cost, availability and ease of use. Poor compliance may translate into decreased efficacy
      (either not improving symptoms well enough or not improving symptoms fast enough),
      tolerability issues or adverse effects (eg, erythema, dryness, or peeling of the skin), a
      lack of understanding of the instructions for use, or product cost/availability. Whatever the
      reason, poor compliance translates to decreased efficacy and increased frustration on the
      part of the user.

      The current study will evaluate and compare the efficacy and tolerability of 2 common,
      over-the-counter, topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) product lines in subjects with acne:
      MAXCLARITY II (2.5% BPO) Foam Cleanser and Foam Treatment and (0.5% Salicylic Acid) Toner
      Foam compared with PROACTIV(2.5% BPO) Renewing Cleanser and Repairing Lotion and Revitalizing
      Toner.

      This is a randomized, 2 center, evaluator-blinded, split-face efficacy and tolerability study
      of MAXCLARITYII and PROACTIV, 2 over-the-counter, topical benzoyl peroxide product lines, in
      subjects with acne. Approximately 40 subjects, aged from 16 to 29 years, inclusive, with mild
      facial acne vulgaris are expected to participate in the study. No more than 50% of the
      subjects at each site can be enrolled under the age of 20.

      An expert grader (blinded evaluator) will complete counts of inflamed lesions
      (papules/pustules) and noninflamed lesions (open/closed comedones), the Investigator's Static
      Global Assessment (ISGA), and an assessment of tolerability of each side of the face at each
      study visit. Subjects will assess tolerability on each side of the face at each study visit
      and will complete a product acceptability and preference questionnaire at the end of the
      study.

      The study duration will be 8 weeks (56 days) with visits at baseline (day 1), week 1m week 2,
      week 4 and week 8. Only the expert grader (evaluator) will be blinded to the study product
      assignments; subjects and study nurses/coordinator will not be blinded.

    <time_frame>BL (Day 1) and Wk 8</time_frame>
    <description>This was an efficacy variable. An expert grader evaluated each side of the face (included forehead, cheeks and chin), the left and the right side, for IL (presence of papules and pustules), NIL (presence of open and closed comedones) and the TLs. The mouth, nose, periocular area, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were excluded. The evaluator was also blinded. BL was defined as Day 1. The percent change was calculated as the value at Wk 8 minus the value at BL.</description>

    <time_frame>BL (Day1) to Wks 1, 2 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>This was an efficacy variable. An expert grader (blinded) evaluated the left and the right side of the face extending from the hairline to the mandible (included forehead, cheeks and chin). The evaluator assessed the IL by counting the number of papules and pustules. The mouth, nose, periocular area, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were excluded. BL was defined as Day 1. The percent change was calculated as the percent value (count of IL) at each individual visit (percent value at wk 1, 2 and 4) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>BL (Day 1) to Wks 1, 2 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>This was an efficacy variable. An expert grader (blinded) evaluated the left and the right side of the face extending from the hairline to the mandible (included forehead, cheeks and chin). The evaluator assessed the total lesions by the sum of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions on each side (left side and right side). The mouth, nose, periocular area, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were excluded. BL was defined as Day 1. The percent change was calculated as the percent value (count of total lesions) at each individual visit (percent value at Wks 1, 2 and 4) minus the value at baseline respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>BL (Day 1) to Wks 1, 2, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluator (blinded) evaluated the acne severity of the participants' face using the ISGA scale ranging from 0 to 5. The grading was 0= Clear, skin with no IL or NILs; 1= Almost clear, rare NILs with no more than one small IL ; 2= Mild, some NILs with no more than few ILs (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions); 3= Moderate Upto many NILs and may have some ILs but no more than one small nodular lesion ; 4= Severe, Upto many NILs and ILs but no more than a few nodular lesions; 5= Very severe, many NILS and ILs more than a few nodular lesions, may have cystic lesions. Thus higher score indicated severity of the disease. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each visit (Wks 1,2,4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Each of the Evaluator Tolerability Assessments-Erythema</measure>
    <time_frame>BL (Day 1) to Wks 1, 2, 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>This was a tolerability variable. The expert grader (blinded evaluator) assessed each left and right side of the face individually at each study visit. The areas on the face excluding nose, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were evaluated. The evaluator conducting the assessment for the participant remained blinded for the treatment assigned. Erythema is condition characterized by redness or rash on the skin. The assessment of the erythema was graded on 0 to 5 scale based on severity by the evaluator. 0=None, 1=Very minimal, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe, and 5= Very severe. Thus higher score indicated severity of the disease. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each individual visit (wk 1,2,4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively. The change from BL was '0' for Wk 4 and Wk 8, and hence statistical analysis was not done.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any
             protocol specific procedures are performed.

          2. Male or female aged from 16 to 29 years, inclusive, at time of consent. No more than
             50% of the subjects at each site can be enrolled under the age of 20.

          3. Mild facial acne vulgaris, characterized by at least 12 facial inflammatory lesions
             (papules and pustules) and/or noninflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) on
             the face.

          4. Able to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.

          5. Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception while receiving
             protocol-assigned product. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who is
             biologically capable of becoming pregnant; including perimenopausal women who are less
             than 2 years from their last menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the
             following:

               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal
                  contraception has been completed.

               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.
                  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a
                  reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has never given birth
                  naturally. The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of
                  acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly.
                  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods
                  of contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal
                  sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception. A barrier method or sterilization plus spermatocide is acceptable.

               -  Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically
                  accepted method of contraception should she become sexually active while
                  participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding.

          2. Has active or chronic skin allergies.

          3. Has a history of acute or chronic disease that might interfere with or increase the
             risk of study participation.

          5. Has damaged skin on facial areas (eg, sunburn, tattoo, or scar)

          6. Had any medical procedure (eg, laser resurfacing, chemical peel, or plastic surgery)
             on facial areas in preceding 12 months.

          7. Had any cosmetic procedure (eg, microdermabrasion) on facial areas within 8 weeks of
             the baseline visit.

          8. Has any dermatological disorder that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere
             with the accurate evaluation of the subject's facial appearance.

          9. Received any investigational drug or procedure within 28 days of the baseline visit or
             is scheduled to receive an investigational drug (other than the study products) or
             procedure during the study.

         10. Currently using any medication that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the
             evaluation of the study products or place the subject at undue risk (including but not
             limited to asthma medications, oral steroids, rifampin, anticonvulsants, and St John's

        <description>This was an efficacy variable. An expert grader evaluated each side of the face (included forehead, cheeks and chin), the left and the right side, for IL (presence of papules and pustules), NIL (presence of open and closed comedones) and the TLs. The mouth, nose, periocular area, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were excluded. The evaluator was also blinded. BL was defined as Day 1. The percent change was calculated as the value at Wk 8 minus the value at BL.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Change in IL Count From BL (Day 1) to Wks 1, 2 and 4</title>
        <description>This was an efficacy variable. An expert grader (blinded) evaluated the left and the right side of the face extending from the hairline to the mandible (included forehead, cheeks and chin). The evaluator assessed the IL by counting the number of papules and pustules. The mouth, nose, periocular area, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were excluded. BL was defined as Day 1. The percent change was calculated as the percent value (count of IL) at each individual visit (percent value at wk 1, 2 and 4) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>

        <description>This was an efficacy variable. An expert grader (blinded) evaluated the left and the right side of the face extending from the hairline to the mandible (included forehead, cheeks and chin). The evaluator assessed the total lesions by the sum of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions on each side (left side and right side). The mouth, nose, periocular area, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were excluded. BL was defined as Day 1. The percent change was calculated as the percent value (count of total lesions) at each individual visit (percent value at Wks 1, 2 and 4) minus the value at baseline respectively.</description>

        <description>The evaluator (blinded) evaluated the acne severity of the participants' face using the ISGA scale ranging from 0 to 5. The grading was 0= Clear, skin with no IL or NILs; 1= Almost clear, rare NILs with no more than one small IL ; 2= Mild, some NILs with no more than few ILs (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions); 3= Moderate Upto many NILs and may have some ILs but no more than one small nodular lesion ; 4= Severe, Upto many NILs and ILs but no more than a few nodular lesions; 5= Very severe, many NILS and ILs more than a few nodular lesions, may have cystic lesions. Thus higher score indicated severity of the disease. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each visit (Wks 1,2,4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Each of the Evaluator Tolerability Assessments-Erythema</title>
        <description>This was a tolerability variable. The expert grader (blinded evaluator) assessed each left and right side of the face individually at each study visit. The areas on the face excluding nose, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were evaluated. The evaluator conducting the assessment for the participant remained blinded for the treatment assigned. Erythema is condition characterized by redness or rash on the skin. The assessment of the erythema was graded on 0 to 5 scale based on severity by the evaluator. 0=None, 1=Very minimal, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe, and 5= Very severe. Thus higher score indicated severity of the disease. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each individual visit (wk 1,2,4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively. The change from BL was '0' for Wk 4 and Wk 8, and hence statistical analysis was not done.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Each of the Evaluator Tolerability Assessments-Peeling</title>
        <description>This was a tolerability variable. The expert grader (blinded evaluator) assessed each left and right side of the face individually at each study visit. The areas on the face excluding nose, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids were evaluated. The evaluator conducting the assessment for the participant remained blinded for the treatment assigned. The assessment of the peeling was graded on 0 to 5 scale based on severity by the evaluator. 0=None, 1=Very minimal, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe, and 5= Very severe. Thus higher score indicated more severity. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each individual visit (Wk 1,2,4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively. The change from BL was '0' for Wk (1, 4 and 8) and hence statistical analysis was not done.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Each of the Participant Assessments of Tolerability-Dryness</title>
        <description>This was a tolerability variable, where the participants were instructed to individually assess the right and the left side of the face to indicate the severity that they had experienced during the time period from their last visit for dryness. The area on the face was assessed excluding the excluding nose, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids. The assessment of the dryness was graded on 0 to 5 scale based on severity by the participant. 0=None, 1=Very minimal, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe, and 5= Very severe. Thus higher score indicated severity of the disease. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each individual visit (Wks 1,2,4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>

        <description>This was a tolerability variable, where the participants were instructed to individually assess the right and the left side of the face to indicate the severity that they had experienced during the time period from their last visit for burning. The area on the face was assessed excluding nose, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids. The assessment of the burning was graded on 0 to 5 scale based on severity by the participant; 0=None, 1=Very minimal, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe, and 5= Very severe. Thus higher score indicated more severity. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each individual visit (Wks 1, 2, 4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>

          <description>This was a tolerability variable, where the participants were instructed to individually assess the right and the left side of the face to indicate the severity that they had experienced during the time period from their last visit for burning. The area on the face was assessed excluding nose, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids. The assessment of the burning was graded on 0 to 5 scale based on severity by the participant; 0=None, 1=Very minimal, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe, and 5= Very severe. Thus higher score indicated more severity. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each individual visit (Wks 1, 2, 4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>

        <description>This was a tolerability variable, where the participants were instructed to individually assess the right and the left side of the face to indicate the severity that they had experienced during the time period from their last visit for itching. The area on the face was assessed excluding nose, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids. The assessment of the itching was graded on 0 to 5 scale based on severity by the participant; 0=None, 1=Very minimal, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe, and 5= Very severe. Thus higher score indicated more severity. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each individual visit (Wks 1,2,4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>

The participants in the morning washed their face with MaxClarity II foam cleanser, on 1 side of the face (side of face, where no proactive cleanser and revitalizing toner were used) . The face was patted dry, post which MaxClarity II foam treatment was applied to the MaxClarity II side of the face. The same was repeated in the evening. This was a split face study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Each of the Participant Assessments of Tolerability-Scaling</title>
        <description>This was a tolerability variable, where the participants were instructed to individually assess the right and the left side of the face to indicate the severity that they had experienced during the time period from their last visit for scaling. The area on the face was assessed excluding nose, nasogenian, and superior and inferior eyelids. The assessment of the scaling was graded on 0 to 5 scale based on severity by the participant; 0=None, 1=Very minimal, 2=mild, 3= moderate, 4=severe, and 5= Very severe. Thus higher score indicated more severity. BL was defined as Day 1. The mean change was calculated as value at each individual visit (Wks 1,2,4 and 8) minus the value at BL respectively.</description>
