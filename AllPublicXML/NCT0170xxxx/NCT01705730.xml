             RoActemra/Actemra treatment in monotherapy in accordance with the local label and the
             reimbursement criteria indicating that RoActemra/Actemra can be given in monotherapy
             in case of methotrexate intolerance or where continued treatment with methotrexate is
             inappropriate; this can include patients who have received RoActemra/Actemra treatment
             within 8 weeks prior to the enrolment visit

             visit

          -  Patients who have previously received RoActemra/Actemra in a clinical trial or for
             compassionate use

          -  Patients receiving concomitant DMARD treatment for rheumatoid arthritis at baseline
             (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, gold compounds,
             cyclosporine) will be excluded from the study

          -  Patients who have received treatment with an investigational agent within 4 weeks (or
             5 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer) before starting
             treatment with RoActemra/Actemra

          -  Patients with a history of autoimmune disease or any joint inflammatory disease other
             than rheumatoid arthritis
