    <textblock>
      Patients with GBM, who were deemed ineligible for any active protocols at our centre,
      received accelerated hypofractionation EBRT if 60Gy/20Fx using an IMRT technique with
      conventional dose of concomitant and adjuvant TMX as per the STUPP's TMZ schedule. Thirty
      five patients, 15 females and 20 males with a median age of 63 (range 31-78) were treated
      with a median KPS of 90 (range 50-100). Four patients had multicentric disease at
      presentation. Eight patients had biopsy only while the rest had a near total resection (n=14)
      and partial resection (n=13) with a median follow-up of 12.1 months, the median survival was
      14.4 months.

      In this proposal, the total cumulative dose of TMZ is unchanged as compared to the doses used
      in the Stupp protocol. In this proposal, the dose of TMZ is the same, with the sole
      difference that TMZ will be given in a neo-adjuvant setting for two weeks and then continued
      at the same dose concurrently with the accelerated hypofractionated EBRT delivering 60Gy in 4
      weeks. The adjuvant component of TMZ remains unchanged from current standard practice.
