  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide early access to TMC114 administered with low-dose
      ritonavir (TMC114/r) and other antiretrovirals (ARVs) for HIV-1-infected patients who have
      not received previous HIV treatment or have received early treatment without TMC114 regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-treatment-group, open-label (patients and study personnel will know the
      identity of the treatments given), single-center study. The primary goal of this study is to
      provide early access to TMC114 administered with low-dose ritonavir (TMC114/r) and other
      antiretrovirals (ARVs, agents that are used to treat viral infections). This study is
      intended for HIV-1-infected patients who have not received previous HIV treatment
      (treatment-naive patients) or have received early treatment without TMC114 regimens and who
      are ineligible to participate in any other sponsored HIV-1 study. This study will monitor and
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of TMC114/r in combination with ARVs during the course of
      the study. Treatment with TMC114/r will be continued until virologic failure (the inability
      to achieve or maintain suppression of viral replication), treatment-limiting toxicity, loss
      to follow-up, study withdrawal, pregnancy, until discontinuation of TMC114 development or
      when TMC114 becomes reimbursable for treatment-naive patients or when TMC114 becomes
      commercially available for treatment-experienced patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with documented HIV-1 infection who are ineligible for participation in any
             other Sponsor's HIV-1 trial

          -  Patients have never been treated with antiretroviral (ARV) medications or have prior
             early treatment-experienced without TMC114 regimens, including they have limited or no
             treatment options due to virological failure or intolerance to regimens

          -  Patient's general medical condition, in the investigator's opinion evaluating the
             patient is eligible for TMC114 containing regimen, does not interfere with the
             assessments and the completion of the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any active clinically significant disease or findings during screening of medical
             history or physical examination that is not either resolved or stabilized for at least
             30 days before the screening phase of the trial

          -  Evidence of active liver disease, acute viral hepatitis, liver impairment/dysfunction
             or cirrhosis irrespective of liver enzyme levels; however, patients coinfected with
             hepatitis B or C will be included if their condition is judged to be clinically stable

          -  Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities as defined by Division of AIDS (DAIDS).

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 50 ml/min

          -  Female patients that are pregnant or breast-feeding, or of childbearing potential
             without using effective non-hormonal birth control methods or not willing to continue
             practicing these birth control methods from screening until the last 30 days after the
             end of the treatment period

          -  Any condition (including but not limited to alcohol and/or drug abuse), which in the
             opinion of the investigator, could compromise the patient's safety or compliance to
             the study protocol procedures
