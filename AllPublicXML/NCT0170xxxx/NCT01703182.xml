  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TCOM is a multicentre prospective cohort study in patients undergoing lower limb amputations.
      Patients will provide oxygen and carbon dioxide measurements in the lower limb for 20 to 30
      minutes before their surgery and will be followed up until 6 months after their surgery. The
      purpose of the TCOM study is to determine the ability of oxygen and carbon dioxide
      measurements in the legs of patients undergoing lower limb amputation to predict wound
      healing complications and to determine an optimum cutoff value for both oxygen and carbon
      dioxide levels beyond which healing complications are likely to occur and a closer amputation
      level is indicated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb amputation is a serious and unfortunate outcome for many patients with vascular
      disease, especially those with diabetes. It results in significant decreases in all aspects
      of quality of life. The need for further surgery to revise the amputation to a more proximal
      level leads to increased potential for serious and life-threatening complications, as well as
      a decrease in patient morale. From surveys and background literature, it can be estimated
      that there are approximately 8600 vascular disease-related lower limb amputations in Canada
      each year. As the epidemic of diabetes continues to unfold and the mean age of the population
      increases, this number is expected to increase. The results of this study may significantly
      assist in the surgical and clinical care of this patient population by providing clinicians
      with a means to assess appropriate lower limb amputation levels.

      Further, the modalities of transcutaneous measures may assist in guiding further intervention
      studies in higher risk patients to improve clinically important outcomes. This study will act
      in part as a feasibility trial for a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of
      supplemental oxygen therapy, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy, as a therapeutic tool to
      increase rates of healing after lower limb amputation.
