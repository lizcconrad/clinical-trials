      In this study, the investigators will monitor extracellular neurotransmitter levels using a
      probe that is able to perform real time electrochemical detection during deep brain
      stimulation surgery. The overall question this study is designed to answer is: Are there
      neurotransmitters released during deep brain stimulation?

      In this study, the investigators will monitor extracellular neurotransmitter levels using a
      probe that is able to perform realtime electrochemical detection during DBS neurosurgery. The
      overall question this study is designed to answer is: Are there neurotransmitters released
      during deep brain stimulation? We propose to enroll 45 patients (15 patients each at the
      three targets for DBS) with Essential Tremor, Parkinson's Disease, and Dystonia who are
      undergoing DBS neurosurgery. This will be an acute study. Patients with medically
      identifiable symptoms of the above diseases who have been approved by Mayo DBS committee for
      implantation of DBS will be selected for this study. These patients will then be consented
      preoperatively to undergo extracellular electrophysiology which is typical in these cases to
      determine the target site for implantation of the DBS electrodes. Following this
      electrophysiologic procedure, the patient will have electrochemical electrode implanted to
      (1) determine whether there is adenosine release at the site of stimulation during ventral
      intermediate nucleus (VIM) thalamic DBS, (2) determine whether there is dopamine and
      adenosine release within the caudate nucleus or putamen during subthalamic nucleus DBS, and
      (3) determine whether there is dopamine and adenosine release at the site of stimulation
      during Globus Pallidus DBS.
