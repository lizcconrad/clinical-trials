      This retrospective, observational study will assess the real world treatment out comes in the
      management of patients with chronic hepatitis C. No prospective ass essment or procedure with
      patients during this study will be conducted. Data wil l be collected from patient medical
      records of the year 2000-2011.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With HCV Relapse (Biochemical or Virological) After Treatment Completion</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Study, up to 36 months after diagnosis.</time_frame>
    <description>HCV relapse was determined by PCR RNA diagnostic testing. Virological relapse was defined as subsequent reappearance of serum HCV RNA after completion of therapy in participants who achieved end of treatment virological response (undetectable HCV RNA). Biochemical relapse was defined as subsequent rise in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level after end of treatment with normal ALT.</description>

        <description>HCV relapse was determined by PCR RNA diagnostic testing. Virological relapse was defined as subsequent reappearance of serum HCV RNA after completion of therapy in participants who achieved end of treatment virological response (undetectable HCV RNA). Biochemical relapse was defined as subsequent rise in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level after end of treatment with normal ALT.</description>
