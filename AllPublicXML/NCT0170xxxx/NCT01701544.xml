  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of human NBM DBS at improving
      cognitive deficits in PD patients referred and eligible for conventional DBS treatment for
      coexisting motor impairments. Six patients with PD with both motor fluctuations and cognitive
      impairments (including but not restricted to deficits in attention and working memory) will
      have bilateral electrodes implanted to ensure that superficial contacts lie in the
      conventional motor GPi target, while the deepest electrical contacts lie in the NBM- (see
      figure 1). We will place electrodes using our conventional image guided, stereotactic
      frame-based procedure currently used in patients at NHNN. Patients will be randomised into 2
      groups in a crossover trial design to have 3 month periods of NBM stimulation switched on or
      switched off separated by a 1 month washout period, following which the patient will cross
      over to have the opposite condition for a further 3 months- see timeline. At the end of the
      crossover period, all patients will be invited for continued follow up with stimulation
      switched on and will have neuropsychological evaluations at 6 monthly intervals. Patients
      will be given the option of receiving additional conventional stimulation to the motor GPi,
      through the higher contacts of each electrode, at the end of the crossover period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients will meet Queen Square brain bank criteria for the diagnosis of PD and
             will have motor fluctuations (off periods and/or L-dopa induced dyskinesias) in
             response to medications that are known to improve with GPi DBS, and will be
             appropriate candidates for GPi DBS aside from the coexistence of cognitive impairment.

        Patients will be aged between 35 and 80 years.

        Patients will be able to give informed consent.

        Patients will meet criteria for PD dementia. Patients will have a MMSE score between 26 and
        lower cutoff of 21 to restrict the sample to those with mild dementia and cognitive
        impairment. This will be equivalent to an age and education adjusted scaled score of
        greater than 5 and lower than 9 (mildly impaired range) on the Mattis Dementia Rating
        Scale-2.

        Patients will have only minimal atrophy on pre-operative brain MRI scans.

        Patients will be living at home and will have a carer living with them e.g. their spouse

        Able to comply with trial protocol and willing to attend clinic necessary visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis or suspicion of other cause for parkinsonism or dementia.

        Known abnormality on CT or MRI brain imaging considered likely to compromise compliance
        with trial protocol.

        Prior intra-cerebral surgical intervention for Parkinson's disease including Deep Brain
        stimulation, lesional surgery, growth factor administration, gene therapy or cell
        transplant.
