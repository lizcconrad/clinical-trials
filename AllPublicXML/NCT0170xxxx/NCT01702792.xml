  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label study in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma to
      determine the ability to generate human hybridomas from lymph nodes draining an autologous
      tumor vaccine injection and demonstrate that the hybridomas secrete glioblastoma-specific
      antibodies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intradermal vaccine will be injected 20cm in the anterior thigh. Vaccination will be done
      twice and separated by one week. The first vaccination will be performed approximately 2
      weeks after surgery.

      Approximately one week after the second vaccination one or two vaccine-draining lymph node(s)
      will be removed. The lymph node(s) will be identified using SN technology. One or two lymph
      node(s) will be removed.

      Lymph nodes will be processed for recovery of B cells and formation of hybridomas.

    <measure>number of hybridoma clones that produce anti-glioma antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary technical endpoint demonstrating the feasibility of the pilot study will be based upon the total count of the number of generated hybridoma clones sourced from the dermal vaccine draining lymph nodes that are determined to be producing anti-glioma antibodies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Production of Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcomes will include:
Determining how many hybridoma clones produce glioblastoma-specific antibodies. The initial secondary endpoint will include the counting of the number of hybridoma clones sourced from the dermal vaccine draining lymph nodes that generate specific glioma antibodies.</description>

    <description>Determining whether B cells sourced from the vaccine nodes produce more anti-tumor antibody hybridomas than the non-vaccine node. The rate of producing these clones will be compared according to the source of the B cells. Thus, B cells recovered from vaccine related nodes will be compared to B cells recovered from the non-vaccine node.</description>

    <description>1 x 107 TCE tumor lysate in 0.5 ml Lactated Ringers Solution (approximately 1 mg of tumor lysate protein) and equivalent volume of adjuvant will be injected 2 weeks and 3 weeks (2 vaccinations) after surgery in the intradermal skin of the upper thigh. There will be 2 vaccine administrations and patients will be followed for 2 months after inguinal node removal for any possible vaccine/study-related toxicity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with confirmed new diagnosis of glioblastoma and who have a yield of at least
             8x10(7) tumor cells obtained at the time of surgery

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  KPS Score of greater than or equal to 70

          -  Adequate bone marrow as evidenced by:

             contraception during the study and for 90 days following vaccination (an effective
             form of contraception is an oral contraceptive or a double barrier method)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient may not be enrolled in the trial if any of the following criteria are met:

          -  Patients receiving dexamethasone &gt; 8 mg/day during the week before vaccination.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Patients with active second malignancy.

          -  Any other medical conditions, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by
             the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed
             consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation
             of the results.
