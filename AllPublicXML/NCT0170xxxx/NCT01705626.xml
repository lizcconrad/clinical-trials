      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of patients with a polyneuropathy of
      undetermined etiology based on the normal results of laboratory data (CRP, glucose,
      electrolytes, urea,transaminases, TSH, immunoglobulins, vitamin B12, RF, ANA, antibodies
      against Lyme borrelia) no anamnesis for carcinoma, no continuous alcohol consumption; no
      light-chain-amyloidosis; no anamnesis for heavy metal exposure.

    <textblock>
      Neuropathies are generalised disorders of the peripheral nervous system, due to deranged
      function of the peripheral motor, sensory and autonomic neurons, their fibres or their myelin
      sheath. Dysfunction of unmyelinated C and myelinated Aδ fibres causes symptoms like
      insensitivity or hypersensitivity to heat and/or cold and neuropathic pain. These fibres have
      slow conduction velocities, carrying temperature feeling and pain sensations from nociceptors
      and thermoreceptors respectively. An isolated disturbance of these fibres leads usually to
      the diagnosis of small fibre neuropathy (SFN). The pathogenesis of SFN may be of
      inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, toxic or hereditary nature. Careful clinical and
      electrodiagnostic assessment, with attention to the pattern of involvement and the types of
      nerve fibers most affected, narrows the differential diagnosis and helps to focus the
      laboratory evaluation.

      Beside the frequent genetic etiologies in PNP (pmp22, MFN2) one cause of a genetic
      polyneuropathy may be a hereditary amyloidosis. These have been described as endemic in
      Sweden, Portugal or Japan. The most common form of the hereditary familial amyloidotic
      neuropathy (FAP) is the Transthyretin-related FAP, however two other amyloidogenic proteins
      have been described: Apolipoprotein A-I and Gelsolin (Ando et al., 2005; Adams et al., 2010).
      This study focuses on TTR-FAP (OMIM: #105210, OMIM: *176300), whose prevalence shall be
      determined in a cohort of 500 patients with polyneuropathy of unknown etiology. The TTR-FAP
      is an autosomal dominant disease, the exact prevalence of which is unknown but estimated to
      be around 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 in the normal population (Orphanet, ORPHA 85447). While
      the diagnosis of the amyloidotic neuropathy can be conducted histologically, a molecular
      genetic approach is necessary to diagnose TTR-FAP. Even though more than 100 point mutations
      are known to cause the disease, the most common amino acid change is V30M.

      The mutation in the TTR gene causes the destabilization of the physiologically tetrameric
      protein. Usually transthyretin consists of four identical monomeric subunits and binds the
      thyroxin circulating in the blood plasma. The monomeric subunits exhibit a pronounced β-sheet
      structure which leads to the accumulation of unsoluble β-fibrils when they are destabilised
      as in TTR-FAP.

      For the molecular genetic diagnosis of the disease TTR-FAP a sequencing of the entire TTR
      gene in all study patients will be performed. Dried blood spots will be used for this
