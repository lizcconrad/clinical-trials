  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD or emphysema, is like
      any other with a chronic illness not only affected by the physical discomfort the illness
      gives. For COPD patients that is: accelerated loss of lung function, conditioning and
      increased mortality: 25% of patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbation die 12 months later.

      Patients are also characterized by various psychological factors such as reduced quality of
      life, depression, etc.

      Therefore, everywhere in the country newly diagnosed COPD patients are offered rehabilitation
      in Region Zealand which consists of 10 weeks of classes 2 hours, 2 times a week with physical
      exercise, smoking cessation, medication, nutrition education and psychosocial support and
      patient education based on the National Health Service and international recommendations.

      In the literature, the effect of rehabilitation on quality of life was measured using a
      questionnaire (St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)), and the increase in function has
      been measured using a walk test, but there are no studies which look at the effect on
      inflammation lungs.

      It is important for COPD patients is to prevent exacerbations of the disease, which sometimes
      requires hospitalization and sometimes treated by their own doctor. It has been proven that
      inflammation in the lungs is associated with disease severity and exacerbation frequency, and
      therefore we would like to investigate whether both rehabilitation, close monitoring of
      patients with time in the pulmonary clinic every 3 months, and instruction in
      self-administration of medication (antibiotics and corticosteroids) have an effect on
      especially inflammation in the lungs, number of exacerbations, mortality, lung function and
      walking capacity.

    <description>&quot;Standard Care&quot;: finishing treatment for AECOPD in hospital and after hospital discharge to further control by the GP. In case of severe symptoms and / or airway obstruction (measured by FEV1) refer patients for follow-up in lung clinic. The subjects are recorded with the same subjective, clinical, paraclinical and invasive parameters as the &quot;Best care&quot; group</description>

    <description>&quot;Best Care&quot;: subjects are randomly assigned to the &quot;Best care&quot; regardless MRC class and severity of symptoms through:
10 weeks of rehabilitation (2 hours, 2 times a week) by Region Zealand's instructions on sundhed.dk. COPD rehabilitation includes physical exercise, smoking cessation, medication, nutrition education and psychosocial support and patient education. Rehabilitation provided by a multidisciplinary effort with lung nurse, dietician and physiotherapist according to national and international guidelines (1.5) (6) (24) (25)
Outpatient follow-up every 3 months, a total of 5 visits, and during these visits various subjective, clinical, paraclinical and invasive parameters.</description>
