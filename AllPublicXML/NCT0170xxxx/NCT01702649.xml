  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RPX2003 (biapenem) is being studied in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor to treat
      bacterial infections, including those due to multi-drug resistant bacteria.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide spread of resistance to antibiotics among Gram-negative bacteria, particularly
      members of the ESKAPE group of pathogens, has resulted in a crisis in the treatment of
      hospital acquired infections. In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine
      carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable
      threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial agents.

      Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem (RPX2003 or biapenem)
      plus a new beta-lactamase inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine
      beta-lactamases, including KPC. This Phase 1 study will assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of biapenem, administered alone, in healthy adult subjects.
