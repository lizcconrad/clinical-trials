      The purpose of this study is to determine if ultrasound guided femoral nerve blocks
      (localized anesthesia in the upper thigh) provide effective pain relief in adult patients
      with hip fractures in the emergency department and to determine if femoral nerve blocks can
      then be used to reduce the use of injected analgesia (anesthesia), therefore also causing
      fewer adverse effects associated with injected analgesia (such as bruising at the site of
      injection).

      100 patients with hip fractures will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive a femoral nerve block (FNB) plus injected analgesia or standard care
      (SC), which is injected analgesia alone.

      Using guidance from an ultrasound machine, the FNB group will have 20ml of 0.5% bupivacaine
      (a local anesthetic of long duration) injected into the front of the thigh, at the site of
      pain. Patients randomized to the SC group will receive an injection of saline (saltwater) so
      that no neither the patient or the treating physician knows to which group the patient was
      randomized. All blocks will be performed in the emergency department by an emergency
      physician trained in the use of ultrasound and ultrasound guided nerve blocks.

      Subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a numeric pain scale both before and after
      intervention (30 min, 60 min, 12 hrs and 24 hrs after injection, as long as the patient is in
      the ER still). Additional data to be collected includes demographics, vital signs, and course
      of treatment resulting from the ED visit.

      Hypothesis: US-guided femoral nerve blocks can provide effective pain control and possibly
      decrease or eliminate the need for narcotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. In the acute
      setting, safe and effective pain control is of the utmost importance. At present, this is
      typically achieved with the use of parenteral opioids. However in older individuals, who
      often have other medical comorbidities, the use of narcotics for pain control must be
      balanced with their potentially deleterious consequences: namely respiratory depression,
      hypotension, and mental confusion. Both poor pain control and the use of opioid medications
      have been associated with acute confusional states in the elderly. 1,2 Regional anesthesia
      can possibly provide adjunctive or even alternative pain control that is both safe and
      effective.Femoral nerve blocks, using local anesthetics, have been described as a method to
      reduce pain and the requirement for systemic analgesia, specifically opioids. Prior research
      has demonstrated feasibility and effective pain control of the femoral nerve block in the ED
      setting. Bedside ultrasound (US) can be used to precisely visualize the femoral neurovascular
      anatomy when performing a femoral nerve block and has distinct advantages when performing
      this procedure in the ED setting.

      Study Objectives The primary aim of this study is to determine the relative effectiveness of
      ultrasound guided femoral nerve blocks in older adult patients with hip fractures in the
      emergency department as compared with parenteral narcotics alone. A secondary aim of this
      study is to determine if femoral nerve blocks reduce both the use of parenteral narcotics and
      the incidence adverse effects associated with parenteral analgesia (delirium, hypotension,
      respiratory depression) in hip fracture patients both in the emergency department and during
      their hospital stay.

        <description>Participants report their discomfort using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Pain level is reported as 0 (lowest-no pain) to 10 (highest level of pain). Each patient enrolled in the study reported their level of pain at least once during their participation in the study.</description>

            <title>Femoral Nerve Block (FNB)</title>
            <description>Participants randomized to the second group, FNB group, will receive an Ultrasound (US) guided femoral nerve block using a Sonosite TitanTM (Sonosite, Inc., Bothell, WA) with a 7.5-MHz linear array transducer. Using this technique, 25ml of 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected along the nerve sheath. The femoral, obturator, and lateral cutaneous nerve are anesthetized with this technique (thus the name &quot;3-in-1 femoral block&quot; is often used), providing maximum analgesia to the hip.
Femoral nerve block: 25 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine : 25ml of 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected along the nerve sheath. The nerve block will be administered by one of the physician co- investigators all of whom are emergency physicians and all of whom have been trained in the use of ultrasound and ultrasound guided nerve blocks.</description>

A 7.5-MHz linear transducer will be placed on the side of the affected hip 1cm below the inguinal ligament. 1cm lateral to the ultrasound probe, a 27 gauge needle and syringe will be used to inject 3cc of 0.9% subcutaneously. The SC group will then be cared for by the Emergency Department physicians according to their regular clinical practice.
