    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether additional doses of ipilimumab have a
      positive effect on survival in the treatment of advanced melanoma that has progressed after
      successful initial treatment with ipilimumab.

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to death or last known alive date, assessed up to 15.6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined for each patient as the time between randomization and death. If a patient has not died, he or she will be censored at the time of last contact (last known alive date)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months for approximately 3.5 years after start of randomization and then every 6 months until confirmed and documented progressive disease</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined per arm as the total number of randomized participants with best overall response as complete response, partial response, or stable disease, divided by the total number of randomized participants in the arm. Bristol-Myers Squibb terminated this study early because the study would not meet its scientific objective in the predefined time frame. Thus, no participants were analyzed. Because the study ended before best overall response could be determined, no participants were analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months for approximately 3.5 years after start of randomization and then every 6 months until confirmed and documented progressive disease</time_frame>
    <description>BORR is defined per arm as the total number of randomized patients with a best overall response of complete response or partial response, divided by the total number of randomized patients in the arm. Bristol-Myers Squibb terminated this study early because the study would not meet its scientific objective in the predefined timeframe. Because the study ended before best overall response for all patients was defined, no participant data was analyzed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Death as Outcome, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Discontinuation, and Immune-related AEs (irAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 of treatment to 90 days after last dose (or to death date for death information)</time_frame>
    <description>AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of unresectable stage III or IV metastatic melanoma

          -  Prior ipilimumab induction treatment (3 mg/kg)

          -  Documented disease control [Stable Disease ≥3 months or Partial Response/Complete
             Response] after ipilimumab induction

          -  Documented progressive disease following disease control

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with brain metastasis are excluded, unless they are free of neurologic
             symptoms related to metastatic brain lesions and do not receive systemic
             corticosteroid therapy for the purpose of reducing intracranial inflammation in the 10
             days prior to beginning retreatment with ipilimumab

          -  Any intervening anticancer therapy between last dose of ipilimumab induction and
             ipilimumab retreatment on study

          -  Patients who experienced any grade 3 immune-related adverse event (irAE) (except for
             endocrinopathies where clinical symptoms were controlled with appropriate hormone
             replacement therapy) or any grade 4 toxicity during prior treatment with ipilimumab

          -  Patients with a prior irAE that has not improved to grade 1 or better at randomization

Partial response (PR)=30% or greater decrease in sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. Progressive disease (PD)=a 20% or greater increase in sum of the LD of all target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded at or following baseline. Stable disease=neither sufficient increase to qualify for PD nor sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR. Objective response=number of patients with best response of CR or PR.</description>
