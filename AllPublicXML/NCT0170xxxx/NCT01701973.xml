  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the following hypotheses:

      Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that acute dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibition with the
      currently available anti-diabetic drug, sitagliptin, will increase stimulated growth hormone
      (GH) secretion in healthy lean adults by decreasing the degradation of growth hormone
      releasing hormone (GHRH).

      Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that decreased degradation of GHRH during acute DPP4 inhibition
      will result in an increase in endothelium-dependent vasodilation mediated by GH and
      independent from GLP1 (glucagon like peptide-1) in healthy lean adults.

      This study promises to provide novel data regarding how this increasingly used class of
      anti-diabetic drugs affects the pituitary GH axis and could affect blood vessel relaxation.
      Growth hormone levels are low in the setting of obesity and pre-diabetes. A further study may
      evaluate the effect of chronic DPP4 inhibitor therapy in a population of patients with
      obesity and pre-diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growth hormone secretion is low in patients with obesity, insulin resistance, and
      hyperlipidemia. GH therapy in these populations and others has been limited by side effects
      which include hyperglycemia. Another strategy to increase GH secretion is to enhance
      pulsatile GH secretion by growth hormone releasing hormone. Growth hormone releasing hormone
      (GHRH) has a half life of 5 minutes due to its rapid inactivation by DPP4. An alternative
      strategy to increase endogenous GH secretion is by inhibiting degradation of GHRH by DPP4.
      DPP4 inhibitors are currently approved therapies for the treatment of hyperglycemia in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. They additionally cause blood vessel relaxation. We
      therefore propose to test the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition simultaneously enhances GH
      secretion while improving blood glucoses and vascular function in patient populations with
      low GH and increased cardiovascular risk. These preliminary aims serve primarily as a novel
      &quot;proof of concept&quot; study to define the effect of acute pharmacologic DPPIV inhibition on
      stimulated GH secretion.

        <title>Aim 1: Stimulated Peak Growth Hormone Level</title>
        <description>Subjects underwent two study days separated by a washout period. On one study day they will receive sitagliptin and on another placebo, in a randomized double-blind fashion. Growth hormone secretion was stimulated using arginine (30 grams i.v. over 30 minutes) on each study day. Growth hormone levels were assessed during a 3 hour period following arginine stimulation.</description>

        <population>Data from all subjects who completed both study days in Aim 1 were analyzed. Subjects represented young, healthy adults without any chronic medical conditions and who did not take any medications. Oral birth control use was not permitted.</population>

        <title>Aim 2: Percent Change From Baseline in Forearm Vascular Resistance</title>
        <description>Subjects undergo two study days separated by a washout period. On one study day they will receive sitagliptin plus another study drug and on another sitagliptin plus placebo, in a randomized double-blind fashion. Forearm blood flow was assessed at each visit every 30 minutes for 3 hours. This was divided into mean arterial pressure to determine forearm vascular resistance.</description>

      <time_frame>The first subject started drug 2/11/13 and the last completed 2/10/2017. In Aim 1, each subject took oral study drug (placebo vs. sitagliptin). Adverse event data was collected over a one month period for each subject. In Aim 2, each subject took oral sitagliptin and also received a single dose of LNMMA, Exendin 9-39 or Pegvisomant based upon their subgroup assigment. Adverse event data was collected over a 6 week period for each subject.</time_frame>
