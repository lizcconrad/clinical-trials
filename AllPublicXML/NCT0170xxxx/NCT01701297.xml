      Research question: Do oral probiotics in patients with cirrhosis and ascites reduce
      intestinal bacterial concentrations, ascitic bacterial DNA, SBP and bacteraemia compared to
      antibiotics or placebo?

      This study is designed to investigate the effects of an oral probiotic (VSL#3; a mixture of
      &quot;healthy&quot; bacteria for the intestines) compared to an antibiotic or placebo in preventing
      infection developing in the abdominal fluid (&quot;ascites&quot;) that collects in patients with
      advanced liver disease (&quot;cirrhosis&quot;). Patients already having had infection will be excluded
      from the study. Clear inclusion and exclusion criteria will be met and patients will be
      monitored throughout the study to examine whether they have required more hospitalisations,
      their rate infection in abdominal fluid or elsewhere and the level of liver function.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of cirrhosis is increasing in the UK. Decompensation heralds a poor outcome,
      with mortality in those developing ascites approximately 50% over the following 1-2 years.
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in ascitic fluid further reduces survival and occurs
      due to a combination of increased intestinal epithelial dysfunction, bacterial translocation
      to mesenteric lymph nodes and ascitic fluid, and reduced opsonisation and neutrophil
      function. Even with antibiotic treatment, 3-month mortality from SBP is approximately 40% and
      results in expensive in-patient care. Several studies have confirmed the benefit of secondary
      prophylaxis with long-term oral antibiotics in patients with advanced liver disease (e.g.
      norfloxacin, co-trimoxazole) and others suggest that in patients at high risk of developing
      SBP, primary antibiotic prophylaxis improves rates of sepsis and survival. Problems with
      these strategies include emergence of bacterial resistance, and development of
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (including C. difficile infection, which has a high
      case-fatality rate in those with cirrhosis). Local bacterial resistance profiles and
      association with C. difficile infection favour the choice of co-trimoxazole in our study
      population. Patients with advanced cirrhosis taking co-trimoxazole have previously
      demonstrated reduced liver-related outcomes such as infection and death3. Probiotic
      preparations alter intestinal bacterial flora and improve intestinal barrier and neutrophil
      function. Faecal bacterial counts of E. coli and Streptococcus (organisms commonly
      responsible for SBP) showed a 2-log fall with probiotics, although whether they could reduce
      the incidence of SBP remains unexamined.
