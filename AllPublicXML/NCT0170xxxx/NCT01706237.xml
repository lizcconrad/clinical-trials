    <textblock>
      Evaluate visual outcomes and contrast sensitivity for subjects undergoing bilateral myopic
      LASIK with a Nexisvision Shield or bandage contact lens placed postoperatively. Early speed
      of visual recovery results indicate that the visual recovery in the first 4 hours after the
      LASIK procedure show the most variability. A patient's ability to drive after their LASIK
      procedure would potentially alleviate a challenge that patients often face in taking
      additional time off work or simply finding a ride to there LASIK procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery has been performed worldwide since 1990.
      Historically, LASIK has been reported to decrease contrast sensitivity post operatively and
      patients have been advised to take the day off of work and potentially the day after LASIK.
      More recently, utilizing advanced laser technology for optimized corneal ablation and
      creation of the flap has the potential for improved LASIK surgery results and improved
      recovery time. Visual recovery and management of immediate post operative visual acuity is
      important for patient satisfaction.

             consent

          -  Patient is planning to undergo a bilateral LASIK procedure

          -  Both eyes must have a manifest refractive error from -1.00 D to -7.00 spherical

          -  Both eyes must have a BSCVA of 20/20 or better

          -  Both eyes must demonstrate refractive stability confirmed by clinical records,
             previous glasses, or investigator's discretion.

          -  Patient must be willing to comply with study dosing and complete the entire course of
             the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  A patient with evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal
             videokeratography in either eye

          -  A patient seeking monovision

          -  A patient with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the procedural or
             post-LASIK medications

          -  A patient requiring the use of any ocular drop(s) and/or medication(s) in either eye
             during the study period with the exception of ocular drops and/or medications provided
             by the investigator

          -  A patient having any surgical procedure within a week preceding the scheduled LASIK
             surgery

          -  A patient with any UNCONTROLLED systemic disease (i.e., a potential patient in whom
             therapy for a systemic disease is not yet stabilized )
