    <measure>Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib with nilotinib. Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 study design. If 2 or more participants within a cohort experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then the MTD will have been exceeded and the preceding dose level will be evaluated as the MTD. A minimum of 6 participants must be evaluated at the dose level in order for it to be declared as the MTD.
Dose limiting toxicity is defined as:
Any non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade three, excluding any untreated nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or fatigue that occurs during the first 56 days of therapy.
Grade three thrombocytopenia with active bleeding or grade four thrombocytopenia or febrile neutropenia (ANC &lt;500 cells/µL and fever &gt; 101.0 F (38.5C)).
Any treatment related grade five toxicity (i.e., death).</description>

    <description>The starting dose of ruxolitinib will be 5mg by mouth (PO) twice a day (BID) and will increase by 5 mg increments in each cohort, to a maximum dose of 15 mg PO BID. Nilotinib will be given at a dose ranging from 300 mg PO BID to 400 mg PO BID, depending on the participant's dose prior to enrollment on the trial.
Dose Level 1: Ruxolitinib 5 mg twice a day (BID); Nilotinib 300 mg or 400 mg BID.
Dose Level 2: Ruxolitinib 10 mg BID; Nilotinib 300 mg or 400 mg BID.
Dose Level 3: Ruxolitinib 15 mg BID; Nilotinib 300 mg or 400 mg BID.</description>

    <description>Participants will remain on the same dose of nilotinib they have been receiving prior to enrollment on the trial. This will range from 300 mg PO BID to 400 mg PO BID.
Dose modifications will not occur, as the purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ruxolitinib, based on the number of dose.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). They must also be under
             treatment with nilotinib as either first, second, or third-line therapy.

          -  Must have a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) OR must have been on nilotinib for a
             minimum of 6 months.

          -  Must not have undergone treatment for any other form of cancer (aside from
             non-melanoma skin cancer) in the past 5 years.

          -  18 years of age or older and must be able to speak and read English or Spanish.

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

          -  Prior therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) other than nilotinib is
             allowable, however, nilotinib must be the current therapy. All participants must be
             under the care of a Moffitt Cancer Center physician, and enrollment is expected to be
             complete within 6 months.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%.

          -  Must have normal organ and marrow function as defined in study protocol.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of Ruxolitinib and nilotinib
             administration. Women of child-bearing age will be required to have a negative
             pregnancy test within 14 days of enrolling in this study.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  B-HCG will be performed on all women of child-bearing potential as screening prior to
             enrollment on this trial. STAT3 levels in the bone marrow will also be measured prior
             to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are in accelerated phase or blast phase CML.

          -  May not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ruxolitinib or other agents used in the study.

          -  Known history of a prolonged QT interval (QTc &gt;480).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Women who are breast feeding their
             infants should discontinue this practice if the mother is treated with ruxolitinib.

          -  Currently receiving any drugs considered to be strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors
             which cannot be discontinued or changed to an alternative drug prior to enrolling on
             the trial.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
