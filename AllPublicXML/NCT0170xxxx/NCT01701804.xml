      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a non-surgical integrative package
      on failed back surgery syndrome through means of a prospective case series.

      After initial screening, treatment will be administered one session a week for 16 weeks.
      Patients will be followed up at 4 and 8 weeks after conclusion of treatment.

      The integrative package used in this study consists of 120ml of Chuna herbal
      medicine(Ostericum koreanum, Eucommia ulmoides, Acanthopanax Sessiliflorus, Achyranthes
      bidentata, Psoralea corylifolia, Peucedanum japonicum, Cibotium barometz, Lycium chinense,
      Boschniakia rossica, and Cuscuta chinensis) and dried extracts in pill form(Cibotium
      barometz, Atractylodes japonica) taken twice a day 30 minutes after meals, Chuna manual
      therapy, intermuscular injections of bee-venom pharmacoacupuncture(Select 6 acupoints,
      concentration 10,000:1, 0.1 cc per acupoint, total amount injected 1.0 cc/session),
      acupuncture and allow for NSAID intake during the investigational period. The subject is
      allowed a maximum of 3 pills/day, taken at a minimum of 8 hrs apart. The number of pills
      taken will be measured at 4 wks after conclusion of treatment.
