  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of FP-01.1 and FP-01.1 reformulated
      with an adjuvant (FP-01.1-Adjuvant) in relatively healthy subjects 65 to 74 years of age,
      subjects that are more representative of the target population. Both formulations will be
      administered alone or concomitantly with the Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Virus (TIV)
      vaccine.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 65 to 74 years inclusive at the time of consent

          -  Female subjects will be post-menopausal (no menses for at least 2 years) and therefore
             of non-child bearing potential

          -  Male subjects willing to comply with the applicable contraceptive requirements of the
             protocol, e.g. must agree to refrain from fathering a child until after the safety
             follow up visit. Male subjects do not need to use contraception if their partner has
             been through the menopause, or has had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. If a
             male subject's partner is of child bearing potential, male subjects must agree to use
             a barrier method (condom) as a method of birth control in addition to any
             contraceptive measures normally taken by his partner, until after the safety follow up
             visit.

          -  Satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically significant or relevant
             abnormalities in medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG and
             laboratory evaluation (haematology &amp; biochemistry) as assessed by the Investigator in
             relation to the age of the patient.

          -  An understanding, ability and willingness to fully comply with study procedures and
             restrictions

          -  Ability to provide written, personally signed and dated informed consent to
             participate in the study.

          -  The subject has a BMI &lt; 35.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of the medical screening process, the Principal Investigator or Co-
             Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential

          -  Clinically significant , uncontrolled, current, chronic or recurrent disease, as
             deemed by the Investigator, (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal,
             liver, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, immune suppression, malignancy or other
             conditions) that could affect the action, absorption or disposition of the IMP or
             could affect clinical or laboratory assessments.

          -  Significant illness as judged by the Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator within
             2 weeks of the first dose of IMP.

          -  Subjects with a history of allergies or allergic conditions including anaphylactic
             reactions, asthmatics, hay fever, allergy to egg products and eczema sufferers
             requiring medication which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or Co-
             Investigator will affect their participation in the study.

          -  Subjects receiving medications that affect the immune system including systemic
             steroids at a dose greater than 5mg and patients on chronic medications where the dose
             has not been stable for at least 3 months. Inhaled or topical steroids will be
             allowed.

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the IMP, or closely related
             compounds or any of the stated ingredients.

          -  Male subjects who consume more than 21 units of alcohol per week and female subjects
             who consume more than 14 units of alcohol per week.

          -  A positive HIV antibody screen, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B core
             antibody, or Hepatitis C antibody screen

          -  Subjects who have significant scarring, tattoos, abrasions, cuts or infections, that
             in the opinion of the Investigator could interfere with evaluation of injection site
             local reactions, over the deltoid region of both arms as these will be the dose site.

          -  Donation of blood or blood products (e.g. plasma, platelets) within 90 days prior to
             or intention to donate blood during the entire study.

          -  Use of another investigational medicinal product within 90 days prior to receiving the
             first dose of IMP or intention to enrol in another clinical study throughout the
             entire study including the follow up period.

          -  Subject with suspected recent (≤6 months) experience of influenza-like illness (fever
             [&gt;37.8ºC] and cough and/or sore throat &gt; 2 days- in the absence of a known cause other
             than influenza)

          -  Subjects who have received a flu vaccine in the last 6 months

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator
             or Co-Investigator, on electrocardiograms (ECGs)

          -  In addition, for each subject, a completed medical history questionnaire will be taken
             as part of the consented study procedure.
