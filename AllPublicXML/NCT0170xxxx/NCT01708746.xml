    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-institution observational study to be conducted at 4 clinics
      within the Southern California Permanente Medical Group. Pregnant women who present for
      prenatal genetic counseling at the designated clinics and who meet study eligibility criteria
      will be offered the option of the verifi® prenatal test by a trained, licensed and certified
      genetic counselor (GC) . Women who elect the verifi® prenatal test will have a blood sample
      drawn by peripheral venipuncture that will be sent to the Verinata Health CAP-accredited
      clinical laboratory (Redwood City, CA). Results will be reported to the ordering health care
      provider by the laboratory within 8-10 business days and will be shared with the subject by
      their provider. Subject care and decision-making following NIPT result will be clinically
      managed by the provider with his/her subject and is not dictated by the study protocol. All
      eligible women who provide informed consent, whether they elect or decline NIPT will be asked
      to complete a short questionnaire on their views of prenatal testing. The uptake of invasive
      prenatal procedures (CVS and/or amniocentesis) by the total prospective cohort will be
      collected through review of electronic medical records (EMR). A historical cohort with
      matched demographic and pre-test indications to the prospective cohort will be identified
      from the EMR for comparison in the primary analysis.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the rate of uptake of invasive prenatal procedures (chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis) between a prospectively enrolled cohort of pregnant women at high-risk for fetal aneuploidy who are offered noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT; verifi® prenatal test) and a historical cohort matched for demographics and pre-test risk indications. The prospective group will include both those who accept NIPT and those who decline NIPT, but are willing to consent and complete a brief questionnaire.</description>
