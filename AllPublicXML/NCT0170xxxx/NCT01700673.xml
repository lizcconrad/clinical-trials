      To determine the impact of maintenance therapy in patients with MDS/AML in remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a phase II study to determine the impact of maintenance therapy with 5-azacytidine
      and GM-CSF in patients with poor-risk AML or MDS, who are in remission after definitive
      treatment with either stem cell transplant or cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy.

      In order to precede relapse and to avoid lead time bias, treatment would need to commence
      within 185 days of definitive therapy. Furthermore, approximately 50% of relapses occur
      within the first year and up to 80% within two years after SCT, therefore we would limit the
      duration of maintenance therapy to one year, followed by two years of follow-up.
