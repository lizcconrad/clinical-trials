  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to look for genetic alterations in tissue and blood samples that
      may be useful in determining what treatments may be useful in the patient's cancer care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the study, patients will have archival tumor tissue collected, and have tumor
      biopsies and blood samples taken. The samples will be tested for genetic alterations, and the
      results will be discussed with the patient including potential treatments. If patients agree,
      after they have received treatment for their cancer and their disease progresses, a second
      biopsy procedure will be done.
