    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center trial wherein each included subject will receive
      the experimental externally focused ultrasound renal denervation therapy. It will be
      conducted on a maximum of fifty patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and
      have signed the informed consent form. Safety is the primary endpoint of this study and will
      be assessed by incidence and evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the
      investigational procedure through the 52-week evaluation. Clinical utility is the secondary
      endpoint of this study and will be evaluated by assessing pre and post therapy systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure.

    <description>Safety will be assessed by incidence and evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure through the 52-week evaluation of bilateral treatment. Included in this assessment will be the proportion of subjects with any of the following outcomes: (1) death, or (2) medical morbidity, including but not limited to renal artery aneurysm, stenosis, significant deterioration of renal function, fistulae or ureteral stenosis.</description>
