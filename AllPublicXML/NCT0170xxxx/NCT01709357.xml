    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the short and medium-term effects of three
      manual techniques on cervical range of motion and pressure pain sensitivity in subjects with
      mechanical stress, presenting latent trigger point of upper trapezius muscle.

    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain syndrome is a common non-articular musculoskeletal chronic pain which has not
      been yet fully understood. It is characterized by myofascial trigger point. This trigger
      point is clinically classified as active or latent. Some studies have demonstrated the
      potential relevance of latent trigger point. In fact, its presence may cause muscle
      activation pattern alterations, increase nociceptive sensitivity and cause sympathetic
      activity alterations. Nevertheless, the vast majority of individuals, even asymptomatic, have
      latent trigger point. High prevalence of myofascial trigger points subsists at cervical and
      scapular regions.

      There is few data regarding myofascial trigger point physiopathology. Furthermore, a
      diversity of therapeutic interventions consisting of trigger point inactivation and
      interruption of the vicious cycle is suggested in literature. Nevertheless, the effectiveness
      of these different interventions in trigger points and the duration of the effects are not
      yet fully clarified.

    <description>To obtain the pressure pain threshold measurements, an electronic pressure algometer was used. With the subject seated, the evaluator placed the pointer on the trigger pint with an approximate angle of 90º and an increasing pressure of approximately 1 kg/cm²/s. Subjects were told to use the word &quot;now&quot; whenever the sensation of pressure was replaced by a sensation of pain. At this point, the evaluator removed the algometer and the equipment recorded the maximum applied pressure.</description>

    <description>The therapist, with one hand on the occipital bone and the other on the shoulder, performed passive side flexion, contralateral to the muscle, taking the subject's head until the end-feel. Then, subjects performed an isometric contraction of 25% of their maximum force, for 5 seconds, while the therapist offered manual resistance. Afterwards the subject was let to relax in this position for additional 5 seconds. Side flexion was now increased until a new end-feel point was reached. This sequence was repeated 3 times. At the end, the therapist passively guided the cervical segment to the neutral position.</description>

At this point, pressure was maintained until pain levels were reduced to level 3. The therapist increased once more the pressure until the level of pain was 7 again. This procedure was repeated during 90 seconds.</description>
