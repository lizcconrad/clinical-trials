      Dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of NEOD001 in approximately 30
      subjects with AL amyloidosis. Expansion phase to evaluate safety, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of NEOD001 in 25 additional subjects at the maximum tolerated dose.

      The purpose of the dose escalation phase of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose/Phase 2 recommended dose of NEOD001 when given as a single agent intravenously in
      approximately 30 subjects with AL amyloidosis.

      The purpose of the expansion phase of the study is to evaluate the safety, preliminary
      efficacy and pharmacokinetics of single agent NEOD001 at the maximum tolerated dose/Phase 2
      recommended dose in approximately 25 additional evaluable subjects.

    <description>NEOD001 will be administered intravenously once every 28 days. The starting dose will be 0.5 mg/kg. Dose escalation will continue until the the maximum tolerated dose is determined for single agent NEOD001.
