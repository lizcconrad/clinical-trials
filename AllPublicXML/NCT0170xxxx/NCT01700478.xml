  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was done to determine if the use of a combination of preoperative rectal
      misoprostol 400µg used with intraoperative perivascular vasopressin is better than
      perivascular vasopressin used alone to decrease bleeding at myomectomy.

      A myomectomy is a fertility sparing procedure in which fibroids are removed from the uterus.
      This procedure can be associated with significant blood loss which can result in significant
      morbidity and mortality. The drug misoprostol which has been been use in the treatment of
      postpartum hemorrhage was given to subset of patients who were scheduled to undergo elective
      myomectomy at the University hospital of the West Indies and from the private practice of the
      participating doctors who were invited to participate in the study. Patients were randomized
      to receive or not to receive pre-operative rectal misoprostol 400µg, 60 minutes before
      surgery. Twenty five patients received misoprostol and twenty patients did not.
