  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nedd4.2 is a regulator of ENac, a transporter of sodium involved in the regulation of salt
      retention by the kidney. The study address the consequence of a frequent genetic variation
      leading expected to impact the function of Nedd4 and in turn, the ability of kidneys to
      excrete salt intake. Our hypothesis is that the genetic variants of Nedd4.2 could constitute
      a genetic predisposition to (or protection against) salt-sensitive hypertension.

      Subjects were submitted one week to a low sodium-high potassium diet, and then switch to a
      high sodium,-low potassium diet for two weeks. the last week, subject were taken a 20 MG
      daily dose of amiloride, a potassium sparing diuretic.
