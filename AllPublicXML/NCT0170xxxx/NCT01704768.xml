      The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two
      major public health problems in the United States today. To address the increasing incidence
      and adverse health outcomes associated with both obesity and mental health problems, a
      theory-based 15 session intervention program entitled COPE (Creating Opportunities for
      Personal Empowerment)/ Healthy Lifestyles TEEN(Thinking, Feeling, Emotions &amp; Exercise), will
      be delivered within high school health classes in order to improve the physical and mental
      health outcomes of 800 culturally diverse adolescents (14 to 16 years of age).

    <textblock>
      The prevention and treatment of obesity and mental health disorders in adolescence are two
      major public health problems in the United States (U.S.) today. The incidence of adolescents
      who are overweight or obese has increased dramatically over the past 20 years, with
      approximately 17.1 percent of teens now being overweight or obese. Furthermore, approximately
      15 million children and adolescents (25 percent) in the U.S. have a mental health problem
      that is interfering with their functioning at home or at school, but less than 25 percent of
      those affected receive any treatment for these disorders. The prevalence rates of obesity and
      mental health problems are even higher in Hispanic teens, with studies suggesting that the
      two conditions often coexist in many youth. However, despite the rapidly increasing incidence
      of these two public health problems with their related health disparities and adverse health
      outcomes, there has been a paucity of theory based intervention studies conducted with
      adolescents in high schools to improve their healthy lifestyle behaviors as well as their
      physical and mental health outcomes. Unfortunately, physical and mental health services
      continue to be largely separated instead of integrated in the nation's healthcare system,
      which often leads to inadequate identification and treatment of these significant adolescent
      health problems.

      Therefore, the goal of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of
      the COPE(Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment)/Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking,
      Feeling, Emotions &amp; Exercise) Program, an educational and cognitive-behavioral skills
      building intervention guided by cognitive behavior theory, on the healthy lifestyle behaviors
      and depressive symptoms of 800 culturally diverse adolescents enrolled in Phoenix, Arizona
      high schools. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Use a randomized controlled trial to
      test the short- and more long-term efficacy of the COPE TEEN Program on key outcomes,
      including healthy lifestyles behaviors, depressive symptoms and body mass index percentage,
      (2) Examine the role of cognitive beliefs and perceived difficulty in leading a healthy
      lifestyle in mediating the effects of COPE on healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive
      symptoms; and (3) Explore variables that may moderate the effects of the intervention on
      healthy lifestyle behaviors and depressive symptoms, including race/ethnicity, gender, SES,
      acculturation, and parental healthy lifestyle beliefs and behaviors. Six prior pilot studies
      support the need for this full scale clinical trial and the use of cognitive-behavioral
      skills building in promoting healthy lifestyles beliefs, behaviors and optimal mental health
      in teens.

    <description>The COPE Program is the intervention curriculum delivered to one arm of the study. Each session of COPE contains 15 to 20 minutes of physical activity (e.g., walking, dancing), not as an exercise training program, but rather to build beliefs/confidence in the teens that they can engage in and sustain some level of physical activity on a regular basis. Those healthy lifestyle intervention programs that have employed exercise interventions only have not led to sustained changes in healthy lifestyle behaviors. Our program is designed to enhance healthy lifestyle behaviors and sustain them because life-long cognitive-behavioral skills are taught in the program. Because the COPE TEEN program is completely manualized for the teens and instructors, it can be easily implemented by health teachers in high school settings.</description>

    <description>The Healthy Teens program is an attention control program that will assist in ruling out alternative explanations of the mechanism by which the intervention works. It will be standardized like the COPE program to insure that it can be evaluated. It will be administered in a format like that of the COPE intervention program, and will include the same number and length of sessions, except for that it will not include the theoretical active components of CBT and will not include theoretical mechanisms to produce our hypothesized changes in outcomes. Teens in the attention control group also will receive the sessions in their required health class. The difference between the two programs will lie in the content of the sessions, with the Healthy Teens program being focused on safety and common health topics/issues for teens (e.g., road safety, skin care, acne, sun safety).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Teens and parents of any gender, ethnicity/race, or socioeconomic status.

          -  Teens 14 to 16 years of age who are freshmen and sophomores taking a health class at
             one of the participating high schools.

          -  Teens who assent to participation.

          -  Teens with a custodial parent who consents for themselves and their teen's
             participation in the study.

          -  Teens who can speak and read in English (educational instruction in Arizona High
             Schools is conducted in English)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Teens who are under age 14 will be excluded because:

               -  They are not likely to be enrolled in high school, and

               -  They are unlikely to have sufficient cognitive development to benefit from the
                  proposed intervention

          -  Teens who are over age 16 will be excluded for two key reasons:

               -  We believe that the cognitive development of and social expectations for older
                  teens requires a more complex and flexible intervention than that proposed, and

               -  Teens need to be available for 12 month follow-up sessions (our pilot studies
                  indicated that this becomes less likely once teens are old enough to
                  leave/graduate from high school, emancipate from parents, and/or leave home).
