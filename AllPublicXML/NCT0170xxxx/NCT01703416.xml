    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-interventional study that aims to evaluate in daily
      clinical practice the possible correlation between patient perception of the ability to
      perform morning activities and the physician's assessment during a regular physical exam in
      patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), group C and D.
