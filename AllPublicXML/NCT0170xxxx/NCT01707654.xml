  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A combination of soft tissue and digital nerve defects in the finger results in sensory loss
      of the finger pulp. Reconstruction of these combined injuries is difficult. When the
      neurocutaneous defect is associated with wound infection, reconstructive alternatives are
      more limited. From July 2008 to May 2010, a retrospective study was conducted with 9
      consecutive postinfection patients who had the neurocutaneous defect of the finger following
      trauma. The purpose of this retrospective study is to report repair of the complicated
      infected wound in the finger using the bipedicled nerve flap and to evaluate the efficacy of
      this technique.

    <measure>2-point Discrimination Test</measure>
    <time_frame>17-25 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 2-point Discrimination Test determines the minimal distance at which a subject can sense the presence of two needles. The modified American Society for Surgery of the Hand guidelines were used to stratify Discriminator measurements (excellent &lt;6 mm; good 6-10 mm; fair 11-15 mm; poor &gt;15 mm. The test points were at the center of the radial or ulnar portion of the pulp. Each area was tested 3 times with a Discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before proceeding to another lower value. We stopped at 4 mm as a limit of 2PD and considered this normal. The assessments were performed at a single time point at the final follow up.</description>

             phalanx, or both;

          -  associated digital nerve defect 1 to 4 cm in length;

          -  single or double nerve defects; and

          -  simultaneous repair of nerve and soft tissue defects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  injury to the course of the pedicle or the donor site;

          -  nerve defect less than 1 cm or larger than 4 cm in length;

          -  occurrence of the defect in a region the flap is unable to reach, such as distal
             interphalangeal joint region, distal portion of the middle phalanx of the middle
             finger and the thumb;

          -  no involvement of the digital nerve.
