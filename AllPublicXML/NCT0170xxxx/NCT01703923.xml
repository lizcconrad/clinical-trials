      The purpose of this study is to determine the antitussive effect size and dose response of
      FP01 lozenges in subjects with chronic cough and to demonstrate the safety and tolerability
      of FP01 lozenges in subjects with chronic cough.

          -  Stable chest X-ray

          -  Forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt;70% predicted

             consecutive months), surgically sterile, or women of child-bearing potential with a
             negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test prior to entering the
             study and who are using or agree to use an acceptable method of contraception as
             determined by the Investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

             participate in the study as determined by the Investigator (i.e., diabetes mellitus,
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina, etc.)

          -  Prior or current renal disease; calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min
             (calculated CrCl &lt; 30)

          -  History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or current clinically significant liver
             disease

             treatment of cough, during the study. Subjects taking drugs in these classes for
             chronic cough at time of screening may have them discontinued at least 2 days prior to
             randomization.

          -  Use of other NMDA-receptor antagonists (e.g. dextromethorphan, ketamine, amantadine)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to memantine hydrochloride

          -  Observation of oral lesion(s) or abnormal finding(s) on oral cavity examination done

          -  History of oropharyngeal leukoplakia, carcinoma or parotid dysfunction

          -  Subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results at the screening
             visit (Subject may be enrolled by exception, as determined by the Principal
             Investigator and consented by Cerecor's Medical Monitor.)

          -  Subject has had clinically significant bleeding or donated blood or plasma within 30

          -  Subject has a positive drug and alcohol screen. Subjects receiving benzodiazepines by
             prescription, who test positive for benzodiazepines at the screening visit will be
             allowed.

          -  Subjects who have any disease or condition (medical or surgical) that might compromise
             hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or central nervous
             system function; or any other conditions that might interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug, or that would place the
             subject at increased risk, as determined by the Investigator.
