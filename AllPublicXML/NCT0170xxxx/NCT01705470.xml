      The study Objective is to assess the clinical and echocardiographic changes of patients with
      systolic dysfunction receiving blood transfusion, with or without prior treatment with
      furosemide

      More than 4 million patients receive a blood transfusion each year in the United States, many
      of them suffer from congestive heart failure. The reported prevalence of anemia in CHF is
      unknown, ranges widely from 4% to 70%, due to a lack of an established, consistent definition
      of anemia in CHF.

      Treating CHF patients with furosemide prior to blood transfusion became a common practice,
      even though no randomize clinical trial had examine this issue. Nand et al. measured the
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressures in 20 adults with chronic severe anemia (Hg &lt;6 mg/dl) and
      no systemic disease before and after transfusion of 700ml of whole blood. Ten of these
      patients were treated with furosemide (40 mg intra-venous) immediately prior the transfusion.
      The PCWP had increased significantly among patient who did not receive the furosemide and
      decreased by 3.75% among patients in the furosemide group, although this change was not was
      statistically significant. In another study, the same group of Nand et al. measured the PCWP
      among 40 chronic anemia patients receiving blood transfusion. None of the patients suffered
      from cardiopulmonary disease. The patients were randomly divided into 4 groups: the
      difference between the first 3 groups was the speed of the transfusion (2 ml/min, 5 ml/min
      and 10 ml/min). The fourth group patients were treated with 40 mg of furosemide before the
      transfusion was given in a rate of 5 ml/min. The PCWP increased significantly in the first 3
      groups, with the rise being proportionately greater with faster transfusions (15.8, 20.9 and
      32.2% in groups A, B and C, respectively). In the furosemide group, however, the PCWP
      decreased significantly by 21.7%.
