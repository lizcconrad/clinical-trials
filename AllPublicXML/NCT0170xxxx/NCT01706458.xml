  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies sipuleucel-T with or without deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) vaccine therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has not responded
      to previous treatment with hormones and has spread to other places in the body. Vaccines may
      help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known
      whether giving sipuleucel-T vaccine works better with or without DNA vaccine therapy in
      treating prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer (adenocarcinoma of the prostate)

          -  Metastatic disease as evidenced by the presence of soft tissue and/or bone metastases
             on imaging studies (computed tomography [CT] of abdomen/pelvis, bone scintigraphy)

          -  Castrate-resistant disease, defined as follows:

               -  All patients must have received standard of care androgen deprivation treatment
                  before trial entry (surgical castration versus gonadotropin-releasing hormone
                  [GnRH] analogue or antagonist treatment), and subjects receiving GnRH analogue or
                  antagonist must continue this treatment throughout the time on this study

               -  Patients may have been treated previously with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, with
                  evidence of disease progression subsequently; subjects must be off use of
                  anti-androgen for at least 4 weeks (for flutamide) or 6 weeks (for bicalutamide
                  or nilutamide) prior to registration

                  ** Subjects who demonstrate an anti-androgen withdrawal response, defined as a &gt;=
                  25% decline in PSA within 4-6 week of stopping a nonsteroidal antiandrogen are
                  not eligible until the PSA rises above the nadir observed after antiandrogen
                  withdrawal

               -  Castration levels of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) within 2 weeks of registration

          -  Progressive disease while receiving androgen deprivation therapy defined by any one of
             the following as per the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) bone
             scan criteria or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 during or
             after completing last therapy:

               -  PSA: at least two consecutive rises in serum PSA, obtained at a minimum of 1-week
                  intervals, and each value &gt;= 2.0 ng/mL

               -  Measurable disease: &gt;= 50% increase in the sum of the cross products of all
                  measurable lesions or the development of new measurable lesions; the short axis
                  of a target lymph node must be at least 15 mm by spiral CT to be considered a
                  target lesion

               -  Non-measurable (bone) disease: the appearance of two or more new areas of uptake
                  on bone scan consistent with metastatic disease compared to previous imaging
                  during castration therapy; the increased uptake of pre-existing lesions on bone
                  scan will not be taken to constitute progression, and ambiguous results must be
                  confirmed by other imaging modalities (e.g. X-ray, CT or magnetic resonance
                  imaging [MRI])

          -  Must have &gt;= 3 serum PSA values obtained over at least a 12 week period of time prior
             to registration, including the day of screening, to calculate a PSA doubling time;
             Note: PSA's are not required to be obtained at the same laboratory; use all PSA values
             that have been done in last 6 months to calculate PSA doubling time
