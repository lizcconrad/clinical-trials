  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multiple dose, parallel group study will assess the monoamine oxidase in the
      brain by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) and safety of RO4602522 in patients with
      Alzheimer disease and in healthy volunteers. Patients and volunteers will receive multiple
      doses of RO4602522 and up to three injections of C11-L-deprenyl-D2 used in the PET.

             judged by the investigator

          -  Able to participate and willing to give informed consent, and comply with the study
             restrictions.
