      1. Objective : To test the safety of 6 month-duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
           compared to conventional 12-month-or-longer duration after second-generation
           drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

        2. Hypothesis : A 6-month duration of DAPT is non-inferior to a conventional 12-month-or
           longer duration of DAPT at preventing the occurrence of major adverse cardiac and
           cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 18-month after second-generation DES implantation in
           patients with ACS.

      1. Primary endpoint

           - MACCE, defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and
           cerebrovascular events at 18 months after the index procedure.

        2. Secondary endpoint

             -  Individual components of the primary endpoint at 18-month after the index procedure

             -  Definite/probable stent thrombosis, defined by the Academic Research Consortium
                (ARC) at 18-month after the index procedure.

             -  Bleeding complication, defined by Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type
                2 to 5 at 18-month after the index procedure.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be ≥ 20 years.

          2. Subject is able to verbally confirm understandings of risks, benefits and treatment
             alternatives of receiving percutaneous coronary intervention and he/she or his/her
             legally authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any study
             related procedure.

          3. Subject must have a culprit lesion in a native coronary artery with significant
             stenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimate) eligible for stent implantation.

          4. Subject must have clinical diagnosis of ACS that includes unstable angina and MI. The
             specific definitions of ACS, as follows; 1) ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) :
             elevation of ST-segment more than 0.1 mV in 2 or more contiguous electrocardiographic
             (ECG) leads or new left bundle-branch block with elevated biomarkers of myocardial
             necrosis 2) Non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) : Elevated biomarkers of myocardial
             necrosis (troponin or CK-MB &gt; upper reference limit) with one of the following; (a)
             Transient ST-segment elevation or depression, or T-wave changes consistent with
             myocardial ischemia, (b) Identification of a culprit lesion at coronary angiography 3)
             Unstable angina : An accelerating pattern or recurrent episodes of chest pain at rest
             or with minimal effort and new ST-segment depression of at least 0.05 mV, or T wave
             inversion of at least 0.3 mV in at least 2 leads. The ECG criteria for unstable angina
             were based on the TACTICS-TIMI 18 trial.

          5. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated
             diameter of ≥ 2.25 mm and ≤ 4.25 mm.

          6. Target lesion(s) must be amenable for percutaneous coronary intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to any of the following
             medications: Heparin, Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Biolimus, Everolimus, Zotarolimus, and
             Contrast media (Patients with documented sensitivity to contrast media which can be
             effectively premedicated with steroids and diphenhydramine [e.g. rash] may be
             enrolled. Those with true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media, however, should not be
             enrolled.)

          2. Patients with active pathologic bleeding

          3. Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding within the prior 3 months, or major surgery
             within 2 months.

          4. Systemic (intravenous) Biolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus use within 12 months.

          5. Female of childbearing potential, unless a recent pregnancy test is negative, who
             possibly plan to become pregnant any time after enrollment into this study.

          6. History of bleeding diathesis, known coagulopathy (including heparin-induced
             thrombocytopenia), or will refuse blood transfusions

          7. Noncardiac comorbid conditions are present with life expectancy &lt;1 year or that may
             result in protocol noncompliance (per site investigator's medical judgment).

          8. An elective surgical procedure is planned that would necessitate interruption of
             clopidogrel during the first 12 months post enrollment.

          9. Patients who are actively participating in another drug or device investigational
             study, which have not completed the primary endpoint follow-up period.
