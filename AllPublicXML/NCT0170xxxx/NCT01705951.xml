  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is prompted by the urgent public health need to identify novel strategies to
      prevent and treat tobacco-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) and by compelling pilot data
      that suggests cessation of smoking results in rapid amelioration of endothelial function. The
      higher prevalence of CVD and metabolic syndrome in smokers have become major health care
      concerns. Therefore, finding optimal intervention strategies to combat these growing
      epidemics is imperative. We are investigating the efficacy of resistance training to
      ameliorate endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance in
      four groups: presence or absence of resistance training with or without cessation treatment +
      nicotine replacement.

      The investigators hypothesize that resistance training will improve cardiovascular function
      in smokers; however, the responses will be better in those who also stop smoking. In
      addition, resistance training will decrease smoking, however, the effects of counseling and
      nicotine replacement alone or counseling and nicotine replacement in conjunction with
      resistance training will be better than resistance training alone.

      The investigators are conducting a 12-week randomized-controlled trial of 100 young adult
      smokers.

      At week 0, participants attend three outpatient visits at baseline. Each participant is
      randomized to one of four groups: Resistance Training(RT)/Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT),
      RT/No NRT, No RT/NRT, and No RT/No NRT. Those receiving RT work with a certified personal
      trainer 3 times per week for 12 weeks at 60 minutes each session. Those receiving NRT use the
      nicotine patch daily for 12 weeks and call the California Smoker's Helpline for smoking
      cessation counseling. Those in the control group do not receive any intervention and maintain
      their current lifestyle and habits.

      At week 13, participants return for three post-intervention assessments.

      At week 26, survey data is collected to assess changes in lifestyle habits.
