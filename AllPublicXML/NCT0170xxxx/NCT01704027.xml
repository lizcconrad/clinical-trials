      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of urinary and rectal acute side
      effects of a pelvic and prostatic intensity-modulated arctherapy with simultaneous integrated
      boost (SIB-IMRT)combined with long-term androgen deprivation for patients with high risk
      localized prostate cancer
