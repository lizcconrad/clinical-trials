      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral intake of
      Lecitone®Se + 200UI/day of D3 vitamin with the effect of a placebo on changes in cognitive
      performance in Trial Making Test score part B (this test evaluate executive functions of
      mental flexibility) in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are symptomatic and can only temporarily slow
      down AD without altering its natural evolution. The development of new therapies has
      primarily focused on preventing the progression of AD. This therapeutic strategy involves
      being interested in patients with an early stage of AD such as a mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI). We hypothesized that the combination of Lecitone®Se with 200 IU/day of vitamin D can
      slow or even improve cognitive decline, particularly executive functions.

      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral
      intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with the effect of a placebo on changes in performance
      obtained in the TMT B in the older adults with a MCI.

      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

        -  To compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with
           the effect of a placebo on changes in executive performance in patients with a MCI.

        -  To compare the effect after 12 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with
           the effect of a placebo on changes in variability of stride time in patients with a MCI.

        -  To compare the effect after 24 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with
           the effect of a placebo and a delay phase of supplementation on changes in executive
           performance in patients with a MCI.

        -  To compare the effect after 24 weeks of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 with
           the effect of a placebo and a delay phase of supplementation on changes in variability
           of stride time in patients with a MCI.

        -  To determine the compliance and tolerance of the oral intake of Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3
           in patients with a MCI.

    <description>Lecitone®Se-Vitamin D3 is a dietary supplement combining the active ingredients in Lecitone®Se and 100 IU of vitamin D3. This dietary supplement comes in capsule form.
Participants take 2 capsules of Lecitone®Se -Vitamin D3 per day. The dose of vitamin D supplementation will not be adjusted except in case of an adverse event such as hypercalcemia. In this case, vitamin D supplementation is stopped and the participant is released prematurely from the study.</description>
