  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FMF is the most common periodic fever with a worldwide patient population estimated as
      150,000, mainly located in the Eastern Mediterranean basin. colchicine is the established
      therapy of choice ,however, around 20.000 patients worldwide fail to respond or cannot
      tolerate therapeutic doses, thereby suffering from recurrent debilitating, severe, painful
      attacks of peritonitis, pleuritis and synovitis and are at risk to die from reactive
      amyloidosis .Mutation-induced reduction in pyrin/ marenostrin activity is thought to underlie
      the disease by leading to NALP3 inflammasome activation ,and thereby to IL-1β related burst
      of inflammation.

      The IL-1 receptor antagonist Kineret (Anakinra), seems to be the most appropriate response to
      the uncontrolled IL-1β elevation. Indeed, an increasing number of reports over the last few
      years indicate a good response to Kineret (Anakinra), in colchicine-resistant FMF ,also in
      children ,however, no controlled study has thoroughly evaluated the efficacy and safety of
      this treatment.

      Study outline:

      The study aims to run at the FMF centre in Sheba Medical Center, covering more than 10,000
      patients. The study will evaluate the effect of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, Kineret
      (Anakinra), on the frequency of FMF attacks in patients that, despite maximum tolerable dose
      of colchicine, present with more than one attack per month.

      The study is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. 50 patients
      will be randomised to treatment with either Kineret (Anakinra), or placebo treatment for 4
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject must fulfil the following criteria in order to be included in the study:

          1. FMF diagnosed as per the Tel-Hashomer criteria -(Criteria for the diagnosis of
             familial Mediterranean fever. Arthritis Rheum.1998 Aug; 41(8):1516-7-Livneh A,
             Langevitz P, Zemer D, Zaks N, Kees S, Lidar T, Migdal A, Padeh S, Pras M).
