  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) is a
      common medical condition encountered during hospitalization in a medical environment. The use
      of thromboprophylaxis with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux has reduced
      more than 50% relative risk of thromboembolic complications.However, while obesity defined by
      a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2, is a major risk factor for venous thrombotic
      events, data on obese patients are limited. In fact, less than 20% of patients included in
      the three major studies of preventive medicine had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and most studies specific
      to the obese population comes from a series of bariatric surgery patients or orthopedic
      surgery. The main results of this series show regarding the obese population a decrease of
      the anti-Xa activity during the administration of a standard dose of enoxaparin (40 mg / d).
      However, no specific recommendation in this population has not been published to date and
      therefore,the dosages currently used are the same regardless of the patient's weight. In this
      context, the use in obese patients hospitalized in a medical environment a stronger dosage of
      enoxaparin (60 mg / d) compared to the standard dose of 40 mg / day, could get rates anti-Xa
      activity levels more consistent with the treatment required, and thus reduce the risk for
      thromboembolic complications in these patients
