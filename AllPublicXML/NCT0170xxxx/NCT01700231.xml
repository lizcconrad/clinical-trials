      Introduction Liver resection is considered the only curative treatment option for mCRC
      patients without extrahepatic disease and is accepted practice. Despite substantial
      improvements in surgical techniques, postoperative morbidity and mortality remain an
      important concern after major resections. Complications of liver resection, although rare,
      include liver failure and acute kidney injury as indicated by oliguria and increased serum
      creatinine. The underlying pathophysiological pathways of post-operative renal alteration
      following liver resection is an increase in portal venous pressure, based on observations in
      animal models or small cohorts. The corpus of data is derived from patients with liver
      cirrhosis and subsequent hepatorenal syndrome. These data are limited since cirrhosis cannot
      distinguish between metabolic changes, portal hypertension and impaired liver function in the
      elucidation of the pathogenesis of renal alterations. Liver resection is therefore a potent
      model to evaluate the impact of portal hypertension on the kidney despite stable liver
      function.

      The most significant factor determining morbidity and mortality following hepatectomy is the
      ability of the remnant liver to regenerate. In this context, several growth factors were
      shown to regulate the highly orchestrated process of liver regeneration (LR).

      Hypothesis The investigators will therefore test the hypothesis that liver resection leads to
      a sustained increase of portalvenous pressure with a subsequent episode of oliguric renal
      impairment, correlating with the quantity of resected liver.

      Furthermore, the investigators will examine the relationship between postoperative liver
      regeneration and circulating growth factor levels in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Based
      on the preclinical data the investigators hypothesize that a circulating growth factor levels
      will be associated with delayed liver regeneration, an increased incidence of postoperative
      liver dysfunction and concomitant worse clinical outcome.
