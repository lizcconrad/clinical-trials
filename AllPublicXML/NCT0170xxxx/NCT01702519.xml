      Bioequivalence study to confirm that a NTS with a polyisobutylene (PIB) adhesive from an
      alternative supplier delivers the same nicotine blood profile as that of the currently
      approved NTS with a polyisobutylene adhesive from the current supplier.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 32 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Following randomization, the nicotine patches; reference nicotine patch or test nicotine patch (as per the assigned sequence), were applied on participant's upper back or arm. Area under the plasma concentration time curve from zero and extrapolated to the time of last quantifiable sample was determined by plasma concentration time profile of nicotine. Blood samples were drawn at the following time intervals: immediately pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 32 hours after the application of the patch. Patch was then removed after the collection of 24 hour blood sample. AUC(0 -t) was based on the baseline adjusted nicotine plasma concentration data.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Curve From Time 0 to the Last Quantifiable Sample, AUC(0-t)</title>
        <description>Following randomization, the nicotine patches; reference nicotine patch or test nicotine patch (as per the assigned sequence), were applied on participant’s upper back or arm. Area under the plasma concentration time curve from zero and extrapolated to the time of last quantifiable sample was determined by plasma concentration time profile of nicotine. Blood samples were drawn at the following time intervals: immediately pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 32 hours after the application of the patch. Patch was then removed after the collection of 24 hour blood sample. AUC(0 -t) was based on the baseline adjusted nicotine plasma concentration data.</description>

          <description>Following randomization, the nicotine patches; reference nicotine patch or test nicotine patch (as per the assigned sequence), were applied on participant’s upper back or arm. Elimination rate constant for nicotine was determined from plasma concentration time profiles. Blood samples were drawn at several time points: immediately pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 32 hours the application of the patch. Patch was then removed after the collection of 24 hour blood sample. Elimination rate constant for nicotine was based on the baseline adjusted nicotine plasma concentration data.</description>
