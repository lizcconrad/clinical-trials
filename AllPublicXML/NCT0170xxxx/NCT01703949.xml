    <textblock>
      This phase II pilot trial studies how well brentuximab vedotin with or without nivolumab
      works in treating patients with CD30+ lymphoma that has come back after a period of
      improvement or does not respond to treatment. Biological therapies, such as brentuximab
      vedotin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from
      growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Giving brentuximab vedotin with or without nivolumab may work
      better in treating patients with CD30+ lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate following weekly brentuximab vedotin (1.2 mg/kg 3 of 4 weeks
      for up to four 28-day cycles) in patients with lack of response (&lt; partial response [PR]) or
      progression following brentuximab vedotin and demonstrating persistent expression of CD30.
      (Arm A)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response rate of combination brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in patients
      with lack of response (&lt; PR) or progression within 6 months following brentuximab vedotin.
      (Arm B)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor clinical outcome following the study treatment regimen.

      II. To estimate the frequency of CD30 loss in patients following resistance to brentuximab
      vedotin.

      III. To describe the pattern of CD30 expression (membranous, cytoplasmic, Golgi) in
      comparison to the pre-brentuximab vedotin expression.

      IV. To semi-quantitatively estimate and compare the surface density of CD30 pre and post
      brentuximab vedotin as measured by flow cytometry.

      V. To correlate response with CD30 density as measured by flow cytometry.

      VI. To evaluate the tolerability of the weekly regimen in patients previously exposed to
      brentuximab vedotin.

      VII. To explore the tolerability of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in patients previously
      exposed to brentuximab vedotin in a 21-day cycle.

      OUTLINE:

      ARM A (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL): Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-5 weeks, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.
