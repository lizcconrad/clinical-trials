      Incubator temperature is one of the most precious variables in IVF labs. When the IVF
      started, almost all incubator temperatures were set at 37 degrees which mimic in vivo
      conditions. Some authors speculated that gametes and early embryos might need low
      temperatures that provide quieter metabolism. We decide to compare Embryo culture at 37
      degree or slightly lower 36.5 degree and extensively investigate to find which is better to
      crucially introduce a solid evidence through this RCT.

    <textblock>
      Since the first IVF birth in 1978, the field of assisted reproductive technology has evolved
      dramatically. The evolution includes both the ovarian stimulation protocols and the
      laboratory techniques. Optimization of the laboratory procedures is of great interest to the
      scientists in the field of IVF.

      Incubator temperature is one of the most precious variables in IVF labs. When the IVF
      started, almost all incubator temperatures were set at 37 degrees which mimic in vivo
      conditions.

      Some authors speculated that gametes and early embryos might need low temperatures that
      provide quieter metabolism. another group found increase in pregnancy rate for embryos
      cultured below 37 degree compared to those cultured at 37 degree. Nevertheless; the majority
      of embryologists still consider culture at 37 degrees is the back bone for the incubators.

      The paucity of well designed studies makes it difficult to achieve a satisfactory answer
      whether lower temperature will improve the pregnancy rate. This encourage us to study the
      effect of lower temperature (36.5 degrees) on the pregnancy rate compared to conventional
      temperature (37 degrees).
