  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects of non-child bearing potential, between the ages
             of 21 and 55 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant
             abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination,
             including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical
             laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  Screening supine blood pressure &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;=90 mm Hg (diastolic), on a
             single measurement (confirmed by a single repeat, if necessary) following at least 5
             minutes of rest.

          -  Evidence or history of orthostatic hypotension.

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at Screening. If QTc
             exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times
             and the average of the three QTc values should be used to determine the subject's
             eligibility.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential, including those with
             tubal ligation.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs, vitamins and dietary supplements within
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study
             medication. Herbal supplements must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of
             &lt;=1 g/day. Limited use of non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect
             subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case
             basis following approval by the sponsor.

          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Subjects who are investigational site staff members or relatives of those site staff
             members or subjects who are Pfizer employees directly involved in the conduct of the
             trial.
