  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to optimize an obesity treatment program targeting overweight
      8-12 year old children using &quot;Cue Exposure Training&quot;.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Cue Exposure program is to train children to resist cues to eat unhealthy
      foods. Through a series of experimental studies, the investigators will evaluate how many
      weekly treatment visits there should be, whether children should be exposed to a single food
      or multiple foods during treatment, whether to use partial reinforcement or not, whether
      visits should be daily or weekly, and whether the exposures should be in single or multiple
      contexts. The investigators will be recruiting parent-child dyads in the San Diego community
      to participate in 8 to 16 weekly or daily treatment sessions either in their home, community
      center, or our lab, depending on the treatment arm. Parents and children will complete
      baseline and post-treatment assessments consisting of collecting psychophysiological data,
      completing laboratory tasks, and completing questionnaires. The investigators will be
      evaluating which treatment condition reduces overeating (as measured by our laboratory
      tasks).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Response to an advertisement for the study,

          -  An overweight or obese child in the family who is between the ages of 8 and 13,

          -  The 8-13 year old child must be above the 85th BMI % for age and gender,

          -  Parent willing to participate and attend all meetings,

          -  Parent who can read at a minimum of a 5th grade level in English,

          -  Parent and child willing to commit to attendance and assessments,

          -  Child who eats in the absence of hunger.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major child psychiatric disorder diagnoses,

          -  An obese child over the 99.9th BMI %

          -  Child or parent diagnoses of diabetes for which physician supervision of diet is
             needed or diagnosis of serious current physical diseases (such as cancer, multiple
             sclerosis, lupus) which could significantly decrease their ability to participate in
             the intervention (parent report),

          -  Child taking a medication that can affect cognitive functioning, such as attention,
             concentration, or mental status.

          -  Family with restrictions on types of food, such as food allergies, or religious or
             ethnic practices that limit the foods available in the home (these restrictions affect
             their ability participate in the food exposures because it would limit the variety of
             foods available to do exposures with),

          -  Child with an active eating disorder (based on parent and child self-report)

          -  Major parent psychiatric or eating disorder.
