  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare once-a-week vs. twice-a-week strength training in
      survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer to determine which is the optimal exercise
      prescription.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a result of cancer and its treatment, survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer are
      reported to have deficits in both physical and psycho-social health. In cancer survivors
      exercise has been shown to improve fitness, increase bone density and lean body mass, enhance
      self-esteem, and reduce fatigue. These changes have a positive effect on the survivor's
      physical functioning and quality of life. However, there are few studies which have examined
      the effects of strength training or studies aimed at determining optimal exercise
      prescription in this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare two
      strength training prescriptions (once-a-week vs. twice-a-week strength training) to determine
      which prescription (if any) results in greater benefit for survivors. It is hoped that the
      results of this study will lead to a better understanding of how strength training improves
      the health of survivors and will help inform future exercise guidelines for this population.

    <time_frame>Baseline (end of week 1); Midpoint (end of week 7); Final (end of week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>Muscular Strength will be assessed using the predicted one-repetition maximum method (Brzycki method)using the bench press and leg press to measure upper and lower body strength.</description>

    <measure>Process Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Final (end of week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>Process measures will provide insight about the feasibility of the exercise prescriptions. Included measures are: recruitment (percent of interested survivors who consent); adherence (the number of sessions attended); compliance (the degree to which the survivors follow the exercise prescription); and safety (all adverse events will be recorded)</description>

    <measure>Changes in Muscular Endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (end of week 1); Midpoint (end of week 7); Final (end of week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>Muscular Endurance will be assessed using the standard load test. Participants will lift a weight equal to 50% one repetition maximum as many times as possible. The bench press and leg press will be used to measure endurance of the upper and lower body.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Body Composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (end of week 1); Midpoint (end of week 7); Final (end of week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be assessed using bioelectric impedance to determine percent body fat, lean body mass, and fat mass.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (end of week 1); Midpoint (end of week 7); Final (end of week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed using the Medical Outcomes Survey - Short Form. This survey measures multiple aspects of quality of life including: physical function, role-physical, bodily-pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (end of week 1); Midpoint (end of week 7); Final (end of week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will me measured using the Fatigue scale of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment. This is a 13 item questionnaire that measures the degree to which a cancer survivor experiences fatigue</description>
