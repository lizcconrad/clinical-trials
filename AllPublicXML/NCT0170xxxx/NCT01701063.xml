  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics in a
      carefully monitored cohort of pediatric subjects infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) on a
      telaprevir-based regimen in Part A and with dose adjustments if needed before Part B.

    <description>AUC was measured for telaprevir only. AUC 0-t last was defined as the area under the concentration-time curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration. AUC 0-12 hour (AUC 0-12h) was calculated by respecifying predose concentrations as 12 hour concentrations. AUC 0-24h was calculated as AUC 0-12h multiplied by 2. Dose adjusted AUC (AUC 0-24h_Adj) was calculated by multiplying AUC 0-24h by the dose adjustment factor to obtain projected exposures in participants who were misdosed. Data were presented for AUC 0-t last, AUC 0-12h, AUC 0-24h, AUC 0-24h_Adj.</description>

Peg-IFN-alfa-2b and RBV were administered for 24 weeks in participants who achieved extended rapid virologic response (eRVR) or for 48 weeks in participants who did not achieve eRVR. eRVR was defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels at Week 4 and Week 12.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of Telaprevir</title>
        <description>AUC was measured for telaprevir only. AUC 0-t last was defined as the area under the concentration-time curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration. AUC 0-12 hour (AUC 0-12h) was calculated by respecifying predose concentrations as 12 hour concentrations. AUC 0-24h was calculated as AUC 0-12h multiplied by 2. Dose adjusted AUC (AUC 0-24h_Adj) was calculated by multiplying AUC 0-24h by the dose adjustment factor to obtain projected exposures in participants who were misdosed. Data were presented for AUC 0-t last, AUC 0-12h, AUC 0-24h, AUC 0-24h_Adj.</description>
