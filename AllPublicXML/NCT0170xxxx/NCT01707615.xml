  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic plaques indicate the occurrence of ischemia events and how to deal with it is
      a difficult task for clinical physicians. Grape seed proanthocyanidin extrat (GSPE) has been
      reported to exert an antiatherogenic effect by inducing regression of atherosclerotic plaques
      in animal experimental studies. In this study, the antiatherogenic effect of GSPE has been
      investigated in clinical use.

    <measure>Carotid B-Mode Ultrasound</measure>
    <time_frame>Carotid ultrasound examination was performed at baseline and 6, 12, 24months after treatment.The change of carotid plaque was record within 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The common, internal, and external carotid arteries were carefully identified by combining B-mode ultrasonography and color-Doppler duplex examination in the anterior oblique, lateral, and posterior oblique planes. All data was collected in 12 segments: the near （intimal-luminal surface) and far (medial- adventitial) walls of the distal common (1 cm proximal to dilation of the carotid bulb), the bifurcation (1cm proximal to the flow divider), and the proximal internal (1 cm section of the internal carotid artery immediately distal to the flow divider) left and right carotid artery.</description>
