  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate a new cancer diagnosis center (Diagnostiskt Centrum, DC)
      in Kristianstad, Sweden. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who are suspected of having serious illness
      but who have no organ-specific symptoms will be referred to the DC for further investigation
      after preliminary assessment in primary care. The overall purpose of the study is to evaluate
      whether the DC meets its target time for diagnosing cancer. In addition, we will evaluate
      secondary issues, such as survival, to determine whether this pilot project merits extension
      to other parts of southern Sweden.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostiskt Centrum (DC), Sweden's first specialized cancer diagnosis center, was
      established at Kristianstad General Hospital in 2012 as a model for reducing the time taken
      to diagnose cancer in primary care patients with diffuse, non-organ specific symptoms. If it
      is successful, the DC model could be rolled out to other areas of Sweden. This study by the
      Center for Primary Health Care Research in Malmö, Sweden and Regionalt cancercentrum syd will
      investigate whether the DC process reduces the time from (1) the point when the patient first
      contacts his/her primary care center with symptoms to (2) the point when he/she is informed
      about his/her diagnosis (of cancer or another disease). This will be achieved by comparison
      with matched control patients with suspected cancer who will be referred to Helsingborg
      General Hospital for further investigation according to existing diagnostic procedures.
      Various outcome measures will be investigated, and patients' experiences of the DC process
      will be assessed using a tailored questionnaire. In addition, the DC model will be subjected
      to health economics analysis.
