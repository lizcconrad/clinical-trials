  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem. Epidemiologic studies have shown the
      prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules to be approximately 5% in women and 1% in men living
      in iodine-sufficient parts of the world and up to 30% in iodine deficient regions, such as
      Germany. The clinical importance of thyroid nodules rests with the need to exclude thyroid
      cancer which occurs in 5-15%. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), which includes papillary
      and follicular cancer, comprises the vast majority (90%) of all thyroid cancers. In Germany,
      approximately 7,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 2011. The yearly incidence has increased
      from 3.6 per 100,000 in 1973 to 8.7 per 100,000 in 2002, and this trend appears to be
      continuing. Recurrence-free survival is generally excellent and depends on the risk group.

      The role of postoperative remnant radioiodine ablation (RRIA) as the most serious question
      regarding the initial management of DTC still needs to be resolved even after decades of
      radioiodine use. American Thyroid Association directions for future research addressing these
      questions include:

        -  Better understanding of the long-term risks of radioiodine use;

        -  Improved risk stratification;

      Randomized controlled trials are still missing in which RRIA has proven its worth as a safe
      and very effective treatment that results in an improved life expectancy and a reduced
      recurrence rate. Many observational studies lack sufficiently high evidence. Evidence grade
      is rated mainly on &quot;expert level&quot;, based on non-randomized retrospective observation studies.
      Although RRIA in Europe is established as adjuvant standard treatment for all patients with
      DTC, except those with stage T1a, it remains to be shown throughout if it is beneficial for
      low risk and medium risk patients without metastases (M0), also known as stage I patients
      according to UICC/AJCC classification, accounting for 40-90% of all patients.

      Blood doses due to cumulative radioiodine therapy may well exceed 2 Gy, and RRIA induces an
      average blood dose of 0.28 Gy to the entire body. Risks as estimated from that dose are not
      insignificant. The question is whether or not the condition after remnant ablation justifies
      such an increased risk of a secondary malignancy. The probability of causation for a
      pharyngeal or breast tumour can well exceed the margin of a 50% after being exposed to RRIA
      or consecutive I-131 diagnostic imaging to explore measureable Tg levels. Even though
      radioiodine therapy can benefit some patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma, it is still
      unknown whether the risks of RRIA outweigh any discernable benefit. Undoubtedly, quality of
      life may be affected by adjuvant use of I-131.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The I-124 study arm may have considerable benefits for the patient included in the study.
      These include

        -  enhanced tumour and risk stratification,

        -  avoidance of unnecessary I-131 exposure in 30-89 percent of patients who were classified
           with &quot;low risk&quot; tumour (MACIS or AMES scoring) or &quot;stage I disease&quot; (UICC-AJCC TNM
           staging system), and,

        -  improved quality of life at the same or better morbidity and mortality rates in the
           I-124 arm.

      Environmental and hospital staff related benefits include prevention or saving of I-131
      exposure.

      This study is designed to compare effectiveness of treatments following and evaluating
      guideline recommendations in two assignment arms.

    <description>Proportion of patients within the group under I-124 PET/CT guided concept which do not need a RRIA: Because all patients subjected to standard EANM guideline procedures will firstly have RRIA, the proportion of patients can be estimated which is not subjected to unnecessary ablation by applying the I-124 PET/CT guided concept. Thus, we can estimate the proportion of patients in the experimental arm without recurrent tumour or progression (key secondary outcome).</description>

    <description>I-124 PET/CT guided concept following ATA guideline recommendations after total thyroidectomy. Uptake outside of thyroid bed constitutes I-131 therapy for remnant ablation and metastasis therapy based on I-124 dosimetry. Remnant mass and/or metastasis mass will be estimated by a diagnostic CT scan simultaneously while doing PET at the optimum time point 2-3 days after administration of I-124. If there is no uptake outside of thyroid bed, no ablation will follow in stage I disease according to AJCC with the possibility of lymph node involvement but no distant metastasis and no microscopical residual disease (Patient age &lt;45y: any T, any N, M0; Patient age 45y or older: T1, N0, M0). Periodic follow-up may include I-124 PET/CT when indicated to determine whether or not another I-131 therapy has to follow. Thyroglobuline increase also constitutes I-124 PET/CT imaging.</description>
