  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The original American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition of Acute Respiratory
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS) required bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on
      frontal chest X-ray (CXR), but there is poor inter-observer reliability in interpreting CXR
      using this definition among intensivists and radiologists.

      As a result, the newly published Berlin definition of ARDS specified that the CXR criterion
      should include bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema not fully explained by
      effusions, lobar/lung collapse, or nodules/masses on CXR.

      In order to improve inter-observer agreement, the panel have also developed a set of CXRs
      judged as consistent, inconsistent, or equivocal for the diagnosis of ARDS.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of this training set on
      inter-observer reliability in applying the radiographic definition for ARDS.

      The study is composed of 3 phases:

      Phase 1: All participants will be required to independently interpret a set of 12 CXRs, as
      provided by the consensus panel. The possible radiographic interpretations include
      consistent, inconsistent, or equivocal for the diagnosis of ARDS.

      Phase 2: Training materials adapted according to the recently published Berlin definition of
      ARDS, with its expanded rationale and interpretation of all 12 CXRs, will be sent to all
      participants.

      Phase 3: The same set of 12 CXRs, in different order, will be sent to all participants for
      interpretation for the second time.
