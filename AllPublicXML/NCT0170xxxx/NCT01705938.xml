      This is a randomized, phase 1, single-blind, placebo controlled, single-dose, study designed
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of orally administered
      SP-333 tablets. The study will include 7 groups of 8 subjects each (6 active, 2 placebo)
      given a single oral dose of of SP-333 tablets or placebo. Following outpatient screening from
      approximately 5 to 42 days before dosing, each subject will enter the Clinical Pharmacology
      Unit (CPU) and will be housed from at least 48 hours, before dosing until 48 hours after
      dosing. Subjects will be given single dose of the study drug on the day of dosing and remain
      in the CPU for at least 48 hours. Subjects will return to the CPU on Days 8±1 and 15±1 for
      safety follow up. Safety Committee Meetings will be conducted to review safety, tolerability,
      and available Pharmacokinetic data from the current and previous treatment group(s), prior to
      dosing subsequent treatment groups. Subjects in a given treatment group are considered
      completers once they have completed the Day 15±1 day Follow up Visit.
