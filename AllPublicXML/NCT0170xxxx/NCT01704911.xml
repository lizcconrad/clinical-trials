      The purpose of the DRAGON clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      transradial coronary intervention (TRI) in comparison with the transfemoral coronary
      intervention (TFI).

    <textblock>
      Historically, performing PCI requires making an access to the peripheral arteries by an
      arterial puncture or cutting down. This may lead to the serious bleeding complications
      especially under the situation of dual antiplatelet therapy and/or potent anti-coagulation
      therapies. TRI is now widely accepted as the most promising alternative for TFI around the
      world. It is supposed to reduce the incidence of the serious bleeding complication during and
      after PCI, as well as the total medical cost. There have been several prospective randomized
      trials comparing the safety and efficacy between TRI and TFI, but none of them had enough
      power to show the statistically valid equivalence in the efficacy between TRI and TFI. In
      this study, investigators randomize approximately 1,700 patients into TRI or TFI.
      Investigators adopt the rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACCE) at 1 year as the primary
      efficacy endpoint for the study. Based on these rates at 1 year, the sample size for the
      non-inferiority analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint is calculated. Through this
      randomization trial, investigators can achieve the scientific evidence for the improved
      safety and equal efficacy of TRI compared to TFI. This trial has enough statistical power to
      draw the final conclusion in the debate between TRI and TFI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patient is able to verbally acknowledge an understanding of the associated risks,
             benefits and treatment alternatives and he or his legally authorized representative
             provides signed informed consent prior to the randomization, as approved by the
             appropriate IEC.

          -  Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina,
             silent ischemia, positive functional study or a reversible changes in the
             electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with ischemia).

          -  Patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery.

          -  Allen test is required for suitable candidate.

          -  Patient must agree to undergo all protocol-required follow-up examinations.

          -  Patient must agree not to participate in any other clinical study within the duration
             of this trial.

          -  Target lesion must be able to be treated by using six-French guiding catheters.

          -  Target lesion can be de Novo or restenotic.

          -  The target lesion can be stable or unstable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received a heart transplant or any other organ transplant or is on a
             waiting list for any organ transplant.

          -  Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy within 30
             days prior to or after the procedure.

             insertion.

             cause non-compliance with the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is
             associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year).

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential who have refused a urine or blood pregnancy
             test (to be done within 7 days prior to index procedure), patients who are nursing at
