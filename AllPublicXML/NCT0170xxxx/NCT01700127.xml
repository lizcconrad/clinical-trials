      This will be a randomized study with the primary objective of assessing the impact of
      withholding versus encouraging breastfeeding on the immunogenicity of Rotarix® in infants.

      Enrolled subjects will all be administered Rotarix®, at ages 6 to 7 weeks, and at10 -14
      weeks. The subjects will be randomized into one of the two study arms. In one of the group
      caregivers will be advised to breastfeed immediately prior to and after each dose of the
      vaccine while in the other group caregivers will be advised to withhold breastfeeding for 30
      minutes before and after each dose of the vaccine. The other childhood vaccines i.e. OPV and
      Pentavalent will be administered at least 30 minutes after administration of Rotarix®, The
      enrolled subjects will be followed up for 4 weeks after the 2nd dose of Rotarix®.

      Infants ≤7 weeks and pregnant women will be identified through a household survey.Families of
      infants aged 6-7 weeks will be called to the study clinic for consenting, screening and
      enrollment.All enrolled subjects will be administered 2 doses of Rotarix® at 6 to 7 weeks and
      at 10-14 weeks of age. Other childhood vaccines will also be offered.

      At enrollment, a blood specimen and breast milk specimen will be obtained from the mother and
      a blood, salivary and stool specimens will be obtained from the subject before administering
      the Rotarix® vaccine.

      At the time of the 2nd administration, a breast milk specimen will be obtained from the
      mother and a salivary specimen will be obtained from the subject before administering the
      Rotarix® vaccine. At 28 days (±) 5 after the 2nd dose of Rotarix® vaccine, a blood, salivary
      and stool specimen will be obtained from the subject.

      Whenever the family comes to the study clinic at 6-7 weeks, consent will be administered and
      a clinical examination conducted.If the family is willing for the mother and the child to be
      part of the study and the child meets the eligibility criteria, the child will be enrolled.

      Depending on the group allocation the mothers will be advised to withhold or encourage
      breastfeeding for 30 minutes before and after receipt of Rotarix®.

      subjects will be observed for 30 minutes after receipt of the vaccines to assess for
      immediate adverse events.

      All minor illnesses that do not require hospital referral will be managed by the study
      physician using current practices.

      All hospitalizations and deaths will be reported and reviewed by an Independent Safety
      Monitor.
