      The purpose of this study is to determine how B cell subsets and autoantibodies are related
      to disease remission after rituximab treatment in subjects with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
      (SLE).

      Immune cells are an important part of the abnormal autoimmune response in SLE. The B cell is
      a significant part of this autimmune response because it produces the antibodies which can
      react with normal tissue of the body. B cells have the ability to accumulate and promote the
      development of SLE. The purpose of this study is to determine how B cell subsets and
      autoantibodies are related to disease remission after rituximab treatment in subjects with
      SLE.

      This study will last approximately two years and consist of 15 study visits. These visits
      will occur at screening, baseline, Days 0 and 14, and Months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,
      21, and 24. Participants will receive a single rituximab injection on Days 0 and 14.
      Medication history and blood tests will occur at every study visit. A physical exam, medical
      history, and urine tests will occur at most visits. For females, a pregnancy test will occur
      at selected visits.
