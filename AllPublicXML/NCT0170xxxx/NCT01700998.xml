  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure (ARF) is a serious and common complication in hospitalized patients,
      occurring in more than 25% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Hypomagnesemia is a common
      disorder, occurring in approximately 12% of hospitalized patients, with an incidence of 60%
      in ICU patients. The majority of those patients have are asymptomatic hypomagnesemia, and
      patients with mild hypomagnesemia do not need treatment, only the correction of the
      underlying cause. Hypomagnesemia potentiates postischemic renal failure in rats, and is
      associated, in humans, with acute renal failure. To date, there is no study that demonstrated
      a benefit of maintain normal levels of magnesium in the incidence of ARF in critically ill
      patients. Thus, we suggest that a treatment aimed to maintain normal magnesium levels during
      ICU stay can decrease the incidence of ARF. We will perform a randomized clinical trial that
      will include all patients admitted to an ICU that, develop hypomagnesemia. It will be
      excluded from the study: patients younger than 18 years, participants from other studies,
      pregnant women, patients with creatinine greater than or equal to 3.5 mg / dl or on dialysis,
      patients who used intravenous contrast for radiological studies, patients weighing less than
      40kg, suffering from advanced malignant disease, with severe hypomagnesemia (serum magnesium
      less than or equal to 1.1 mg / dl), with a diagnosis of Torsades de Pointes or symptomatic
      hypomagnesemia prior to randomization. Patients included in the study will be randomized to
      one of the following groups: placebo (saline solution 0.9%) or 50% Magnesium Sulfate.
      Patients will receive an administration of 48 mEq Magnesium diluted in 250 ml saline 0.9% for
      24 hours in an infusion rate of 10.4 ml / hr. Therapy will be continued for 3 days, and
      repeated during ICU stay to maintain magnesium levels in the normal range. Placebo group will
      receive exactly the same infusion only with saline administration. The therapy will be
      discontinued if the patient has hypermagnesemia or signs of magnesium intoxication. The main
      outcome measurement will be the occurrence of ARF during ICU stay.
