      This post market clinical follow-up study is designed to confirm safety and performance of
      the Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder when used in hemi or total shoulder arthroplasty.

      The safety of the implant will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of all
      kinds of adverse events.

      The performance will be determined by analyzing the implant survival, overall pain and
      functional performances (based on Constant &amp; Murley score and ASES score), subject quality of
      life (EuroQol EQ5D) and radiographic parameters (e.g. radiolucencies, osteolysis, component
      migration) of study subjects who received the Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder.

      The Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder is not approved for use in the US.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, noncontrolled, multi-center post market clinical follow-up study
      involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in hemi and total shoulder arthroplasty procedures.

      A total number of 160 subjects will be included in the study.

      Ethics Committee (EC) approval for each site has to be obtained prior to conducting this
      study. Sequentially, all eligible patients will be offered study enrollment at each center to
      avoid potential selection bias. All potential subjects will be required to participate in an
      informed consent process and sign the EC approved written Informed Consent prior to study
      enrollment.

      The study is designed to be prospective to ensure that the study population is representative
      of the type of population that the device is intended to treat. Patients will be selected
      according to the subject selection criteria described in section 8. All subjects will undergo
      preoperative, intraoperative and immediate postoperative assessments including physical
      examinations, radiographic evaluations and collection of quality of life metrics. Follow-up
      evaluations are to be conducted at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 years postoperation.
