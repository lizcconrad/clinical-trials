    <textblock>
      This trial studies the safety and immunogenicity of a HIV clade B'/C DNA vaccine followed by
      recombinant vaccinia virus rTV boost in HIV-uninfected healthy volunteers at low or high risk
      of HIV infection. In addition, the effect of different intervals of the prime-boost will be
      studied.
