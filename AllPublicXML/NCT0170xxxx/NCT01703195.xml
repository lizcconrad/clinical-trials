  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a type of MRI scan called diffusion
      weighted imaging (DWI) is accurate in checking the status of tumors. Researchers also want to
      learn if DWI can predict how tumors will respond to radiation therapy.

      If you agree to take part in this study, information will be collected from your medical
      record including your age, sex, and status of the disease.

      For the MRI scans, you will receive a routine contrast drug by vein. Contrast drugs are used
      by doctors in order to see MRI images more clearly.

      A modified MRI scan will performed right after your scheduled standard-of-care MRI scan. This
      modified MRI scan is the investigational scan. To complete the modified MRI scan, you will
      need to stay in the MRI scanner for about 8 extra minutes. It should take about 47 minutes
      total to complete both scans.

      The way that researchers program the MRI machine and the order in which the images are taken
      is what is being modified for the investigational scan. These changes may help researchers
      capture better images.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over after the modified MRI scan is complete.

      This is an investigational study. The standard-of-care MRI scan method is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the diagnosis of several diseases. The modified MRI scan method is
      being used in research only.

      Up to 25 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Location of tumor involvement determined based on pre-treatment imaging findings, where inferior margin of tumor marked on the MRI. Tumor involved areas will then be evaluated by EUA, where fiducial markers will be placed and MRI images will be fused with the CT images to find if there is any discrepancy between the EUA and the DWI images. The primary endpoint is the accuracy of tumor involvement detection (binary endpoint), where tumor invasion is defined as similar to that seen by EUA, in the anterior/posterior or the lateral walls of the vagina. Similarity will be defined as the tumor margin seen on MRI being similar to what is seen on the EUA where the markers correspond to the margins defined on the MRI. This will be defined as 5mm or less.</description>

    <measure>Ability of Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWMR) to Assess Response to Radiation Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after radiation therapy treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary endpoints include quantitative measurements of discrepancies (or: quantitative measurement of the discrepancy) between DWMR and exam under anesthesia (EUA), agreement and difference between DWMR and other MR sequences (T2, DGE), and the ability of DWMR to assess response to therapy. Summary statistics of results for each modality tabulated. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV estimated along with corresponding 95% CIs. Quantitative discrepancy measurements summarized using mean, SD, and range. Difference and agreement between DWMR and other MR sequences assessed using the McNemar test and Kappa statistics, respectively.</description>
