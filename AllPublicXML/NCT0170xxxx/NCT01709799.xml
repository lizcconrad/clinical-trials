      The purpose of this research study is to help scientists and health care providers learn more
      about preventing dementia and brain disease in older adults. There is an urgent need to
      develop strategies to prevent or slow down memory loss and brain function decline in the
      elderly.

      In this study, the investigators hope to learn how physical exercise and a brain training
      program work together to improve thinking and memory in older adults. Specifically, these
      aims include:

        -  Learning whether physical activities (like biking or treadmill walking or Wii Fit games)
           will help improve the benefits of a brain training program. Based on preliminary results
           and that in the literature, the investigators anticipate greater cognitive benefits in
           the Exercise + Cognitive training groups than the Cognitive Training alone group.

        -  To determine whether the benefits of adding exercise will occur quickly or develop more
           gradually over time. The investigators suspect that a major benefit of exercise
           pre-dosing will occur by the 12th week of the program.

        -  To examine whether Wii-Fit exercise games cause similar effects on brain training as
           traditional exercise programs such as biking or walking. Although several recent studies
           have raised questions about the true aerobic benefit of exergames such as Wii-Fit Plus,
           other evidence suggests that these weaker aerobic benefits may be offset by the greater
           novelty and interest level afforded by exergames.

      Research Participants take part in a 16 week Wellness Program, which includes either
      traditional physical exercise with brain training(Group A), Wii exergaming with brain
      training(Group B) or brain training alone (Group C). Participants are randomly assigned to
      groups.

      A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests, surveys and assessments are given prior
      to start of the intervention, at completion of the 16 weeks, and again 3 months post
      completion.

      The program involves 4 days of physical activity each week for groups A &amp; B. The physical
      exercise/activity portion will involve warm up stretching and then either Group A-traditional
      exercise (like riding a stationary recumbent bicycle or walking on a treadmill), Group B-
      playing Nintendo Wii Exergames with a television based video game, or Group C- NO exercise at
      all.

      Every 4th week the 16 week intervention period, all participants in all three groups will
      also complete 80 minutes of brain training activities each day of the week. This is in
      addition to the previously assigned physical activity for Groups A &amp; B. The brain training
      regimen consists of Posit Science Insight computer based brain games.

      The Insight program consists of five different modules that focus on visual processing,
      attention, and memory. Each of the modules are described below:

        1. Bird Safari: This module involves identifying and ordering simple visual stimuli that
           flash on a screen. The goal is to improve ability to respond quickly to visual stimuli
           and to segment rapidly changing visual pictures.

        2. Jewel Diver: This module involves tracking objects as they become hidden by distractors.
           The goal is to improve ability of visual system to rapidly identify and discriminate
           objects in the visual periphery.

        3. Master Gardener: This module involves visual working memory and matching pairs of
           pictures.

        4. Road Tour: This is a simulated driving exercise that involves divided attention to
           oncoming cars and road signs. The goal is to improve ability of visual system to
           continuously track multiple objects against a field of distractors.

        5. Sweep Seeker: In this exercise, participants identify complex moving visual stimuli. The
           goal is to improve rapid, sequential eye movements to salient visual targets, process
           relevant information and then make rapid decisions to identify, discriminate and
           classify targets.

      Questionnaires regarding the participants mood before and after the brain training weekly are
      administered. In addition, brief questionnaires on attention and memory are given to measure
      thinking and memory progress.

    <measure>Bird Safari Subtest of PositScience Insight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), immediate posttest (Week 16), delayed posttest (Week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants identify the bird that is different from the others as it flashes briefly on screen. The test measures visual speed and precision. The test is adaptive, and becomes more difficult with practice in that bird pairs get more similar, backgrounds get more complex, and distance from the center increases. The raw score is in milliseconds. As participants improve, the birds flash for fewer milliseconds, giving them a lower (better) score. Thus, LOWER SCORES reflect IMPROVEMENT
These scores have been converted to T-scores (standardized scores with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10). The formula used was:
T-score = ((((participant score minus sample mean at baseline) / (sample standard deviation at baseline) ) * 10) + 50)</description>

    <measure>Jewel Diver Subtest of PositScience Insight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), immediate posttest (Week 16), delayed posttest (Week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants track target objects as they move around the screen. This is a measure of divided attention. As participants master the task, it is made more difficult in that: (a) objects travel more quickly, (b) objects travel over larger area, (c) objects travel for longer, (d) visual contrast decreases. The score is the number of objects participants are able to track. Thus, HIGHER SCORES reflect IMPROVEMENT
These scores have been converted to T-scores (standardized scores with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10). The formula used was:

    <measure>Master Gardener Subtest of PositScience Insight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), immediate posttest (Week 16), delayed posttest (Week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants watch as three or five images briefly flash in different positions on screen. This task measures visual processing speed and visual working memory. As participants master the task, it is made more difficult via: (a) the images change, becoming more similar, (b) the images are shown over a larger area on screen, and (c) participants go from viewing 3 images to 5 images. Participant score is in milliseconds, so that as they improve, the images flash on screen for fewer milliseconds. Thus LOWER SCORES are indicative of IMPROVEMENT.
These scores have been converted to T-scores (standardized scores with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10). The formula used was:

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), immediate posttest (Week 16), delayed posttest (Week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants choose which car they saw at the center of the screen, and also locate where a &quot;Route 66&quot; sign appeared in the periphery. This is a measure of useful field of view and visual processing speed. As participants master the task, it is made more difficult via: (a) distractors are added, (b) distance from the center increases, (c) cars get more similar, and (d) backgrounds get more complex. Score is in milliseconds. As participants improve, the cars and road signs flash for fewer milliseconds, giving them a lower (better) score. Thus LOWER SCORES are indicative of IMPROVEMENT.
These scores have been converted to T-scores (standardized scores with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10). The formula used was:

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), immediate posttest (Week 16), delayed posttest (Week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants watch two patterns that &quot;sweep&quot; in or out and identify their direction. The test measures visual processing speed. As participants master the task it is made more difficult via: (a) the colors of the sweeps change, (b) the direction of the sweeps change, and (c) the thickness of the bars change. Participants' scores are in milliseconds. As participants improve, the visual sweeps speed up, giving participants a lower (better) score. Thus LOWER SCORES are indicative of IMPROVEMENT.
These scores have been converted to T-scores (standardized scores with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10). The formula used was:
T-score = ((((participant score minus sample mean at baseline) / (sample standard deviation at baseline) ) * 10) + 50)</description>

    <measure>Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), immediate posttest (Week 16), delayed posttest (Week 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The TIADL consists of five timed instrumental activities of daily (TIADL) tasks. The score that is generated is the total time required to perform the tasks (e.g., finding a telephone number, making change, finding and reading the ingredients on a can of food, finding food items on a shelf, reading instructions on medicine container). Thus LOWER SCORES are indicative of IMPROVEMENT.
These scores have been converted to T-scores (standardized scores with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10). The formula used was:

Exergames: Participants experience Wii Video Games in a standardized format, beginning with 15 mins of seated play per day on week one, and then increasing 5 mins./week on each week following up to a maximum of 40mins. of play.
Participants are made aware of the Target Heart Rate Zone for the week, but are not required to reach that zone during play. The THR is calculated by the Karvonen Formula:
THR={(max. heart rate- rest heart rate) x %intensity} + resting heart rate
Polar Heart Rate monitors are used to measure THR and save resulting data.
Participants also received cognitive training every fourth week. See &quot;Cognitive Training&quot; arm for description.</description>

        <description>Participants identify the bird that is different from the others as it flashes briefly on screen. The test measures visual speed and precision. The test is adaptive, and becomes more difficult with practice in that bird pairs get more similar, backgrounds get more complex, and distance from the center increases. The raw score is in milliseconds. As participants improve, the birds flash for fewer milliseconds, giving them a lower (better) score. Thus, LOWER SCORES reflect IMPROVEMENT
These scores have been converted to T-scores (standardized scores with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10). The formula used was:

        <description>Participants watch two patterns that “sweep” in or out and identify their direction. The test measures visual processing speed. As participants master the task it is made more difficult via: (a) the colors of the sweeps change, (b) the direction of the sweeps change, and (c) the thickness of the bars change. Participants' scores are in milliseconds. As participants improve, the visual sweeps speed up, giving participants a lower (better) score. Thus LOWER SCORES are indicative of IMPROVEMENT.
These scores have been converted to T-scores (standardized scores with an average of 50 and standard deviation of 10). The formula used was:

Exergames: Participants experience Wii Video Games in a standardized format, beginning with 15 mins of seated play per day on week one, and then increasing 5 mins./week on each week following up to a maximum of 40mins. of play.
Participants are made aware of the Target Heart Rate Zone for the week, but are not required to reach that zone during play. The THR is calculated by the Karvonen Formula:
THR={(max. heart rate- rest heart rate) x %intensity} + resting heart rate
Polar Heart Rate monitors are used to measure THR and save resulting data.
Every fourth week, participants will complete Cognitive Training. See Cognitive Training arm for details.</description>

          <description>Participants will complete 80 mins/day during the 4th, 8th, 12th and 16th weeks of the intervention.
Cognitive Training: Posit Science INSIGHT program games are used for all cognitive training. Participants are exposed to (2) forty minute game sessions per day, for the cognitive training weeks #4,8,12,16.
INSIGHT Assessments are done at baseline, the start of each training week and at week 28.</description>
