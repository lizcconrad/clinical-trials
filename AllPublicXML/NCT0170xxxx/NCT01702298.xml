          <description>Change from baseline in HDL-C was measured as a percent change from baseline at Week 6 based on LDA model including percent change from baseline as response variable and term time.</description>
          <population>FAS defined as all participants who took at least one dose of study medication and had both baseline and post-baseline measurements. One participant, who had no on-treatment data, was excluded from the FAS for the LDA analysis of HDL-C.</population>
