  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if the Eye Drop Guide more effective than carefully instructed routine
      technique for chronic glaucoma patients to self-instill eye drops.

      And what factors are associated with the failure of self-instillation eye drops with the Eye
      Drop Guide?

      The participants are randomized into 2 groups. For group I; the participants will be
      instructed to use the Eye Drop Guide first while for group II; the participants will be
      instructed to use the routine self-instillation technique first. The instruction will be
      given to all participants by the same investigator. The participants are allowed to practice
      until confidence in the techniques to which they are assigned. The participants then are
      instructed to use only that technique to instill eye drops in both eyes every day and keep
      the diary to document the date, time of practice, and number of bottles use in each eye for
      practice at home. The investigators make a telephone visit at 1 week to remind the practice
      routine and the follow up schedule. The 2 week follow up will be scheduled to evaluate the
      self-instillation performance using the techniques to which they are assigned by the VDO
      recordings under the same setting as Day 1.

      After VDO recordings the participants will be switched to receive the other technique with
      the same instruction as the other group. Allow the same period of practice in the hospital
      and at home. The investigators again will make a 1-week telephone visit and 2-week follow up
      after self-practice at home. At week 4 the VDO recordings of self-instillation performance
      will be taken again under the same setting as previous records.

    <description>Wash the hands.
Shake and then uncap the bottle.
Hold the bottle between the thumb, index, and/or middle finger of the dominant hand.
Use the lower lip of the cup to pull the lower lid down like what they normally do with the fingers.
Then place the upper lip down to cover the whole orbital rim area.
Tilt the head back if seated or standing.
Insert the bottle in the device all the way. Hold the bottle gently.
Look upward.
Squeeze the bottle one drop at a time until feel one drop instilled into the eye.
Close the eye 2-3 minutes.
For the non-seeing eye (best-corrected visual acuity â‰¤ 20/400) the participants should insert the bottle in the device before cover the eye then proceed with head tilt and look upward.</description>

    <description>Wash the hands.
Shake and then uncap the bottle.
Hold the bottle between the thumb, index, and/or middle finger of the dominant hand.
Lie down or tilt the head back if seated or standing.
Using the other hand, pull the lower lid down.
Hold the bottle over the eye and look up.
Squeeze the bottle one drop at a time until feel one drop instilled into the eye.
Close the eye 2-3 minutes.
For the participants using more than one medication after instilling one bottle the participants should wait 3-5 minutes between administering different medications in the same eye.</description>
