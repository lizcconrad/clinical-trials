  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of a lidocaine topical anesthetic (numbing cream) for
      reducing discomfort associated with Ultherapy™ treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a full face and neck Ultherapy™ treatment. Thirty (30) minutes
      prior to treatment, a topical anesthetic (numbing cream) will be applied to one side of the
      face and neck and a placebo cream with similar consistency and color will be applied to the
      other side of the face and neck, in a randomized fashion. The subject and investigator or
      sub-investigator performing Ultherapy™ treatment will be blinded to the side to which the
      topical anesthetic is applied. Pain scores will be collected following treatment of each
      section of the face and neck on both sides. Subjects will return for a 90-day post-treatment
      visit to assess improvement in skin laxity, and overall lifting and tightening of skin.
