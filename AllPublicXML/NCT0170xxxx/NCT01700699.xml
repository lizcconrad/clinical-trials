  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Background: BRAFV600E is the most frequent oncogene in differentiated thyroid cancer
           (DTC) occurring in about 50% of cases. Clinical trials with tyrosine kinase inhibitors
           (TKI) with specific activity against BRAF in metastatic radioiodine-resistant DTC
           (MRR-DTC) are ongoing. Very recently it has been demonstrated that DTC often consists of
           a mixture of tumor cells with wild-type and mutant BRAF. The subclonal occurrence of
           BRAFV600E in MRR-DTC could disable the therapy with BRAF targeted TKI and be responsible
           of the frequent defeats of this treatment. A therapeutic strategy based upon BRAF
           inhibitors in tumors bearing subclonal BRAFV600E could be initially successful hitting
           the tumor cells expressing the oncogene, and after the initial tumor growth arrest
           and/or shrinkage, the oncogene negative cells insensitive or less sensitive to the
           treatment, could restart the growth of the tumor causing the progression of the disease
           and the escape from the clinical response.

        -  Aims: To determine the impact of subclonal BRAFV600E on the efficacy of BRAF inhibitors
           in the treatment of MRR-DTC.

        -  Study design: Primary tumor tissues will be analyzed for the presence of BRAFV600E by
           pyrosequencing or other quantitative assay. If available, synchronous metastases and
           post-therapy metachronous metastases will be analyzed as well. The clinical response
           will be determined according to RECIST, and the association with the percentage of
           BRAFV600E alleles will be evaluated. Attention will be paid to the possible difference
           of BRAFwild-type/BRAFV600E ratio between primary tumors and synchronous metastases,
           primary tumors and post-therapy metachronous metastases, and between responsive and
           resistant synchronous tumor lesions.
