    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of deferasirox in patients with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia
      based on change in liver iron concentration from baseline after 52 weeks of treatment. To
      provide further assessment of the long-term efficacy and safety of deferasirox in NTDT
      patients with iron overload (LIC ≥ 5 mg Fe/g liver dw and SF ≥ 300 ng/mL) for up to 260
      weeks.

    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of deferasirox in patients with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia
      based on change in liver iron concentration from baseline after 52 weeks. Also, to evaluate
      the impact of deferasirox on the quality of life for adults and pediatric patients; correlate
      changes in serum ferritin and LIC, evaluate efficacy changes in NTDT syndrome, evaluate
      higher doses of deferasirox, assess endocrine function and examine PK parameters.To also
      assess the efficacy of treatment in patients with very high LIC (&gt;15 mg Fe/g dw) at baseline
      and those who need re-treatment after having reached the target LIC &lt; 3 mg Fe/g dw during the
      study.

    <description>Absolute change from baseline at 52, 104 and 156 weeks. The SF-36 is a self-administered questionnaire for adults (from 18 years of age) and contains 36 items which measure: Physical functioning, Role limitation due to physical health problems, Bodily pain, General health perseptions, Vitality, Social functioning, Role limitations due to emotional problems, General mental health and Health change over the past year.</description>

    <description>Absolute change from baseline at 52, 104 and 156 weeks. The PedsOL is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (13 to 18 years). The approach includes both a child self-report and a parent proxy-report. The 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales encompass the essential core domains for pediatric health related quality of life measurement: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and school functioning.</description>
