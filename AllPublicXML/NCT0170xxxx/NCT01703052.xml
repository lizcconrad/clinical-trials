  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      inhaled CHF 6001 after single and multiple doses in healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in a single centre and will consist of a single dose part and a
      multiple dose part.

      Seven single doses of CHF 6001 will be administered according to an escalation, alternate
      cross over scheme. Five multiple doses of CHF 6001 will be administered for 7 days according
      to a sequential escalation scheme.
