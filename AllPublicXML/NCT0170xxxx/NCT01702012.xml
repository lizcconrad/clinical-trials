    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:• Gender: Men and women are eligible

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Diabetes mellitus will be determined by medical records,
             current treatment, verification from personal health care provider, or test results
             meeting the 2010 American Diabetes Association criteria of fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dl,
             symptoms of hyperglycemia with casual plasma glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl or two-hour plasma
             glucose ≥200 mg/dl after a 75 gram oral glucose load. Individuals who have a clinical
             history strongly suggestive of type 1 diabetes will be excluded. Individuals taking
             oral hypoglycemic medication with diet and exercise are eligible. Subjects taking
             insulin will not be eligible for entry into the study.

          -  Body mass index: Overweight and obese individuals, with body mass index 25 - 40 kg/m2,
             are eligible. Weight loss is recommended for overweight diabetic participants with one
             or more cardiovascular risk factors.

          -  Age: Individuals older than 21 years are eligible.

          -  Ethnicity: All ethnic groups are eligible for the study.

          -  Blood pressure: AMDIT will enroll individuals whose blood pressure is under at least
             moderate control. For safety purposes, moderate control will be defined in this study
             as systolic values under 160 mm/Hg and diastolic values under 100 mm/Hg. Individuals
             whose blood pressure exceeds these levels during screening will be advised to seek
             treatment and may be re-evaluated following initiation of antihypertensive treatment.

          -  Glycemic control: AMDIT will enroll individuals whose HbA1c is between 7.5 and 10%.
             Individuals whose HbA1c exceeds this level may require more urgent care and will be
             told to seek treatment and may also be re-evaluated for inclusion.

          -  Lipid control: Individuals with a fasting triglycerides concentration less than 500
             mg/dl are eligible.

          -  Willingness to participate: Participants must be willing to be randomized to either
             Almased or the Lifestyle Intervention and to follow the protocol to which they have
             been assigned. Individuals must be willing to modify their diet and their activity if
             they are assigned to the Lifestyle Intervention.

        study staff;
