  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a large scale, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial with
      four parallel arms. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of affected meridian
      acupuncture for patients with mild hypertension,with respect to decreasing their blood
      pressure, safety of acupuncture ,and improving their quality of life as well.

    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to recruit 428 hypertensive patients. Eligible patients will be randomized
      to four different groups.ⅰ. the affected meridian acupuncture group (AMA, n=107) will be
      treated with acupoints on affected meridians.ⅱ.the non-affected meridian acupuncture group
      (NMA, n=107) will be treated with acupoints on non-affected meridians.ⅲ.invasive sham
      acupuncture group(ISA, n=107)will be provided with sham acupoints treatment.ⅳ.waiting-list
      group(WL, n=107)will not be given any intervention.

    <description>Two types of acupuncture are given, one is acupuncture at affected meridian points, the other is at non-affected. For the first type, We select the acupoints from the affected meridians.Patients in this group are divided into two subgroups according meridian syndrome differentiation(jue-yin style,yang-ming style).Patients pertaining to Jue-yin-style are treated with taichong (LR3), renying(ST9), taixi(KI3), neiguan(PC6) .Patients pertaining to Yang-ming-style: taichong(LR3), renying(ST9), zusanli(ST36), quchi(LI11). For the second,We select the acupoints from the non-affected meridians.Patients assigned into the non-affected meridian acupuncture group will be treated with Fengchi (GB20), waiguan(SJ5), yinlingquan(SP9), xuehai (SP10).</description>

On the ulnar side of the arm, half way between the epicondylus medialis of the humerus and the ulnar side of the wrist.

    <description>In each session, acupuncture are applied bilaterally. Except the acupoints around the neck(ST9.GB20.non-acupoints 4) ,6 auxiliary needles will be punctured at 2mm lateral to each acupoints or non-acupoints.as to auxiliary needle we will not do any manipulation. We use transcutaneous electric acupoints stimulation to stimulate the acupoints and non-acupoints.</description>
