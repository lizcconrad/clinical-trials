      The investigators will recruit active ankylosing spondylitis patients for injection treatment
      of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (a prospective, open-label, masculine medicine
      controlled(NSAIDs), clinical trial), and collect their Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte (PBMCs)
      and sera before and after the treatment of 24 weeks to test the gene expression profiles and
      study related pathogenesis of AS
