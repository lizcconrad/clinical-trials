    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the appropriate dosing regimen of GS-9820 in subjects with
      lymphoid malignancies. This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study
      evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of GS-9820.

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall safety will be assessed by overall safety profile, enumeration and description of any dose-limiting toxicities, serious adverse events, or adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug.</description>

    <description>Participants will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels to receive GS-9820 administered twice a day. Escalation will proceed to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest tested dose associated with a rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of &lt; 33% during the first 4 weeks of therapy.</description>
