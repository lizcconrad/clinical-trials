  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the new ingenol derivative gels are as safe as
      and as well tolerated as ingenol mebutate gel when applied to AK lesions on the forearm for
      two consecutive days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various concentrations of new ingenol derivatives will be applied to AKs on the forearms.
      Reactions and safety will be compared to a US registered and marketed ingenol gel to
      ascertain if the new ingenol is at least as safe and as well tolerated as the registered
      ingenol.
