  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the west. The disease caused by high
      intra ocular pressure (IOP) and characterized by damage to the optic nerve and gradual loss
      of visual field. Intra ocular pressure change during the day. To evaluate the efficiency of
      the therapy it is common to measure the intra ocular pressure at different times of the day.
      Most ophthalmologists admit the patient for one day at which intra ocular pressure is
      measured at different times. This method does not mimic the patient daily routine and may not
      reflect the true diurnal fluctuations.

      For this reason some ophthalmologists measure the intra ocular pressure at different times
      and at different days. It is not known if both methods give similar diurnal curves.

      A study physician will install anesthetic eye drops and will color the eye drops film with
      fluorescein. Study physician will use tonometer to measure the intra ocular pressure in each
      eye. This is a standard procedure done in any ophthalmological examination. Each patient will
      undergo intraocular pressure examination at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00.

      In the first day intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00, same day
      measurements. The day after intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, two days after at
      12:00 and three days after at 16:00. One month later the patient will undergo another serious
      of intra ocular pressure measurements.

      In the first day intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00, same day
      measurements. The day after intra ocular pressure will be measured at 8:00, two days after at
      12:00 and three days after at 16:00.

      The relationship between the two diurnal curves will be analyzed.
