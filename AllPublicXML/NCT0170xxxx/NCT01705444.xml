  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute urinary retention is considered one of the most common problems in the older age,
      especially those who have benign prostatic hyperplasia. Solving the problem of acute urinary
      retention using the Foley catheter still causes problems at the level of patient movement and
      the daily exercises. However, with the emergence of a new device, the spanner, investigators
      believe that many of the above mentioned problems can be resolved. This tool may provide more
      freedom for the patient.

      This research comes up to date with technological innovations in the field of health where
      investigators want to evaluate the efficacy of a new catheter (The Spanner) to reduce the
      acute urinary retention and to determine whether they are consistent with the daily life of
      the patient, compared to the Foley catheter previously used.

      The study include all patients with acute urinary retention due to prostatic obstruction.
      Subjects were excluded if they had prior surgery for prostate cancer, had any other urethral
      or bladder surgery, or if they were at high risk of developing bladder or kidney stones The
      study will be national community based study conducted in different hospitals in Saudi
      Arabia. Investigators will test two different types of stents in patients with acute urinary
      retention for a short period (not exceeding five days), find out the compatibility of these
      stents with the daily life of the patient and determine their impact on his quality of life
      using an appropriate questionnaire after each use.

    <description>A Foley catheter will be inserted for 3-5 days, then a voiding trail will be attempted by the patient himself without the catheter. Then, the Spanner will be inserted into the same patient for another 3-5 days and an evacuation trail will be attempted also by the patient after removal of the Spanner. Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ) will be applied by the same person to the patient twice, once after removal of the Foley catheter and the second after removal of the Spanner.</description>
