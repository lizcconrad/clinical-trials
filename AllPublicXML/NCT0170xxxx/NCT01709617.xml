  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrates are an integral component of sports nutrition. Providing carbohydrate (CHO)
      during exercise delays the onset of fatigue and improves exercise performance by maintaining
      high rates of CHO oxidation. Traditionally, glucose, or glucose polymers have been the
      preferential CHO source found in sports drinks. However, during the intestinal absorption of
      large amounts of glucose (&gt;1.2 g/min), sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLT1) may
      become fully saturated, potentially limiting the rate of exogenous CHO oxidation. In an
      effort to evade this limitation, research has suggested using multiple transportable
      carbohydrates in the composition of sports drinks. Multiple transportable carbohydrates are
      combinations of simple sugars that use different intestinal transporters during the
      absorption process. Ingesting multiple transportable carbohydrates may enhance the capacity
      for total intestinal CHO absorption, leading to an increase in the rate of exogenous CHO
      oxidation. Our purpose will be to examine the disaccharide sucrose in it's ability to provide
      exogenous fuel during and following prolonged exercise.
