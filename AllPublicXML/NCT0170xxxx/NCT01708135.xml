    <textblock>
      This current study aims to evaluate the efficacy of engagement modules in preparing patients
      for bariatric surgery. With the help of the Center for Innovation (CFI), a smartphone app
      (Android and Apple compatible) has been created that will assist in both educating and
      engaging patients to develop and maintain healthy lifestyle modifications. Our goal is to
      create a cost-effective, smartphone-based platform that serves to not only efficiently
      educate but to also verify competence and keep our patients engaged during the lengthy
      pre-bariatric surgery process.

    <description>All subjects will complete a Bariatric Surgery Questionnaire consisting of 30 questions that assess their knowldege in areas of nutrition, physical activity, and bariatric surgery. They will also be given a questionnaire on physical activity (International physical activity questionnaire or IPAQ). The primary objective is to assess improvement on both of these questionnaires with use of app.</description>
