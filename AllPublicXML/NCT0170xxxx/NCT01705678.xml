  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence that dietary supplementation with fish oil has health benefits,
      especially in respect of some of the known risk factors for cardiovascular (heart) disease
      such as cardiac arrhythmia. However, supplies of fish oil are limited, and it is desirable to
      validate alternative sustainable sources of the important omega−3 fatty acid components. It
      has been suggested that oil from krill, which are small marine crustaceans, may be as
      effective or possibly more beneficial than fish oil, and may provide a more effective and
      beneficial supplement. Dietary management of cardiovascular health parameters (such as blood
      lipids)is becoming more and more important as the rising trends in obesity nationally and
      worldwide are leading to escalating incidence of diabetes and heart disease. The
      investigators propose to use some specific novel lipid measurements of cardiovascular risk to
      test this possibility in a group of men who, although generally healthy, show some risk
      factors in terms of their weight and metabolic profile.This pilot study will provide
      preliminary data to show whether krill oil has similar or different effects from fish oil on
      the cardiovascular health of overweight but otherwise healthy men, and in particular will
      provide detailed information on alterations in novel lipid markers of cardiovascular disease,
      which may be a better diagnostic tool than classical lipid measurements (e.g. serum
      cholesterol). The investigators have been developing and validating new techniques to measure
      emerging lipid markers of cardiovascular risk accurately and will continue to develop and
      investigate these techniques during the course of this project. The investigators hypothesise
      that krill oil will be more efficacious in reducing markers of risk relating to
      cardiovascular disease.
