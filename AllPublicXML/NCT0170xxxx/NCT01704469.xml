    <textblock>
      Opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) is most broadly defined as a state of nociceptive
      sensitization caused by exposure to opioids. In humans, the evidence of OIH is strong but
      conflicting. Previous clinical studies mostly used experimental or non-standardized surgical
      stimuli to assess OIH. We therefore sought to certify a presence of OIH using a standardized,
      clinical pain stimuli in cancer patients receiving opioid therapy and opioid-naive patients.

    <description>The local anesthetic injection before main procedure was performed by one pain physician using a 25-gauge needle and 1 ml of 1% lidocaine to raise a small skin wheel. Before and immediately following the injection, patients were asked to rate injection-specific pain and unpleasantness intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS).</description>
