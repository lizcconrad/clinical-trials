  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the safety and maximum tolerated dose of brentuximab
      vedotin when given with tacrolimus and methotrexate after unrelated allogeneic donor stem
      cell transplant in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or
      myelodysplastic syndromes. The addition of brentuximab vedotin to tacrolimus and methotrexate
      may result in a significant reduction of graft versus host disease in these patients.

    <time_frame>37 days</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity; Hematologic DLT is defined as ANC &lt; 500/mm3 for three consecutive days beyond Day +21 that was determined by the investigator to be likely related to brentuximab vedotin.
Non-hematologic DLT is defined as any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity that was determined by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to brentuximab vedotin, with the following specific exceptions:
Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, or fatigue thought to be associated with conditioning regimens
Grade 3 rash will only be considered a DLT for patients who have received two weeks of supportive care treatment with no improvement.</description>
