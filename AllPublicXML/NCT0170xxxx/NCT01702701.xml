      This study will compare response to treatment of Eosinophilic Esophagitis with montelukast vs
      standard therapy fluticasone. Investigators hypothesize that montelukast is equally effective
      in treating symptoms and histology of EoE when compared to fluticasone. The study will be
      conducted at multiple sites with Medical College of Wisconsin as the coordinating site. After
      identification and recruitment all patients will be randomized (provider blinded) to one of
      two medications: montelukast 10mg po qday vs fluticasone 440mcg po bid. Patients will also
      complete a pretreatment, 6 week therapy and 12 week therapy questionaire. They will then
      undergo a repeat endoscopy to evaluate endoscopic and histologic response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis is an allergic condition of the esophagus with an incidence that is
      on the rise, and has limited treatment options. Current gold standard of treatment is with
      topical steroids (swallowed fluticasone). There is preliminary data that oral montelukast may
      prove to be effective in inducing and maintaining symptomatic along with histologic remission
      of this disease. Investigators will be comparing the effectiveness of singulair to swallowed
      fluticasone in inducing and maintaining histologic and symptomatic remission of eosinophilic
      esophagitis.
