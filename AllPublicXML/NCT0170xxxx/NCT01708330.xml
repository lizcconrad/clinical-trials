  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient requires a manual vacuum aspiration (MVA), whether for an undesired pregnancy,
      missed abortion, or other nonviable pregnancy, she is undergoing an emotional experience. She
      is grieving the loss of her pregnancy, and is then faced with the anxiety of an invasive and
      often painful procedure. Minimizing the pain during this procedure must not be overlooked.
      There have been no randomized controlled trials evaluating pain control during MVA for
      nonviable pregnancy, and the data is mixed regarding analgesia for MVA for an elective
      abortion or other office procedures.

      Women being treated at the Women &amp; Infants Triage who have experienced a first trimester
      missed abortion, inevitable abortion, incomplete abortion or other nonviable pregnancy and
      are being treated with an outpatient manual vacuum aspiration will be asked to enroll in this
      study. Those who wish to participate will be randomly assigned to treatment with lidocaine
      gel or a placebo gel applied to the cervix during their procedure.

      The hypothesis is that topical lidocaine will decrease pain during manual vacuum aspiration.
