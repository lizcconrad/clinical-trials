  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, single-sequence, crossover, drug-drug interaction (DDI)
      study to assess the effect of the CYP1A2 inhibitor, fluvoxamine, on the PK of dovitinib in
      patients with advanced solid tumors, excluding breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of a CYP1A2 inhibitor, 100 mg fluvoxamine, on the PK of dovitinib when
      administered at a dose of 300 mg on the dosing schedule, 5 days on/2 days off. The study will
      consist of 2 phases: a Pharmacokinetic (PK) phase and a clinical treatment phase. The DDI
      test will be conducted in the PK phase. The DDI test will assess the steady state PK profile
      of dovitinib when administered alone and in the presence of the CYP1A2 inhibitor, fluvoxamine
      (AUC 0-24h, AUC 0-72h and Cmax parameters). During the clinical treatment phase patients may
      continue to receive treatment with TKI258 until disease progression (assessed by RECIST 1.1),
      unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other
      reason.
