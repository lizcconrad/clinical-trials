    <measure>Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time [AUC (0 - 8)]</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8). For dacomitinib and PF-05199265</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration [AUC (0-t)]</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-t)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to time of last quantifiable concentration (0-t).For dacomitinib and PF-05199265</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>AUC is a measure of the serum concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption. For dacomitinib and PF-05199265</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. For dacomitinib</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed. For dacomitinib</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half. For dacomitinib</description>
