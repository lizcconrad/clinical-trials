      The association between obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has mostly been studied
      using broad endpoints or have focused on cause-specific mortality. The investigators aim to
      compare the effect of body mass index (BMI) on different types of initial presentation of
      CVD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has many detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system that can manifest in a
      range of clinical presentations. Many of these are mediated by frequently coexisting
      conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia but there are also direct,
      progressive effects on the arteries and the heart muscle. As evident from autopsies, even
      from early adulthood the degree of coronary artery disease (CAD) correlates with the BMI and
      particularly the amount of abdominal fat. The multiple mechanisms by which obesity exerts its
      effects are still being elucidated.

      Previous studies have assessed the effect of obesity on cause-specific mortality. Here the
      investigators analyze association of BMI with the first symptomatic presentation of
      cardiovascular disease across any phenotypes, to which the investigators refer to as &quot;initial
      presentation&quot; to distinguish from first presentation within a specific phenotype. For
      example, an initial presentation with myocardial infarction is an MI which is not preceded by
      stable angina, ischemic stroke or any other phenotype, rather than the first MI in a possible
      series of MIs, as is commonly used in other studies.

      Adjustments The key risk factor of interest is baseline BMI, which the investigators define
      as the most recent measurement of BMI recorded up to 2 years prior to cohort entry date. BMI
      will be analyzed based on the following categories: underweight (&lt;18.5 kg/m2), healthy (18.5
      to 24 kg/m2), overweight (25 to 29 kg/m2), moderately obese (30 to 34 kg/m2), morbidly obese
      (&gt;35 kg/m2). The healthy BMI category will be used as the reference in regression models.

      Associations with BMI will be adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, social deprivation, smoking,
      diabetes, and systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol (TCHOL) and high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (HDL). All baseline covariates will be obtained from within a 2 year window prior
      to study entry.

      Statistical analyses Cause-specific Cox models will be used to measure the association
      between BMI categories and endpoints of interest. Multiple imputation will be used to replace
      missing values in prognostic factors. The investigators will estimate lifetime risk for each
      endpoint over time adjusting for competing risks.

    <description>We will report findings from the CALIBER (CArdiovascular disease research using Linked BEspoke studies and Electronic Records) collaboration where we linked primary care data (from the General Practice Research Database [GPRD]) to three further sources of electronic health records: the Myocardial Ischemia National Audit Project registry (MINAP),cause specific discharge data from Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) and cause specific mortality from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</description>

        The cohort we will use in the present analysis has been drawn from patients across 225
        practices in England contributing data to GPRD, covering approximately 5% of the UK
        population (Figure 1). The study period is 1st January 2001 to 25th March 2010 (the date of
        the last GPRD data submission). To allow time for medical history and risk factors to be
        measured and recorded we require that patients enter the cohort after having completed at
        least 1 year of registration with their current practice during which the practice provides
        data that meet research quality criteria. Patients are followed up from the date they
        become eligible to be included in the cohort until the earliest date among a) the date of
        an initial presentation with one of the endpoints of interest, b) the date of leaving the
        practice or c) the date of last data submission from their practice.
