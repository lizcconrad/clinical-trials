  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of a psychoeducational memory program versus a
      computerized memory program in individuals with mental illness. Although improvements are
      expected with both form of interventions, we do not know which will provide maximal benefit
      in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to compare two memory strategies, a top-down (i.e.,
      educational and interventional)protocol vs. a bottom-up (computerized)protocol, in a
      population of individuals diagnosed with mental illness. Performance on ecologically
      validated memory tasks will be measured before and after each intervention protocol.
      Improvements are expected following each protocol. However, there is no evidence available to
      support added benefits from one protocol over another. As such, the current study will
      endeavour to contrast the two intervention types (top-down vs. bottom-up) to determine which,
      if any, provides maximal benefit.
