    <textblock>
      Cognitive aging is a major source of disability in an increasingly aging population. The
      paucity of effective treatments for cognitive aging disorders, and most importantly in
      Alzheimer's disease instigates a need for further research into novel therapeutic
      possibilities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and its
      prevalence steeply increases. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in neuropsychiatric disorders
      and in particular in Alzheimer's disease has been shown to cause significant cerebral damage.
      Early effective therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is critical in order to
      prevent or at least retard neuropathological progression that will lead to widespread
      irreversible neuronal loss and significant cognitive dysfunction. Riluzole, a glutamate
      modulator agent that is a proven safe medication and has not yet been used in cognitive aging
      disorders, will be tested in mild Alzheimer's disease patients. Cognitive functional changes
      along with two established in vivo biomarkers, namely, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)
      and Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) will be evaluated.

      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be performed. Forty-eight
      individuals with a diagnosis of mild Alzheimer's disease between 60-85 years old will
      complete the study. There will be two cohorts of 60-75 and 75-85 years old that will be
      age-matched. All forty-eight individuals will have been on donepezil, which is FDA approved
      for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, at a dose of 5mg or 10mg per day for at least 3
      months prior to consenting and will remain on the drug throughout this study. Twenty-four
      mild Alzheimer's disease patients will receive riluzole and another 24 will receive a placebo
      (the placebo tablets will be generated at the Rockefeller University's pharmacy by the
      research pharmacist). All patients will have a neurological evaluation and neuropsychological
      tests performed to confirm that they meet criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease set out
      by the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's disease Association that recently revisited
      the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and to have mild Alzheimer's disease.
