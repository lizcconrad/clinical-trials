  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to document the demographic and clinical characteristics and
      the long-term clinical outcomes of patients who require a robot assisted knee arthroplasty.

      The hypothesis is that MAKO® robot assisted surgery replacing one or two compartments of the
      knee joint has 10 year implant survival and clinical outcomes that are equivalent to other
      knee replacement systems.

    <measure>American Knee Society Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks prior to surgery, 1-2 weeks after surgery, 4-6 weeks after surgery, 10-12 weeks after surgery, 6 months after surgery, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The American Knee Society Score is an assessment and questionnaire that provides a rating of the pain, function, range of motion, and knee joint stability. It is subdivided into a knee score that rates only the knee joint itself and a functional score that rates the patient's ability to walk and climb stairs.</description>

    <description>The Reduced WOMAC is a truncated version of the Western Ontario and McMaster's University Osteoarthritis Index. The questionnaire is designed to assess pain, disability and joint stiffness in the osteoarthritis patient.</description>
