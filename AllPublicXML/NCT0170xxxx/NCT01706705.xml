      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) images can better help to plan internal radiation treatment.

      Treatment planning for patients with cervical cancer treated at MD Anderson is usually
      performed based on x-ray films taken while the patient is under anesthesia in the operating
      room. In this study, you will have an MRI and CT scan performed after recovering from
      anesthesia in addition to the standard x-rays. In order to allow MRI images to be taken,
      special MRI compatible applicators will be used. The CT and MRI images will be reviewed by
      the doctor in charge of radiation treatment and will also be used for research purposes.

      Study Procedures:

      If you agree to take part in this study, an applicator made of a material that can be used
      during an MRI will be used.

      You will have a CT scan and an MRI scan performed after the implant is placed in the
      operating room. The CT scan should take about 20 minutes and the MRI about 55 minutes. These
      scans will be performed after you wake up from general anesthesia. Pain medicine will be
      given if you feel any discomfort from the placement of the implant.

      The additional scans will be used to confirm appropriate placement of the applicator and may
      result in small adjustments to your radiation treatment plan.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation on this study will be complete once you have the CT and MRI scans.

      Your medical record may be reviewed after the scans for the purposes of the study, but you
      will not be contacted in the future.

      This is an investigational study. The applicator that best fits your personal anatomy will be
      used in this study. A selection of MRI compatible applicators are available. Many of the MRI
      applicators that will be used are FDA approved. However, in some cases you may have a novel
      device with a moveable shield placed. This applicator is not FDA approved or commercially
      available.

      Up to 57 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <measure>Comparison of 3D Image Guided Treatment Planning to 2D Treatment Planning for Brachytherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The goal is to determine if 3D image guided treatment planning allows for improved tumor coverage while respecting normal tissue constraints as compared to standard 2D treatment planning. To address this, the D90 (or the dose to 90% of the HR-CTV volume) and maximally irradiated 2 cc of the bladder (D2 cc bladder) and rectum (D2 cc rectum) will be compared. The quality of the brachytherapy treatment plans will be determined according to dosimetric parameters for the target volumes as well as organs at risk.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) Women with stage greater than or equal to IB2 cervical cancer treated with definitive
        chemoradiation or radiation therapy who require intracavitary brachytherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient or tumor anatomy that requires use of a non-MRI-compatible applicator.

          2. Patients who require interstitial brachytherapy.

          3. Patients whose treating physician feels that they require additional 3D imaging at the
             time of implant based on physical exam or initial findings.

          4. Patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, pacemaker or other implanted
             device, which precludes MRI acquisition.
