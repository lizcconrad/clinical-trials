  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose-escalating phase Ib study with an
      expansion cohort will determine the recommended Phase II dose and schedule to investigate
      safety, tolerability, and activity of RO5083945 in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine
      or carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung
      cancer of squamous histology who have not received prior chemotherapy for the metastatic
      disease. Cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of RO5083945 in combination with
      up to 6 cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine or carboplatin and paclitaxel. Anticipated time
      on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

          -  Recent history of poorly controlled hypertension (systolic &gt;180 mmHg or diastolic &gt;100
             mmHg)

          -  Severe uncontrolled illness, including poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and active
             or uncontrolled infection
