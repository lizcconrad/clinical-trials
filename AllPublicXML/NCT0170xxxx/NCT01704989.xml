  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of large clinical trials have found pseudoexfoliation (PXF) to be a major risk
      factor for glaucoma progression and risk of blindness. It is estimated that PXF accounts for
      approximately a quarter of cases of open angle glaucoma in Nova Scotia, Canada, making this
      region an ideal setting for studying patients with this condition. Despite associated high
      morbidity, the treatment of pseudoexfoliative glaucoma remains suboptimal and a challenge for
      the clinician. Topical medical therapy is less effective than for primary open angle glaucoma
      and patients often require early surgical therapy, with associated risks. Selective laser
      trabeculoplasty (SLT) may be a safe and effective treatment for pseudoexfoliative glaucoma,
      although the evidence for this is presently lacking. The aim of the current study is to
      provide the first controlled-trial evidence for the effectiveness of SLT, compared to topical
      therapy, in the management of pseudoexfoliative glaucoma.

      Objectives:

      The primary aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness, in terms of intraocular
      pressure (IOP) control, of SLT and topical medical therapy in the primary treatment of
      patients with high IOP secondary to PXF. The secondary aims of the study are:

        1. To examine the relationship between the degree of angle pigmentation and reduction of
           IOP

        2. To examine adverse effects from SLT treatment in patients with PXF

        3. To compare IOP-lowering effects of SLT in patients with PXF to patients with POAG (in
           the LiGHT study, see structure below).

      Study Population: All new patients with PXF who are naïve to treatment (and willing to
      participate) will be recruited after their first hospital consultation. Both eyes will be
      treated but only one eye per patient included in the analysis (eye with the higher presenting
      IOP).

      Structure: The study design mirrors that of National Institute of Health (NIHR-) funded, the
      laser in glaucoma and ocular hypertension trial (LiGHT) in the UK and is a collaborative
      study between a Canadian Institute and Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. This is a
      single-study randomised (unmasked) control trial of a proposed treatment intervention (SLT)
      versus a standard treatment (topical therapy).

      Summary of study design Patients will be randomised to one of 2 trial arms: 'laser-pathway'
      or 'medicine- pathway'. Following initial treatment, SLT patients will be followed up 1-2
      weeks after treatment to check IOP and for potential side effects. The interval of subsequent
      follow-up visits (between 4 and 12 months) will be governed by the level of IOP in relation
      to the target IOP and the severity of glaucoma. Visual field testing (SITA standard, 24-2
      test pattern) and imaging with the Hedidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT III) will be performed
      at each visit. Target IOP will be set using the Canadian Glaucoma Society guidelines
      depending on the severity of glaucoma and the level of IOP. At subsequent visits, treatment
      will be escalated if the target IOP is not met or if there is evidence of progression.

      Duration of study The study will last 3 years. One year will be allowed for recruitment of
      all study participants, so that a minimum follow-up of 2 years will be available.

      All patients will have a medical history, gonioscopy, central corneal thickness (CCT)
      measurement, IOP measurement with Goldmann applanation tonometry and dilated fundoscopy at
      the baseline visit.

    <description>At the first treatment, SLT treatment will be delivered to 360 degrees of trabecular meshwork. At the first escalation of treatment, the superior 180 degrees will be retreated. Twenty-five non-overlapping shots per quadrant will be used with a starting power of 0.8 mJ and increments of 0.1 mJ (titrated to avoid large bubbles) with standard other settings (400 nm spot size, 3 nanosecond duration) using a Latina single-mirror goniolens. The IOP will be checked 1 hour post treatment and five days of guttae acular tds will be administered to the treatment eye following treatment. After 2 treatments of SLT, the laser treated arm of the study will follow the same pathway as the medical treatment arm.</description>

    <description>Treatment will be initiated with latanoprost 0.005%. At the first IOP check (1-2 months), if the IOP has not reached target IOP, a second line agent will be added (β-Blocker unless contraindicated). If target IOP is still not reached, a third agent will be considered (topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor). Treatment may be switched, instead, at the discretion of the clinician if the reduction of IOP with an agent is deemed to be no different than the pre-treatment IOP. Surgical therapy will be considered if target IOP is not met, or there is high IOP (&gt;35 mmHg) or advanced damage at presentation.</description>
