      The present study will evaluate the long term effects on scar formation for dermatome-induced
      skin wounds treated with Collagenase Santyl® Ointment or vehicle (white petrolatum ointment)
      alone. The previous study, 017-101-09-001, utilized a small, experimental, cutaneous wound to
      evaluate both time to complete wound closure and quality of the resulting scar when
      Collagenase Santyl® Ointment was used to treat the wound.
