    <textblock>
      A 6 months prospective, randomized, multicenter, controlled, parallel-group, open-label study
      in RRMS patients to assess the impact of an individualized patient support program (PSP) on
      treatment satisfaction and to evaluate whether this individualized support improves
      satisfaction and with it adherence to medication compared to standard care.

          2. Male or female subjects aged 18 - 65 years.

          3. Subjects with relapsing remitting MS defined by 2010 revised McDonald criteria.

          4. Patients with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-6.5.

          5. Patients under Fingolimod Therapy, according to German label, for at least 6 months at
             Study Visit 1 (Day 1).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria are not eligible for inclusion in this
        study:

          1. Patients, who are registered in any patient support program (e.g. Extracare)

          2. Patients with any relevant medically unstable condition, as assessed by the primary
             treating physician at each site.

          3. Any severe disability or clinical impairment that can prevent the patient to meet all
             study requirements at the investigator's discretion

          4. History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5
