  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In addition, cancer is
      associated with high rates of depression and anxiety among its sufferers, and cancer patients
      with depression usually have worse treatment outcomes and long-term survival. Surprisingly,
      many cancer patients with depression do not receive treatment for their depression, perhaps
      because treatments for cancer-related depression are usually adapted from those used in
      non-cancer populations and may not be suitable for cancer patients. Moreover, cancer patients
      with depression are more likely to have a long latency of anti-depressant drug action,
      negative drug-drug interactions with cancer chemotherapies and an increased susceptibility
      for systemic side effects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new
      treatment modality for depression that affects the brain directly with no systemic side
      effects and poses no potential for drug-drug interactions. rTMS therapy was recently cleared
      by the FDA as an antidepressant treatment for treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder,
      and now is being evaluated for a wide array of additional psychiatric indications. This
      randomized, open label, two-arm, pilot study will investigate the safety, tolerability,
      feasibility and the efficacy of two forms of rTMS (i.e., left (fast) and right (slow) sided
      rTMS) in cancer-related depression. The study hypotheses are that rTMS will significantly
      reduce symptoms of depression and that right-sided slow rTMS will be more effective than
      left-sided fast rTMS for the treatment of severe anxiety.

             release - IR - formulation) donepezil, psychostimulants (ex. methylphenidate),
             theophylline and/or other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold. For individuals on
             any of these medicines, a study clinician will evaluate the drugs and doses to
             determine the risks and benefits. These will then be discussed with the individual's
             Primary Care Physician to determine if the individual should be excluded from the
