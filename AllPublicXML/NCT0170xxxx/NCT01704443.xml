    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the efficacy of a 4-session intervention (Group psychoeducational
      treatment) using a randomized study design. Participants will be randomized in to 'immediate
      treatment' or 'waitlist control'. Women in the wait-list condition will receive the 4-session
      IMPROVED treatment, just as women randomized to the experimental group, after the end of
      their wait-list period.

    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>one week pre-treatment to one week post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be measured with the Q-tip test- a standard method of diagnosing vestibulodynia and assessing the pain associated with the diagnosis. The Q-tip test involves the physician lightly touching a Q-tip to specific areas around the vulvar vestibule while the patient indicates how much pain they feel on a scale from 0-10 in response to this provoked touch.</description>

    <description>Women in the Immediate treatment arm will receive the Group Psychoeducational treatment in the next available group. There will be 8-9 womenper group and each session will be 2.25 hours in duration and there will be 4, bi-weekly sessions over the course of 2 months. Session content includes education about chronic pain, PVD, stress and sexual response, mindfulness practices, and cognitive techniques to notice thought patterns that contribute to increased pain.</description>
