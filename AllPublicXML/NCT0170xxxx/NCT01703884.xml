    <textblock>
      The program's overall objective is to assess the impact of a package of interventions aimed
      at reducing malaria-related mortality and morbidity in pregnant women and newborns by
      ensuring access to a package of interventions designed to optimise the detection and
      treatment of malaria during pregnancy as well as improving the early detection and treatment
      of malaria during the third trimester.

      This is a cluster-randomised study in which the health facility is the unit of randomisation.
      16 health facilities will be randomised to intervention and control. At the community level
      women will be encouraged to access ANC early in the pregnancy, attend follow-up antenatal
      visits throughout the pregnancy and deliver at the facility. The current recommended standard
      of care will be provided to all women attending antenatal and obstetric care. In the
      intervention area, obstetric, medical, drug-exposure histories will be collected at ANC
      visits. In addition, in the last trimester of the pregnancy (&gt; 28 weeks of pregnancy), women
      will be systematically evaluated with selected diagnostic test for whether they have malaria
      parasites and treated effectively. Skilled birth attendants at the facility will be trained
      in emergency obstetric and neonatal care and the assessment of neonates for danger signs, low
      birth weight and external/observable birth defects. In the control area, women will be
      provided with standard practice of care. In both areas, women will be diagnosed and treated
      at delivery if they are positive.
