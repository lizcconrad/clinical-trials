  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of treadmill training (TT), with and
      without a strengthening component, on functional mobility, gait and quality of life in
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The rationale for a study of this type stems from the
      hypothesis that treadmill training may act as an external &quot;pacemaker&quot; and enhance some
      properties of gait. There is a need for larger scale randomized controlled trials comparing
      the effects of treadmill training to control groups that receive similar amounts of
      attention. To date, no study has combined TT and muscle strengthening, likely the optimal
      form of therapy. A kinesiologist supervises the training, 3 times per week, for a total of 72
      one-hour exercise sessions. It is hypothesized that at the end of 6 months, treadmill
      training will considerably improve walking parameters and the well being of people with PD.

    <description>3 sessions/week, 24 weeks. The heart rate does not exceed 75% of maximum heart rate (220-age) of the participant and that blood pressure does not exceed 250/115 mmHg. During the first week, the TT velocity was adjusted to 80% of preferential walking speed of the participant. The following week, the participant was encouraged to reach 90% and 100% in the third week. From the fourth week, subjects in the Speed TT had an increase in speed, depending on exercise tolerance of each participant. The TT velocity was increased by 0,2 km/h when the participant reached criteria.</description>

    <description>Training of the control group was characterized by light intensity exercises. For the first three months, participants performed regular exercise involving full range of motion to enhance their flexibility. For the last three months of the training programme, participants learned elements of Tai Chi and rhythmic movements of latin dance. Participants attended two 1-h supervised sessions per week and were asked to perform each week a third session at home, based on instructions in a document offered to the control group participants</description>
