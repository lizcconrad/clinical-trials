  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contractures and broad scars of the axilla, anterior chest wall and neck have detrimental
      effects on functional, physical and psychological development of children. Perforator flaps
      have already been shown to be reliable options for the reconstruction of contractures but
      there have been no reports demonstrating the value of preexpanded perforator flaps of
      dorsolateral trunk region in treatment of extensive contractures and scars of pediatric
      patients. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate these techniques by a case series
      formed of pediatric patients with broad scars and contractures of anterior chest wall,
      axilla, neck and breasts. Seven pediatric patients (mean age, 11,6 years) who were treated by
      preexpanded perforator flaps are presented. By this means, clinical experience on intercostal
      artery perforator (ICAP) flap, thoracodorsal artery perforator (TDAP) flap, circumflex
      scapular artery perforator (CSAP) flap and lumbar artery perforator flap was shared. Flaps as
      large as 20,5x10,5 cm in size could be successfully transferred in pediatric patients. Broad
      scar tissues were resurfaced with broad flaps carrying similar characteristics with the
      uninjured anterior chest wall and neck skin in six of our patients. In one patient with
      partial necrosis, full thickness skin graft was used for the residual defect. The mean
      duration of postoperative (after flap transfer) follow-ups was 17,2 months. The preexpanded
      TDAP, ICAP and CSAP flaps are revealed to be useful reconstructive options for the treatment
      of scars and contractures of anterior chest wall, axilla, neck and breast in pediatric
      patients.
