  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remifentanil is a rapid-acting opioid which has been widely used in pain treatment during
      surgery for the last 15 years 1. Remifentanil is rapidly eliminated (minutes) from the body
      after end of infusion, and this makes it easily manageable compared to other opioids.
      However, there are both experimental and clinical studies indicating that remifentanil, after
      end of infusion, triggers increased pain sensation and increased opioid consumption
      post-operatively. Increased post-operative opioid consumption should be avoided due to the
      adverse effects of these drugs (nausea/vomiting, pruritus, dizziness, fatigue and reduced
      respiratory rate). Thus, it's important to investigate relevant strategies to avoid the
      increased pain sensation (opioid-induced hyperalgesia = hypersensitivity to pain stimuli)
      after end of infusion of remifentanil after surgery. Several experimental and clinical trials
      have been conducted in this field. Ketamine has been shown to block this effect, but its
      adverse effect profile (i.a. hallucinations) makes it not suitable in normal clinical use. In
      a study of healthy volunteers, it has been demonstrated that parecoxib (a COX-2 selective
      NSAID) can prevent remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. Our group has previously shown that a
      relatively COX-1 selective NSAID (ketorolac) can prevent hyperalgesia in an experimental pain
      model.

      This is of interest since NSAIDs are frequently administered as premedication before surgery.
      There are several disadvantages associated with the use of COX-2 inhibitors, e.g. the risk of
      myocardial infarction after long-term use (&gt; 1 year), and potentially reduced bone healing
      after orthopedic surgery. However, this has not been shown with short-term use (days/week).
      The disadvantages associated with the use of e.g. ketorolac (a COX-1 inhibitor) are i.a.
      increased bleeding tendency, which is unfavourable for the surgeon, and increased risk of
      gastric ulcer. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate other ways of preventing
      opioid-induced hyperalgesia. In a recent animal study it has been shown that gradual dose
      reduction of remifentanil (vs. abrupt withdrawal of a relatively high remifentanil dose) can
      prevent the development of hyperalgesia after end of infusion. In this study we will i.a.
      investigate whether this is also the case in humans. In this new model, the study
      participants will get remifentanil infusion with two different dose reduction regimes:
      gradual reduction or abrupt withdrawal.

    <description>Two pain models will be used - a heat-pain and a cold-pain model. Testing will be done before, during and after remifentanil infusion. NRS (Numeric rating Scale) will be used for pain scoring.
Heat model:
A computer-controlled Medoc ATS Thermal stimulator (3 x 3 cm) is applied to the left volar forearm at pre-defined areas.
Cold model:
In the cold test the study participant should keep his right hand in circulating cold water (3 ̊C) in up to 90 seconds.
The pain models will be applied during three separate trials using remifentanil infusion with abrupt withdrawal, remifentanil infusion with gradual withdrawal and saline infusion(placebo).</description>
