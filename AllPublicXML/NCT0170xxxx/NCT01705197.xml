      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Avanafil in the
      treatment of erectile dysfunction with moderate to severe in subjects. And, this is to
      additionally confirm the efficacy and safety after initiating treatment with Avanafil 100mg
      and later increasing to 200mg, compared with continuing treatment with Avanafile 100mg, in
      subjects.

    <textblock>
      All subjects, who are judged to be suitable to the clinical trial after 4-week free run-in
      period was completed, should be administered with Avanafil 100mg(study group) or placebo
      100mg(control group) for the first 4 weeks after randomization. When there are no moderate to
      severe adverse events at the 4 weeks evaluation after administration, and when it is decided
      by the researcher that the effect of Avanafil or placebo 100mg against erectile dysfunction
      is insufficient, a dosage increase to 200mg is executed. For subjects with a sufficient
      improvement effect on ED at 100mg, no dosage increase is allowed, and the previous 100mg
      administration should be maintained until the termination of the study.

    <description>When a dose is increased to 200mg because the effect is insufficient after 4 weeks of medication with Avanafil 100mg, it is to evaluate the effect of a dosage increase in IIEF EF domain, SEP Q2 and Q3.
It is to evaluate changes in SEP (Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5), other domains of IIEF (such as OF, SD, IS and OS domain), IIEF Q3, IIEF Q4, MSHQ, rate of subjects who score 26 and over in EF domain, GEAQ of the study group and control group compared to the baseline after 12 weeks post medication.

    <description>This study is designed as a double-blind, stratified randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicenter, dose escalation study. For subjects with moderate to severe ED who have voluntarily signed the consent form, conduct screening and undertake the 4 weeks Free run-in period. For those who satisfy the study criteria during the review of subject's diaries composed during the free run-in period and the evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria at a future visit, drugs for each group are provided after randomized to Avanafil 100mg or placebo 100mg at a ratio of 2:1. At this time, subjects are random stratified to each group depending on their diabetes status.</description>
