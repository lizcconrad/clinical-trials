    <textblock>
      The main purposes of this study are to evaluate the safety (Parts 1 and 2) and efficacy (Part
      2) of pretreatment with CNTO 3157 in healthy adult and asthmatic adult participants before
      and after intranasal (into the nose) inoculation with human rhinovirus type 16 (HRV-16).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by chance),
      double-blind (participants and investigators do not know what study agent is being
      administered), placebo-controlled study. A placebo appears identical to a study agent, has no
      active ingredients, and helps investigators evaluate the effect of a study agent. In Part 1,
      following administration of CNTO 3157 or placebo, the severity of an upper respiratory tract
      infection, due to inoculation with HRV 16, will be assessed in healthy participants for
      safety reasons. In Part 2, following administration of CNTO 3157 or placebo and inoculation
      with HRV-16, efficacy and safety will be assessed in asthmatic participants using standard
      assessments to evaluate asthma treatments. The study (Parts 1 and 2) will be completed when
      the last participant completes the last visit (Week 11) in Part 2.

    <time_frame>Up to 10 days after inoculation with HRV-16</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ is an instrument designed to evaluate asthma control. Seven items are scored on a 7-point scale (0=good control, 6=poor control) with the mean score as an overall summary score. Questions 1-6 are completed by the patient; the last item is entered by site personnel and corresponds to the patient's percent predicted FEV1 categorized according to the 7-point scale. Higher scores reflect poorer control.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Cold Symptom Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical symptoms to HRV-16 will be assessed by using the Cold Symptom Assessment Score, wherein participants will report the presence and severity of their cold symptoms in the context of the previous 24 hours via an interactive interview with the study staff. The symptoms consist of nasal congestion (stuffy nose), rhinorrhea (runny nose), sore throat, sneezing, cough, headache, malaise (feeling run down, tired) and chilliness. Severity is rated using a 5 point scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe). Scores can range from 0-32, with higher scores indicating more symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Cold and Chest Symptom Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cold and Chest Symptom Scale contains 15 items composing 2 domains, a total cold score and a total chest score. Together, these 2 domains comprise the chest symptom assessment score.
Total Cold Score domain: sneezing, runny nose, blocked or stuff nose, sore throat or hoarse voice, headache or face pain, generally unwell, chills, fever or shivery and cough and Total Chest Score domain: cough on waking, wheeze on waking, daytime cough, daytime wheeze, daytime chest tightness, daytime breathlessness and nocturnal cough, wheeze and breathlessness.
Severity is rated using a 5 point scale: 0 using a 5 point scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, and 4=very severe). Scores can range from 0-60, with higher scores indicating more symptoms.</description>
