  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the potential association between finasteride
      (MK-0906) exposure and the development of breast cancer in men residing in Denmark, Sweden,
      Finland, and Norway from data in national registries. The primary hypothesis of this study is
      that the previously reported increased incidence of male breast cancer among finasteride
      users is explained by confounding factors.
