    <textblock>
      Psoriatic nails can significantly affect a quality of life of patients. Psoriasis affects
      both nail matrix and nail bed. Pitting, leukonychia and red spots in lunula indicate a defect
      in the nail matrix. Psoriasis can change the nail bed as the results in onycholysis,
      discoloration, splinter hemorrhage and subungual hyperkeratosis. The main treatment of
      psoriatic nails is using topical high- potent steroids however topical steroids are limited
      their ability to penetrate deep nail matrix or nail bed which are the main pathology. Use of
      such a treatment can lead to skin atrophy and report in the case of &quot;Disappearing digits&quot;.
      Previous studies of steroid injection in the treatment of psoriatic nails show satisfactory
      results without any serious permanent adverse effects. At present, there is no comparison
      study between intralesional steroid and ultrapotent topical steroid for the treatment of
      psoriatic nails.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intralesional
      triamcinolone comparing to 0.05% clobetasol ointment in the treatment of psoriatic nails.

      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder. The nails involvement has been reported up to
      40% of psoriatic patients. Psoriatic nails can significantly affect a quality of life of
      patients. Psoriasis affects both nail matrix and nail bed. Pitting, leukonychia and red spots
      in lunula indicate a defect in the nail matrix. Psoriasis can change the nail bed as the
      results in onycholysis, discoloration, splinter hemorrhage and subungual hyperkeratosis. The
      main treatment of psoriatic nails is using topical high- potent steroids however topical
      steroids are limited their ability to penetrate deep nail matrix or nail bed which are the
      main pathology. Use of such a treatment can lead to skin atrophy and report in the case of
      &quot;Disappearing digits&quot;. Previous studies of steroid injection in the treatment of psoriatic
      nails show satisfactory results without any serious permanent adverse effects. At present,
      there is no comparison study between intralesional steroid and ultrapotent topical steroid
      for the treatment of psoriatic nails.
