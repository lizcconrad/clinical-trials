      We hypothesize that the combination treatment with deferasirox and deferiprone will be well
      tolerated and will result in significant improvement in cardiac and liver iron levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Death and disability from iron related damage to the heart remain the most serious issue
      facing transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia. However, over the past decade there
      have been several reports of improved survival and fewer cardiac complications. This
      improvement may be related to the availability of three chelators and also the accurate
      measurement of iron stores in various organs (e.g. heart and liver) with magnetic resonance
      imaging, which allows for personalized, tailored medical care for patients. The chelator
      characteristics, side effect profiles, and ability to remove iron from specific organs differ
      among the chelators, suggesting that combination therapy may be beneficial. Using two drugs
      at lower doses may be more tolerable than escalating doses of a single drug and may improve
      iron removal. The combination of deferoxamine and deferiprone has been shown to be
      particularly beneficial for reducing cardiac iron, but it requires a painful
      injection/infusion, which hinders adherence. This pilot study aims to investigate the safety
      of an oral-only combination chelator regimen (deferasirox and deferiprone) in individuals
      with thalassemia major with poorly controlled iron overload and to assess how well this
      chelator combination lowers iron stores over one year.
