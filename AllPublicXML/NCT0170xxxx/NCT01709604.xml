  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paraquat poisoning is characterized by multiple organ failure and pulmonary fibrosis with
      respiratory failure. Accumulating evidence suggested that continuous venovenous
      hemofiltration (CVVH) had a beneficial role in the treatment of multiple organ dysfunction.
      The investigators hypothesized that CVVH might restore multiple organ function and reduce the
      high mortality rate of paraquat poisoning. To confirm it, an prospective clinical study would
      be carried out.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paraquat (1,1 '-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridylium dichloride) is widely used as a herbicide.
      Accidental or intentional ingestion of paraquat is common in many developing countries such
      as China, Sri Lanka and Korea because of easy access. The high mortality rate of paraquat is
      due to its high toxicity and the lack of effective treatments. Thus, the paraquat poisoning
      becomes one of major medical problem in the developing countries.

      Paraquat poisoning is also one of major causes of death among young patients with acute
      poisoning in China. It is characterized by multiple organ failure and pulmonary fibrosis with
      respiratory failure. A growing body of evidence suggested that continuous venovenous
      hemofiltration (CVVH) had a great beneficial role in the treatment of multiple organ
      dysfunctions. We hypothesized that CVVH might reduce the high mortality rate of paraquat
      poisoning via restoring the multiorgan function, such as acute hepatic lesion, acute kidney
      injury, acute lung injury and acute pancreatic injury. We expect to enroll 100 patients from
      our hospital within 1 week after oral intake of paraquat. All patients were divided into
      Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 were treated with a standardized therapeutic regimen including
      stomach lavage, emergency haemoperfusion and drugs. Group 2 were accepted with standardized
      treatment plus CVVH. The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of CVVH for the treatment of patients with paraquat poisoning. The survival
      rate, clinical manifestations and clinical parameters between these two groups were compared.

    <time_frame>at 6 months after paraquat poisoning</time_frame>
    <description>CVVH treatment efficacy was assessed by the following measurements:
Mortality rate: compared the difference between standardized therapy and CVVH treatment.
Number of organs involved in paraquat poisoning such as lung,kidney,liver and heart.
Degree of organ injuries
CT scan of lung
Biomarkers:
1)Oxidative stress: blood superoxide dismutase(SOD),malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT).
2)Proinflammatory factors: interleukins(IL-2,IL-6,IL-8 and IL-10) 3)Kidney function:serum cystatin C and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and N-acetyl-β-(D)-glucosaminidase activity (NAG),kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin(NAGL) and urinary retinol-binding protein(RBP),etc.
4)Heart damage markers: cTnT，MYO，creatine kinase-MB(CK-MB) and brain natriuretic peptide(BNP).</description>
