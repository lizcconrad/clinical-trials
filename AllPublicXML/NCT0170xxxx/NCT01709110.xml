    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of participation in this study is to answer whether teriparatide is
      superior to risedronate in reducing the occurrence of new vertebral fractures during 24
      months of therapy.

    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of new vertebral fractures was assessed by quantitative vertebral morphometry measurements (QM) with qualitative visual semiquantitative grading (SQ) confirmation.
A new vertebral fracture was diagnosed in a vertebra that was non-fractured at the baseline radiological examination. It was defined as a loss of vertebral body height of at least 20% and 4 mm from the baseline radiograph by vertebral QM, based upon placement of six points by a trained, central reader. Any fractures identified by QM were confirmed using SQ: if the vertebral body also had an increase of one or more severity grade, it was considered an incident vertebral fracture.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Participants With Pooled New and Worsening Vertebral Fractures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Worsening of a pre-existing fracture was considered if the decrease in vertebral height was at least one severity grade in the semi-quantitative assessment, confirmed by a trained central reader, where vertebrae were graded as normal (SQ0) or as with mild (SQ1), moderate (SQ2), or severe (SQ3) fractures, defined as ~20 to 25% (mild), ~25 to 40% (moderate) or ~40% or more (severe) decrease in anterior, central, or posterior vertebral height (T4 to L4).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants With Pooled Clinical Vertebral and Non-Vertebral Fragility Fractures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical vertebral fracture was defined as a new or worsening vertebral fracture, confirmed by radiography, that was associated with signs and symptoms highly suggestive of a vertebral fracture.
All non-vertebral fractures that occurred and were diagnosed between visits required the confirmation by the site investigators after evaluating the original x-ray film(s), the radiology or surgical report. For clinical vertebral fractures, the final confirmation of the diagnosis required the centralized evaluation by a trained, independent reader.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants With Non-Vertebral Fragility Fractures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A non-vertebral fracture is a fracture at any of the following non-vertebral sites: clavicle, scapula, ribs, sternum, sacrum, coccyx, humerus, radius, ulna, carpus, pelvis, hip, femur, patella, tibia, fibula, ankle, calcaneus, tarsus, and metatarsal. Non-vertebral fractures were determined by direct questioning at each visit, and confirmed by the site investigators by x-ray, radiology or surgical report. Fractures resulting from a severe trauma such as a traffic collision, a beating, or having been struck by a falling or moving object were not considered fragility fractures but traumatic fractures.</description>

    <description>A major non-vertebral fracture is a fracture at any of the following non-vertebral sites hip, radius, humerus, ribs, pelvis, tibia and femur.

    <description>Vertebrae were graded as moderate (SQ2), or severe (SQ3) fractures, based on ~25 to 40% (moderate) or ~40% or more (severe) decrease in anterior, central, or posterior vertebral height (T4 through L4).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated the worst back pain during the 24 hours preceding the visit at baseline and each post-baseline visit. An 11-point numerical back pain rating scale (rated from 0 = no back pain to 10 = worst possible back pain) was used.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 24 Months Endpoint in the European Quality of Life Questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L] (UK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument completed on five dimensions to measure health-related quality of life. The profile allowed participants to rate their health state in five health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using a five level scale (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems). The responses are used to derive the health state index scores using the United Kingdom (UK) algorithm, with scores ranging from -0.59 to 1.0. A higher score indicates better health state.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With New Vertebral Fractures</title>
        <description>The incidence of new vertebral fractures was assessed by quantitative vertebral morphometry measurements (QM) with qualitative visual semiquantitative grading (SQ) confirmation.
A new vertebral fracture was diagnosed in a vertebra that was non-fractured at the baseline radiological examination. It was defined as a loss of vertebral body height of at least 20% and 4 mm from the baseline radiograph by vertebral QM, based upon placement of six points by a trained, central reader. Any fractures identified by QM were confirmed using SQ: if the vertebral body also had an increase of one or more severity grade, it was considered an incident vertebral fracture.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With Non-Vertebral Fragility Fractures</title>
        <description>A non-vertebral fracture is a fracture at any of the following non-vertebral sites: clavicle, scapula, ribs, sternum, sacrum, coccyx, humerus, radius, ulna, carpus, pelvis, hip, femur, patella, tibia, fibula, ankle, calcaneus, tarsus, and metatarsal. Non-vertebral fractures were determined by direct questioning at each visit, and confirmed by the site investigators by x-ray, radiology or surgical report. Fractures resulting from a severe trauma such as a traffic collision, a beating, or having been struck by a falling or moving object were not considered fragility fractures but traumatic fractures.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument completed on five dimensions to measure health-related quality of life. The profile allowed participants to rate their health state in five health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using a five level scale (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems). The responses are used to derive the health state index scores using the United Kingdom (UK) algorithm, with scores ranging from -0.59 to 1.0. A higher score indicates better health state.</description>
