  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study serves to determine whether the treatment of patients with stable, symptomatic
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with the investigational drug NVA237 is
      efficient and safe. The efficacy and safety of the drug will be tested against a placebo
      treatment.

      The primary criterion to assess efficacy will be the difference between the serial lung
      function measurements of patients who have been treated for 12 weeks with NVA237 versus those
      that have received placebo treatment for 12 weeks. A serial lung function measurement (FEV1
      testing) will be conducted and the &quot;area under the curve&quot; will be the measure for the ability
      to breathe.

    <description>The standardized Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) post dosing (FEV1 AUC) at week 12 of treatment. Serial lung function measurements are taken at various time points following dosing at week 12 to calculate the AUC.</description>

    <description>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) is the mean of FEV1 at 23h 15min and 23h 45min after the morning dose of the previous day. Pre-dose trough FEV1 is the mean of FEV1 at -45min and -15min before morning dose</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in FEV1 AUC (0-12H) at Day 1 and FEV1 AUC (0-4h), AUC (4-8h), AUC (8-12h) at Day 1 and Week 12 (Day 85)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Week 12 (Day 85)</time_frame>
    <description>The standardized Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) is assessed for different time spans within the overall serial measurement post dosing (FEV1 AUCs Time Spans), at day 1 and at week 12 of treatment. Serial lung function measurements are taken at various time points post dosing on day 1 and at week 12 to calculate the AUC for these different time spans.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Health Status Assessed by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The health status, as reported by the patients, is assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The SGRQ is a 50 item scale assessing symptoms, patient activities and impact of the disease. Scores range from 0 to 100 units, with higher scores indicating more limitations. The assessment is based on total score as well as the percentage of patients with clinically significant improvement at week 12 versus day 1. A clinically meaningful improvement (MCID) in SGRQ is defined as a decrease of 4 or more units of the SGRQ scale in the total score, as compared to baseline (change from baseline).</description>

    <description>The health status, as reported by the patients, is assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The assessment is based on total score as well as the percentage of patients with clinically significant improvement at week 12 versus day 1. A clinically significant improvement in SGRQ is defined as less than or equal to -4 change from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Breathlessness Assessed by Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Breathlessness at week 12 is measured using the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI). On day 1, breathlessness is assessed by the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). Patients are considered to have clinically significant improvement with the TDI score change versus BDI being equal to or greater than 1. TDI focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. Each domain is scored from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline of Daily Symptom Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients reported symptoms using an electronic diary.The diary has 9 symptom questions each am and each pm. Each question can be answered w/1 of 4 pre-defined answers, with a unit value of 0-3, 0 is least &amp; 3 is most severe symptom.Symptom scores are calculated as the mean of combined daily symptom scores(combined from am &amp; pm)for each patient over 12 weeks. The baseline is calculated from the run-in epoch prior to randomization.The change from baseline is in LS mean daily symptom scores over the 12 weeks. If the mean score over the 12 weeks is lower than the baseline, result is (-).A neg. result indicates an improvement in COPD symptom severity. Patients may have met the min. response requirements for the night scores(am questions),but not for the day scores(pm questions)or vice versa, the # of patients analyzed can vary between both day &amp; night scores. Therefore, the # of patients analyzed for the combined daily symptom score can vary from the #s for individual day &amp; night scores.</description>

If the mean score over the 12 weeks is lower than the baseline, result is (-).A neg. result indicates an improvement in COPD symptom severity. the # of patients analyzed can vary between both day &amp; night scores.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Status Assessed by St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The health status, as reported by the patients, is assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). The SGRQ is a 50 item scale assessing symptoms, patient activities and impact of the disease. Scores range from 0 to 100 units, with higher scores indicating more limitations. The assessment is based on total score as well as the percentage of patients with clinically significant improvement at week 12 versus day 1. A clinically meaningful improvement (MCID) in SGRQ is defined as a decrease of 4 or more units of the SGRQ scale in the total score, as compared to baseline (change from baseline).</description>

        <title>Breathlessness Assessed by Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Breathlessness at week 12 is measured using the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI). On day 1, breathlessness is assessed by the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). Patients are considered to have clinically significant improvement with the TDI score change versus BDI being equal to or greater than 1. TDI focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. Each domain is scored from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9. Higher numbers indicate a better score.</description>

        <description>Patients reported symptoms using an electronic diary.The diary has 9 symptom questions each am and each pm. Each question can be answered w/1 of 4 pre-defined answers, with a unit value of 0-3, 0 is least &amp; 3 is most severe symptom.Symptom scores are calculated as the mean of combined daily symptom scores(combined from am &amp; pm)for each patient over 12 weeks. The baseline is calculated from the run-in epoch prior to randomization.The change from baseline is in LS mean daily symptom scores over the 12 weeks. If the mean score over the 12 weeks is lower than the baseline, result is (-).A neg. result indicates an improvement in COPD symptom severity. Patients may have met the min. response requirements for the night scores(am questions),but not for the day scores(pm questions)or vice versa, the # of patients analyzed can vary between both day &amp; night scores. Therefore, the # of patients analyzed for the combined daily symptom score can vary from the #s for individual day &amp; night scores.</description>
