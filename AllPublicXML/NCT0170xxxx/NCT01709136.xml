      Pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus and Sirolimus alone and in combination in liver transplant
      recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplant patients receiving tacrolimus, and who experience side effects such as
      hypertension and renal dysfunction, will be converted to sirolimus with low-dose tacrolimus,
      or Tacrolimus withdrawal. This study will evaluate allograft function by serial clinical lab
      testing, the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus and tacrolimus, the glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR) and the potential side effect of sirolimus, such as marrow suppression and
      hyperlipidemia. Two pharmacokinetic evaluations are planned: once around the third
      post-transplant month and another one at about 12 months. Expected outcomes are, a better
      understanding of sirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters over time in pediatric/adult liver
      recipients and early efficacy and safety data of the sirolimus as a non-nephrotoxic
      alternative to tacrolimus.

Patients will receive a single dose of SRL of 2 mg/m2. Blood sampling will be performed over a 24 hour stay in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh's Pediatric Clinical and Translational Research Center (PCTRC) - See more at: http://www.chp.edu/research/our-facilities/pctrc, and the sampling for 48 hour and 72 hour PK studies can be done at the outpatient lab. This phase can either be performed immediately after the 12-hour iothalamate GFR evaluation, or a few days later at the convenience of the subject.</description>
