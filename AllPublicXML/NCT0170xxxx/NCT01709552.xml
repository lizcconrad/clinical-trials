    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to target co-occurring problems of substance use and intimate
      partner violence (IPV) using a computer-based intervention, B-SAFER (Brief intervention for
      Substance use and partner Abuse for Females in the Emergency Room). This project will develop
      and test the computer-based intervention, examining primary outcomes of substance use and
      utilization of relationship safety resources.
