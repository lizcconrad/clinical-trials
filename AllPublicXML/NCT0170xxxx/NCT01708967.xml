      1. Check of the medical history (both method)

             1. underlying systemic disease

             2. drug allergy

             3. anticoagulant or antiplatelet use

        2. Premedication (both method)

             1. taking premedication contain dimethylpolysiloxane, pronase, sodium bicarbonate for
                improved endoscopic visualization

             2. spraying naphazolin acetate into nasal cavity for decrease secretion

        3. Different anesthetic method for transnasal endoscopy

             1. &quot;Catheter-free method&quot; : spraying epinephrine into nasal cavity

             2. &quot;Catheter-insertion method&quot; : spraying both epinephrine and lidocaine into nasal
                cavity

    <description>Catheter-free method : The patient then takes simethicone (10cc). After that, the nasal cavity is sprayed with epinephrine (1cc) and lidocaine HCL (4%, 4cc).
Catheter inesertion method: After preparation steps the same as in the 'catheter-free' method, a 14 Fr. flexible catheter is coated with 2% lidocaine HCL gel and 8% lidocaine HCL spray. After that, the catheter is inserted into the patient's nasal cavity, and maintained about 1 minute for anesthesia. A 16 Fr. catheter is prepared by the same method with as the 14Fr. catheter. After the 14 Fr. cathter has been removed from the patient's nasal cavity, the 16 Fr. catheter is inserted into the patient's nasal cavity.</description>

Intervention: one-time spray of epinephrine (1cc) plus 4% lidocaine (4cc)
pretreatment method for transnasal endoscopy : one-time spray method : patients are given simethicone (5cc) and lidocaine (2%, 10cc). After that, epinephrine (1cc) and lidocaine (2%, 3cc) are injected in both nose and mouth. Lastly, buscopan Intra Muscular (IM) is injected.
spray+catheter method: patients are given simethicone (10cc). Next, epinephrine and lidocaine (4%, 4cc) are injected in both nose and mouth. Following this step, benoxinate hydrochloride (5cc) is inhaled by the patients. Subsequently, the patients are catheterized for 10 minutes using the 7Fr. Nelaton catheter.

Intervention: one-time spray of epinephrine (1cc) plus 4% lidocaine (4cc)
pretreatment method for transnasal endoscopy : one-time spray method : patients are given simethicone (5cc) and lidocaine (2%, 10cc). After that, epinephrine (1cc) and lidocaine (2%, 3cc) are injected in both nose and mouth. Lastly, buscopan Intra Muscular (IM) is injected.
spray+catheter method: patients are given simethicone (10cc). Next, epinephrine and lidocaine (4%, 4cc) are injected in both nose and mouth. Following this step, benoxinate hydrochloride (5cc) is inhaled by the patients. Subsequently, the patients are catheterized for 10 minutes using the 7Fr. Nelaton catheter. Finally, buscopan IM is injected.</description>

          <title>Success Rate of Transnasal Endoscopy</title>
          <description>We difine the success of transnasal endoscopy as follows: the pateint underwent transnasal endoscopy without signicant complaint nor side effects.
We difine the failure of transnasal endoscopy as follows: the patient cannot tolerate insertion of the endoscope; the patient presents side effects such as epistaxis, pain, or a decrease in O2 saturation; and the endoscope cannot pass through the nasal or oral cavity.</description>
