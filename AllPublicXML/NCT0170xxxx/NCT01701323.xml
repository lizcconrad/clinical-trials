    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies infusion of laboratory-grown donor cord blood cells
      following combination chemotherapy in treating younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      that has returned or that does not respond to treatment. Chemotherapy drugs work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Chemotherapy also kills healthy
      infection-fighting cells, increasing the risk of infection. The infusion of laboratory-grown
      cord blood cells may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by
      chemotherapy. This may decrease the risk of infection following chemotherapy, and allow for
      more chemotherapy to be given so that more cancer cells are killed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety of infusing &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched
      expanded cord blood cells as supportive care following administration of fludarabine
      phosphate, cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG) consolidation or reinduction chemotherapy in
      pediatric and young adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute leukemia of
      ambiguous lineage.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the kinetics of autologous recovery when compared to historical cohorts.

      II. Assess the ability of the product to provide transient myeloid engraftment/recovery.

      III. Examine the in vivo persistence of the ex vivo expanded cord blood cells by determining
      the kinetics and durability of potential engraftment.

      IV. Develop understanding of the underlying immune interaction between the patient (host) and
      the infused expanded cord blood cells (donor) by performing in vitro analyses to assess
      host-mediated rejection of the non HLA-matched expanded cells.

      V. Estimate the incidence of clinically significant infections (e.g. bacterial, viral, or
      fungal) observed in patients treated with FLAG consolidation or reinduction chemotherapy
      followed by &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; non-HLA matched expanded cord blood cells.

      VI. Assess the percentage of patients that achieve complete remission (CR)/complete remission
      with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)/complete remission with partial recovery of
      platelet count (CRp) with this therapy approach.

      VII. Assess long term efficacy (overall survival [OS]/disease free survival [DFS]) of FLAG
      consolidation or reinduction chemotherapy followed by &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; non HLA matched
      expanded cord blood cells in pediatric AML or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage patients
      during long term follow up.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-7,
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes once daily (QD) on days 2-6, cytarabine IV QD over 4
      hours on days 2-6, and ex vivo-expanded cord blood progenitor cells IV over 30 minutes on day
      8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
