    <textblock>
      This will be prospective, multicentre, observational study. Patients who will initiate
      treatment with IFNβ-1b (Betaferon) will be followed up to 6 months. Baseline visit (visit 0)
      i.e. treatment initiation plus four follow-up visits (visits 1-4). For each patient
      demographics, medical history data, safety parameters, presence of flu-like symptoms and
      measures to prevent or treat these symptoms will be collected.
