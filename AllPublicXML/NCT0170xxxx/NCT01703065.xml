    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies cabozantinib in treating men with castration-resistant
      prostate cancer. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      Primary Outcome Measure:

        1. Change in urinary N-telopeptide (uNTX)

           Secondary Outcome Measures:

        2. Changes in dynamic histomorphometry of bone biopsy samples

        3. Changes in serum markers of bone metabolism. Markers of bone metabolism in blood include
           bone specific alkaline phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, LDH.

        4. Changes in biomarker expression in bone biopsy samples. To include MET, AKT, FASN and
           VEGFR2 expression and phosphorylation status (activation) in osteoblasts/osteoclasts and
           prostate cancer cells. Will also include changes in markers of apoptosis, proliferation,
           and angiogenesis.

        5. Changes in miRNA expression in the serial blood samples

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are
      followed up for 4 weeks.

             asymptomatic and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting
             study treatment are eligible. Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain
             biopsy is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment.
             Baseline brain scans are not required to confirm eligibility.)

         10. The subject has prothrombin time (PT)/ International Normalized Ratio (INR) or partial

             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa
             inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (eg, clopidogrel). Low dose aspirin (≤ 81 mg/day),
             low-dose warfarin (≤ 1 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
             are permitted.

             dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin,
             phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort). Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.asp; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.
