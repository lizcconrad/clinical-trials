  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if an electronic dataglove can be used to measure joint stiffness
      in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will use a dataglove to record joint movements in a small number of patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of the study is to find out if changes in dynamic movements
      measured by the glove will correlate with symptoms of joint stiffness in the hands of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

    <measure>Correlation between maximum velocity of movement and the patient reported severity of joint stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Maximum of 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>A significant inverse correlation is expected to be found between the patient's assessment of the severity and/or duration of stiffness and the maximum velocity of movement at the main finger joints.</description>

    <measure>Number of patients withdrawing from the study</measure>

    <description>We are expecting that no more than 30% of patients will withdraw from the study due to discomfort fitting or using the dataglove.</description>
