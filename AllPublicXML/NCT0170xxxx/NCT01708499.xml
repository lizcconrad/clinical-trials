      Enrolled subjects will receive one UltherapyTM treatment on the abdomen. Follow-up visits
      will occur at 90 and 180 days post-treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment,

      This is a prospective, single-center, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the
      Ulthera® System for improving laxity/crepiness and texture of abdominal tissue. Changes from
      baseline in the laxity, crepiness and texture of abdominal skin will be assessed at each
      study follow-up visit. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores, assessments of dermal
      thickness, and patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained.
