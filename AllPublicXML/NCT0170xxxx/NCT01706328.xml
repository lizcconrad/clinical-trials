  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase IIIb multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 12-week
      parallel group study evaluating the effects of once daily in the morning treatment of FF/VI
      Inhalation Powder versus Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol Inhalation Powder twice daily on
      lung function in COPD subjects.

      Subjects will be screened and will enter a 2-week, single-blind (placebo), Run-In Period to
      evaluate the subject's adherence with study treatment, study procedures and assessment of
      disease stability.

      At the end of the Run-In Period, subjects will return to the Clinic and who meet all of the
      Randomization Criteria will be randomized to double-blind study medication (12-week treatment
      period). Subjects will be randomized to receive either FF/VI 100/25 via NDPI or Fluticasone
      Propionate/Salmeterol 250/50mcg via ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Matching placebos will be available in
      NDPI and ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Each morning (approximately 6-10 AM) subjects will take 1
      inhalation from the NDPI followed by 1 inhalation from the ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Each evening
      (approximately 6-10 PM), approximately 12 hours after the morning dose with blinded study
      medication, subjects will take 1 inhalation from the ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Subjects will return
      to the clinic at the end of the treatment period.

      A follow-up phone contact will be performed approximately 7 days after the last clinic visit.
      The overall study duration (Screening to Follow-up) for each subject is approximately 15
      weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline Trough in Weighted-mean 24-hour Serial Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Treatment Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean was calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and the post-dose FEV1 measurements taken at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, and 24 hours on Treatment Day 84. Baseline trough FEV1 was calculated as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and 5 minutes pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. The weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under curve, and then dividing by the relevant time interval. The weighted mean change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements on Day 84 minus the Baseline trough FEV1 value. The analysis used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline FEV1, reversibility stratum, smoking status (at Screening), country, and treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset on Treatment Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset on Treatment Day 1 is defined as the time to an increase of 100 milliliters (mL) from Baseline in FEV1 during the 0- to 4-hour serial measurements (5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes post-dose). Participants who never met or exceeded a 100 mL increase over the Baseline value during the 4-hour serial measurements were censored at the actual time of their last FEV1 measurement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the 24-hour FEV1 assessment, which was obtained on Day 85. Baseline trough was calculated as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and 5 minutes pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the average of the Day 85 values minus the Baseline value. The analysis used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline FEV1, reversibility stratum, smoking status (at Screening), country, and treatment.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Only those participants that started the Double-blind Treatment Period were considered enrolled.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>At Visit 1, participants entered a 2-week, single-blind (placebo) Run-in Period to obtain Baseline assessments of salbutamol use and to evaluate adherence with study treatment and procedures, diary card completion, and assessment of disease stability. At Visit 2, participants were randomized to a 12-week, double-blind Treatment Period.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Placebo + Salbutamol</title>
          <description>Participants were instructed to take single-blind placebo twice a day (one inhalation from a multi-dose powder inhaler [MPI] and one inhalation from a dry powder inhaler [DPI] in the morning; one inhalation from an MPI in the evening). In addition, all participants received supplemental albuterol (salbutamol) (via a metered dose inhaler [MDI] and/or nebules) to be used on an as-needed basis. Ipratropium bromide alone was permitted, provided that the participant was on a stable dose from Visit 1 (Screening) and remained on the stable dose throughout the study; however, ipratropium must have been withheld for 4 hours prior to and during each clinic visit.</description>

        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>FF/VI 100/25 µg QD</title>
          <description>Participants received one inhalation of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25 micrograms (µg) once daily (QD) in the morning from a DPI and placebo twice daily (BID) from a DPI (one inhalation in the morning and one inhalation in the evening) for 12 weeks. In addition, participants were provided supplemental albuterol (salbutamol) inhalation to be used as needed throughout the study.</description>

In addition, participants were provided supplemental albuterol (salbutamol) to be used as needed throughout the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Trough in Weighted-mean 24-hour Serial Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Treatment Day 84</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean was calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and the post-dose FEV1 measurements taken at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, and 24 hours on Treatment Day 84. Baseline trough FEV1 was calculated as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and 5 minutes pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. The weighted mean was derived by calculating the area under curve, and then dividing by the relevant time interval. The weighted mean change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements on Day 84 minus the Baseline trough FEV1 value. The analysis used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline FEV1, reversibility stratum, smoking status (at Screening), country, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Time to Onset on Treatment Day 1</title>
        <description>Time to onset on Treatment Day 1 is defined as the time to an increase of 100 milliliters (mL) from Baseline in FEV1 during the 0- to 4-hour serial measurements (5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes post-dose). Participants who never met or exceeded a 100 mL increase over the Baseline value during the 4-hour serial measurements were censored at the actual time of their last FEV1 measurement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Trough FEV1 on Treatment Day 85</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the volume of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as the 24-hour FEV1 assessment, which was obtained on Day 85. Baseline trough was calculated as the mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and 5 minutes pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the average of the Day 85 values minus the Baseline value. The analysis used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline FEV1, reversibility stratum, smoking status (at Screening), country, and treatment.</description>
