      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether 2 different dosages of a herbal extract
      (240 and 480 mg/day) are more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with
      chronic rhinosinusitis (average reduction of investigator's Major Symptom Score over Visit 5
      and Visit 6.

    <textblock>
      The clinical trial population consists of patients presenting with two or more typical
      symptoms of CRS and duration of symptoms of at least ≥12 weeks. The diagnosis should have
      been confirmed with the initial diagnosis of CRS by nasal endoscopy and/or computer
      tomography (CT) and by obligatory nasal endoscopy including exclusion of nasal polyps during
      screening phase.

      A total of 885 patients will be included in this clinical trial, which will last for
      approximately 12 months, including screening, treatment and medication-free follow-up period
      as well as final reporting. The duration for the individual patient is approximately 22 weeks
      (Visit 1 - Visit 7). After a 2-week screening phase, treatment will be started by application
      of either 240 mg or 480 mg daily dose (t.i.d.) or placebo for 12 weeks followed by a
      medication-free follow-up period.

      Symptoms often do not correlate to the findings in nasal endoscopy or CT. Therefore, efficacy
      in this clinical trial is defined as per clinical definition using five individual
      rhinosinusitis symptoms (MSS)graded by the investigator using increasing severity grading(0 =
      absent [none / not present], 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe).

      Secondary outcome measures include

        -  single rhinosinusitis symptoms of CRS (MSSINV and MSSPAT),

        -  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment patient questionnaire related to General
           Health [WPAI:GH],

        -  total symptom severity by Visual Analogue Scale

        -  response to treatment rated by investigator and patient

        -  20-Question Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-20, only Germany]

        -  percentage of patients with permitted concomitant medication for the treatment of CRS

        -  premature termination due to exacerbations of symptoms

        -  post treatment course of CRS will

        -  pharmacoeconomic assessments

        -  safety and tolerability of trial treatment
