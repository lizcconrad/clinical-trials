      This is an open-label Phase 1a dose escalation study of single-agent OMP-52M51 in subjects
      with relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies. Study includes a dose escalation phase and
      expansion phase. Subjects will be assessed for safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics,
      biomarkers, and efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Lymphoid malignancy that has relapsed or is refractory after two or more treatments
             that are FDA approved or are commonly used clinically.

          2. Subjects must have progressive disease requiring therapy. Subjects who are candidates
             for observation only are not eligible.

          5. Must have received their last chemotherapy, biologic, radiotherapy, or investigational
             therapy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment; 12 weeks from their last
             radioimmunotherapy; 3 months if the last therapy was bone marrow/ peripheral stem cell
             transplant.

          6. Age &gt;18 years

          7. ECOG performance status &lt;2

          8. Normal Ejection Fraction on ECHO scan

          9. Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

             Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000/mL Platelets &gt;75,000/mL For subjects with known marrow
             infiltration, ANC ≥500 and platelets ≥30,000 Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 X institutional
             upper limit of normal (ULN) (&lt;2X ULN for subjects with Gilbert's syndrome) AST (SGOT)
             and ALT (SGPT) &lt;3 X institutional ULN (for subjects with hepatic involvement &lt;5 X
             institutional ULN) PT/INR and aPTT within 1.5 X institutional ULN Creatinine &lt;1.5 X
             institutional ULN OR Creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with
             creatinine levels above institutional normal

         10. Women of childbearing potential must have had a prior hysterectomy or have a negative
             serum pregnancy test and be using adequate contraception prior to study entry and must
             agree to use adequate contraception from study entry through at least 6 months after
             discontinuation of study drug. Men must also agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and
             from study entry through at least 6 months after discontinuation of study drug. Should
             a woman enrolled in the study or a female partner of a man enrolled in the study
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study or within

          6. Pregnant women or nursing women

          7. Ongoing malignancies or malignancies in remission &lt;3 years other than the lymphoid
             malignancies included in this trial. Patients with history of known skin cancers
             including non-melanotic skin cancers within the past 3 years will not be included in
             this trial. The following prior malignancies are allowable irrespective of when they
             occurred: in situ carcinoma of the cervix, in situ ductal breast cancer, and low-grade
             local bladder cancer.
