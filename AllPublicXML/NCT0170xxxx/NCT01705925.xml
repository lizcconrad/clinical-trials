      The purpose of the study is to provide comprehensive follow-up in patients with Long QT
      Syndrome (LQTS) and gain additional information regarding genotype-phenotype correlation and
      effective management and treatment options.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Cardiac Events on patients with genotype positive LQT1 who have a normal EKG and absence of symptoms, but a molecular confirmation of LQT1.</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment is expected to take approximately 5 years. The patients will be followed until they are no longer cared for by a pediatric cardiology facility (typically post-college) or approximately 21 years of age.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Cardiac Events on patients with both phenotype and genotype positive.</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment is expected to take approximately 5 years. The patients will be followed until they are no longer cared for by a pediatric cardiology facility (typically post-college) or approximately 21 years of age.</time_frame>
