      The aim of this project is to investigate fMRI ability to identify pain central sensitization
      in chronic knee OA. Patients with high and low central sensitization and healthy control
      subjects will be included. Central sensitization will be clinically defined based on the
      evidence of regional spread of pain (spreading sensitization) and increased pain response to
      repeated stimulation (temporal summation). Operatively, a patient will be assigned to high
      sensitization group when showing (i) clinical evidence of pain or altered sensations spread
      beyond the knee joint by manual palpation, (ii) a minimum of 3 anatomical sites around the
      knee showing a pressure pain threshold below 4 kg/cm2 (tender points), (iii) pain score of 4
      points or more in a 11-point scale during 4 kg/cm2 pressure stimulation on the
      anterior/medial surface of the tibial bone (the site selected for the fMRI experiment) and
      (iv) increase of at least 1 point in a 11-point scale after 10 repeated pressure stimulation
      on the tenderest point around the knee.

      A three-step strategy is proposed to characterize the phenomenon by assessing (i) brain
      response to direct pressure stimulation on the painful knee, which will reflect the
      combination of peripheral and central sensitization; (ii) brain response to pressure
      stimulation on a non-arthritic hyperalgesic area (i.e., the anterior surface of the tibia),
      which will mostly reflect central sensitization mediated at the spinal cord level, and (iii)
      brain response to moderately painful heat stimulation on a healthy skin area (i.e., volar
      forearm), which will reflect central sensitization occurring in the brain and involving the
      highest-level pain modulatory mechanisms. An additional evaluation is proposed using
      resting-state fMRI to assess potential alterations in baseline brain functional organization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients:

               1. A diagnosis of knee OA and suitable for the study as determined by a responsible
                  physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical
                  examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

               2. Have a radiological and clinical diagnosis of knee OA based upon American College
                  of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (1986) affecting at least one knee of a minimum of
                  3 months in symptom duration prior to screening.

               3. Subject is either male or female and at least 45 years of age.

               4. A minimum of 4 out of 10 on the numerical rating scale (Brief Pain Inventory- BPI
                  item 5) at screening and/ or a requirement for the use of an analgesic for the
                  pain in the OA knee. In addition, baseline pain must be stable for at least 72
                  hours prior to fMRI assessment or fMRI assessment may be delayed.

               5. A maximum of 8 out of 10 on the NRS at screening. Enrolment may be delayed if, in

                  incident.

               6. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing
                  potential.

               7. Body weight &lt;120kg.

                  requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

               9. Subject demonstrates an understanding of the study and a willingness to
                  participate as evidenced by voluntary written informed consent.

          -  Controls:

                  relevantly affect brain function and pain perception.

               4. No clinical evidence of knee OA.

               5. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing
                  potential.

               6. Body weight &lt;120kg.

               7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
                  requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. - Subjects will not be permitted to heavily exercise for 12 hours prior to fMRI
             assessment

          2. - Subjects will be required to refrain from the following treatments: I.- Analgesic
             and anti-inflammatory drugs for 3 days prior to fMRI assessment except for rescue
             medication. Rescue medication will be based on paracetamol (dosed 1g/8h), which in any
             case must be withdrawn for a minimum of 24 h prior to fMRI assessment or the fMRI
             assessment may be delayed.

        II.- Steroid injections into the joint or muscle for three months prior to fMRI assessment
        III.- Hyaluronan injections into index knee within the previous 6 months prior fMRI
        assessment IV.- Non-pharmacological treatments, such as heat wraps or massage for 24 hours
        prior to fMRI assessment.

        V.- Antidepressants not allowed: MAOIs, Tricyclic antidepressants, mixed 5HT &amp; NE reuptake
        inhibitors (eg. Duloxetine). SISR are not allowed as a recent prescription, moreover they
        are allowed in case of chronic use (more than 6 weeks). If those drugs are used for less
        than 6 weeks, patients could participate in the study after a washout period.

        VI.- Anticonvulsant indicated as a pain killer are not allowed, but patients could
        participate in the study after a washout period.

        VII.- Patients can take low doses of hypnotic drugs (eg. Lorazepam 1mg/OD or Diazepam
        5mg/OD) if they are used as a chronic prescription (more than 6 weeks). If they are used
        for less than 6 weeks, patients could participate in the study after a washout period.

        Subjects will be allowed to take their chronic (non-analgesic and non-anti-inflammatory)
        medications if the treatments have been used continuously for at least six weeks prior to
        assessment.
