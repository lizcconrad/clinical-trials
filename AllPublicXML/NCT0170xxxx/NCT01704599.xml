  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamins modulating homocysteine affect both TNF-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor,
      and theoretically enhance the anti-inflammatory version of NOS thus hopefully increasing the
      efficacy and reducing the chance of some toxicities of adalimumab as determined by blood
      testing and EKGs.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a pilot study designed to evaluate whether addition of oral vitamin B12, vitamin B6,
      and folic acid to the use of adalimumab for psoriasis leads to further improvement of a
      patient's psoriasis and quality of life.

The one arm: After 16 weeks on adalimumab, modulators of homocysteine (oral vitamin B12, oral vitamin B6 or pyridoxine, and oral folic acid) will be added to adalimumab therapy for an additional 12 weeks. At end of this, therapy can stop or continue . Telephone call day 70 after formal end of in person study the investigators will assess general health of each subject.

        <description>An electrocardiogram (EKG) is used to evaluate the electrical activity of the heart by converting this activity into line tracings on paper.. Electrodes (small, plastic patches) are placed at certain locations on the chest, arms, and legs. When the electrodes are connected to an EKG machine by lead wires, the electrical activity of the heart is measured, interpreted, and printed out for the doctor's information and further interpretation. This test was to be administered to adults age 18 or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis patients at week 0, 16 and week 28 of this study.</description>
