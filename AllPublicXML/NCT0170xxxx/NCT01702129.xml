      Background: Site-specific delivery of anti-cancer therapeutics is paramount for both reducing
      nonspecific toxicities and increasing efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Due to their small
      molecular size and nonspecific mechanisms of action, most conventional chemotherapies result
      in significant toxicities that limit the effectiveness of treatment and reduce the overall
      quality of life for cancer patients. Encapsulation of these toxic agents inside lipid-based
      carrier systems (so-called liposomes) results in passive targeting of the compounds to solid
      tumors. The preferential delivery of liposomal drugs to solid tumors is mostly due to altered
      barrier-properties of tumor-associated vessels. This results in both an improved delivery and
      at the same time a significantly milder toxicity profile. Recently, the specificity of
      delivery was further increased by attaching monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments to
      the surface of liposomes (=immunoliposomes, antibody-linked nanoparticles). Antibody-coated
      immunoliposomes attach more selectively to antigens expressed on the target cells and they
      are internalized more efficiently. Furthermore, there is evidence that drug resistance, a
      major challenge in cancer treatment, may be overcome by such delivery systems. A logical and
      accessible target, such as EGFR, is overexpressed on a variety of primary human cancer cells
      and it is involved in signaling pathways that contribute both to tumor initiation and tumor
      progression. Recently, the investigators have tested immunoliposomes against the epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) in a preclinical setting. Based on the preclinical results we
      have initiated this phase I clinical trial.

      Study hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes selectively
      deliver cytotoxic compounds to EGFR-overexpressing tumors cells. Specific delivery is
      supposed to increase efficacy while reducing side-effects of the compound. The primary
      objective of this phase 1 trial is the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for
      future phase 2 trials of this nanoparticle.

      C225-ILS-DOX

      This is a phase 1 trial of anti-EGFR-immunoliposomes, an investigative nanoparticle targeted
      against EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. The investigators have constructed anti-EGFR
      immunoliposomes by using Fab' fragments of the chimeric MAb cetuximab (C225, cetuximab,
      erbitux™, ImClone Systems Corp., NY, USA; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), which were
      covalently conjugated to the liposome membrane. This approach was designed to provide maximal
      drug delivery to cancer cells via a receptor-targeted and internalizing drug carrier that is
      stable, non-immunogenic, long-lived with extended blood and tissue residence times and
      capable of delivering large payloads of diverse types of drugs.

      Based on extensive preclinical studies, the investigators decided to perform a first-in-human
      clinical trial in patients with EGFR-overexpressing solid tumors who have already received
      all available standard treatments. The therapeutic compound tested in the trial is
      C225-ILs-dox, a doxorubicin-loaded anti-EGFR-immunoliposome. Doxorubicin is one of the most
      active agents in many human tumors, and a high percentage of these malignancies do express
      EGFR. Therefore, the targeting of doxorubicin to EGFR-expressing tumors via the EGFR-specific
      antibody C225 should enhance the specificity and efficacy of chemotherapy, while the
      encapsulation of the cytotoxic drug within pegylated liposomes should at the same time
      decrease its toxicity.

      This is a single center, open study. The aim of the trial is the definition of the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) for future phase 2 studies. Secondary endpoints include the overall
      response rate, the time-to-progression and the assessment of the pharmakokinetic of the
      compound. The trials follows a canonical 3+3 design and allows an additional recruitment of
      up to 6 patients on the dose level defined as the MTD. Planned dose levels are as follows:

      Level 1 = 5 mg/m2 Level 2 = 10 mg/m2 Level 3 = 20 mg/m2 Level 4 = 30 mg/m2 Level 5 = 40 mg/m2
      Level 6 = 50 mg/m2 Level 7 = 60 mg/m2 Level 8 = 70 mg/m2 Level 9 = 80 mg/m2

      At each dose level, 3 patients may be enrolled simultaneously. Escalation to the next higher
      dose will be allowed after patient 3 of a given dose level has received at least one full
      cycle of therapy if no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occured at a given dose level. The
      decision to enter a next dose level will be made by the study team after reviewing all
      available toxicity data of the previous groups. A DLT is defined as any grade 4 toxicity, any
      grade 3 toxicity lasting more than one week or/and febrile neutropenia grade 3 (defined as
      neutrophils &lt; 1.0 x 10e9/l and fever &gt; 38.5 °C). Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and alopecia
      (grade 2) will be excluded as dose limiting toxicities. Similarly, adverse events that are
      clearly related to the primary tumor, such as progression of disease will not be considered
      as DLTs. In addition, preexisting toxicities must be taken into account when defining and
      analyzing DLTs.

      Patients will be treated until disease progression but for a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients
      having completed the treatment phase (24 weeks) and showing complete or partial response as
      well as stable disease will enter the observation phase of the study. This phase will end 12
      months after the last patient has been included. At any time during treatment phase or
      observation phase, patients with signs of disease progression according to RECIST criteria
      for reporting results of cancer treatment or having discontinued treatment due to
      unacceptable toxicity will go off study and be treated at the investigator's discretion.
