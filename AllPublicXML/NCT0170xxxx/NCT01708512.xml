      All enrolled subject will receive one Ultherapy™ treatment. Study images will be obtained
      pre-treatment, immediate post-treatment, and at each study follow-up visit. Enrolled subjects
      will return for follow-up visits at 90 days, 180 days and 365 days post-treatment.

      This is a prospective, single-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the Ulthera®
      System to provide a customized, high-density, vectored Ultherapy™ treatment to lift and
      tighten the skin of the face and neck. Skin laxity changes from baseline will be assessed at
      study follow-up visits. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores and patient satisfaction
      questionnaires will also be obtained.
