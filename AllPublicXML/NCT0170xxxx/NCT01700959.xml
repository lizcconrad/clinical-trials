      Primary objective:

        1. To examine the efficacy of melatonin treatment on neurocognitive functioning in adult
           survivors of childhood cancer.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of melatonin treatment on delayed sleep onset latency in
           long-term childhood cancer survivors.

        2. To investigate whether improvement in sleep onset latency due to melatonin treatment is
           associated with neurocognitive improvement in long-term childhood cancer survivors.

      This study is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of time release melatonin
      for adult survivors of childhood cancer who demonstrate impaired neurocognitive functioning
      and/or difficulty falling asleep.

      All participants undergo a general neurocognitive evaluation at baseline and 6-month
      follow-up, focused on assessment of intelligence, academic skills, attention, processing
      speed, memory and executive functions.

      Sleep parameters using self-report and actigraphy will be assessed at three time points
      during the study: Baseline, 3-months, and 6-months.

      Participants will be divided into 3 mutually exclusive groups:

        -  Cohort 1: Participant has neurocognitive impairment defined as performance on at least
           one measure of attention, memory, and/or executive functioning at or below the 10th
           percentile, AND is absent of delayed sleep onset latency defined as an inability to fall
           asleep within 30 minutes less than once a week during the past month.

        -  Cohort 2: Participant has neurocognitive impairment defined as performance on at least
           one measure of attention, memory, and/or executive functioning at or below the 10th
           percentile, AND has delayed sleep onset latency defined as self-report of an inability
           to fall asleep within 30 minutes at least once a week during the past month.

        -  Cohort 3: Participant is absent of neurocognitive impairment defined as performance
           &gt;10th percentile on all six measures of attention, memory, and executive functioning,
           AND has delayed sleep onset latency defined as self-report of an inability to fall
           asleep within 30 minutes &gt; once a week during the past month.

      Within each group, participants will be randomly assigned to take either 3 mgs of time
      release melatonin or placebo 1-2 hours before bedtime each night for 6 months.

      Psychosocial measures of health-related quality of life and psychological distress will be
      completed at baseline and following 6 months of melatonin/placebo treatment.

      Biological samples for serum melatonin levels will be collected at baseline and at the 6
      month follow-up evaluation.
