    <description>The primary endpoint will be the mean change between time-matched measurements of QTcF for ATX-101 and placebo after baseline adjustment calculating the upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval. A negative TQT study can be claimed if each upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI is below 10 msec.</description>

               -  QRS Duration: &lt; 120 msec

               -  QTcF Duration: &lt; 450 msec

          -  Serum hemoglobin test result of 11.0 g/dL or greater and negative hepatitis B,
             hepatitis C, and HIV test result within 28 days before the dose of study material.

          -  Willing and able to comply with and understand the visit schedule and all of the
             protocol-specified tests and procedures.

          -  Medically able to undergo the administration of study material as determined by
             clinical and laboratory evaluations obtained within 28 days before dosing with study
             material for which the investigator identifies no clinically significant abnormality.

          -  Signed informed consent obtained before any study-specific procedure is conducted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prescription medication taken within 14 days (or 5 elimination half-lives,

             including topical medications, herbal or dietary supplements/remedies within 7 days of
             Study Day 2, or planned concomitant medication while in the study (except for
             acetaminophen up to 2 g/day and hormonal birth control).

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (e.g. hypokalemia, history
             of drowning survival, family history of Long QT Syndrome, family history of Short QT
             Syndrome, or family history of unexplainable early sudden death).

          -  Participation in a study of an investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to
             the baseline ECG.

          -  Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would place a subject at
             undue risk, or potentially compromise the results or interpretation of the study.

          -  Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, for example, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular
             response at rest &gt; 100 beats per minute.

          -  Known abnormality of any cardiac valve (either stenosis or regurgitation) that is
             greater than moderate in severity.

          -  Subjects not in sinus rhythm at screening.

          -  History of trauma associated with the chin or neck areas, which in the judgment of the
             investigator may affect evaluation of safety of treatment.

          -  Loose skin in the neck or chin area for which reduction in submental fat may, in the

             disorder.

          -  Any medical condition that would interfere with the assessment of safety in this trial
             or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study procedures or to give
             informed consent.

          -  Treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) within 30 days before dosing with

             the neck or chin within 12 months before dosing with the study material, or botulinum
             toxin injections in the neck or chin area within 6 months before dosing with the study
             material.

          -  History of sensitivity to any components of the study material.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse, in the judgment of the investigator, within two
             years before dosing with the study material.

          -  Presence of positive urine drug or alcohol screening test result obtained from a
             sample obtained during the screening period and/or after admission to the research
             facility for the confinement period, but before dosing with the study material.

          -  Previous enrollment in a trial of ATX-101.
