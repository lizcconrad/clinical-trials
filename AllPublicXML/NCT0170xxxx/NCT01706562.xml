  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the overall success rate of itraconazole
      intravenous treatment for a period of more than 7 days.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study ie, a study that looks backward in time, usually using medical
      records and interviews with patients who are already known to have a disease, in patients
      with itraconazole intravenous prescription as an empirical (based on practical experience)
      antifungal agent. This study collects baseline information about underlying disease, sign of
      fungal infection, neutropenia (a decrease in white blood cells), neutropenic fever duration
      and the reason for discontinuation. Neutropenia is defined as a neutrophil (white blood cell)
      count of ≤500 cells/mm3 or a count of ≤1000 cells/mm3 with a predicted decrease to ≤500
      cells/mm3. Fever is defined as a body temperature ≥38.3 Celsius degrees at least once a day
      with no definite external factor or a body temperature of ≥38 Celsius degrees continued for
      at least 1 hour.
