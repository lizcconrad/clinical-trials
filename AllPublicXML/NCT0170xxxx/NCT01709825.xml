  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if daily consumption of a probiotic in the period
      before, during and after academic exams will help maintain digestive and immune health and
      quality of life of undergraduate students.

      A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial will be used. Healthy full-time
      undergraduate students will be recruited from the University of Florida via flyers, emails,
      announcements, etc. Informed consent will be obtained and the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be reviewed to determine whether a participant qualifies for the study. All participants
      will be consented for the main six-week intervention and a subgroup (n=50/group) of these
      students will be consented to provide two stool samples.

      Participants will provide saliva and stool samples (for the sub-group)during the pre-baseline
      week and during the week of final exams at approximately week 4. At the randomization visit,
      height, weight and age will be obtained. Participants will be stratified based on body mass
      index and randomized via sealed envelopes to one of four groups: Lactobacillus helveticus,
      Bifidobacterium longum ssp. Infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum or the placebo (n=145/group).
      Participants will take the study provided capsule of probiotic or placebo daily for 6 weeks.
      Participants will receive daily questionnaires via email throughout the prebaseline week and
      the 6-week intervention. Daily questionnaires will ask about intake of the supplement, cold
      symptoms, and general health (i.e., new medications, doctor visits). Throughout the study,
      participants will also be asked to complete weekly questionnaires (inquiring about
      gastrointestinal symptoms and physical activity) and Quality of Life Questionnaires
      (administered during pre-baseline, final exam week and week 6 of the study).

    <description>The intensity of cold/flu symptoms (running/congested nose, stiffness or chills, headache, cough, fatigue, fever, sore throat, achiness, and ear discomfort)will be scored as 0 (not experiencing) to 3 (severe). The symptom intensity from the 9 cold/flu symptoms will be summed to obtain a symptom intensity score. A symptom intensity score of &gt;6 will be designated as a day of cold. The mean proportion of days without a cold/flu will be compared between each probiotic and the placebo.</description>
