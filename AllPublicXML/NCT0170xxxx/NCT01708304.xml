  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The University of Washington's Northwest Research Group on Aging is partnering with Area
      Agencies on Aging (AAA) in Washington and Oregon to complete this translational investigation
      of RDAD (Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease). RDAD is an evidence-based program
      with demonstrated efficacy in helping older adults with dementia maintain physical function
      and remain physically and mentally healthy. This study asks two questions: 1) Can AAA
      partners successfully translate and implement RDAD, and 2) Is AAA implementation of RDAD
      effective in producing desired outcomes among agencies, providers, and older adults with
      dementia and their family members. This study is being conducted in Washington and Oregon
      states.
