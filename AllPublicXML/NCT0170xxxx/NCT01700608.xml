  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plerixafor is a new CXCR4 inhibitor that is able to improve peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      mobilization when combined with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The 'on
      demand' use of plerixafor at the hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy + G-CSF may be
      more efficient and cost-effective, but the timing of administration and criteria for patient
      selection are still under investigation. We collected the data of lymphoma and myeloma
      patients treated with plerixafor at the hematopoietic recovery after chemotherapy + G-CSF.
      The decision of adding plerixafor was based on PB CD34+ cells at the time of hematopoietic
      recovery after chemotherapy in patients at their first or subsequent attempt, according to
      the attending physician choice. The primary endpoint was the assessment of the rate of
      patients who were able to collect &gt;=2 x 10^6 CD34+/kg.

      of the rate of patients collecting &gt; 4 x 10^6 CD34+/kg and the median number of apheresis to
      reach the target.
