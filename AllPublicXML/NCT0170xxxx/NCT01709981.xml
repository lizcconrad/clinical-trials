  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-procedural inflammation is associated with increased rates of post-procedural myocardial
      infarction (MI), which occur in up to 35% of PCI patients and are themselves associated with
      increased risk of later MI and death. Statins suppress both inflammatory markers and MI rates
      during and after PCI, but ≥ 40% of PCI patients go statin-untreated, due in part to side
      effects such as myalgia. Moreover, because their mechanism of action relies on
      post-translational effects, statins must be given ≥ 12 to 24 hours prior to PCI, a time frame
      that is not always feasible. The investigators propose a novel alternative approach to reduce
      inflammation during PCI employing colchicine, an anti-inflammatory medication used frequently
      in gout and pericarditis. Colchicine may be particularly applicable to the PCI setting due to
      its rapid onset of action and excellent side-effect profile at low doses, as well as its
      known mechanisms of action. However, data on colchicine use in patients with coronary disease
      is extremely limited, and no studies to date have evaluated the use of colchicine in patients
      undergoing PCI. The investigators aim to characterize a potential mechanism of benefit in
      patients undergoing PCI by evaluating the effects of colchicine on soluble and leukocyte
      surface markers after PCI. The investigators also aim to determine the effects of colchicine
      on peri-procedural myonecrosis and MI. Accordingly, the investigators propose a prospective
      randomized study to characterize the effect of colchicine on inflammation and peri-procedural
      myocnecrosis. Patients referred for possible PCI will be randomized in a double-blinded
      fashion to placebo or colchicine (1.2mg 1 to 2 hours before PCI, followed by 0.6mg 1 hour
      later). The primary endpoint will be post-procedural interleukin-6 level. Secondary endpoints
      will include other relevant soluble and leukocyte-associated inflammatory markers and rates
      of peri-procedural myonecrosis and MI. Sample size needed is 200 patients undergoing PCI. To
      adjust for a floor effect, 280 patients undergoing PCI will be needed. 400 patients will
      likely be needed to be enrolled to reach 280 PCIs (the remaining will have undergone a
      diagnostic only procedure).
