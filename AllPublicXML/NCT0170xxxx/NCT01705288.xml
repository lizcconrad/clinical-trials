  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 600,000 hysterectomies are performed annually in the United States. Despite increasing
      use of less invasive approaches, the majority of hysterectomies are still performed via
      traditional laparotomy, which can be associated with generally slower recovery and longer
      lengths of post-operative hospitalization. Rapid Recovery Protocols (RRP) seek to optimize
      post-surgical morbidity outcomes by returning a patient to normal physiology as quickly as
      possible following surgery.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Rapid recovery protocol (regional
      anesthesia, pain control options with emphasis on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDS) over narcotic pain medications, early ambulation, and early enteral feeding) or
      standard of care (traditional laparatomy and supportive care).

    <time_frame>1 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of this study is a reduction of length of hospital stay from a mean of 5 days to 3 days.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Pain Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcome is to determine if rapid recovery can improve Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain assessment. VAS scales are a horizontal line 100 mm in length with the left end labeled 'No pain' and the right end labeled 'Very severe pain'. The subject marks a point on the line that represents their perception of their current state. VAS score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) from the left end of the line to the point on the line marked by the subject. The range of possible values for this pain score is 0 to 100 mm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Pain Medications Used</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Another secondary outcome will be whether the rapid recovery protocol decreases the amount of narcotic pain medication used by patients during their hospital stay.</description>
