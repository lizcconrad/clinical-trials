    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if giving reolysin in combination with docetaxel or
      pemetrexed can offer better results than standard therapy with docetaxel or pemetrexed alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reolysin is a virus which has been shown to target and destroy cancer cells in laboratory
      tests. Reolysin has been studied in over 360 cancer patients to find safe doses that can be
      given and has also undergone testing in combination with docetaxel.

      Docetaxel and pemetrexed have anticancer activity in certain cancers including lung and they
      have been approved by Health Canada for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      Researchers doing this study also want to evaluate the side effects of reolysin when given
      together with docetaxel or pemetrexed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-small
             cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As treatment arm is assigned based on histology subtype, it
             must be feasible to subtype into squamous or other.

          -  All patients must have a formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue block (from primary
             or metastatic tumour) available for translational studies and must have provided
             informed consent for the release of the block as well as for blood samples for
             correlative studies.

          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. At least one site of
             disease must be unidimensionally measurable as follows:

               -  Chest X-ray ≥ 20 mm

               -  CT/MRI scan (with slice thickness of &lt; 5 mm) ≥ 10 mm --&gt; longest diameter

               -  Physical exam (using calipers) ≥ 10 mm

               -  Lymph nodes by CT scan ≥ 15 mm --&gt; measured in short axis All radiology studies
                  must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization (within 35 days if
                  negative).

          -  Patients must have advanced and or metastatic disease, for which no curative therapy
             exists and for which systemic therapy is indicated.

          -  ECOG performance of 0 or 1.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

        Surgery: Previous major surgery is permitted provided that it has been at least 14 days
        prior to patient randomization and that wound healing has occurred.

        Chemotherapy: Patients must have received one regimen of palliative first line chemotherapy
        (must be platinum containing combination unless patient's age &gt; 70 years) which may not
        have contained docetaxel. Patients who have had concurrent platinum based chemoradiotherapy
        for stage three disease and have relapsed within one year of treatment, or patients who
        have had platinum based adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection and have
        relapsed within one year of treatment, may be considered to have had one prior platinum
        containing regimen.

        Prior paclitaxel is permissible. Patients who have had prior pemetrexed for first line
        therapy will be randomized to Treatment Arm C or D (docetaxel ± reolysin). Prior
        maintenance therapy with pemetrexed is not permitted. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy is
        permissible providing completed at least 1 year prior to relapse/recurrence of disease and
        the patient has received one regimen of palliative first line chemotherapy as described
        above.

        Other Therapy: Patients may have received other therapies including immunotherapy, or with
        signal transduction inhibitors, including EGFR inhibitors.

        Radiation: Prior external beam radiation is permitted provided a minimum of 4 weeks has
        elapsed between the last dose and enrollment to the trial. Exceptions may be made for low
        dose, non-myelosuppressive radiotherapy.

          -  Laboratory Requirements (must be done within 7 days prior to randomization)

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

               -  Biochemistry:

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN (For patients enrolled to a pemetrexed arm, the
                  creatinine clearance must also be &gt;45 ml/min)

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 x ULN (unless elevated secondary to conditions such as
                  Gilbert's disease)

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 1.5 x ULN (≤ 3x ULN is permitted in the presence of known liver
                  metastases)

               -  Proteinuria &lt;2g/24hrs (screen using spot testing; if ≥ grade 2 repeat with
                  mid-stream urine; if still ≥ grade 2 then uring collection for 24 hours to
                  confirm &lt;2g/24hrs).

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in
             the trial to document their willingness to participate.

        Patients who cannot give informed consent (i.e. mentally incompetent patients, or those
        physically incapacitated such as comatose patients) are not to be recruited into the study.
        Patients competent but physically unable to sign the consent form may have the document
        signed by their nearest relative or legal guardian. Each patient will be provided with a
        full explanation of the study before consent is requested.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 2 hour's driving distance) placed
             on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure themselves that
             the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete documentation of
             the treatment, adverse events, response assessment and follow-up.

          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working
             days of patient randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except for adequately treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer or solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of
             disease for &gt; 3 years.

          -  Patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy or have known HIV infection or active
             hepatitis B or C.

          -  Patients with active or uncontrolled infections or with serious illnesses or medical
             conditions which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol.

          -  Patients with significant cardiac (including uncontrolled hypertension) or pulmonary
             disease, or active CNS disease or infection.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to the study drug(s) or their components.

          -  Patients with untreated brain metastases, untreated spinal cord compression or
             meningeal metastases are not eligible (CT scans are not required to rule this out
             unless there is a clinical suspicion of CNS disease). Patients with treated brain
             metastases who have radiologic evidence of stable brain metastases, with no evidence
             of cavitation or hemorrhage in the brain lesion, are eligible providing that they are
             asymptomatic and do not require corticosteroids (must have discontinued steroids at
             least 1 week prior to randomization).

          -  Patients who have neuropathy ≥ grade 2 (patients planned for docetaxel Arms C and D
             only).

          -  Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile or use two reliable forms of
             contraception while on study and for 6 months after discontinuing therapy. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test taken and proven negative within 7
             days prior to registration/randomization and must not be lactating. Men must be
             surgically sterile or use a barrier method of contraception.

          -  Concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs or anti-cancer therapy.
