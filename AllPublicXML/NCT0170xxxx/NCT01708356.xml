      Introduction: Cycling is currently promoted at the municipal, provincial and national level
      as a form of active transportation that increases physical activity while at the same time
      reducing traffic congestion, traffic-related air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
      While at a population level the health benefits of exercise via cycling are estimated to
      substantially exceed any health impacts related to air pollution exposure and injuries from
      traffic accidents , cyclists are known to experience elevated exposures to traffic-related
      air pollutants. Combined with exposure to elevated concentrations of air pollutants, cyclists
      also are subject to substantially increased inhaled doses due to their level of exertion and
      consequently increased inhalation rate. Therefore, given that cyclists experience exposures
      to relatively high concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants and that their inhalation
      of these pollutants is increased, it is important to evaluate the potential health impacts of
      this scenario. Research on the potential health impacts related to exercise (cycling) and
      urban air pollution exposure can help inform public communication strategies related to air
      quality and its health impacts. In addition, as our previous work suggests substantial
      variability in air pollution exposures to cyclists that is related to the route type and the
      levels of traffic along cycling routes, there is potential for transportation planners to
      promote increased cycling by enhancing infrastructure while at the same time developing
      routes that also minimize exposure to air pollution. The cyclist population is also
      interested in information regarding the air pollution exposures and potential health impacts
      related to cycling.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between traffic-related air
      pollution exposure, and respiratory and cardiovascular health impacts in commuting cyclists.
      Specifically, the investigators propose to:

        1. determine commuting cyclists' exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (PM 2.5, PM10,
           ultrafine particulate, black carbon) while cycling along two different bicycle routes in
           the city of Vancouver;

        2. estimate the pollutant dose received by each cyclist, and relate this to the health
           effects observed; and

        3. determine if there is a change in lung function, endothelial function, and C-reactive
           protein level related to the level of air pollution exposure and dose
