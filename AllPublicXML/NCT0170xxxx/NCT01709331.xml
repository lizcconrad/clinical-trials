  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess if corifollitropin alfa (MK-8962), when administered in combination
      with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), will increase testicular volume in men with HH who
      remain azoospermic after treatment with hCG alone.

      Hypothesis: The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the geometric mean increase in
      testicular volume from Day 1 to Week 52 is greater than one.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Log-Transformed Testicular Volume at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Participants underwent testicular ultrasound in the pretreatment phase at Weeks -16, -8, -1; and during the combined treatment phase at Baseline (predose, Day 1) and at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52. The testicular volume was measured as the sum of volumes of left and right testes. The mean change from Day 1 in log-transformed testicular volume was analyzed using a mixed model with a fixed effect for time point and a random effect for the participant. For each time point, the mean change from Day 1 to that time point and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The geometric mean fold change in testicular volume and its 95% CI was obtained by exponentiation.</description>
