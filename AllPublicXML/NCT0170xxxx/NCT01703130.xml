  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interscalene block (ISB) consistently demonstrates superior pain relief after shoulder
      surgery. However, patients can experience complications such as blurred vision, hoarseness
      and shortness of breath with the standard volumes of local anesthetic used in contemporary
      practice. Patients with respiratory diseases are precluded because of the potential effects
      on respiration. However, they are then exposed to the risks of general anesthesia and opioid
      medications which can also have detrimental effects on respiration. Ultrasound guided ISB can
      reduce the local anesthetic volume required to produce anesthesia for shoulder surgery; this
      may reduce the complications from ISB to allow patients previously unable to benefit to have
      this technique, such as patients with obesity and respiratory disease. In order to do so the
      investigators will use an up-down methodology to find the minimum volume of local anesthetic
      to provide sufficient anesthesia for shoulder surgery.

    <description>to determine the MEAV95 of ropivacaine 0.75% at the level of root C5-6 using the dose-finding protocol. The success of surgical anesthesia is defined by the presence of sensory blockade (no sensation/score of 0 to pinprick testing) 30 minutes post injection of local anesthetic</description>

    <measure>Motor blockade</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The C5 myotome covers the deltoid muscle (the most powerful motion being shoulder abduction) and the biceps brachii muscle. Biceps brachii is also innervated by C6. Therefore, motor blockade will be assessed by testing shoulder abduction and forearm flexion. Motor function will be classified as present (any movement) or absent (no movement)</description>
