    <textblock>
      This is a research study of African American parents/caregivers of newborns. The purpose of
      this research study is to learn what type of educational materials about infant safety and
      safe infant sleep are most effective and acceptable to parents and caregivers. The
      investigators will compare the responses of parents who receive enhanced materials to the
      responses of parents who receive the ordinary materials that are currently in use.

      The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether a tailored multi-media mailed
      intervention is superior to standard non-tailored print brochures along with a generic DVD in
      increasing the prevalence of African American infant supine sleep during the first six months
      of life.
