      This epidemiological study is based on an already existing database of time series regression
      modeling outputs generated during the generated by EPI-FLU-018 BOD UK DB (116273) study,
      which estimated the burden of influenza in terms of General Practitioner (GP) consultations,
      hospitalizations, and deaths associated with various respiratory and non-respiratory
      outcomes.

    <description>The previous study has used four primary data sources: the General Practice Research Data (GPRD [recently re-named Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)], for mild outcomes), the Hospital Episode Statistics database (HES, for hospitalizations), the Office of National Statistics mortality database (ONS, for mortality), and weekly virology data from the Health Protection Agency (HPA). The extracted data are referred to as the EPI-FLU-018 BOD UK DB database. Weekly time series will be generated to estimate the RSV burden and characterize it in terms of incidence of GP consultations, hospitalizations and deaths for each of the respiratory and non-respiratory outcomes (including GP antibiotic prescriptions), stratified by age and risk group.</description>
