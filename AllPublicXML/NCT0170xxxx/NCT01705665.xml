  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was initiated on the preliminary premise that a thrombus whose formation was
      triggered by a thrombogenic substrate, such as within an atherosclerotic plaque (Tissue
      factor initiated thrombus), may evolve differently than the one evolving at the site of a
      recently implanted stent (foreign body triggered). Consequently, the thrombus composition of
      a de novo clot could differ from the other one, extracted during the occurrence of a subacute
      thrombosis, regarding the number of various cells, the amount of fibrin and platelet
      aggregates and the relationship among these components. In addition, it seems relevant to
      evaluate the numbers and the distribution of the local monocytes, once these cells may
      interact with platelets (via cell -adhesion mechanisms e.g., by CD31 [PECAM-1]) and by the
      extrinsic coagulation pathway (via TF/FVII elaborated by plaque-resident macrophages). Such a
      distinction, if eventually found, may reveal the mechanisms of thrombosis within coronary
      arteries, and may have clinical implications.
