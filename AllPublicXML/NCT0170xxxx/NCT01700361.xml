      This study will examine whether measurement of pelvic floor muscle sEMG activity is
      responsive to explicit sexual stimuli, and whether it correlates with self-reports of sexual
      arousal in healthy women. Participants' vaginal, labial and anal sEMG readings will be
      monitored during exposure to neutral, erotic and anxiety-provoking films. Participants will
      also be required to provide subjective ratings of sexual arousal before and after each film.
      If pelvic floor sEMG is validated as a psychophysiological measure, these findings may have
      important clinical and research implications by providing a greater understanding of the
      mechanisms involved in sexual arousal and for providing a relatively easy method of assessing
      sexual arousal in a clinical or research setting.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. Investigators hypothesize that, relative to the neutral films, PFM EMG activity will
           significantly increase in response to the erotic film as measured by the labial, anal,
           and vaginal EMG probes.

        2. Investigators hypothesize that, relative to the anxiety-provoking film, PFM EMG activity
           will significantly increase in response to the erotic film as measured by the labial,
           anal, and vaginal EMG probes.

        3. Investigators hypothesize that continuously measured subjective sexual arousal (via the
           arousometer) will correlate significantly with PFM EMG activity during the erotic film.
