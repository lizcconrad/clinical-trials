      Background:

      The importance of ischemic ECG changes including St segment elevation, ST segment depression
      or T wave inversion that indicate myocardial ischemia are well established and require
      appropriate investigation and treatment.

      However, there is an abundance of clinical situation, with apparently ischemic ECG change not
      indicate traditionally coronary artery related ischemia and therefore require prompt
      recognition and treatment of underlying condition, that may be serious and life-threatened.
      For example of such conditions are pericarditis, myocarditis, aortic dissection, electrolyte
      abnormalities, intracranial hemorrhage and hypothermia.

      Together with them, an ECG ST segment changes may appeared in abdominal serious illness such
      as pancreatitis and cholecystitis(17,18,19,20,23). Whereas in pancreatitis various vasoactive
      and toxic for myocardium substances released, the cause of ST segment changes in
      cholecystitis are discussed and includes tachycardia , vagal reflexes, changed in plasma
      rennin activity resulted by distension of the gallbladder.

      The certain proportion of the patients with ECG changes actually didn't have coronary artery
      disease(9,15) or other acute cardiac condition and therefore require treatment of the
      underlie illness only without spend the time for cardiac investigation or special
      treatment(1,3,4,7,8). Some kind of treatment may be even harmful for the patients with
      abdominal illness such as thrombolytic, anticoagulant, aggressive antiaggregant therapy or
      unnecessary cardiac catheterization.

      In the medical literature the investigators found some case reports and works about the ECG
      changes in acute biliary disease in patient with knowing cardiac disease and without it, but
      actually incidence of ECG changes that suggest but not represent an acute coronary illness
      isn't knowing.

      Therefore this is necessary to investigate actually incidence of ECG changes that mimic acute
      coronary syndrome in acute cholecystitis and acute biliary disease and determined clinical
      and laboratory characteristics that helps to differentiate this patients.
