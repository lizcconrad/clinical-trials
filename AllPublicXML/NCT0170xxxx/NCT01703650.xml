    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is

        1. to determine whether the perfusion parameters in the normal pancreas and the pancreas
           cancer (adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine tumor) are different on perfusion CT

        2. to determine whether initial perfusion parameters as well as perfusion parameter change
           in pancreas adenocarcinoma before and after chemotherapy are different between
           chemotherapy response group (CR, PR according to RECIST 1.1) and non response group (SD,
           PD according to RECIST 1.1).

      1. Performance of preoperative perfusion CT for preoperative staging is assessed by
           comparing with operative finding and histologic disease staging

        2. Estimation of initial or change of pancreas cancer perfusion parameters and whether
           those can provide cut-off value for predicting response of chemotherapy in patients with
           pancreas adenocarcinoma

    <description>iopromide (370mgI/mL) enhanced perfusion CT will be performed within 14 days of operation.
In patients who are planned to receive chemotherapy, iopromide enhanced perfusion CT was performed twice; within 14 days before starting 1st cycle and within 14 days after finishing 2nd cycle.
iopromide (370mgI/mL) will be administered intravenously with an amount of 30mL (body weight[BW] &lt;50kg) or 35 mL (50kg ≤BW &lt;70kg) or 40 mL (70 kg≤BW &lt;90kg) or 50 mL (90≤BW), followed by saline infusion (30mL).
Injection rate is as follows; 6.0mL/sec if BW is &lt;50kg, 7.0 mL/sec if BW is 50kg≤and &lt;70kg, 8.0 mL/sec if BW is 70≤and&lt;90kg and 9.0mL/sec if BW is 90kg≤.</description>

    <description>Perfusion CT will be performed by using a 320 channel MDCT
Patients are requested for fasting for at least 8 hours before CT scan.
Patients are requested for doing shallow breathing as slow as possible and wide strap is applied during CT scan.
Scan range is limited to the whole pancreas and it focuses to the pancreas tumor lesion.
During perfusion CT, 19 phases (ten phases with two seconds interval and six phases with three seconds interval and three phases with five seconds interval) are obtained in fifty three seconds.
ADIR 3D and SURE EXPOSURE 3D are applied during perfusion CT to minimize radiation dose.</description>
