    <textblock>
      Background: In Italy, several recent studies found that a large percentage of patients
      attending Primary Care (PC) clinics meet criteria for at least one common mental disorder, as
      they show high rates of depression, anxiety, and co-morbid anxiety and depression. These
      patients may experience significant functional impairment and suffer from unexplained somatic
      symptoms, and often remain undetected and untreated. Consistent evidence for the
      effectiveness of organized care programs for depression, by improving quality of care and
      treatment adherence, is now available. Fundamental elements of these programs include
      algorithms to prompt the proper and timely implementation of evidence-based treatments,
      structured outcome assessment and systematic outreach. Telemedicine tools may represent a
      valuable strategy for improving depression outcomes in PC.

      Aims: 1.To develop and employ computer-based assessment to more accurately and timely detect
      patient depression in PC settings; 2.To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a care
      support program developed in conjunction with the PC-based assessment for patients suffering
      from depression, as based on two main objectives: 2a.To support GP decisions with treatment
      algorithms and improve the quality of GP and mental health service collaboration; 2b.To
      improve patient compliance and treatment adherence by using appropriate telecommunication
      tools and technologically advanced tools to conduct systematic routine assessment. Although
      much of this system will be computer-based, live telephonic and in-person contacts will also
      be included as needed.

      Study Design: The study is a randomized controlled trial, involving four PC group clinics
      (GCs) located in two areas of Northern Italy. Two PC clinics will use the experimental
      protocol; the other two will serve as controls.

      The study will compare two different conditions:

        -  Group 1 (experimental): GPs will use a Computer Decision Support System with treatment
           algorithms and advice and supervision from a consultant psychiatrist. Patients will
           receive reminders via mobile texting or automatic mobile (or landline) phone calls to
           improve adherence to the treatment prescribed.

        -  Group 2 (control): GPs will provide TAU, will make their own decisions and will
           therefore not use the CDSS. Patients will not receive any reminders. All enrolled
           patients will be administered and will fill in the IDS-SR at baseline, 3 and 6-months:
           the IDS-SR score will be used as a primary endpoint.
