  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open elective abdominal aortic surgery is a high risk procedure involving clamping of the
      aorta. Indications include abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or aortic occlusive disease (AOD)
      causing lower limb ischaemia.

      These patients are often regarded as one entity in postoperative study settings. However,
      previous studies indicate that risk profiles, inflammatory activity, and haemodynamic
      capacity may differ between these groups. The first aim of this study was to evaluate
      postoperative ICU-requirements after open elective abdominal aortic surgery, hypothesising
      that AAA-patients had longer ICU-stays and needed more mechanical ventilation or acute
      dialysis than did patients with AOD.

      The investigators see a relatively high incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI)
      following aortic surgery. Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalcin (NGAL) may be useful in
      the early diagnosis of postopeative AKI. However, NGAL is also known as a marker of
      inflammatory activation. The ischaemia-reperfusion injury and subsequent inflammatory
      response to aortic cross clamping may per se induce a rise in NGAL despite intact renal
      function. Therefore NGAL may not be a reliable marker of AKI after AAS.

      The second aim of this study is to describe the changes in NGAL after AAS in patients with
      and without postoperative dialysis-dependent AKI.
