  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of switching away from efavirenz
      (which patients are taking in combination with Kivexa速 or as part of the combination pill,
      Atripla速) in patients with central nervous system side effects (such as insomnia {difficulty
      with sleeping}, bad dreams etc). The investigators in this study will investigate the effect
      of switching to a single tablet regimen (Eviplera速) containing tenofovir, emtricitabine and
      rilpivirine. If patients are currently taking Atripla, rilpivirine will be the only new
      component of the combination.

      Rilpivirine is a drug for HIV treatment, licensed for first-line treatment. In combination
      with Truvada速, it showed fewer side effects when compared to efavirenz in 2 other clinical
      studies, where patients were starting HIV treatment for the first time.

      This study will also investigate the safety (in terms of other side effects and the routine
      blood tests which we ordinarily use to monitor your treatment) and monitor effectiveness,
      your viral load and CD4 counts, when you switch treatment to
      tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine.

    <description>To investigate whether switching individuals with intolerance to efavirenz-containing cART (as Atripla or Kivexa plus Efavarinz) to tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine is associated with resolution of toxicity after 12 weeks. CNS toxicity will be measured by a questionnaire based on efavirenz SPC and graded based on the ACTG adverse event scale.</description>

               3. Has signed the Informed Consent Form voluntarily

               4. Is willing to comply with the protocol requirements

               5. Has been on Atripla for at least 12 weeks OR Kivexa plus efavirenz

               6. Has an HIV-plasma viral load at screening &lt;50 copies/mL (single re-test allowed)

               7. Has a CD4 cell count at screening &gt;50 cells/mm3

               8. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD) &gt;50 ml/min.
