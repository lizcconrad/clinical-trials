      The MURDOCK Study Community Registry and Biorepository (Horizon 1.5) aims to create a
      large-scale community registry and biorepository that can be used as a vehicle for future
      health services, epidemiologic, clinical trials and other omics-related research.

    <textblock>
      The MURDOCK Study Community Registry and Biorepository's activities include enrolling
      approximately 50,000 participants who live in Cabarrus County and/or Kannapolis, North
      Carolina. Participants must consent to (1) use of the data provided by the participant
      through completion of the Participant Registry Questionnaire for epidemiologic population
      characterization, (2) annual contact to update their MURDOCK Horizon 1.5 database record, (3)
      release of their medical information, including but not limited to demographic information,
      problem lists, medications, social and family history, and results of laboratory and other
      testing modalities from pre-existing paper or electronic health records or electronic health
      records that may become available in the future, (4) provision of a blood and urine sample,
      and (5) contact up to four times/year to request participation in additional research
      studies.
