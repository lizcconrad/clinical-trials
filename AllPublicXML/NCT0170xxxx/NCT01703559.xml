  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Night vision complaints such as glare, starburst and halo are often a result of peripheral
      corneal aberrations that cause light scatter when the pupil dilates in mesopic or scotopic
      conditions. Modest reductions in pupil size achieved pharmacologically may reduce the light
      scatter in dim light situations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of people with acceptable uncorrected or best-corrected daytime vision can
      experience night vision complaints, whether they be people with 'night myopia', people with
      Intraocular Implants (IOLs), cortical cataracts, or people who have had refractive surgery.
      Many of these people have corneal or lenticular aberrations, either naturally occurring or
      surgically introduced. For these people, when the pupil dilates in dim light, some light rays
      are not focused on the retina, resulting in visual aberrations including glare, ghosting,
      halos and starburst. It has been proposed that a modest pharmacologic reduction of pupil size
      has the potential to mitigate these complications in many affected individuals. The purpose
      of the present study is to evaluate the sub-acute effect of two dose levels of PM on contrast
      sensitivity and visual acuity during 15 days of continuous therapy.
