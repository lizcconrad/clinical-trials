    <textblock>
      The present study, in an out-patient setting for substance use treatment in adolescents,
      examines the effect on treatment retention of a mobile telephone follow-up technique
      (interactive voice response), with or without personal feedback. Subjects in treatment for
      substance use disorders will be followed by automated mobile telephone contact with questions
      about psychiatric symptoms and substance use, and the investigators hypothesize that this
      technique, including a personal feedback reporting back to the client whether his or her
      status is changing in one way or another, may increase the treatment retention, possibly by
      means of an intensified treatment contact.
