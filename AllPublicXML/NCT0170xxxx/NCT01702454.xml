        <description>Antibody titers were expressed as geometric mean titers. The vaccine strains included A/Christchurch/16/2010(H1N1), A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2),B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria) and B/Hubei-Wujiagang/158/2009(Yamagata) antigens. The humoral response in terms of anti-neuraminidase antibodies for all vaccine strains were calculated by age stratum which included 17-29 months and 30-48 months age groups for both the Fluarix primed and unprimed groups.</description>

        <title>Vaccine Response Rate(VRR) for Serum Neutralising Antibody Titers Against Each of the Four Vaccine Strains by Age Strata</title>
        <description>VRR was defined as the percentage of vaccinees who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt;cut-off and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 4-fold of half of the cut-off or a pre-vaccination titer ≥cut-off and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titers. The vaccine strains included A/Christchurch/16/2010 (H1N1), A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2), B/Brisbane/60/2008(Victoria) and B/Hubei-Wujiagang/158/2009 (Yamagata) antigens. The humoral response in terms of neutralising antibodies for all vaccine strains were calculated by age stratum which included 17-29 months and 30-48 months age groups for both the Fluarix primed and unprimed groups.</description>

        <population>Analyses were perfomed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity which included all evaluable subjects who received the study vaccine according to their treatment assignment, for whom the assay results for antibodies against at least one study vaccine strain after vaccination and for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available</population>

        <title>Vaccine Response Rate(VRR) for Anti-neuraminidase Antibody Titers Against Each of the Four Vaccine Strains by Age Strata.</title>
        <description>VRR was defined as the percentage of vaccinees who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt;cut-off and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 4-fold of half of the cut-off or a pre-vaccination titer ≥cut-off and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titers.

The humoral response in terms of anti-neuraminidase antibodies for all vaccine strains were calculated by age stratum which included 17-29 months and 30-48 months age groups for both the Fluarix primed and unprimed groups.</description>

          <title>Vaccine Response Rate(VRR) for Anti-neuraminidase Antibody Titers Against Each of the Four Vaccine Strains by Age Strata.</title>
          <description>VRR was defined as the percentage of vaccinees who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt;cut-off and a post-vaccination titer ≥ 4-fold of half of the cut-off or a pre-vaccination titer ≥cut-off and at least a 4-fold increase in post-vaccination titers. The vaccine strains included A/Christchurch/16/2010 (H1N1), A/Victoria /361/2011(H3N2), B/Brisbane /60/2008(Victoria ) and B/Hubei-Wujiagang/158/2009 (Yamagata) antigens. The humoral response in terms of anti-neuraminidase antibodies for all vaccine strains were calculated by age stratum which included 17-29 months and 30-48 months age groups for both the Fluarix primed and unprimed groups.</description>
          <population>Analyses were performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity which included all evaluable subjects who received the study vaccine according to their treatment assignment, for whom the assay results for antibodies against at least one study vaccine strain after vaccination and for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available.</population>
