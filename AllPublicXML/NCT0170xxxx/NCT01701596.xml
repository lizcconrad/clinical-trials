      This study is aimed at examining the safety and efficacy of rotational atherectomy (RA) in
      nondilatable calcified lesion complicated by coronary dissection during percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) procedure.

    <textblock>
      Coronary artery dissection is a contraindication for the use of rotational atherectomy, since
      rotational atherectomy may propagate coronary dissection. In the presence of coronary
      dissection, conservative management is suggested for approximately 4 weeks to permit the
      dissection to heal prior to treatment with rotational atherectomy. However, a lot of patients
      have frequent angina attacks and some patients develop serious complications including abrupt
      vessel closure during this period. Thus, immediate strategies cope with coronary dissection
      induced by balloon dilation is needed for the early recovery of those patients. The present
      study was performed to compare the safety and efficacy of immediate RA and delayed RA in the
      treatment with nondilatable calcified lesion complicated by coronary dissection.
