  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving erlotinib hydrochloride and
      cabozantinib-s-malate alone or in combination works as second or third line therapy in
      treating patient with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride and
      cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving erlotinib hydrochloride together
      with cabozantinib-s-malate is more effective than erlotinib hydrochloride or
      cabozantinib-s-malate alone in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) associated with patients treated with
      erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) versus (vs) erlotinib plus cabozantinib
      (cabozantinib-s-malate).

      II. To compare the PFS associated with patients treated with erlotinib vs cabozantinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival in the three treatment arms. II. To evaluate best objective
      response rate in the three treatment arms. III. To define the toxicity associated with each
      regimen. IV. To conduct correlative science studies that will help to select predictive
      biomarkers of response to therapy, including mesenchymal-epidermal transition (MET)
      expression and potentially other tissue biomarkers, plasma biomarkers, and bone scans.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM A (erlotinib): Patients receive erlotinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B (cabozantinib): Patients receive cabozantinib PO daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C (erlotinib+cabozantinib): Patients receive erlotinib as patients in Arm A and
      cabozantinib as patients in Arm B. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM Z: Patients achieving disease progression in Arm A or Arm B may receive erlotinib and
      cabozantinib as patients in Arm C. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
