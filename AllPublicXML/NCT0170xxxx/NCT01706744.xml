  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to investigate the following topics:

        1. Can discharge via the Intermediate Care Unit in Stjørdal, compared to direct discharge
           to Verdal Municipality, be equally effective in preventing aggravation of disease and
           loss of function for patients over 60 years that have been hospitalized in Levanger
           hospital?

        2. Are the cost by discharge to the Intermediate Care Unit in Stjørdal, when the hospital
           is not located in the same Municipality, comparable to the cost by direct discharge to
           the Municipality of Verdal, for patients over 60 years that have been hospitalized in
           Levanger hospital?

        3. Which issues are considered important by patients and health personnel during discharge,
           arrival and follow up in the Municipality, to ensure an optimal interaction between the
           involved units.
