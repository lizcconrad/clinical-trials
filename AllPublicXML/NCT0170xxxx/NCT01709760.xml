      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENIA11 in combination
      with methotrexate versus methotrexate alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ENIA11 in combination with methotrexate versus
      methotrexate alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

      Subject participation duration: A total of 28 weeks, including: 2 weeks of screening, 24
      weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of follow-up
