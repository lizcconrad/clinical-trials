    <textblock>
      This Clinical Trial is being conducted to study two adjunctive treatments for rotator cuff
      repair; soft tissue and bone trephination. &quot;Trephination&quot; is a procedure that involves making
      small perforations either in the torn tendon near its edge, or in the bone that the tendon is
      repaired to. The rotator cuff is repaired by sewing the tendon down to the bone in the
      shoulder. Trephination is a new technique that is used in addition to the standard method of
      repairing the rotator cuff tendon.

      This study will help to determine whether this technique improves the speed of healing, the
      strength and the re-tear rate of the repair. You are being asked to take part in this study
      because you have a tear of the rotator cuff that requires surgical treatment. A total of 90
      participants will participate in this study.

    <description>What is the difference in re-tear rate for cuff repair with adjunctive bone trephination, as measured by ultrasound, at six months and 24 months post-operatively, compared with adjunctive, pre-operative soft tissue trephination? What is the difference in the early healing reaction, as measured by T1 quantitative MRI, at 6 weeks post operatively?</description>

    <description>Ten days prior to the standard rotator cuff repair, a trephination procedure will be carried out. The trephination procedure will take approximately 30 minutes to complete and will be carried out under local anesthesia. A needle will be placed through the skin over the shoulder and either into the bone or into the edge of the cuff tendon, depending on whether you are allocated to the &quot;bone trephination&quot; or &quot;soft tissue trephination&quot; groups. The needle will be used to make 6 small holes in either bone or the tendon in the shoulder in the area where the cuff is to be repaired.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have failed standard non-surgical management of their rotator cuff tear,
             and who would benefit from a surgical repair of the cuff.

          -  Failed medical management will be defined as persistent pain and disability despite
             adequate standard non-operative management for 6 months.

        Medical management will be defined as:

          -  The use of drugs including analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

          -  Physiotherapy consisting of stretching, strengthening and local modalities
             (ultrasound, cryotherapy, etc)

          -  Activity modification

          -  Imaging, and intra-operative findings confirming a full thickness tear of the rotator
             cuff.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Characteristics of the cuff tear that render the cuff irrepairable: fatty infiltration
             in the muscles grade III (50%) or greater; superior subluxation of the humeral head;
             retraction of the cuff to the level of the glenoid rim.

          2. Partial thickness cuff tears.

          3. Significant shoulder comorbidities e.g. Bankart lesion, osteoarthritis

          4. Previous surgery on affected shoulder e.g. Previous rotator cuff repair.

          5. Patients with active worker's compensation claims

          6. Active joint or systemic infection

          7. Significant muscle paralysis

          9. Charcot's arthropathy

         10. Significant medical comorbidity that could alter the effectiveness of the surgical
             intervention (eg. Cervical radiculopathy, polymyalgia rheumatica)

         11. Major medical illness (life expectancy less then 1 year or unacceptably high operative
             risk)

         12. Unable to speak or read English/French

         13. Psychiatric illness that precludes informed consent

         14. Unwilling to be followed for 1 year
