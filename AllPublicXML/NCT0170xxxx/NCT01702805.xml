  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the TOP trial is to determine whether higher hemoglobin thresholds for
      transfusing ELBW infants resulting in higher hemoglobin levels lead to improvement in the
      primary outcome of survival and rates of neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) at 22-26 months
      of age, using standardized assessments by Bayley.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term outcomes of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) preterm infants, those weighing less
      than or equal to 1000 g at birth, are poor and pose a major health care burden. Virtually all
      of these infants are transfused, but at inconsistent hemoglobin (Hgb) thresholds.

      The investigators propose in TOP to randomize infants less than or equal to 1000 g BW and &lt;
      29 weeks GA to receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusions according to one of two strategies
      of Hgb thresholds, either a high Hgb (liberal transfusion) or a low Hgb (restrictive
      transfusion) algorithm. It is currently unknown which transfusion strategy is superior. TOP
      is powered to demonstrate which strategy reduces the primary outcome of death or
      neurodisability in survivors at 22-26 months.

      A secondary study entitled &quot;Effect of Blood Transfusion Practices on Cerebral and Somatic
      Oximetry&quot;, also known as the NIRS study, will determine differences in cerebral oxygenation
      and fractional tissue oxygen extraction with NIRS between high and low hemoglobin threshold
      groups during red blood cell transfusions. The investigators also propose to determine
      whether abnormal cerebral NIRS measures are a better predictor of NDI than hemoglobin alone
      and whether abnormal mesenteric NIRS measures are associated with the development of NEC
      within the 48 hours following a transfusion.
