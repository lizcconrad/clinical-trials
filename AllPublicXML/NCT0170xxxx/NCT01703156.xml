  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients are diagnosed with low risk ACS, and these individuals are at
      significant cardiovascular risk. Though guidelines recommend stress testing to manage low
      risk ACS patients, evidence supporting this recommendation is not based on trials examining
      this population. A well-designed, randomized trial is warranted to determine if stress
      testing is useful in managing low risk ACS. If medical therapy alone is equivalent as the
      investigators hypothesize, healthcare expenditures could be reduced and patients may not be
      exposed to the harms associated with more invasive cardiac testing such as coronary
      angiography.

    <description>Medical therapy will be implemented and will include the following: aspirin, clopidogrel, b-blockers, and statins. The dosages of aspirin, b-blocker and statin will be left to the discretion of the treating physician. Statins will be initiated irrespective of LDL unless contraindicated. Clopidogrel will be taken for at least one month and ideally up to one year. Sublingual nitroglycerin will be provided to all patients. Other anti-ischemic medications including long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and ranolazine may be provided at the treating physicians' discretion. If a patient has contraindications to any medications, they will not be administered. If a statin contraindication exists, other cholesterol-lowering medications may be administered. Appendix 4 shows the detailed management of low risk ACS patients randomized to the non-stress group.</description>

    <description>Medical therapy will be implemented and will include the following: aspirin, clopidogrel, b-blockers, and statins. Statins will be initiated irrespective of LDL unless contraindicated. Clopidogrel will be taken for at least one month and ideally up to one year. Sublingual nitroglycerin will be provided to all patients. Other anti-ischemic medications including long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and ranolazine may be provided at the treating physicians' discretion. If a statin contraindication exists, other cholesterol-lowering medications may be administered. All patients will undergo noninvasive stress testing. Results of individual stress tests will be reviewed by a cardiologist. Based on the myocardium deemed at risk and patient symptoms, further testing with angiography and revascularization using percutaneous techniques and/or coronary artery bypass grafting may be considered. Likewise, medical treatment may be adjusted.</description>
