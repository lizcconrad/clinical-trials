    <textblock>
      Calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, have improved allograft survival
      in kidney organ transplantation. Indeed, they have reduced the incidence of acute rejection
      episodes of cadaveric allograft recipients. Although marked progression has been made in
      initial survival rates, long-term kidney graft survival has yet to show such encouraging
      results. Because CNIs are associated with adverse effects, particularly nephrotoxicity, which
      contribute to declining organ function and eventual graft loss. In kidney transplants,
      progressive allograft dysfunction has been shown to develop in as many as 94% of patients by
      1 year.

      Therefore, reducing or eliminating the dose of CNIs to minimize nephrotoxicity must be
      balanced against the maintenance of adequate immunosuppression.

      Certican allows CNI dose reduction then provides renal function improvement and current PSI
      strategy point out that early intervention is important in managing the risk of CAN before it
      develops in both de novo and maintenance renal transplant recipients.

      To demonstrate Certican early introduction after 1 month provides better renal function with
      no change of efficacy compared to standard regimen, and also prevent delayed wound healing.
