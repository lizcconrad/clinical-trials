  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how easy it is for female HIV- positive
      subjects taking Complera to comply with the dietary requirement using a food diary in the
      short term (4 weeks) and long term (24 weeks and 48 weeks) and to determine association
      between calorie intake and virologic suppression. A secondary goal of the study is to
      evaluate subjects' attitudes towards contraception.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        HIV positive females ≥ 18 years of age who are currently on Complera with suppressed viral
        load (VL) defined as having VL &lt;50 copies/ml in the 6 months prior to study entry and no
        known resistance to FTC, TDF, or rilpivirine. Subjects may or may not be of child bearing
        potential.

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV-1 infection documented by HIV serology or detectable viral load at any point prior
             to study entry or other documentation confirming HIV infection. If no documentation is
             available to confirm HIV infection, a rapid test may be performed to document HIV
             infection.

          2. HIV+ female ≥18 years old and obtaining care at UNC Health Care Infectious Diseases
             Clinic, Wake County Human Services Clinic, or Durham County Early Intervention Clinic.
             Patients receiving care at other clinics may be entered with approval of the study
             team.

          3. HIV viral load (VL) &lt; 50 copies/ml as measured by any FDA-approved test for
             quantifying HIV-1 RNA during the six months prior to study entry (PSE). The timing of
             the viral load may be longer than 6 months depending on the schedule of the last
             clinic visit attended by the subject. The intent of the protocol was to assess viral
             load status at the previous clinic visit which may occur at an interval longer than
             six months due to the scheduling constraints of the UNC Infectious Diseases clinic.
             Viral loads drawn &gt; than 6 months (but not &gt; 8 months) prior to the study entry visit
             are acceptable. A single &quot;blip&quot; of &gt; 50 and &lt; 200 copies/ml is permissible provided
             the most recent VL is &lt;50 copies/ml.

          4. No documented resistance to FTC, TDF or rilpivirine. Note: genotyping will not be
             performed on study. Subjects with no historical genotype will be considered to have no
             documented resistance.

          5. Able and willing to provide informed consent.

          6. In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with study medication and
             procedures, including ability to complete food diary.

          7. Willing to receive monthly phone calls.

          8. Agreement between ID clinic provider and study team that clinical monitoring and care
             of patient will reside with the ID clinic provider. The study responsibility is
             limited to providing 48 weeks of Complera.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would be likely to interfere
             with ability to take the study medications appropriately and comply with the study
             protocol.

          2. Current active illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until the
             individual completes therapy or, in the opinion of the investigator, is clinically
             stable on therapy for at least 7 days prior to study entry.

          3. Acute viral hepatitis.

          4. Known allergy/hypersensitivity to components of the study drugs or their formulations.

          5. Current or expected use of medication on the prohibited medication list.
