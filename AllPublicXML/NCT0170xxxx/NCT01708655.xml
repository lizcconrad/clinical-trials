  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that measurement of beta adrenergic induced sweat rate using an
      evaporimeter can accurately and reliably determine different levels of CFTR dysfunction
      within a spectrum of patients expressing various degrees of cystic fibrosis disease.

      The investigators overall goal is to determine whether the evaporimeter technique of
      measuring beta-adrenergic induced sweat rate is capable of accurately and reliably
      identifying different levels of CFTR dysfunction, as a prerequisite before advancing this
      technique as biomarker assay into clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data show that following β-adrenergic stimulation, evaporimetry can reliably
      measure sweat secretion that is: highly reproducible in healthy controls; reduced by 50% in
      CF obligate heterozygotes; and absent in CF patients carrying severe mutations on both
      alleles. Further, test- retest experiments suggest good intra-individual reliability. All
      these features satisfy the required criteria for a biomarker assay that is capable of
      assessing small increments in CFTR function in vivo in clinical trials designed to assess the
      effectiveness of correctors and potentiators of CFTR channel activity. Therefore, to provide
      additional evidence of the value of this novel technique the investigators will determine the
      accuracy and reliability of evaporimetry to measure Beta-adrenergic induced sweating in
      subjects with a range of CFTR channel activity.

    <description>The response patterns will be interpreted and classified by the study PI, as consistent or inconsistent to the published standards. The obtained measurements will be compared to the results obtained from a recently finished validation trial. According to the result of this trial the ranges were as followed: cholinergic response for all subjects 60±20 Evaporimeter units, beta-adrenergic response: Healthy control 51 ± 20 heterozygote -22 ±20, CF -1.4 ±2.</description>
