  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective of this prospective, randomized and controlled study is to compare the performances
      of recently-released size 1 I-gel and size 1 PLMA proven to be superior to classical LMA with
      prospective studies. In this study, primer endpoint was value of airway leak pressure and
      secondary insertion time, insertion success and conditions, initial airway quality,
      hemodynamic parameters, fiberoptic view and complications will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      Routine monitorization will be performed. Lidocaine 1 mg.kg-1, remifentanil 1 mcg.kg-1 (slow
      bolus in approximately 1 minute) and 3 mg.kg-1 propofol will be administered in anaesthesia
      induction.

      In Group P, PLMA with fully deflated cuff and applied water-based lubricant, will be inserted
      using a metal introducer. After insertion, cuff will be inflated with a recommended volume of
      air and then cuff pressure will be adjusted to 60 cm H2O with manometer.

      In Group I, I-gel with its cuff lubricated will be orally inserted along the hard palate
      until resistance will be felt, as recommended by the manufacturer.

      The time between picking up the prepared PLMA (with introducer and deflated cuff) or I-gel
      and the appearance of the first stable capnographic trace will be recorded as the insertion
      time. The conditions for insertion will be ere scored according to mouth (1: full, 2:
      partial, 3: nil), gagging or coughing (1: nil, 2: slight, 3: gross), swallowing (1: nil, 2:
      slight, 3: gross), head or limb movement (1: nil, 2: slight, 3: gross), laryngospasm (1: nil,
      2: slight, 3: complete) and ease of insertion (1: easy, 2: difficult, 3: impossible).

      Fresh gas flow will be adjusted to 3 L.min-1, and after closing the expiratory valve the
      airway pressure at which an audible leak in the mouth occurred will recorded as the 'Pleak'.
      When Pleak reach 35 cm H2O, expiratory valve will be opened.

      Anatomical position of airway device will viewed by inserting fiberoptic bronchoscope through
      the ventilation tube.

      Complications encountered during and at the end of the operation such as desaturation (sPO2
      less than 90%), gastric insufflation, aspiration, laryngospasm, bronchospasm and blood stain
      on the airway device during removal will be recorded.

    <description>The time between picking up the device and the appearance of the first stable capnographic trace will be recorded as the insertion time. The conditions for insertion were scored according to mouth (1: full, 2: partial, 3: nil), gagging or coughing (1: nil, 2: slight, 3: gross), swallowing (1: nil, 2: slight, 3: gross), head or limb movement (1: nil, 2: slight, 3: gross), laryngospasm (1: nil, 2: slight, 3: complete) and ease of insertion (1: easy, 2: difficult, 3: impossible).</description>

    <measure>Initial airway quality</measure>
    <time_frame>During maintainance of anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>Initial airway quality will be evaluated with manual ventilation by adjusting APL valve to 20 cm H2O. Evaluation will be performed with a scale as excellent (no leaks heard), good/acceptable (a slight, clinically insignificant leak, sufficient ventilation) and poor/unacceptable (significant leak and insufficient ventilation which requires reposition or relocation of device) by listening to lungs, epigastrium and perilaryngeal field and observing the expansion of thorax.</description>

    <description>The breathing system will be disconnected and fiberoptic bronchoscope will be inserted through the ventilation tube to evaluate glottic view. Fiberoptic images will be recorded by using a digital camera. The images will be graded according to the score of 1 to 5.</description>
