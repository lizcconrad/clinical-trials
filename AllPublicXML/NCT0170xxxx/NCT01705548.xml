    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of hypofractionated radiosurgery in
      treating patients with large brain metastasis. Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays
      directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving fractionated
      stereotactic radiosurgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To demonstrate the safety and feasibility of treating brain metastases or resection cavities
      greater than 3 cm with hypofractionated radiosurgery and to determine the maximum-tolerated
      radiation dose for hypofractionated radiosurgery (HR) delivered in 5 fractions, 2-3 fractions
      per week.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery 2-3 times weekly (5 fractions
      total) for 2-3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3
      months thereafter.

    <description>HR (Hypofractionated Radiosurgery) delivered in 5 fractions, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 fractions being delivered per week, to patients with brain metastases or resection cavity greater than 3 cm and less than 6 cm.

A 4 month observation period will occur for each completed cohort prior to dose escalation, with a goal timeline for trial completion of 4 years from first patient enrollment.</description>
