  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nocturnal leg cramps (NLC) are painful, involuntary contractions of muscles occurring at
      rest, mostly at night. A Cochrane review on leg cramps in pregnancy showed some potential
      benefits in trials of magnesium. This is a single center, prospective, randomized, double
      blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that aims to investigate the effect of treatment
      with Magnox 520® (un-organic granular magnesium complex, composed of Magnesium Oxide &amp;
      Magnesium Oxide Monohydrate 865mg, Provides 520 mg of free elemental Mg++) on frequency and
      severity of NLC, quality of sleep and quality of life. Hypothesis: Magnox 520® may reduce the
      number and severity of NLC; an improvement in the quality of life and quality of sleep may
      ensue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ads in the local media and pharmacies will invite individuals afflicted by NLC to participate
      in the study. Each participating individual will undergo two weeks of eligibility screening
      followed by 4-week double-blind treatment. The number, severity and duration of NLC will be
      measured daily as documented in a designated, structured sleep dairy. Quality of life and
      quality of sleep will be assessed by SF-36 and PSQI questionnaires, respectively, to be
      completed twice - at enrollment and within one week of the end of the treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Signed informed consent before any procedure or assessment is done. Age over 21 years old.
        Over 4 episodes of documented NLC during 2 weeks of eligibility screening (for the
        treatment phase).
