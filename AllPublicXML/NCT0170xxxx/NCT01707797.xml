  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop a questionnaire that can be used to help uncover a child's risk of
      developing dental caries (also known as tooth decay or a cavity). The aim is to develop a
      practical and easily-scored risk tool that a primary medical care provider can use to help
      find young children with the highest risk for developing cavities.

    <description>Outcomes will be defined at the participant level.
Presence of any caries at baseline (defined as ICDAS ≥ 3, filling, or missing due to caries).
Incidence (ICDAS ≥ 3, filling, or missing due to caries) and/or progression (change from ICDAS= 3 or 4 to ICDAS=5 or 6, or filling, or missing due to caries) of any caries lesions at the follow-up examinations.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of any caries at baseline (defined as ICDAS &gt; 0, which includes all early caries, filling, or missing due to caries). Presence of any caries at baseline (defined as ICDAS ≥ 5, which includes only frank cavitation, filling, or missing due to caries)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence and/or progression of any caries lesions at the follow-up examinations.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence and/or progression of any caries lesions at the follow-up examinations. Progression is defined as change from ICDAS=0 to ICDAS=1 or higher, or filling, or missing due to caries; change from ICDAS=1 or 2 to ICDAS=3 or higher, or filling, or missing due to caries; or change from ICDAS=3 or 4 to ICDAS=5 or 6, or filling, or missing due to caries.
Incidence of any caries lesions at the follow-up examinations. Because only distinct cavitation is included at baseline, no progression outcomes from baseline to follow-up will be defined.</description>

    <description>Counts of the number of carious surfaces (dmfs), using ICDAS ≥ 3 to define decayed surfaces.
Counts of the number of carious surfaces (dmfs), using ICDAS &gt; 0 to define decayed surfaces.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adults

          -  If Primary Caregiver is the Parent/Legal guardian: The parent/legal guardian must
             provide written informed consent for the child and her/himself (if s/he is the primary
             caregiver) prior to participation.

          -  If Primary Caregiver is not the Parent/Legal Guardian: If another individual is the
             primary caregiver, then this individual must provide written informed consent for
             her/himself prior to participation.

          -  The parent/legal guardian and the participating primary caregiver must each be at
             least 18 years old or an emancipated minor

          -  The parent/legal guardian must consent and allow examination of the oral cavity of
             her/his child. The primary caregiver must complete the caries risk assessment
             questionnaire.

          -  The primary caregiver must be willing to participate, anticipate being the child's
             primary caregiver during the study period, and anticipate being available for all
             examinations (baseline, 18 month follow up, and 36 month follow up), in addition to
             intermediate contacts in between examinations.

        Children

          -  Child must be 9-15 months of age at the time of the baseline study visit.

          -  Child must be generally healthy (i.e., no current medical condition that makes it
             difficult for her/him to receive a dental examination).

          -  Child must allow examination of the oral cavity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Adults

          -  A participant pair (adult-child) who demonstrates an inability to comply with study
             protocol requirements will be excluded - this determination will be at the Site
             Primary Investigator's discretion.

          -  Non-English, non-Spanish reading/speaking individuals will be excluded, as they will
             not be able to comprehend the consent document or complete the risk questionnaire.

        Children

          -  Children who are in foster care at study initiation will be excluded, due to the
             likelihood that their primary caregiver will change multiple times during the length
             of the study.

          -  Need for antibiotic and/or sedative premedication prior to dental exam.

          -  Uncontrolled epilepsy.

          -  Active cancer treatment.

          -  Unrepaired congenital heart defects that would require premedication prior to dental
             exam.
