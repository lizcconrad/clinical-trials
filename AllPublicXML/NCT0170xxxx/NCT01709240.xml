  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the BioWeld1 System
      procedure for surgical incision closure of the skin in women scheduled for elective C-section
      procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In every surgical procedure, there is a need to close the incision that was made. Current
      methods for incision closure include stitching, gluing and stapling. Some of these methods
      are time consuming, have potential for infection and may leave a significant scar. The
      bioWeld1 technology suggests a new approach for incision closure. It is a novel medical
      device that consists of a Chitosan film and the BioWeld1 plasma ejecting device. The Chitosan
      film is intended to be applied to the skin incision, while the BioWeld1device is used for
      welding the Chitosan to the skin by means of cold plasma technology.
