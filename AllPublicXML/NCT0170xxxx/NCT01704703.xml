        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Competent to understand, sign and date an IEC-approved informed consent form.

          2. Men or women 18 years of age or older at the time the written informed consent is
             obtained.

          3. Histologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum Wild-Type
             RAS (No mutation) with at least 1 measurable metastatic lesion following RECIST
             criteria v 1.1 and initially irresectable (non suitable for radical surgery at the
             inclusion time).

          4. Obtention of DNA from tumor tissue blocks sent to central lab (ICO) that is amenable
             for highly sensitive techniques

          5. Previous irinotecan based chemotherapy +/- bevacizumab for metastatic CCR during at
             least 6 weeks.

          6. Irinotecan based chemotherapy does not need to be the most recent chemotherapy
             administrated. There are no restrictions on numbers of treatments lines before study
             inclusion.

          7. Disease progression during irinotecan treatment or within 6 months after irinotecan
             treatment.

          8. Karnofsky status ≥ 70% .

          9. Adequate bone marrow, hepatic, renal and metabolic functions,

               1. Adequate bone marrow function: neutrophils ≥ 1.5x109/ L; platelets ≥ 100x109/L;
                  hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL.

               2. Hepatic functions as follows: total bilirubin count ≤ 1.5 x ULN; ALAT and ASAT ≤
                  2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN in case of liver metastasis).

               3. Renal function: creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min (according Cockcroft y Gault
                  formulae)

               4. Metabolic functions: magnesium ≥ lower limit of normal (LIN)

         10. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior malignant tumor in the last 5 years, except a history of basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin or pre-invasive cervical cancer.

          2. Unresolved toxicities from prior systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, does not qualify the patient for inclusion.

          3. Documented or suspected central nervous system metastases.

          4. Any previous antitumoral treatment (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation
             treatment, surgery, immunotherapy, biologic therapy) ≤ 28 days before study inclusion.

          5. Significant cardiovascular disease including unstable angina or myocardial infarction
             within 12 months before initiating study treatment or a history of ventricular
             arrhythmia.

          6. Prior anti-EGFr antibody therapy (eg, Cetuximab) or treatment small molecule EGFr
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, Erlotinib). Subjects who discontinue their first dose
             of anti-EGFR therapy (Cetuximab) because of an infusion reaction may participate in
             this clinical trial.

          7. Paraffin-embedded tissue or unstained tumor slides from primary or metastatic tumor
             not available or quality ADN not available for biomarker determination by highly
             sensitive techniques.

          8. History of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis or evidence of interstitial
             pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis.

          9. Treatment for systemic infection within 14 days before study inclusion.

         10. Acute or sub-acute intestinal occlusion and /or active inflammatory bowel disease or
             other bowel disease causing chronic diarrhoea (defined as &gt; 4 loose stools per day).

         11. History of Gilbert's syndrome or dihydropyrimidine deficiency.

         12. History of any medical condition that may increase the risks associated with study
             participation or may interfere with the interpretation of the study results.

         13. Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis C virus, and
             chronic active hepatitis B infection.

         14. Subject allergic to the ingredients of the study medication or to Staphylococcus
             protein A.

         15. Any co-morbid disease that would increase risk of toxicity.

         16. Any kind of disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give written
             informed consent and/or comply with the study procedures.

         17. Subject who is pregnant or breast feeding.

         18. Surgery (excluding diagnostic biopsy or central venous catheter placement) ≤ 28 days
             prior study inclusion.

         19. Woman or man of childbearing potential not consenting to use adequate contraceptive
             precautions.

         20. Subject unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements.
