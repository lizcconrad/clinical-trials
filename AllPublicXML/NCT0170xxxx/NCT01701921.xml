      The purpose of this study is to determine whether pregabalin is effective in the treatment of
      acute postoperative pain after cardiac surgery if administered before the surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregabalin was introduced as an antiepileptic drug with analgesic anti-hyperalgesic and
      anxiolytic properties and was also used to treat neuropathic pain. In recent years it has
      been used as part of a multimodal management of acute postoperative pain after various types
      of surgery. We study the effect of pregabalin administered before cardiac surgery on acute
      and chronic postoperative pain. Post CABG syndrome is well known since 1980 and various
      analgesic methods have been used from time to time (opioids, regional analgesia,
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). In our research patients will be divided into three
      groups. The control group will receive a placebo capsule before surgery. The second group
      will receive 75mg of pregabalin per os before surgery while the third will receive 150mg of
      pregabalin. After the surgery all patients will be connected to an intravenous PCA morphine
      pump for 48 hours. The postoperative pain will be assessed with the Visual Analogue Scale
      (0-10) every day. Total morphine consumption by the patients as well as any other pain
      medications administered supplementary will be registered and compared between the different
      groups. Remaining postoperative pain will be assessed after 3 months. The results will be
      statistically analyzed in order to determine whether there is significant difference in pain
      management between the groups.
