  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK, the
      action of a drug in the body over a period of time) of multiple intravenous (IV)
      administrations of CNTO 136 in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE). The secondary goal of this study was to assess the
      pharmacodynamics (biochemical and physiological effects of a drug and the mechanisms of
      action), immune response, and clinical response.

      In Part A of this study, patients with CLE were randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to
      receive multiple IV doses of CNTO 136, a human anti-IL 6 monoclonal antibody (an immune
      protein that binds to interleukin 6) or placebo (a substance that appears identical to the
      treatment and has no active ingredients). Patients and study personnel did not know the
      identity of the administered treatments (double-blind study). Increasing doses were given,
      based on safety data collected during the initial weeks of treatment. In Part B, which was
      also double-blind, patients with SLE were randomly assigned to receive multiple IV doses of
      the highest well-tolerated dose, as determined in Part A, of CNTO 136, or placebo.
