      One of the main success factors in acne therapy is user compliance with treatment, product
      cost, availability and ease of use. Poor compliance may translate into decreased efficacy
      (either not improving symptoms well enough or not improving symptoms fast enough),
      tolerability issues or adverse effects (eg, erythema, dryness, or peeling of the skin), a
      lack of understanding of the instructions for use, or product cost/availability. Whatever the
      reason, poor compliance translates to decreased efficacy and increased frustration on the
      part of the user.

      The current study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MAXCLARITY II, an over the
      counter, topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) product line, in subjects with acne.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is an extremely common dermatological disease that is found typically in
      adolescence and young adulthood. Acne vulgaris manifests with open and closed comedones
      (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts on the face, neck, and
      trunk. Scarring can occur, particularly if the lesions are inflamed and deep, even in the
      absence of external manipulation (eg, picking and squeezing) of the skin.

      Acne vulgaris can be treated with a variety of agents that are selected to address the
      pathogenic factors assumed to be responsible for the type and degree of manifested acne
      lesions. Monotherapy and combination therapy regimens are both useful. Topical agents are
      generally used as first-line therapy and include retinoids, antibiotic preparations (eg,
      erythromycin and clindamycin), benzoyl peroxide (BPO), alpha and beta hydroxy acids (eg,
      glycolic and salicylic acid preparations), and azelaic acid. Systemic therapies are initiated
      in patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne that does not respond to topical
      therapy.

      Benzoyl peroxide has antimicrobial and anti inflammatory properties and is often considered
      an important component of acne treatment. Benzoyl peroxide is frequently the first product
      that adolescents will use for acne because it can be purchased without a prescription in
      several different concentrations and formulations.

      One of the main success factors in acne therapy is user compliance with treatment, product
      cost, availability and ease of use. Poor compliance may translate into decreased efficacy
      (either not improving symptoms well enough or not improving symptoms fast enough),
      tolerability issues or adverse effects (eg, erythema, dryness, or peeling of the skin), a
      lack of understanding of the instructions for use, or product cost/availability. Whatever the
      reason, poor compliance translates to decreased efficacy and increased frustration on the
      part of the user.

      The current study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of MAXCLARITY II, an over the
      counter, topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO) product line, in subjects with acne.

      This is a multi center, open label study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      MAXCLARITY II, an over the-counter, topical benzoyl peroxide product line, in subjects with
      acne. Approximately 30 subjects, aged from 16 to 29 years, inclusive, with mild facial acne
      vulgaris are expected to participate in the study. No more than 50% of the subjects at each
      site can be enrolled under the age of 20.

      An expert grader will complete counts of inflamed lesions (papules/pustules) and noninflamed
      lesions (open/closed comedones), the ISGA, and an assessment of tolerability at each study
      visit. Subjects will assess tolerability at each study visit and will complete a product
      acceptability and preference questionnaire at the end of the study.

      The study duration will be 8 weeks (56 days) with visits at baseline (day 1), week 1, week 2,
      week 4 and week 8.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any
             protocol specific procedures are performed.

          2. Male or female aged from 16 to 29 years, inclusive, at time of consent. No more than
             50% of the subjects at each site can be enrolled under the age of 20.

          3. Mild facial acne vulgaris, characterized by at least 24 facial inflammatory lesions
             (papules and pustules) and/or noninflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) on
             the face.

          4. Able to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.

          5. Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception while receiving
             protocol-assigned product. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who is
             biologically capable of becoming pregnant; including perimenopausal women who are less
             than 2 years from their last menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the
             following:

               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal
                  contraception has been completed.

               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.
                  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a
                  reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has never given birth
                  naturally. The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of
                  acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly.
                  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods
                  of contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal
                  sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception. A barrier method or sterilization plus spermatocide is acceptable.

               -  Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically
                  accepted method of contraception should she become sexually active while
                  participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female who is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breast feeding.

          2. Has active or chronic skin allergies.

          3. Has a history of acute or chronic disease that might interfere with or increase the
             risk of study participation.

          4. Had skin cancer treatment in preceding 12 months.

          5. Has damaged skin on facial areas (eg, sunburn, tattoo, or scar)

          6. Had any medical procedure (eg, laser resurfacing, chemical peel, or plastic surgery)
             on facial areas in preceding 12 months.

          7. Had any cosmetic procedure (eg, microdermabrasion) on facial areas within 8 weeks of
             the baseline visit.

          8. Has any dermatological disorder that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere
             with the accurate evaluation of the subject's facial appearance.

          9. Received any investigational drug or procedure within 28 days of the baseline visit or
             is scheduled to receive an investigational drug (other than the study products) or
             procedure during the study.

         10. Currently using any medication that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the
             evaluation of the study products or place the subject at undue risk (including but not
             limited to asthma medications, oral steroids, rifampin, anticonvulsants, and St John's
             wart).

         11. Has a history of known or suspected intolerance to any of the ingredients of the study
             products (ie, benzoyl peroxide).

         12. Considered unable or unlikely to attend the necessary visits.

         13. Live in the same household as currently enrolled subjects.

         14. Employee of the investigator, a contract research organization, or Stiefel
             Laboratories who is involved in the study, or an immediate family member (partner,
             offspring, parents, siblings or sibling's offspring) of an employee involved in the
             study.

          <description>The eligible participants applied a small amount of the MAXCLARITY II 2.5 % benzyl peroxide foam cleanser and foam treatment, 0.5% salicylic acid toner foam. Participants applied foam cleanser each morning to the dampened skin and gently massaged over whole face followed by thorough wash with warm water. The participants then applied small amount of MAXCLARITY II foam treatment in a thin layer to the entire face (avoiding the eyes, lips, and mouth) each morning. In the evening the participants washed their face with MAXCLARITY II Foam cleanser and then applied MAXCLARITY II toner foam to the face each evening. Study products were applied once daily for 8 weeks. If any dose was missed, the next dose was administered according to original schedule.</description>

Each type of lesion was counted separately; the lesion counts were taken from the face from hairline to the mandible (including forehead, cheeks, and chin). Total lesion counts were calculated as the sum of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. Percent change from Baseline to Week 8 was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the value at Baseline divided by the Baseline value multiplied by 100.

In the evening the participants washed their face with MAXCLARITY II Foam cleanser and then applied MAXCLARITY II toner foam to the face each evening. Study products were applied once daily for 8 weeks. If any dose was missed, the next dose was administered according to original schedule.</description>

        <description>Redness, dryness, burning, itching and scaling were evaluated independently by the participant on a five point scale ranged from 0 to 4 defined as 0-none, 1-very minimal, 2-mild, 3-moderate, 4-severe. Change from Baseline to specified time point (Weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8) was calculated as the value at specified time point minus the value at Baseline.

            <description>The eligible participants applied a small amount of the MAXCLARITY II 2.5 % benzyl peroxide foam cleanser and foam treatment, 0.5% salicylic acid toner foam. Participants applied foam cleanser each morning to the dampened skin and gently massaged over whole face followed by thorough wash with warm water. The participants then applied small amount of MAXCLARITY II foam treatment in a thin layer to the entire face (avoiding the eyes, lips, and mouth) each morning. In the evening the participants washed their face with MAXCLARITY II Foam cleanser and then applied MAXCLARITY II toner foam to the face each evening. Study products were applied once daily for 8 weeks. If any dose was missed, the next dose was administered according to original schedule.</description>
