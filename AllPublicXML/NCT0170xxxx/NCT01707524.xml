  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CA) with
      a trans-radial approach (TRA), specifically comparing access via the left versus right radial
      artery in patients with suggested clinical predictors of TRA failure/difficult. These
      predictors include age &gt;70, female gender, height &lt;64 inches, and history of hypertension.The
      study also aims to determine difficulties encountered during left or right radial access in
      this specific patient population. A secondary aim is to compare the results of enrolled
      patients with a registry of patients where femoral access was obtained.

      Currently more than 1 million percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are performed in the
      United States annually. There is a growing trend to perform procedures utilizing the TRA due
      to recent data demonstrating decreased bleeding and access-site complications compared to the
      femoral approach. However, the TRA approach is also know to be associated with greater
      radiation exposure compared to the femoral approach. Furthermore, the TRA to catheterization
      may be difficult in certain populations because of anatomic considerations. Though
      traditionally completed via canalization of the right radial artery (RRA) due to feasibility
      with room setup, left radial artery (LRA) access may be superior due to the shorter distance
      needed to reach the ascending aorta and bypassing the tortuosity of the right subclavian
      artery. Given the benefits of the TRA, it is important to determine how left versus right
      radial artery access affects parameters of radiation exposure in addition to procedural
      difficulty.

      This study will be a prospective, randomized study of patients with suggested predictors of
      TRA failure/difficulty referred for coronary angiography. Patients referred for coronary
      angiography using the trans-radial approach will be randomly assigned to obtain arterial
      access via the right or left radial artery. A registry of patients referred for coronary
      angiography using the trans-femoral approach will be compiled. The primary outcome measure
      will be radiation exposure as measured by dose area product output from the coronary
      angiography system. Secondary measures will include the total fluoroscopy time, total dose of
      radiation, number of catheters used, and incidence of subclavian tortuosity. In addition,
      procedural complications and success rates will also be evaluated.
