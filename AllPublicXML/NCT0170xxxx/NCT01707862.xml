  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) with intracardiac extension is a rare benign smooth muscle
      tumor. Reviewing literature, intracardiac extension of the IVL has been reported in at least
      70 cases. Most are individual case reports. Surgical experience is not much. However,
      different opinion of surgical strategies remain controversial. The purpose of this report is
      to describe our experience of surgical management for the IVL with intracardiac extension.
