    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies capecitabine and celecoxib in treating patients with solid
      malignancies that are metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving capecitabine and
      celecoxib together may be an effective treatment for solid malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) (primarily minimum concentration [Cmin],
      maximum concentration [Cmax], and area under the curve [AUC]) of celecoxib on day 7 of
      monotherapy versus on day 14 of concomitant administration with capecitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a celecoxib PK drug interaction model using longitudinal data and determine
      whether the results are concordant with results from the primary objective.

      II. To assess the impact of known cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) pharmacogenetic variants with
      reduced enzyme activity (CYP2C9*2 and *3) on the between subject variability in celecoxib PK.

      III. To assess tumor response by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST,
      version 1.1) and explore whether there is any correlation between celecoxib PK and response.

      IV. To assess toxicity by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version
      4.0) and explore whether there is any correlation between celecoxib PK and toxicities related
      to either celecoxib or capecitabine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 7 days (course 0) and then on
      days 1-21 of course 1 and all subsequent courses. Patients also receive capecitabine PO BID
      on days 1-14 beginning in course 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
