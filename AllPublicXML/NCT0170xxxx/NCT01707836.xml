      This study will analyze DNA samples to determine associations between maternal and offspring
      genetic factors and pediatric brain tumor development in children with Neurofibromatosis Type
      1. Participating families (mother, father, child) will be asked to complete a short
      questionnaire and provide DNA samples (either saliva or blood). The information gained from
      your participation may one day help doctors develop strategies to reduce brain tumor risk in
      individuals with NF1. Please note: there is no therapy associated with this study.

    <textblock>
      The prenatal period is a developmentally vulnerable time point during which environmental
      conditions, including nutrition, can have life-long impacts on health.1,2 This is
      particularly relevant to many childhood cancers that are thought to initiate during
      pregnancy.3 As a consequence, there has been intense interest in whether prenatal exposures
      can modulate childhood cancer risk.4-6 It is important to recognize that both maternal and
      offspring genetic factors including those in nutritional pathways may play an important role
      in pediatric cancer risk through their effect on the child's exposure to nutrients important
      in development during the prenatal period. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate
      whether there are any maternal or offspring genetic factors in the folate pathway that may
      contribute to the development of brain tumors in children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1
      through analysis of DNA samples collected from families.
