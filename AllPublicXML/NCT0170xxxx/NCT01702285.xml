  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of orally
      administered CUDC-101 in cancer patients, and to determine a dose for further testing. This
      study will also determine how well CUDC-101 is absorbed into the blood after being given
      orally, assess CUDC-101 blood levels and what happens to the study drug in the body, and
      study how the body reacts to the study drug and what effects it has on tumors. CUDC-101 has
      been administered to cancer patients as an intravenous (IV) infusion in other research
      studies, but has not been studied when given orally.

          1. Subjects with a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor.

          2. Subjects must have no further standard of care options.

          3. Measurable or non-measurable disease

          4. Age ≥ 18 years
