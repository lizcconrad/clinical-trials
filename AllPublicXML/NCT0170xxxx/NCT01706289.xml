      Exploring the relationship between serum VAP-1 and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing recently, especially in the urban area of
      developing countries. Subjects with diabetes have higher rate of hospitalization and have
      higher mortality. Diabetes results in various complications including diabetic retinopathy,
      nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular complications. Among these, cardiovascular
      autonomic neuropathy is one of clinical important complication of diabetes. Diabetic subjects
      with reduced cardiovascular autonomic function have been shown to strongly associate with an
      increased risk of silent myocardial ischemia and increased mortality. They also have higher
      risk of sudden death, intraoperative and perioperative cardiovascular instability. Formation
      of advanced glycation end product (AGE) and oxidative stress are important causes of diabetic
      neuropathy. Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), an adhesion molecule with an activity of
      semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases (SSAO), which can catalyze endogenous amines to
      produces corresponding aldehydes, H2O2, and ammonia. We have demonstrated that serum VAP-1 is
      a source of systemic AGE and oxidative stress, and is associated with nephropathy and
      atherosclerosis. There are reports demonstrating that subjects with diabetic retinopathy or
      stroke have higher serum VAP-1. To our best knowledge, there is no report regarding the
      relationship between serum VAP-1 and neuropathy. In present study, we will measure serum
      VAP-1 and check cardiovascular autonomic function. We will also explore the relationship
      between serum VAP-1 and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.
