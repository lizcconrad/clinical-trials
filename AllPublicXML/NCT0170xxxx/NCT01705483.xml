  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      ASP9853 combined with docetaxel or with paclitaxel in subjects with advanced non-hematologic
      malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study. Part 1 will test increasing dose levels of ASP9853 in combination
      with docetaxel. Part 2 will test increasing doses of ASP9853 combined with paclitaxel. Each
      part will determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose for ASP9853 in
      combination with each taxane. Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of ASP9853 in
      combination with docetaxel or with paclitaxel also will be explored.
