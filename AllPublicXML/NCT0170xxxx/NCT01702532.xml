    <textblock>
      Nicotine mouth film is a new dosage form of nicotine replacement therapy. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate the craving relief efficacy of nicotine mouth film by comparing mint
      nicotine mouth film to nicotine lozenge in light smokers using the provoked craving model.
      The cues used to provoke a craving episode will be the sight and smell of a lit cigarette and
      the manipulations required to light a cigarette. The smokers will be denied access to
      cigarettes for 4 hours prior to the provoked craving session in order to precipitate nicotine
      withdrawal and an increase level of cigarette craving.

    <description>Participants completed a cigarette craving assessment consisting of the following five items: &quot;I have a desire for a cigarette right now; If it were possible I would smoke right now; All I want right now is a cigarette; I have an urge for a cigarette; I crave a cigarette right now. All participants indicated craving intensity on a pre-drawn 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (disagree) to 100 (agree). The average of the scores over the five items was defined as craving score for each time point.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI within the range of 19-35 kg/m2;

          -  Current cigarette smokers who have smoked regularly daily for at least a year,

          -  Participants who smoke their first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to nicotine (or closely related
             compounds) or any of the stated ingredients in formulation.

          -  Any participant whose CO level rises during the sequestration period (i.e., the
             subject's two expired CO assessments immediately prior to the provoked craving
             paradigm are higher than the mean baseline CO assessment) and, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may have smoked during that time.

        <title>The Change From Pre-dose Post-provocation in Craving Score at 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 Minutes</title>
        <description>Participants completed a cigarette craving assessment consisting of the following five items: “I have a desire for a cigarette right now; If it were possible I would smoke right now; All I want right now is a cigarette; I have an urge for a cigarette; I crave a cigarette right now. All participants indicated craving intensity on a pre-drawn 100 mm VAS ranging from 0 (disagree) to 100 (agree). The average of the scores over the five items was defined as the craving score for each time .</description>
