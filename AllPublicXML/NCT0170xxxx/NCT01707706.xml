    <textblock>
      This is a randomized single-blinded controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three groups. One is the traditional acupuncture treatment group, one is the
      non-traditional acupuncture treatment group and the other is an acupuncture-like placebo
      treatment. Patients will be put into groups and then compared. The chance of getting into
      each group is 2:2:1.

    <description>Patients will be treated at bilateral Ear Shenmen, Sishencong EX-HN1, Anmian, Neiguan PC6, Shenmen HT7, Sanyinjiao SP6, and unilateral Yintang EX-HN3 and Baihui GV20. Acupuncture treatment will be performed by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner. &quot;De qi&quot;(an irradiating feeling considered to be indicative of effective needling) is achieved if possible. An electric-stimulator (ITO ES160, Japan) is connected to these needles to give an electric-stimulation in continuous wave, frequency of 4 Hz, 0.4 ms square wave pulses and constant current. Surgical tape or hair pin will be adhered to the needles.The needles will be left for 30 min and then removed. Acupuncture treatment will consist of three sessions per week for 3 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated superficially at points away from classic acupoints. The points include bilateral &quot;Forearm&quot; [1 inch lateral to the middle point between HE3 and HE7] , &quot;Upper arm&quot; [1 inch lateral to LU 3 ], and &quot;Lower leg&quot; [0.5 inch dorsal to GB39]; for head, the non-acupoints include bilateral &quot;Head&quot; [middle point between GB8 and ST8], &quot;Forehead&quot; [middle point between ST8 and GB14], &quot;Neck&quot; [middle point between TB16 and SI17], and &quot;Ear&quot; [the point on the helix, inferior to the apex]. The points selected have been used in previous acupuncture studies as sham control. &quot;De qi&quot; is avoided during needling. The treatment procedure, electric-stimulation, frequency, duration and number of treatment sessions will be the same for the Traditional Acupuncture group.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Placebo Acupuncture</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Placebo needles designed by Streitberger (1998) will be used. The placebo needles are blunt needle that will not penetrate the skin during needle insertion. The handles of these placebo needles will slide over the needle when it is compressed, giving it the appearance of penetrating the skin. The placebo needles are inserted to the site 1 inch beside the acupoints in order to avoid the acupressure effect. The needles are held by a surgical tape or hair pin in hairy region to imitate the retention of needles. The needles are connected to an electric-stimulator with zero frequency and amplitude. The number, duration and frequency of the treatment sessions, and the intervention procedure will be the same for electro-acupuncture and placebo acupuncture.</description>
