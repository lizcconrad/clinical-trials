      The purpose of this study is to determine how difficult life-events that women experienced
      during their childhood might affect their babies.

      Women who are asked to participate in this study will fill out forms about their physical and
      mental health, have 3D ultrasounds of their baby's adrenal gland, have their stress responses
      measured and have their baby's development and stress responses assessed.

      The objectives of this study are to further our understanding of maternal prepubertal
      adversity on fetal and infant neuroendocrine development. This study utilizes 3-D ultrasound
      to measure fetal adrenal gland volume, a battery of psychosocial/behavioral assessments to
      determine the degree of maternal stress and prepubertal adversity, and an acoustic startle
      paradigm and Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) to assess maternal arousal. This study also
      utilizes an infant stress test to assess infant arousal.

    <description>At 8-17 weeks gestational age, 1,500 pregnant women will complete:
Adverse Childhood Events (ACE) Questionnaire;
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS);
A general health and demographic questionnaire.
All women who are screened will be asked if they would be willing to allow the study team to access their delivery report.
Women who report 0 or 1 adverse childhood experiences will be invited to continue in the study as part of the Women without Prepubertal Adversity cohort. We aim to have 125 women in this cohort.</description>

        Women from the greater Philadelphia and surrounding areas who are ages 18 - 45 and between
        8 and 17 weeks pregnant will be considered for enrollment into this study. All subjects
        must be physically healthy without a serious major medical illness, as well as be carrying
        a healthy fetus. Subjects will be recruited through fliers, advertising, and social media
        and may be directly approached at a University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) or UPHS
        affiliated obstetrics and gynecology clinic. We anticipate the composition of the proposed
        study population to reflect the greater Philadelphia referral base. The projected
        composition from Philadelphia is African American 42.58%, Hispanic 8.5%, Asian 4.42%, Other
        2.04% and White, not of Hispanic Origin, 42.46%.

        Additionally, we plan to include father's of the babies that are willing and able to
        complete the ACE questionnaire.
