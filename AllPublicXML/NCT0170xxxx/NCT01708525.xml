      Enrolled subjects undergo tissue labeling to evaluate the rate of collagen synthesis in
      tissue treated with the Ulthera® System compared to control tissue.

      This study is a prospective, single-center, blinded, non-randomized clinical trial. Two
      subjects who have chosen to have a surgical facelift procedure and agree to drink heavy water
      for tissue labeling, will be enrolled. Subjects will consume heavy water and collect saliva
      specimens over the course of the study period, following a specific heavy water labeling
      protocol. Two weeks after starting the heavy water protocol, subjects will return to the
      study site to receive one Ultherapy® treatment to the pre-auricular region on one side of the
      face. The contra-lateral pre-auricular region will serve as a control. Following Ultherapy®
      treatment, subjects will continue to follow the heavy water protocol for 4 more weeks.
      Subjects will then return to the study site to undergo resection of the treated and control
      tissue for analysis during their planned rhytidectomy procedure. Subjects will send in saliva
      samples on a weekly basis to allow for confirmation that they are drinking the heavy water.

    <description>A tissue labeling model via the consumption of the stable isotope, deuterated water (heavy water). Heavy water consumed over the course of the 6-week study period for a direct kinetic measure of in vivo collagen synthesis. 60 ml (about 12 teaspoons) of heavy water (also called deuterated water or 2H2O), was consumed three times a day for the first five days. Starting on Day 6, two 60 ml doses of heavy water were consumed per day for the remaining 37 days.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>A limitation of this trial includes only a two subject study population due to the extremely high expense of the tissue analyses conducted. High expense precluded further research in a randomized designed trial with a broader patient population.</limitations_and_caveats>
