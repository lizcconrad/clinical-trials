      This is an open label, exploratory study of simtuzumab (GS-6624) in adults infected with HIV,
      hepatitis C virus (HCV), or co-HIV/HCV with histological evidence of liver fibrosis.
      Participants will receive simtuzumab 700 mg intravenously every 2 weeks for a total of 24
      weeks (12 infusions) while continuing on standard therapy for HIV (HIV-infected subjects
      only).

               -  Failed to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) on a regimen containing a
                  direct-acting antiviral (DAA) in addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin
                  OR
