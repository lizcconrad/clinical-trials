  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that the effect of either multiple deep intramuscular stimulation
      therapy [(DIMMST: trigger point deep dry needling (TrP-DDN) is combined with paraspinal deep
      intramuscular stimulation (PDIMS) and needle rotation (NR)] would be more effective than a
      placebo-sham for the treatment of MPS and that DIMMST would be more effective than LTrP-I for
      improving pain relief, sleep quality, and physical and mental state of the patient.
