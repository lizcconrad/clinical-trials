  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, the investigators examined whether a relaxation response mind-body
      intervention could be effectively delivered to mixed groups of IBS and IBD patients and
      determined the effects of the intervention on quality of life, inflammatory markers, and gene
      expression using transcriptional profiling.

    <description>The IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) is a validated disease-specific instruments to assess the disease-specific impact of the intervention. The IBS-QOL is a self-reported quality of life (QOL) measure containing 34 questions specific to IBS that is used to assess the impact of IBS and its treatment on QOL.</description>

    <description>The IBS Symptom Severity Index (SSI) is a validated disease-specific instruments to assess the disease-specific impact of the intervention. The IBS SSI is a widely used questionnaire measuring IBS-related pain frequency, severity of pain, bloating, bowel habit dissatisfaction and interference with daily life and extra-colonic symptoms on a visual analogue scale.</description>

    <description>The IBD Questionnaire (IBD-Q) is a validated disease-specific instruments to assess the disease-specific impact of the intervention. The IBD-Q is designed to measure the effects of inflammatory bowel disease on daily function and quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Change between Baseline (week 0), Mid-intervention (week 5), Post-intervention (week 10), and Short-term Follow-up (week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure symptoms common to IBS and IBD, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y) was administered at each assessment. The STAI is a widely used instrument for measuring anxiety in adults. It differentiates between the temporary condition of &quot;state anxiety&quot; and the more general and long-standing quality of &quot;trait anxiety&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Change between Baseline (week 0), Mid-intervention (week 5), Post-intervention (week 10), and Short-term Follow-up (week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure symptoms common to IBS and IBD, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) was administered at each assessment. The PCS is widely used to assess cognitive and affective responses to pain and to evaluate pain management program outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>Change between Baseline (week 0), Mid-intervention (week 5), Post-intervention (week 10), and Short-term Follow-up (week 13)</time_frame>
    <description>To measure symptoms common to IBS and IBD the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was administered at each assessment. The BPI allows patients to rate the severity of their pain (BPI-S) and the degree to which their pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function (BPI-I).</description>

    <description>The Relaxation Response Mind-Body Intervention (RR-MBI) involved a 9-week group program conducted by a nurse practitioner or psychologist skilled in MBI, which included a GI-specific session conducted by a physician. The groups met once weekly for 1.5 hours. The program was multidimensional and included daily elicitation of the RR using a variety of methods (including breath focus, single-pointed focus, imagery, contemplation, yoga, and mindful awareness); cognitive reappraisal skills, health enhancing behaviors, and the promotion of optimism and acceptance. Throughout the course of treatment, participants were asked to elicit the RR at home each day for 15-20 minutes.</description>

The groups met once weekly for 1.5 hours. Three consecutive, mixed-disorder groups, ranging in size from 10 to 18 participants each. The program was multidimensional and included daily elicitation of the RR using a variety of methods (including breath focus, single-pointed focus, imagery, contemplation, yoga, and mindful awareness); cognitive reappraisal skills, health enhancing behaviors, and the promotion of optimism and acceptance.
