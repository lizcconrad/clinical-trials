  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial factors, including a previous history of depression, recent stressful life
      events, sleep disturbances during pregnancy, and depression and/or anxiety during pregnancy
      have been shown to be associated with an increased risk for the development of postpartum
      depression (PPD). Biological mechanisms underlying the relationships among these psychosocial
      risk factors for PPD, and the development of PPD, remain unclear. However, evidence from
      non-perinatal populations suggest that dysregulation in stress-reactive neuroendocrine
      factors may play a role. The primary objectives of this study are: (1) to assess the
      feasibility of enrolling second trimester pregnant women, with or without depression
      histories, into a laboratory-based study protocol which includes a mild psychosocial stressor
      and the collection of venous blood for the measurement of stress-reactive adrenocorticotropic
      hormone (ACTH) and cortisol; (2) to assess the feasibility of retaining participants, for a
      brief postpartum phone interview, after completion of the second trimester assessments; and
      (3) to establish proof of concept for measuring group differences, between women with or
      without depression histories, in second trimester prenatal measures of neuroendocrine stress
      reactivity, depressive and anxious symptoms, recent stressful life events, and sleep quality.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The investigators will use a two-group t-test, or a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for non-normal distributions, to test for group differences in prenatal depressive symptoms using the Endinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).</measure>
    <time_frame>The Endinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) will be administered during the enrollment visit, scheduled during gestational weeks 20-22.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The investigators will use a two-group t-test, or a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for non-normal distributions, to test for group differences in prenatal anxious symptoms using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), trait version.</measure>
    <time_frame>The trait version of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) will be administered during the enrollment visit, scheduled during gestational weeks 20-22.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The investigators will use a two-group t-test, or a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for non-normal distributions, to test for group differences in recent stressful life events (last 6 months) using the Life Events Scale (LES).</measure>
    <time_frame>The Life Events Scale (LES) will be administered during the enrollment visit, scheduled during gestational weeks 20-22.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The investigators will use a two-group t-test, or a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for non-normal distributions, to test for group differences in prenatal sleep quality (past 30 days) using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).</measure>
