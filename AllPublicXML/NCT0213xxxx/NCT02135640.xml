    <textblock>
      Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANKL that being investigated as a
      therapeutic agent in all bone diseases characterized by excessive bone resorption, such as
      primary and secondary osteoporosis, metastatic bone diseases, and other diseases involving
      bone loss associated with increases in osteoclast function. This will be a single-blind,
      placebo-controlled single-dose study. All subjects will be randomized to denosuamb 60 mg,
      denosumab 120 mg or placebo in a ration of 3:3:2. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of denosumab
      administered subcutaneously to healthy adults in China. The primary endpoints for safety are:
      subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, including clinically significant
      changes in physical examinations, laboratory safety tests, ECG and vital signs. The secondary
      endpoints are PK and PD (s-CTX1) parameter estimates.

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive, from date of birth, at the
             time of signing the informed consent.

          -  A positive test for syphilis at Screening.

          -  Abnormal serum calcium: current hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia. Albumin-adjusted serum
             calcium levels must be within the normal range of the central laboratory.
