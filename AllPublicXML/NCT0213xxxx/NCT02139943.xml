  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of administration of canagliflozin 100 mg
      and 300 mg, compared with placebo as an addition to insulin therapy for the treatment of Type
      1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo-controlled
      (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has
      a real effect) parallel-group, multicenter study of canagliflozin as an addition to insulin
      therapy for participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control.

      Approximately 330 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to either
      canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, or placebo groups. About 90 participants (30 per
      treatment group) will be selected for a substudy with a purpose of a continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) assessment for 7 days at baseline and 7 days at the end of treatment.

      The total duration of the participation will be about 22 weeks, during which participants
      will need to return to investigational sites for approximately 9 visits. During the study
      participants will receive advice on treatment of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis
      (DKA), as well as on compliance with diet and exercise.
