  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rilapladib is a potent and selective inhibitor of lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2
      (Lp-PLA2), which was previously under development for the treatment of atherosclerosis and is
      currently being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

      This study is a single-center, open-label, two-part study. The two study parts will run
      independently. Subjects dosed in one part of this study will not be permitted to participate
      in the other part.

      Part A will investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of rilapladib and its metabolites,
      SB-664601 and GSK1174379, after single dose and steady state dosing of rilapladib 250
      milligram (mg) along with the biliary and urinary elimination pathways of rilapladib 250 mg.
      Part B will determine the effect of repeat administration of itraconazole on the PK of a
      single oral dose of rilapladib 25 mg.

      Healthy male and female subjects, aged 18-65 years, will be recruited for this study. Ten
      subjects will be recruited for Part A and 20 subjects will be recruited for Part B.
