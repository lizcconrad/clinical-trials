  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of home telemonitoring as an intervention to decrease
      hospital readmissions in patients at high risk for readmission. The overall readmission rate
      for high-risk MCF hospital patients is approximately 20%. Currently a system is in place to
      identify and score all MCF patients for their risk of readmission. This score is based on
      multiple variables including but not limited to: co-morbid conditions, patient's health
      literacy, whether they are a Medicare/Medicaid patient, their in-home social support, and
      whether they have had prior hospital admissions within the previous year. The literature
      shows that home telemonitoring of patients has had mixed results for effectiveness at
      preventing hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Many of these reports have
      restricted studies to patients with specific diseases or general characteristics; some have
      shown improved results while others have not. No study has examined patients who are high
      risk for readmission to determine if home telemonitoring for 30 days post-discharge reduces
      the risk for 30-day readmission.

      We hope to enroll a total of 1900 participants, 950 in each arm, over the next 2 years. One
      arm will be the telemonitoring group and one arm will be the standard of care group.
      Participants will be in the study for 30 days. Participants in the telemonitoring group will
      receive a Telestation, blood pressure monitor, and pulse oximeter. If the participant also
      has congestive heart failure, they will receive a scale. All of these vital measurements are
      to be taken on a daily basis along with survey questions on how the patient feels. If set
      parameters are out of the normal range, a flag will trigger that requires follow
      up/intervention from a nurse by telephone. In some cases, the participant might need to come
      back in to see a physician through the outpatient clinic. The participant in the standard of
      care group will be contacted via phone 30 days after discharge to learn if they were
      readmitted to any hospitals or had any emergency room visits during the past 30 days. This
      data will be collected via Philips software and also entered into the RedCap database here at
      Mayo Clinic.
