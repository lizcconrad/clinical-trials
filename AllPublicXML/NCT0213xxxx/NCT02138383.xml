  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out the dose of enzalutamide that can be safely
      given with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
      Researchers also want to find out the side effects of these drugs when given together. This
      study will help in finding out the effect on tumor of the combination of enzalutamide,
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. In the first part of the study, different doses of
      enzalutamide will be tested. In the second part of the study, all patients will be started at
      the same dose of enzalutamide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma that is metastatic or unresectable. In the dose expansion phase, the
             tumor must express Androgen Receptor (AR) by immunohistochemistry. If ≥1% of the tumor
             cells express AR, it will be considered positive for this trial.

             treatment.
