    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the long-term safety and possible benefits of
      transplanted Human Central Nervous System Stem Cells (HuCNS-SC) for patients with Geographic
      Atrophy of Age-Related Macular Degeneration. This long-term follow-up study is limited to
      those individuals who received a transplant of HuCNS-SC cells into one of their eyes as part
      of the CL-N01-AMD study. No additional study product will be given in this 4-year long-term
      follow-up study.
