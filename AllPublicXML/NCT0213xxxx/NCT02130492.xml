  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this Pilot study are to investigate the toxicity and safety of high doses
      of [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) used as a therapeutic agent in patients with advanced stage
      IV malignant tumors that failed standard of care treatment, have a good performance status
      and bear radiosensitive tumors with a high [18F]-FDG uptake.

      The investigators hypothesize that [18F]FDG may have a significant tumoricidal effect on
      cancer cells and radionuclide therapy of cancers with high doses of [18F]FDG administered as
      a single dose or in multiple doses (dose fractionation regimen) can be safe and well
      tolerated with minimal toxicities. Advantages of FDG are its uptake in many different human
      tumors, its short half-life (110 minutes) and the possibility to monitor its effect closely
      with the FDG-PET scan. The rationale for using high doses of this radiopharmaceutical agent
      for treatement is that most malignant lesions have accentuated glucose metabolism, which is
      mirrored by increased uptake of FDG. Since FDG cannot be metabolized within the cell like
      glucose, it is effectively confined within the cancer cells; thus, FDG treatment is
      potentially a novel form of targeted therapy for tumors with increased FDG uptake.

               -  Liver function: bilirubin &lt; 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) and SGOT (AST) &lt;
                  2.5x ULN.

               -  Renal function: Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 times the ULN or creatinine clearance above
                  50.
