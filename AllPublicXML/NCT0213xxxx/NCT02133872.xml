  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN) is the single most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
      diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Recent American Heart Association (AHA) statistics
      indicate that one-third of all adults in the United States of America suffer from HTN.
      Despite advances in life style modification and multi-drug therapies, 20-30% of all
      hypertensive patients remain resistant.

      These individuals exhibit autonomic dysregulation due to elevated sympathetic activity and
      norepinephrine spillover, and low parasympathetic activity. It is generally accepted that
      this uncontrolled, resistant HTN is primarily &quot;neurogenic&quot; in origin, involving over activity
      of the sympathetic nervous system that initiates and sustains HTN. A surgical approach such
      as the recently developed &quot;Simplicity Catheter&quot; assisted renal denervation remains one of the
      few options available to these patients. Thus, a mechanism-based breakthrough is imperative
      to develop novel strategies to prevent and perhaps eventually cure neurogenic hypertension
      (NH). This study is designed to evaluate a low and high dose of minocycline to test the
      hypothesis that minocycline treatment would produce antihypertensive effects in
      drug-resistant neurogenic hypertensive individuals. Minocycline has been selected because of
      its demonstrated effects on inhibiting microglial activation and its ability to penetrate the
      blood brain barrier. There is no other compound available that is safer and displays
      specificity better than Minocycline in inhibiting microglial activation. Thus, the potential
      therapeutic benefits of this inexpensive, well tolerated, already FDA-approved drug that has
      minimal side effects would be enormous.

      One hundred seventy-five (175) subjects who will be randomized to receive either Minocycline
      100 mg or 200 mg b.i.d. (twice a day). At baseline, subjects will undergo blood tests (lipid
      panel, high sensitivity-C reactive protein, high sensitivity troponin, glucose, metabolic
      profile, lipid panel, Cystatin C, albumin and flow cytometry). Peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells will be isolated and used to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
      which will be used for further mechanism studies.

      In addition to blood collection, a physical exam will be conducted and office systolic blood
      pressure (BP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP) will be recorded.
      Patients will also be fitted with an ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) system.
      Patients will wear the ABPM for 24 hours at which point they will mail the monitor back to
      research personnel. A week later, a second ABPM baseline reading will be conducted as
      patients will return to the clinic to be fitted again with the ABPM. At this visit, the study
      drug will be dispensed and patients will be instructed to start the study medication after
      completing the 24- hour ABPM monitoring period. After this visit, patients will be asked to
      return every month till the end of the study at 6 months.

      Monthly visits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 month visits), will include a brief physical examination
      and an assessment of medication compliance and tolerance. One tablespoon of blood will be
      drawn for flow cytometry analysis and iPSCs isolation at the baseline, 3 and 6 month visit
      only. Study drug will be dispensed and measurement of SBP, DBP, PP and other vital signs will
      also be completed. Office BP readings will be taken in a seated position after 5 minutes of
      rest according to Joint National Committee VII Guidelines. At baseline, BP will be measured
      at each arm, and the arm with the higher BP will be used for all subsequent readings.
      Averages of the triplicate measures will be calculated and used for analysis. At baseline and
      each followup visit, patients will be asked to wear the ABPM for 24 hours. Subjects will mail
      the cuff back to research personnel when completed. ABPM will be performed using an
      oscillometric Spacelabs 90207 monitor (Spacelabs Healthcare, Issaqua, WA) with readings taken
      every 30 minutes in daytime and every 60 minutes at nighttime. ABPM readings will be averaged
      for, daytime (8 AM to 5 PM), and nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM). Patients will be assessed while
      adhering to their usual diurnal activity and nocturnal sleep routine. The antihypertensive
      drugs, and their doses, used at each visit will be recorded on standardized forms along with
      any reports of adverse experiences known to occur with the drugs used (e.g. lightheadedness,
      dizziness, syncope, etc.).

      Only at the final visit, the same blood tests at baseline will be repeated. When the patients
      complete the 6 months of treatment, come in for their final visit, and return the ABPM
      monitor, their participation in the trial will be considered as complete.
