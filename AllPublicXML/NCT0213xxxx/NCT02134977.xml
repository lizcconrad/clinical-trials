      The purpose of this survey is to examine the effect on quality of life (QOL) improvement and
      convenience of switching to leuprorelin acetate 3 months depot 11.25 milligram (mg) injection
      kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg injection kit) from a 4-week adjuvant therapy with a luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone analog (LH-RHa) 1 month depot over 48 weeks in premenopausal breast
      cancer participants in daily medical practice. Influence of condition of estrogen receptor
      expression on the efficacy and safety of leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg injection kit was
      also evaluated.

      This survey was designed to examine the effect on QOL improvement and convenience of
      switching to leuprorelin acetate 3 month depot 11.25 mg injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg
      injection kit) from a 4-week adjuvant therapy with a LH-RHa 1 month depot over 48 weeks in
      premenopausal breast cancer participants in daily medical practice, as well as to evaluate
      the influence of condition of estrogen receptor expression on the efficacy and safety of
      leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg injection kit .

      For adults, leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg Injection Kit)
      is usually administered subcutaneously once every 12 weeks. Prior to injection, the plunger
      rod of the syringe is pushed upward with the needle pointed upward, allowing the entire
      suspension fluid contained to be transferred to the powder. The powder is then fully
      suspended in the fluid while ensuring that bubbles are not generated.

    <measure>Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated With Anticancer Drugs (QOL-ACD) Total and Subscale Score at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>QOL-ACD score is a score used for cancer participants treated with anti-cancer drug and is a 22-item self-reported instrument assessing differences in symptom severity and health-related QOL. It includes 4 subscale domains: Daily Activities, Physical Condition, Social Activities, Mental and Psychological Status. Total and subscale scores are calculated as sum of items within each subscale: Daily Activity (items 1-6), Physical Condition (7-11), Psychological Condition (12-16), Social Attitude (17-21) and total (1-22). Face scale: 5-point score for 1 item (22). Participants answer each question on a 5-point scale (1: not at all [worst response] to 5: very much [best response]). Score range for total score is 22 to 110 and subscale score range for daily activity is 6 to 30, and for physical condition, psychological condition, and social attitude is 5 to 25. Less total/subscale scores reflect greater symptom severity and symptom impact on health-related QOL.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated With Anticancer Drugs (QOL-ACD) Total and Subscale Score at Baseline</title>
        <description>QOL-ACD score is a score used for cancer participants treated with anti-cancer drug and is a 22-item self-reported instrument assessing differences in symptom severity and health-related QOL. It includes 4 subscale domains: Daily Activities, Physical Condition, Social Activities, Mental and Psychological Status. Total and subscale scores are calculated as sum of items within each subscale: Daily Activity (items 1-6), Physical Condition (7-11), Psychological Condition (12-16), Social Attitude (17-21) and total (1-22). Face scale: 5-point score for 1 item (22). Participants answer each question on a 5-point scale (1: not at all [worst response] to 5: very much [best response]). Score range for total score is 22 to 110 and subscale score range for daily activity is 6 to 30, and for physical condition, psychological condition, and social attitude is 5 to 25. Less total/subscale scores reflect greater symptom severity and symptom impact on health-related QOL.</description>

        <title>QOL-ACD Total and Subscale Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>QOL-ACD score is a score used for cancer participants treated with anti-cancer drug and is a 22-item self-reported instrument assessing differences in symptom severity and health-related QOL. It includes 4 subscale domains: Daily Activities, Physical Condition, Social Activities, Mental and Psychological Status. Total and subscale scores are calculated as sum of items within each subscale: Daily Activity (items 1-6), Physical Condition (7-11), Psychological Condition (12-16), Social Attitude (17-21) and total (1-22). Face scale:5-point score for 1 item (22). Participants answer each question on a 5-point scale (1: not at all [worst response] to 5: very much [best response]). Score range for total score is 22 to 110 and subscale score range for daily activity is 6 to 30, and for physical condition, psychological condition, and social attitude is 5 to 25. Less total/subscale scores reflect greater symptom severity and symptom impact on health-related QOL.</description>

Participants answer each question on a 5-point scale (1: not at all [worst response] to 5: very much [best response]). Total score was calculated over score range 0-100 for item 1 to 18 as ((a sum of 18 items)/18-1)*25). Score for physical condition and pain was calculated over score range 0-100 for item 1 to 6 as ((a sum of 6 items)/6-1)*25)). Score for health-care and illness satisfaction was calculated over score range 0-100 for item 7 to 10 as ((a sum of 4 items)/4-1)*25)), where less scores reflect greater symptom severity and symptom impact on health-related quality of life.

        <title>Score of QOL-ACD-B at Week 48</title>
        <description>QOL-ACD-B is a part of QOL-ACD (using questionnaire items 1 to 18). QOL-ACD is a score used for cancer participants treated with anti-cancer drug and is a 22-item self-reported instrument assessing differences in symptom severity and health-related QOL. Participants answer each question on a 5-point scale (1: not at all [worst response] to 5: very much [best response]). Total score for QOL-ACD-B is calculated as a sum of 18 items, score range: 18 to 90 where less scores reflect greater symptom severity and symptom impact on health-related quality of life. Means and standard deviations were calculated for the total score and score of each subscale from questionnaire items 1 to 18.</description>
