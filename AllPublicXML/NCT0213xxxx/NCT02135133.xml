  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a combination of drugs called Ofatumumab and Idelalisib as
      a possible treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Small Lymphocytic Leukemia
      (SLL).

      The main purpose of this study is to examine the combination of the two drugs, Ofatumumab and
      Idelalisib, in participants who have been diagnosed with CLL/SLL and have not previously
      received treatment but do require treatment. The investigators hope to observe how
      participants' disease will be impacted by this treatment and whether they will benefit more
      from combining these drugs together rather than taking them separately. Both of these drugs
      have been used in treatment for CLL / SLL and information from those research studies
      suggests that these drugs may help patients with CLL/SLL.

      Ofatumumab is an antibody engineered in the lab against CD20, a protein on the surface of CLL
      cells, which is expressed in CLL. An antibody is a molecule your body creates to identify
      foreign substances so that it can destroy them. Ofatumumab has been FDA approved for
      treatment of CLL/SLL that has relapsed or progressed on other therapies. Idelalisib is a drug
      that blocks one of the signals inside the cells that cause this type of cancer to grow and
      survive. The investigators hope that combining Ofatumumab with Idelalisib will stop the
      growth of disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the side effects of combining these
      two drugs, gathering information on the CLL/SLL disease process and how the study affects the
      patient's cells, as well as assessing the outcome of the disease. This combination of drugs
      has been previously tested, and appeared to be well tolerated.

      Before the research starts (screening): After signing the consent form, the participant will
      be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if they are eligible to be
      in this research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular
      cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that the participant does not take part in
      the research study. If the participant has had some of these tests or procedures recently,
      they may or may not have to be repeated.

        -  A medical history, which includes questions about the participant's health, current
           medications, and any allergies.

        -  Physical examination, which includes vital signs, height, weight, and disease assessment
           by the size of the participant's spleen, liver, and lymph nodes.

        -  Performance status, which evaluates how the participant is able to carry on with their
           usual activities.

        -  An assessment of the patient's tumor by CT (Computerized Tomography) scan, MRI or PET
           (Positron Emission Tomography) scans,

        -  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy: A study tube (plastic cylinder container that contains
           biopsy material) will be drawn during this biopsy to further assess the participant's
           disease status.

        -  Blood tests, a maximum of 24 teaspoons will be collected.

        -  Urine test.

        -  A blood pregnancy test

        -  A Hepatitis B and C test, will require blood sample.

      If these tests show that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study,
      then the participant will be begin will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the
      eligibility criteria, the participant will not be able to participate in this research study.

      Additional research procedures to be performed at the time of screening:

      • Blood tests, including baseline tests so that the investigators can measure any additional
      effect of the study drug and disease status

      After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research
      study:

      If you take part in this research study, the participant will be given a study drug-dosing
      diary for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days. The diary will also
      include special instructions for taking the study drugs.

        -  Study Drugs: The participant will first be given Idelalisib daily for two cycles of 28
           days each. Idelalisib will be given orally. Once the participant completes 2 cycles of
           Idelalisib, then the participant will start to receive a combination of Ofatumumab and
           Idelalisib. This regimen will continue weekly to complete 8 weeks (two more cycles).
           This will be followed by monthly Ofatumumab and Idelalisib to complete 4 additional
           cycles (eight total). The overall treatment period will therefore be 8 months, comprised
           of two months of Idelalisib followed by 6 months of Ofatumumab with Idelalisib. After
           completing the 8-month treatment, the participant will likely continue Idelalisib.
           Restaging with CT scans will happen after Cycle 2, 4, and a final restage will occur 2
           months after the completion of Ofatumumab. There will be a tumor response assessment
           done during a physical exam after Cycle 8.

        -  Clinical Exams: During all cycles the participant will have a physical exam and will be
           asked questions about their general health and specific questions about any problems
           that they might be having and any medications they may be taking.

        -  Scans (or Imaging tests): The investigator will assess the participant's tumor by CT
           scan. Restaging with CT scans will happen after Cycle 2, 4, and a final restage will
           occur 2 months after the completion of Ofatumumab.

        -  Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy: will be conducted to see if the bone marrow has tumor
           cells. A study tube will be drawn during this biopsy to further assess the patient's
           disease status

        -  Blood tests

      Additional Blood Tests:

      Blood Tests will be performed throughout the study so that the Investigator can measure any
      additional effect of the study drug and disease status. These tests will be taken on the days
      listed below before the participant receive study drug, on some days additional blood will be
      drawn after they receive study drug.

      Cycle 3 Day 1 Cycle 3 Day 8 Cycle 3 Day 15 Cycle 4 Day 21 (last weekly Ofatumumab dose) Cycle
      5 Day 1 (first monthly Ofatumumab dose) Cycle 8 Day 1 (last monthly Ofatumumab dose) 2 months
      after Ofatumumab therapy completed 6 months after Ofatumumab therapy completed

      Planned Follow-up:

      Once the participant has completed the study treatment, the participant will be monitored
      until they start a new type of treatment or are removed from the study. During this time the
      participant will meet with your research physician every 3 or 6 months.

      The investigator would like to keep track of the participant's medical condition for the rest
      of their life. The investigator would like to do this by calling the participant on the
      telephone once a year to see how the participant is doing. Keeping in touch with the
      participant and checking their condition every year helps the investigator look at the
      long-term effects of the research study.

          -  Known HIV positive. HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are
             ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with idelalisib.
             In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease including unstable angina, acute myocardial
             infarction within six months prior to randomization, congestive heart failure (NYHA

             the participant.

          -  Positive serology for Hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for HBsAg. In
             addition, if negative for HBsAg but HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a HB
             DNA test will be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded.

          -  If HBV DNA is negative, subject may be included but must undergo HBV DNA PCR testing
             at least every 2 months from the start of treatment until 12 months post treatment.
             Prophylactic antiviral therapy may be initiated at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis C (HC) defined as a positive test for HepC Ab, in
             which case reflexively perform an HC RIBA immunoblot assay or hepatitis C viral load
             to confirm the result. If the confirmatory test is negative the subject will be
             eligible.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Women of childbearing potential, including women whose last menstrual period was less
             than one year prior to screening, unable or unwilling to use adequate contraception
             from study start to 30 days after the last dose of protocol therapy. Adequate
             contraception is defined as hormonal birth control, intrauterine device, double
             barrier method or total abstinence.

          -  Male subjects unable or unwilling to use adequate contraception methods from study
             start to 30 days after the last dose of protocol therapy.

          -  Participants using concomitant corticosteroids are allowed as long as the subject is
             on the equivalent of 20mg/day or less of prednisone and has been on a stable dose for
             at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy.
