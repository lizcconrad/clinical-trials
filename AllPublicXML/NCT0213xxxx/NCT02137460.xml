  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study for cognitively normal (young and old), mild cognitive
      impairment, and Alzheimer's disease people
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is 1) to search new biomarkers and develop clinically applicable early
      diagnosis and prediction methods of Alzheimer's disease, and 2) to investigate how the
      proposed lifetime risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease contribute to
      pathological hallmarks of AD or other brain changes in living human through annual
      comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and biannual brain imaging (MRI and
      MRA, Fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG)-PET, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET), AV--1451 PET, and body
      specimen (blood, gene, and hair) analysis.

      * Note: AV-1451 PET will not be applied to whole subjects, but to 210 subjects (30 young CN,
      60 old CN, 60 MCI, and 60 AD).
