  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery still remains the mainstay of treatment for localized colorectal cancer. However,
      nearly 30% of patients with localized colorectal cancer (stage II and stage III) will present
      with recurrence. Tumor progression is mediated by both intrinsic genetic changes and by
      extrinsic epigenetic and host environmental factors, including interactions with the immune
      system. Several studies demonstrated that tumor infiltrating memory T-cells and type, density
      and location of infiltrating T cells are better predictors of disease-free survival in
      patients with CRC compared to the standard TNM staging. These data suggest that tumor
      invasion and progression are more accurately predicted by immune response in the primary
      tumor. In addition, mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors are characterized a priori by a
      higher frequency of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and are associated with significantly
      improved prognosis. Recently, Stotz et al showed that the preoperative lymphocyte to monocyte
      ratio in peripheral blood samples predicts clinical outcome in patients with stage III colon
      cancer. So far there is no comprehensive analysis of the immune-landscape in CRC.

      The aim of the current project is to identify a comprehensive panel of immunomarkers in
      localized colorectal cancer (stage II and stage III) applicable for the detection of patients
      at high risk of recurrence. For the first time, specific tumor-infiltrating immune cells,
      mismatch repair protein expression in tumor tissue and preoperative blood based inflammatory
      markers from routine blood counts in corresponding peripheral blood samples and known
      clinicopathological features will be correlated with outcome in 300 localized CRC patients.
