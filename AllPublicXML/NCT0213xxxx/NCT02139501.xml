      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other well-known
      hospitals in China. In order to study the efficacy and safety of different dose and frequency
      Recombinant Human thrombopoietin in treating the primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial
      of 30 primary ITP adult patients from 3 medical centers in China. They will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into three groups .The patients in group A (total 10 patients) will
      receive rhTPO at a dose of 300Units/kg ,daily for 14 consecutive days;The patients in group B
      will receive rhTPO at a dose of 300Units/kg ,one times every other day for 7 times.The
      patients in group C will receive rhTPO at a dose of 300Units/kg ,daily for 7 consecutive days
      .All the patients will follow with a flexible dosage depending on platelet count during the
      following 12 weeks.

      Platelet counts, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment, in
      order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different dose and frequency Recombinant Human
      thrombopoietin in treating the primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)
