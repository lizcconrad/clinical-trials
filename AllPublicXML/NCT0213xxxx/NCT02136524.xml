  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment sequence
      crossover study to determine the relative bioavailability of cobimetinib administered as a
      single dose of the tablet formulation relative to a single dose of the capsule formulation to
      healthy male and female participants. A minimum of 24 participants (12 participants per
      sequence) will complete the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 possible
      sequences (i.e., I: A/B, II: B/A) where the treatments are as follows: Treatment A: One
      cobimetinib tablet administered as a single oral dose after at least an 8-hour fast;
      Treatment B: Four cobimetinib capsules administered as a single oral dose after at least an
      8-hour fast. The study is expected to last approximately 7 weeks.
