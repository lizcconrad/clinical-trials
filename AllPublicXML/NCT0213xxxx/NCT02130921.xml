    <textblock>
      This proposed study is an initiative for HIV prevention and care that integrates intervention
      efforts at multiple strata: Community Health Workers (CHWs), Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), and
      their Family Members (FMs). The proposed study will demonstrate the process of development,
      implementation, and evaluation of an intervention for CHWs, IDUs, and their FMs. One aim is
      to increase the CHWs' capacities to effectively interact with IDUs and FMs for HIV and drug
      use prevention and treatment. Using a combination of participatory action research and a
      randomized controlled trial design, this study has the potential to maximize PEPFAR impact in
      Vietnam and other PEPFAR-funded countries by identifying a sustainable mix of interventions
      and their implementation in different settings. The findings may benefit not only Vietnam but
      also a global audience by investigating enhanced methods for controlling the HIV epidemic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vietnam is currently facing an HIV epidemic that had affected approximately 280,000 people by
      the end of 2009. Injecting Drug Use (IDU) is principal driver of the HIV epidemic,
      contributing to between 32 % and 58 % of all HIV cases in various provinces. However, it has
      proven difficult to address the needs of IDUs, a high-risk group, given the prevalence of
      stigmatization and drug use in Vietnamese society. In addition, Vietnamese people are highly
      family oriented and most young IDUs have daily family contact of live in their parents'
      homes. Thus the burden on the family is substantial, and even greater if the IDU is HIV+.

      The study will be implemented in two provinces in Vietnam: Phu Tho and Vinh Phuc. A
      randomized controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate the impact of the intervention in
      60 commune health centers. From each center we will recruit 5 Community Health Workers
      (CHWs), 15 Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), and 10 Family Members (FMs) (totaling 300 CHWs, 900
      IDUs, and 600 FMs). The outcomes will be evaluated at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12- month follow-up
      assessments. The specific aims of the study are as follows:

        1. To develop and implement an integrated intervention, CHW CARE, for CHWs, IDUs, and their
           FMS in Vietnam

        2. To evaluate the feasibility and operational procedures of the intervention with an
           implementation pilot, including process evalution and monitoring, and participants
           feedback.

        3. To assess the impact of the intervention by comparing outcome measures of CHWs, IDUs,
           and FMs in the intervention group to those in the control group.

        4. To explore the relationships between the intervention outcomes of CHWs, IDUs, and FMs.
