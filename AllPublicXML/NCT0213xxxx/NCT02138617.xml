  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves standard combination chemotherapy treatment for colon cancer,
      5-Fluorouracil (5FU), leucovorin and irinotecan (known as FOLFIRI), plus bevacizumab
      (Avastin). The study is designed to test the FOLFIRI regimen based on certain characteristics
      of a person's genetic makeup or &quot;genes&quot;. Genes are made of DNA and determine not only
      inherited traits or appearance (hair and eye color, height, body type, etc.) but also play an
      important role in health and how the body responds to illness and treatments for those
      illnesses.

      In this study, the investigators will examine the relationship between a patient's genes
      (DNA), or &quot;genotype&quot;, and how the patient's body breaks down and removes or &quot;metabolizes&quot; the
      anti-cancer drug irinotecan. Circulating blood level of irinotecan plays an important role in
      how well this drug works against a patient's cancer as well as the adverse side effects the
      patient may experience. The current standard dose of irinotecan was determined in clinical
      trials without knowing individual genotypes and thus does not take into account a patient's
      ability to metabolize irinotecan. This means that based on one genotype the current standard
      dose of irinotecan may be correct or based on other genotypes the standard dose could result
      in lower and possibly less effective blood levels and result in significant under-dosing of
      irinotecan.

      Based on genotype the patient will be assigned to one of the following doses of irinotecan:

        -  180 mg/m2 (standard dose)

        -  260 mg/m2

        -  310 mg/m2

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if dosing irinotecan based on genotype is
      effective and safe for patients with colon cancer. Patient genotype will be determined from a
      small sample of blood and a laboratory test or &quot;assay&quot; performed at UNC Laboratories. For the
      purpose of this study, this assay is new and considered to be &quot;investigational&quot;. This means
      that the genotype assay used in this study has not yet been approved by the FDA for
      determining irinotecan dose levels in patients with colon cancer.

      This phase II multicenter clinical trial will use a genotype-guided dosing strategy for
      irinotecan to prospectively analyze efficacy in 100 metastatic colorectal cancer patients
      (mCRC) receiving FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, irinotecan) plus bevacizumab.
      Irinotecan is detoxified and excreted primarily by glucuronidation in the liver via the
      isoenzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1). Common variants in UGT1A1
      alter the rate of glucuronidation and thus alter exposure to irinotecan.

      The UGT1A1 *28 allele results in slower irinotecan glucuronidation, and thus greater exposure
      to its active metabolite SN-38. At the standard irinotecan dose used in FOLFIRI (180 mg/m2;
      established prior to our understanding of the importance of genotype in the rate of this
      drug's metabolism), there is a small increased risk of neutropenia in *28 homozygotes.
      However, the risk of clinically important consequences of neutropenia, such as febrile
      neutropenia and infection, are not significantly increased. Patients with other genotypes
      have a quite low risk of adverse effects suggesting patients with these low risk genotypes
      may tolerate higher doses of irinotecan in FOLFIRI. This finding was demonstrated in a phase
      I study in which *1/*28 and *1/*1 genotypes were able to tolerate escalating doses of
      irinotecan up to 260 mg/m2 and 310 mg/m2, respectively.

      The central hypothesis of this trial is that increasing the irinotecan dose in *1/*28 and
      *1/*1 genotypes will increase the overall benefit of FOLFIRI for patients with mCRC as these
      two groups are likely under-dosed with the current dosing regimen. Eligible patients will be
      genotyped for UGT1A1 and assigned into 1 of 3 different dosing groups, based on their
      relative rate of metabolism. The primary objective of this trial is to estimate
      progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary objectives include characterization of
      toxicity and objective response rate (OR; complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)).
