      Lung isolation is primordial in thoracic surgery. To achieve it, two techniques are used: the
      double lumen tube (DLT) and the bronchial blocker (BB). Left-sided DLT (L-DLT) is use by the
      majority of anesthesiologists for both left and right thoracic surgeries. Standard
      right-sided DLT (Rs-DLT) is rarely use since it is dif¬ficult to properly position it and
      that there is a risk of misalignment between the lateral orifice of the tube and the origin
      of the right upper lobe (RUL) bron¬chus. In 2007, the investigators have published results
      suggesting enlarging the Rs-DLT's lateral orifice. The modified R-DLT (Rm-DLT) was more
      frequently in an adequate position: 77% vs 37% of patients (p = 0.0121), and easier to
      reposition: 97% vs 74% of patients (p= 0.0109) in comparison to the standard R-DLT group. The
      data suggest the superiority of the Rm-DLT compared to Rs-DLT for optimal positioning to
      facilitate one-lung ventilation (OLV) during thoracic surgery. It is believed that DLT tend
      to provide quicker and better quality of lung collapse than BB. In 2013, investigators have
      demonstrated an equivalent quality of lung collapse (LC) between L-DLT and BB used with two
      apnea periods when initiating OLV. Complementary analysis showed a significative difference
      to obtain complete LC (CLC) between L-DLT for left thoracoscopy and L-DLT for right
      thoracoscopy and BB in right or left surgery. The investigator hypothesis is that, when using
      L-DLT for left video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), LC of the isolated lung will be
      slower and of poorer quality compare to the use of the Rm-DLT. The primary objective is to
      compare the delay between pleural opening (PO) and CLC in left VATS when using three lung
      isolation devices: 1) L-DLT and 2) Rm-DLT. Secondary objectives are: 1) to evaluate quality
      of LC, 2) to evaluate the level of obstruction of the lumen of the left bronchus, 3) to
      evaluate the quality of OLV (PaO2) 4) To collect blind surgeon's opinion about de device used
      and 5) to measure the delay between OLV and PO for evaluating the role of absorption
      atelectasis in obtaining CLC. After obtaining IRB approval, the investigators propose a study
      of 40 patients undergoing an elective left VATS at IUCPQ involving one lung ventilation. They
      will have to be 21 years or more, to read, understand and sign an informed consent at their
      pre-operative evaluation. This study will be prospective, randomized, and blind to thoracic
      surgeons.

      Background:

      Lung isolation is frequently used in thoracic surgery. The quality of the isolation is
      crucial, especially for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Two techniques are
      principally used to obtain lung isolation: the double lumen tube (DLT) and the bronchial
      blocker (BB).

      The left-sided DLT (L-DLT) is used by the majority of anesthesiologists, as much for left as
      for right thoracic surgeries. The standard right-sided DLT (Rs-DLT) is rarely used since
      positioning its lateral orifice with the origin of the right upper lobe (RUL) can be
      difficult.(1-4) In 2007, the investigators have published their results suggesting an
      enlargement of the lateral orifice of the Rs-DLT.(5) They have demonstrated that the modified
      right-sided double lumen tube (Rm-DLT) remained more frequently in optimal position than the
      Rs-DLT (77% vs. 37%, p=0.0121) and that it was also easier to reposition the tube after
      turning the patient in lateral decubitus (97% vs. 74%, p=0.0109).

      More recently, investigators have demonstrated, with three dimensional reconstruction of
      computed tomography of 106 patients, that angulation between the RUL and the horizontal
      posterior plane varies from -26 to +58°, justifying the modification of the Rs-DLT proposed
      in 2007. (Unpublished data)

      The use of BB for lung isolation is believed to provide a slower and a poorer quality of lung
      collapse (LC) than DLT. Over the years, the investigators have demonstrated an equivalent
      quality of lung collapse between the L-DLT and BB when two apnea periods are used at the
      beginning of one-lung ventilation (OLV). (Unpublished data) Further to complementary
      analysis, investigators have noted a significant difference in time to get complete lung
      collapse between left and right thoracic surgery when using the L-DLT. Time to obtain
      complete lung collapse (CLC) was not different when comparing BB and L-DLT in left thoracic
      surgery.

      The hypothesis to explain these observations is that when the bronchial extremity of the
      L-DLT is inserted into the left main stem bronchus (LMSB), the LMSB and its relative superior
      position, associated to a progressive collapse of the left lung, could induce a dynamic
      obstruction of the distal extremity of the L-DLT lumen, and consequently slowing the lung
      collapse. Investigators have also regularly observed this type of obstruction during
      bronchoscopic examination when positioning the L-DLT.

      In past studies comparing L-DLT to BB, time to get CLC was measured from the beginning of
      OLV. Nevertheless, the interval between this time point and the pleural opening (PO) is
      sometime difficult to control. Technical incidents can prolong this period and induce a bias.
      Furthermore, in the last investigator's protocol, the second period of apnea is done at
      pleural opening. For these reasons, the authors consider that the time to get CLC should be
      measured from the pleural opening since it is the crucial moment for the surgical team.
      Investigators are proposing to evaluate the PO-CLC interval as a primary objective.(6)

      Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis of the proposed study is that the use of the L-DLT will allow for a slower and
      a poorer quality of CLC compared to the ones obtained with the Rm-DLT in left VATS.
