  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that compared to placebo, 10g of daily creatine monohydrate for
      eight weeks will be associated with significant increases in frontal lobe phosphocreatine and
      beta-nucleoside triphosphate (β-NTP) concentrations. A secondary hypothesis is that decreased
      depressive symptoms measured with the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) will be reciprocally correlated with
      increased β-NTP concentrations.

      The current protocol seeks to expand upon the investigators previous work by opening
      recruitment on a pilot study of creatine 10g daily vs. placebo as a treatment for female
      adolescents with SSRI-resistant MDD. The purpose of the pilot study is twofold: A) to
      evaluate several aspects of the feasibility of creatine supplementation as a treatment for
      this population; and B) to estimate the effect size of adjunctive creatine, to inform the
      design and implementation of a potential future efficacy trial.

        MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER SUBJECTS

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must be female.

          2. Participants must be able to grant informed consent (age &gt;18), or parent/guardian
             permission plus participant assent (age &lt;18).

          3. Participants must meet DSM criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), with current
             mood state depressed for &gt; 2 weeks.

          4. Participants must be between the ages of 12 and 21.

          5. Current CDRS-R raw score of &gt; 40 or MADRS score &gt; 25; and CGI-S score &gt; 3.

          6. Participants may be enrolled in individual and/or group psychotherapy, if it has been
             ongoing for at least 8 weeks.

          7. Participants must have been in treatment with an SSRI for at least 8 weeks, the last 4
             of which were at a dosage of &gt; 20 mg per day of fluoxetine or its equivalent, e.g. 20
             mg per day of paroxetine, 20 mg citalopram, 10 mg escitalopram, or 100 mg sertraline.
             If the participant attempted, but could not tolerate, a dose comparable to 20 mg
             fluoxetine, they will be considered eligible. (This definition of &quot;Adolescent SSRI
             Resistant Depression&quot; is modified from the NIH-sponsored, $17 million TORDIA
             Randomized Controlled Trial [http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00018902].

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable co-morbid medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorder.

          2. Current DSM criteria for substance abuse or dependence (excepting
             nicotine/cigarettes).

          3. Clinically significant suicidal or homicidal risk.

          4. Pre-existing renal disease.

          5. Proteinuria on baseline urinalysis testing.

             claustrophobic anxiety).

          9. History of hypersensitivity to creatine.

         10. History of a previous failed therapeutic trial of creatine.

         11. Participants may be outpatients or inpatients, but incarcerated persons will be
             excluded because this study is not approved for &quot;Research Involving Prisoners.&quot;

        Study Withdrawal Criteria:

          1. Withdrawal of parental permission, participant informed consent or participant assent.

          2. Onset of a psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder.

          3. Intolerable, or clinically-significant side effects to creatine.

          4. Worsening depression, as demonstrated by an increase in CDRS-R or MADRS score &gt; 25%
             from baseline.

          5. Positive pregnancy test.

          6. A significant change to the participant's medication or psychotherapy treatment from
             the regimen reported at their baseline/screening visit (e.g. if the SSRI is
             discontinued).

          7. Incarceration, as the study is not approved to conduct &quot;Research Involving Prisoners.&quot;

          8. If a clinically-significant intracranial lesion is found by the Radiologist on a
             participant's baseline brain scan, they will be withdrawn from the study and referred
             for appropriate medical care.

          9. The principal investigator retains the right to withdraw participants from the study
             without their permission, in the event they are unwilling or unable to maintain
             adherence with the research protocol.

        HEALTHY COMPARISON SUBJECTS

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must be able to grant informed consent (age &gt; 18), or parent/guardian

             addition, women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to practice
             contraception during the study will be excluded. Female participants who are of
             childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test before the MRI/MRS
