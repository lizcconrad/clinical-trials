      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether treatment with a nasal spray based on
      resveratrol has some benefit in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, mild, moderate, or
      severe. The primary objective is to assess whether the treatment with nasal spray based
      resveratrol is able to improve the allergic rhinitis symptoms during the two months of
      treatment. The secondary aim is to evaluate if the resveratrol nasal spray is able to reduce
      respiratory infections and wheezing episodes.
