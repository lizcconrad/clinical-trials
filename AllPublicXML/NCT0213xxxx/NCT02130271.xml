      The purpose of this study is to see if the spine shows areas of inflammation using a specific
      type of imaging (pictures).

      The purpose of this study is to determine if inflammation around the spinal nerves can be
      identified using a radioactive tracer [11C] PBR28 and integrated PET/MRI scan for the purpose
      of better treating patients who have radicular lumbar pain with epidural steroid injections.

      A blood sample will be taken from healthy subjects only at Visit 1. The blood sample will
      genotyped. Genotyping will identify if the subject makes proteins that will bind the
      radioactive tracer.

      A blood sample will be drawn for Genotyping at Visit 2 from all subjects.
