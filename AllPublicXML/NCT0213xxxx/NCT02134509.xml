  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a smartphone application for
      smoking cessation in smokers ages 18 to 65 years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized control trial, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of two
      treatments: (1) a standard smartphone application to support smokers working to become
      quit-free, or (2) the tested intervention, an app that trains behavioral strategies for
      smoking cessation. The primary endpoint of interest will be 1-week point prevalence
      abstinence at end of treatment, and at 3 and 6 months follow-up for individuals.

    <description>This is a 3-week smartphone-based training program that trains behavioral strategies for smoking cessation by helping smokers self-monitor their smoking habits, recognize when and how often they smoke, identify triggers for smoking, and learn methods to become more mindful of triggers, to quit smoking with a target quit date of 3 weeks.</description>

    <description>It is comprised of twenty-two modules of 10-15 minutes each, designed to teach behavioral strategies for smoking cessation using psychoeducation-based audio and videos, animations to reinforce key concepts, and in vivo exercises. In addition, 5 bonus modules become available upon completion of earlier modules; these may be accessed for additional practices to bolster other modules</description>
