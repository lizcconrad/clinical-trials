    <textblock>
      This study is testing a walking program called Walk with Ease by the Arthritis Foundation
      with men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. The researchers are interested in how easy
      or difficult it is for these men to participate in this program and whether or not is is
      helpful to them during their care.

      Purpose: This pilot study evaluates the feasibility of implementing a moderate-intensity
      physical activity (PA) program in a sample of men age 65 or older with a prostate cancer
      diagnosis undergoing various forms of treatment or active surveillance.

      Participants: Men, 65 and older, with a prostate cancer diagnosis.

      Procedures (methods): This study will enroll subjects in a 6 week walking program called Walk
      with Ease (WWE) and see if walking can be sustained for up to three months. In addition, the
      study will perform a Geriatric Assessment and gather preliminary data on self-reported
      quality of life outcomes and self-reported physical activity as captured in a daily walking
      log.

    <description>Exploring the evaluate the feasibility of implementing the WWE intervention among men age &gt;65 with a prostate cancer diagnosis. The study will measure those who were able to complete the program and increased their self-reported level of walking. The study will also measure the percent of patients who reach the goal of walking 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week in order to determine feasibility.</description>
