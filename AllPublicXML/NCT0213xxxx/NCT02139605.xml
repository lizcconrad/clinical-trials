  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stomach cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in India. Curative
      surgery offers the only chance of improving survival in this cancer. In patients whose cancer
      has not spread to other parts of the body (beyond the stomach and lymph nodes around it),
      removal of stomach (gastrectomy) with lymph nodes around the stomach and along the major
      vessels supplying blood to the stomach (D2 lymphadenectomy) is regarded as current standard
      of care at Tata Memorial Centre. However, the extent of lymphadenectomy is controversial.
      Some studies have suggested that removing more lymph nodes, even around the major vessels of
      the abdomen (aorta and inferior vena cava) may not only help to accurately determine the
      disease spread, but may also confer an additional survival benefit. Removing more lymph nodes
      around the major vessels may increase the risk of morbidity to the patient.

      In the last 5-6 years, stomach cancer specialists around the world have resorted to giving
      half the cycles of chemotherapy to the patient before the surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy),
      and the other half after the surgery in what is called 'perioperative chemotherapy'. This has
      been shown to lead to more patients surviving to 5 years, than before.

      The investigators feel that perioperative chemotherapy with D2 lymphadenectomy may constitute
      the best care for our patients with stomach cancer such that no further removal of lymph
      nodes beyond is required. However, the investigators have no evidence in literature to
      support this hypothesis. The investigators have thus designed this trial based on which we
      propose that there exists no difference between a D2 lymphadenectomy and a D3 lymphadenectomy
      following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for non-metastatic, locally advanced but resectable
      gastric cancer. The data will enable the development of clear management guidelines for lymph
      node dissection in stomach cancer.

      The only data comparing D2 and D3 comes from a multi-institutional, non-randomised study
      which reported that D3 lymphadenectomy conferred a survival advantage over D2 in tumours that
      were 50-100mm in diameter, with or without lymph nodal disease.

      Of the three published randomised controlled trials(RCT) comparing D2 versus D2+paraaortic
      nodal dissection (PAND), two of the studies in which the long-term results are available,
      were carried out in Japan. In both these studies, the patients were not offered chemotherapy
      until after they developed a recurrence. Another reason is the benefit on survival, albeit
      modest, in patients undergoing D3 lymphadenectomy that has been noted in the study by Wu et
      al.

      Another important reason for comparing D2 versus D2+PAND, lies in the fact that none of the
      aforementioned RCTs have been performed after the 1998 revision in the definition of lymph
      node stations by the Japanese Gastric cancer association. Hence, none of these results can be
      considered representative of the current classifications.

      Duly considering the possible higher morbidity that has been shown with a complete para
      aortic lymph node dissection, the investigators propose to study a more extensive
      lymphadenectomy than D2 but without increasing the risk of morbidity in the patient.

      D2 lymphadenectomy has been performed at Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), since 2002 with
      morbidity and mortality rates comparable to world literature It is the standard form of
      lymphadenectomy in TMC. Hence, the trial will be performed by surgeons experienced in the
      technique. D3 is performed in some centres in Japan, Italy and Taiwan (where the only
      randomized controlled trial demonstrated a survival benefit of D3 over D1). Both the
      procedures are well established and regarded as standards in different parts of the world.
