  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood
      cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving
      the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL
      and we have given this type of treatment to over 100 patients. In this study, we are
      selecting a specific subset of white blood cells from the tumor that we think are the most
      effective in fighting tumors and will use only these cells in making the tumor fighting
      cells.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can
      cause non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is
      safe.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18-70 with NSCLC who have a tumor that can be safely removed.

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and
           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as
           needed

        -  Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo
           surgery to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.

        -  Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood
           cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells
           from the patient.}

        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital
           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the
           hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.

      Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects,
      lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1
      year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.

      Background:

        -  Patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have few approved
           therapeutic options and those that exist are of transient benefit.

        -  Recent clinical experiences with experimental agents that release checkpoints on the
           host immune response (such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL1 antibody) have induced tumor
           regressions in patients with NSCLC.

        -  Data from sequencing the genomes of human cancers have shown that, like malignant
           melanoma, NSCLC has a very high rate of tumor-specific genomic mutation.

        -  In metastatic melanoma, a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy product (TIL) can
           mediate the regression of bulky disease at any site when administered to an autologous
           patient with high dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative but lymphodepleting
           chemotherapy preparative regimen.

        -  Recent studies on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes from melanoma have demonstrated that
           they can frequently recognize tumor-specific mutated proteins as foreign antigens and
           that is one hypothesis as to why melanoma is such an immunogenic tumor.

        -  We propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of growing and
           administering an autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte product (TIL) to patients with
           metastatic NSCLC.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      -To determine the rate of tumor regression in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) who receive an autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte product (TIL) plus
      aldesleukin following a lymphodepleting preparative regimen.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients who are 18 years of age or older must have:

             -  Advanced NSCLC refractory to standard therapy

             -  A site of tumor that can be excised with minimal morbidity and mortality or that
                requires excision for clinical indications

             -  At least one remaining site of measurable disease

             -  Normal basic laboratory values.

        -  Patients may not have:

             -  Concurrent major medical illnesses that preclude aldesleukin administration or
                immunosuppression;

             -  Severe hepatic function impairment due to liver metastatic burden;

             -  Any form of immunodeficiency;

             -  Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study;

             -  Symptomatic brain metastases or more than 3 CNS metastases

      Design:

        -  Patients will undergo biopsy or resection to obtain tumor for generation of autologous
           tumor infiltrating lymphocyte cultures and autologous cancer cell lines.

        -  The TIL product will be generated according to current TIL-lab standard operating
           procedures, using interleukin-2 and OKT3 antibody.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine

        -  Cohort 1 will receive TIL on day 0 and then begin high-dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg
           IV); cohort 2 will receive TIL on day 0 and then begin low-dose aldesleukin (72,000
           IU/kg IV). Assignment to this cohort will be made if there are concomitant medical
           conditions that would preclude the use of high-dose aldesleukin

        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after TIL infusion.

        -  For both cohorts 1 and 2, using a Phase II design, 21 patients will be initially
           enrolled in each group to assess toxicity and tumor responses. If two or more of the
           first 21 patients per group shows a clinical response (PR or CR), accrual will continue
           to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response. In order to allow for a
           small number of non evaluable patients, a total of 85 patients may be enrolled over 5
           years.

             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities.)

          7. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study.

          8. Any patient known to have an LVEF less than or equal to 45%.

          9. Documented LVEF of less than or equal to 45% tested in patients with:
