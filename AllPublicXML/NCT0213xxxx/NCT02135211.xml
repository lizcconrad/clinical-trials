  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility and acceptability of a lifestyle
      risk reduction intervention for patients with lung cancer receiving surgical treatment. This
      study will provide the preliminary data needed to conduct a larger randomized controlled
      trial that tests an innovative, multidisciplinary intervention that has the potential to
      transform the standard of care for patients receiving surgical treatment for lung cancer.
