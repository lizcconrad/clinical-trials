      The purpose of this study is to determine if a simple intervention to improve hand hygiene,
      consisting of a 3-4 minute training video, on-site posters, and hand hygiene supplies, can
      reduce respiratory and GI illness among employees.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if a simple random cluster intervention trial to
      improve hand hygiene, consisting of a 3-4 minute training video, on-site posters, and hand
      hygiene supplies, can reduce respiratory and GI illness among those in the intervention group
      compared to the control group. The intervention was performed among employees in a Midwestern
      public government setting. Employees in the treatment group received a 3-4 minute training
      video online that was embedded in the baseline survey. Motivational posters from the USDHHS
      encouraging proper hand hygiene were installed in the workplace, along with hand hygiene
      supplies. The control group received a program called &quot;Ask Me 3&quot; developed by the National
      Patient Safety Foundation; the intervention consisted of a 3-4 minute training video to
      encourage clear communication with their health care providers, a brochure discussing the Ask
      Me 3 principles of clear communication with health care providers, and a key-ring with the
      Ask Me 3 communication principles to promote more effective communication with health care
      providers at visits out side of work. The groups were followed monthly through surveys over
      the Internet for an average of three months after baseline to determine if a relative
      reduction in self-reported respiratory / GI infections occurred in the intervention group
      compared to the control group.

    <time_frame>prior 30 days as elicited by self-report on four monthly surveys</time_frame>
    <description>Monthly surveys elicited information among employees in both the intervention and the control group about self-reported usual hand hygiene practices, symptoms of respiratory and GI infections and missed work days due to these symptoms during the prior 30 days. After the close of the study, statistical analysis was conducted to determine relative reductions in the intervention group compared to the control group regarding: self-reported infections and work days missed due to such infections.</description>
