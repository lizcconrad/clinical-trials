  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a community based participatory action research (CBPAR)
      approach to 1) create &quot;radio stories&quot; about Somali, Latino and Hmong families' real success
      stories with hypertension and obesity in managing their disease through implementation of
      healthful lifestyle behaviors (nutrition and physical activity), and 2) test the
      effectiveness and acceptability of radio stories on participant intentions to engage in or
      improve healthful lifestyle behaviors to prevent these disease. Participants in the
      Intervention condition listened to the &quot;radio stories&quot; and the participants in the control
      condition listened to an audio brochure with relevant health information. We hypothesized
      that the intervention participants would report higher intentions to engage in various
      healthful lifestyle behaviors than the control participants after both participants listened
      to their respective health information.

    <textblock>
      Given the high rate of hypertension and obesity in minority and immigrant communities,
      implementing culturally and linguistically appropriate health promotion activities that
      improve families' diet and physical activity behaviors is imperative. &quot;Radio Stories&quot; is an
      education entertainment strategy that has significant potential as a health promotion tool.
      Through a CBPAR process, we aimed to create and test the effectiveness and acceptability of
      &quot;SoLaHmo Radio Stories&quot; about changing knowledge and behaviors to prevent or manage
      hypertension and obesity for Somali, Latino, and Hmong families with children.

      Methods: SoLaHmo community researchers interviewed 7 families (3 Somali, 2 Latino, and 2
      Hmong) who have successfully implemented lifestyle changes to prevent or manage hypertension
      or obesity, and then create 6 &quot;radio stories&quot; (2 per ethnic community) based on the families'
      experiences. To test the stories, we are conducting a two-arm trial that includes 146
      participants (obesity: 68, hypertension: 78; 44 Hmong, 49 Latino, and 53 Somali
      participants). Effectiveness and acceptability of the program will be tested with pre-and
      post questionnaires.

      Anticipated Results: Higher rates of satisfaction, increased knowledge, and increased
      intention to change healthful lifestyle behaviors in participants receiving the radio
      stories, as compared to control group participants, will indicate radio story program
      effectiveness and acceptability.

    <description>The baseline and follow-up survey questions to test the &quot;radio stories&quot; included 15 items referring to intentions to change or improve a specific diet, physical activity, and health related behavior. There were four Likert scale response categories, from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree.' In addition, the follow-up survey included questions to assess participant perceptions of the radio stories relating to their emotional connection to the story, relevance with their own experience, believability, and increase awareness and concern about hypertension and obesity. In the baseline survey they were questions pertaining to demographics and dietary and physical activity behaviors.</description>
