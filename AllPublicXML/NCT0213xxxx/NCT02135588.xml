      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intrapleural dornase alfa
      and tPA administered to patients with clinical failure of small-bore chest tube with
      persistent pleural effusions or malignancy-related loculated effusion to improve pleural
      drainage.

          7. At least 2 days from administration of chemotherapy

          8. At least 7 days from prior major surgery

          9. Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically
             sterile) must be willing to use an acceptable contraceptive method (abstinence, oral
             contraceptive or double barrier method) for the duration of the study and for 30 days
             following the last dose of study drug, and must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial.

         10. Patient judged to be 'medically stable' by primary investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment with intrapleural fibrinolytic agents

          2. Presence of any intracranial mass

          3. Traumatic hemorrhagic pleural effusion

         11. Concurrent severe illness such as active infection, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit safety and compliance with study requirements.

         12. Patients who are pregnant or lactating (females of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to participation in this study)

         13. Expected survival less than six weeks
