    <textblock>
      The US food and Drug Administration (FDA) originally approved INTACS prescription inserts in
      April 1999 for the correction of low levels of nearsightedness (-1.00 to -3.00 diopters).
      Additional clinical data have shown that INTACS are safe for the treatment of keratoconus, in
      July 2004, FDA approved INTACS inserts for the treatment of keratoconus as a Humanitarian Use
      Device (FDA approval letter attached). The statute and the implementing regulation of FDA (21
      CFR 814.124 (aj) require IRB review and approval before a HUD is used.INTACS prescription
      inserts are composed of two clear segments, each having an arc length of 150°, they are
      manufactured form a biomedical material called polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and are
      available in three thicknesses. Two INTACS inserts ranging from 0.250mm to 0.350mm may be
      implanted depending on the orientation of the cone and the amount of myopia and astigmatism
      to be reduced.

      The INTACS procedure is typically performed in an outpatient setting. The two tiny INTACS
      inserts are surgically placed into the periphery of the cornea through a tiny cut that is
      made on the cornea after numbing drops have been applied. A specially designed instrument
      creates a tunnel by separating the tissue layers in the outside periphery of the cornea, the
      INTACS inserts are placed into this tunnel where they remain. One or two ophthalmic sutures
      will be placed to close the incision. A postoperative care information booklet will be given
      to the patients; patients will be followed by means of postoperative appointments for up to
      12 months after the surgery. The visits/testing schedules are listed below:

      Pre-OR visit (1.5 hours): Visual Acuity (VA), Refraction, Topography, Keratometry, Glare
      Test. Mesopic Pupil Size, Pachymetry, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam and Contrast Sensitivity.

      Surgery (30min): At Laser Center for Vision Care which is part of Aston and department of
      Ophthalmology.

      Post-OR Day 1(10min): VA, Slit Lamp Exam.

      Post-OR 1week (20min): Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.

      Post-OR 1 month (20minj: Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.

      Post-OR 3 month (1.5 hours): Some as pre-op Visit.

      Post-OR 6 month (20min): Visual Acuity, Refraction, Topography, Tonometry, Slit Lamp Exam.

      Post-OR 12 month (1.5 hours): Same as pre-op.

    <description>INTACS® prescription inserts used to treat patients with Keratoconus as a Humanitarian Use Device - Efficacy outcome measures including Visual Acuity, Refraction (pre-op refraction will be evaluated post-operatively to assess the effectiveness of Intacs Surgery in regards to deceasing the level of astigmatism and other corneal aberrations as a result of keratoconus), Topography (assessing post-operative vs. pre-operative corneal topography), Tonometry, Slit Lamp corneal findings, and the need for further interventions including corneal transplant.</description>
