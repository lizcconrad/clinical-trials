    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending-dose study of healthy
      volunteers after administration of single or multiple dose(s) of investigational drug
      (OLT1177 Caps or Placebo Caps). A total of 36 subjects will be enrolled across 6 cohorts, and
      subjects in each cohort will be randomized in a ratio of 5 active to 1 placebo.
