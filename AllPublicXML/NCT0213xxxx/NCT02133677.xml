  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastasis (BM) is among the most feared complications in cancer because even small
      tumors may cause incapacitating neurologic symptoms. It is observed in more than 50% of
      patients with lung cancer and 15% to 25% of patients with breast cancer. Temozolomide (TMZ)
      is an oral alkylating agent that crosses blood-brain barrier (BBB). This pilot study aims to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plus
      concomitant TMZ in lung cancer and breast cancer patients with BM.
