  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized prospective pilot study in a single academic center with historic
      controls. This study will compare Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of patients who
      have undergone childhood cancer treatment that has cardio-toxic effects to historic controls.
      The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a safe and effective method for early diagnosis
      of heart problems in children who are receiving chemotherapy treatments that may be toxic to
      the heart.

      The following tests and procedures will be performed after consent has been obtained. All
      tests and procedures noted below are being done for the sole purpose of the study:

      Visit 1. Subjects will be asked to complete some questionnaires and answer questions
      regarding smoking status and use of alcohol or smokeless tobacco. We will also gather basic
      information such as age, height, weight, gender, ethnicity, race, pertinent medical history
      as well as collect vital sign information (height, weight, blood pressure, heart and
      respiratory rate.) Next, subjects will undergo a routine transthoracic echocardiogram.

      Visit 2. Following the completion of the echocardiogram, and if selected to take part in the
      study, subjects will be schedule for a cardiac MRI test within a 3 months period.

      When subjects come in for Visit 2, they will receive a 12 lead electrocardiograph (ECG)
      before the cardiac 3D MRI.

      All females who are capable of becoming pregnant, except those who are age 11 and under, will
      then undergo urine pregnancy testing. If it is found that you are pregnant you will not be
      allowed to be in the study. If the female is under 18 and a positive pregnancy test result is
      obtained, we will inform both the participant and her parent/guardian.

      Subjects may then be placed in a &quot;simulated&quot; MRI to teach them what it will be like to enter
      the scanner and also train them on how to breathe calmly and regularly during the scan.

      Training will involve the use of a PrimeSense 3D sensor, similar to the cameras used in
      active videogame systems such as the Xbox Kinect, which will generate a 3D picture of their
      chest as they breathe. Following this training session, subjects will then undergo cardiac 3D
      MRI. Study participations will end after this visit.

        Subjects will come from the Kentucky Children's Hospital Hematology/Oncology clinic. The
        study team will ask the subject's primary physician to introduce the study in clinic to any
        patient who is identified by the study team as meeting the enrollment criteria. If the
        patient and his/her family are interested in participating, a member of the study team will
        be notified, and will then consent / assent the patient and family for the study. Patients
        who wish to consider the study and potentially enroll later will be given contact
        information to call the study personnel if they wish to enroll later.
