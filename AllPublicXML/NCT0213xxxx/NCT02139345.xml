  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical study to compare the safety and
      efficacy of TC-A PS total knee system with TC-PLUS Solution PS total knee system in Chinese
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease or hyperostosis, is the most
      common cause of knee arthritis. Pain, dyskinesia and disability induced by osteoarthritis
      impact severely on the subject's health and quality of life. Knee osteoarthritis is very
      common in the elderly population. As life expectancy has increased, the incidence of
      osteoarthritis rose significantly during the 20th century. For people over 60 years of age,
      approximately 50% show signs of osteoarthritis on x-rays, among which 35% -50% show clinical
      signs. For people over the age of 75, 80% had osteoarthritis symptoms.

      There has been an increase in imported knee prostheses during the past decade, so that
      surgeons now have more choices of implants. However, the high cost of imported prostheses has
      become a barrier to the development of TKA in China and caused many OA subjects requiring
      immediate TKA to have to delay or miss their surgery. The development and promotion of
      high-quality domestic joint implants and surgical instruments is the key to the development
      of TKA technique in China.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of subjects implanted
      with the TC-A PS total knee system compared to a randomized concurrent control group of
      subjects implanted with the TC-PLUS Solution PS total knee system in terms of Knee Society
      Clinical Score (KSCS) at 1 year.

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints.
The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties.</description>

    <measure>SF-12 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 Health Survey was first developed in 1995 as a shorter version of the SF-36 Health Survey used for measuring the overall health condition of the general population. The usefulness of SF-12 is improved by its simplicity and less time needed for completion, and it has a good reliability on the evaluation of quality of life. The SF-12v2 Health Survey is a 12-item generic Health-Related Quality of Life measure consisted of eight subscales: Physical functioning (PF), Role physical (RP), Bodily pain (BP), General health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social functioning (SF), Role emotional (RE) and Mental health (MH); and two composite summary scores: Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. All subscales and summary scores were ranged from 0-100. The higher the SF-12 score, the better the HRQOL outcome.</description>
