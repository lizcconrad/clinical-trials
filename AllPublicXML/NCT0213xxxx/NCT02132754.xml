  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-part dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum
      administered dose (MAD) of MK-4166 in participants with advanced solid tumors. In Part A,
      MK-4166 doses will be escalated quickly in successive cohorts and based on safety events may
      progress to Part B, in which the preliminary MTD will be identified. Based on safety events
      the study may progress to Part C in which the MTD will be confirmed. In Part D, participants
      will receive escalating doses of MK-4166 plus a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 200 mg
      to determine the MTD for MK-4166 in combination with pembrolizumab. Based on safety events in
      Part D, the study may progress to Part E in which the MTD for MK-4166 in combination with
      pembrolizumab will be confirmed.

      With Amendments 05/06, the dose confirmation Part E (combination of MK-4166 and
      pembrolizumab) will be limited to participants with advanced malignant melanoma.

      The primary study hypotheses are that MK-4166 as a single agent and MK-4166 in combination
      with pembrolizumab have acceptable safety and tolerability.
