  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively collect patients undergoing the standard CROSS regimen in the
      neoadjuvant setting of the treatment for gastro-oesophageal cancer. The investigators will
      focus on the potential geometric differences between the OAR and target volume on the initial
      planning CT and on the kilovolt (kV) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). They expect a
      potential difference in the abdominal part of the planned target volume (PTV) and/or
      gastro-oesophageal junction part. Furthermore, the impact of gastric filling , potential
      tumor regression and the accuracy of 5 mm PTV margin in the thoracic PTV will be monitored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimal radiotherapy planning and delivery is essential for irradiation of gastro-oesophageal
      junction tumors. There is a need for individualized radiotherapy delivery to the upper
      abdomen, because of mobility. Likewise, controlling gastric filling by instructing patients
      about fluid and food intake before treatment, may contribute to positional reproducibility.
      There is evidence that missing microscopic disease in treating the clinical target volume
      (CTV) results in a worse prognostic outcome. The investigators want to evaluate wether
      positional difference of stomach, with and without fasting prescription, has an impact of the
      delivered dose. They will focus on the part of the CTV extending in the stomach. The
      investigators hypothesize that measurement of the dose using verification kilovoltage cone
      beam CTs will provide information on potential cold/hot spots of dose delivery and monitor
      potential geometric differences during treatment. This may result in a suboptimal treatment
      and a reconsideration of matching target volume on soft tissue instead of bony landmarks. The
      investigators will evaluate the first clinical results with DGRT in patients with esophageal
      cancer.
