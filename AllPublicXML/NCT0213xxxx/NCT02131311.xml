    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of the pessary device by assessing reduction in
      urine leakage in approximately 80 women with SUI. Efficacy will be assessed by pad weight
      gain, frequency of stress urinary incontinence events, and a quality of life questionnaire.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as Measured by Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and end-of-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The IIQ-7 is based on 7 questions referring to areas which may have been influenced or changed by accidental urine loss and/or prolapse. These questions are assigned a value of, 0 = 'Not at all,' 1= 'Slightly,' 2 = 'Moderately,' or 3 'Greatly.' The IIQ-7 is scored by taking the average score of items and then multiplying the average by 33 1/3 to put scores on a scale from 0 to 100. A lower score is considered less impact to quality of life and a higher score reflects more impact to quality of life. In the same manner, a reduction in scores from baseline reflects improved quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life as Measured by Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7)</title>
        <description>The IIQ-7 is based on 7 questions referring to areas which may have been influenced or changed by accidental urine loss and/or prolapse. These questions are assigned a value of, 0 = ‘Not at all,’ 1= ‘Slightly,’ 2 = ‘Moderately,’ or 3 ‘Greatly.’ The IIQ-7 is scored by taking the average score of items and then multiplying the average by 33 1/3 to put scores on a scale from 0 to 100. A lower score is considered less impact to quality of life and a higher score reflects more impact to quality of life. In the same manner, a reduction in scores from baseline reflects improved quality of life.</description>
