    <textblock>
      Most patients presenting to the emergency department with chest discomfort have a nonischemic
      ECG and biomarkers of myocardial necrosis within normal limits. These patients are routinely
      admitted to hospital because of diagnostic uncertainty for occult MI or ischaemia.

      Acute myocardial ischemia is associated with acute mycardial dysfunction We tested a
      non-invasive plethysmographic arterial pressure change index of myocardial performance
      (dP/dt) that could be added to the diagnostic triage of ischaemia in the ER avoiding
      unnecessary admissions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with chest pain , the ECG remains the most important initial risk assessment
      tool. Myocardial ischemia or infarction is highly likely in patients with significant ST
      segment changes on the ECG or elevation in myocardial markers of necrosis. Identification of
      high-risk patients is more difficult in those with non ischemic ECG and negative markers on
      presentation.

      One of the most sensitive indices of contractility is the rate of increase of
      intraventricular pressure during isovolumetric contraction, (left ventricular dP/dt and
      arterial dP/dt). Dp/dt (dP/dt ejc ) represents the rate of change of pressure during
      ejection. It has been shown that cardiac contractility and dP/dt decreases during acute
      myocardial ischemia.

      We theorized that a higher value of dP/dt would be found for non ischemic chest pain than
      during ischemic chest pain because ischemia reduces myocardial contractility, whereas chest
      pain of non cardiac origin increases dP/dt by the stress of the pain itself.

      The current study describes a noninvasive plethysmographic dP/dt changes in patients
      presenting at the emergency department with acute chest pain, which could be added to the
      diagnostic triage of ischemia in the ED, thus decreasing the number of unnecessary
      admissions.
