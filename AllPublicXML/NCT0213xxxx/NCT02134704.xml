  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that moderate scoliosis patients have postural and kinematic
      differences (static and dynamic) compared with healthy volunteers and it is possible to
      characterize and quantify.

      The aim of this study is the detailed analysis of postural anomalies in moderate scoliosis
      patients compared with healthy volunteers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects participating in the study must wear sensors that will be arrange at the shoulders,
      spine, pelvis and legs. Subjects will perform under the direction of the investigator,
      different tasks of a total duration of 45 minutes.

      During the period of experimentation, the data collected will be:

        -  the positions of each one of the sensors in all three planes of space,

        -  the ground support forces

    All patients were recruted but it has been difficulte to recrute all volunteers (15/30) .
    However data should be sufficient for analyse of data.
