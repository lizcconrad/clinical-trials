      The purpose of this study is to predict and explain on the basis of brain function and
      structure the behavioral and brain effects of an evidence-based intervention for adults with
      high-functioning autism, Virtual Reality-Social Cognition Training (Kandalaft et al., 2012;
      Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders). Adults with autism will be randomly assigned
      to receive either (a) two hours per week of intervention services for five weeks, or (b) a
      treatment as usual control. The intervention will focus on enhancing social skills, social
      cognition, and social functioning. Outcome measures will evaluate changes in these social
      skills, cognition, and functioning using standardized assessments. We will perform structural
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at three time points-before, during,
      and after treatment (i.e., Time Point #1, 2, and 3).

      treatment, after the treatment, and a 3-month follow-up (i.e., Time Point #1, 2, and 3).

      All the recruitment will be taking place at Yale Child Study Center (YCSC), while the
      intervention will be delivered online by therapists located at the Center for BrainHealth at
      the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). The intervention is called Virtual Reality-Social
      Cognition Training (VR-SCT) and has been approved by the IRB at UTD (approval number #06-54).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults:

               1. Age: 18-40, inclusive

               2. A male or female outpatient

          2. High-functioning (so that the treatment can effectively benefit the subjects):

               1. Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of WASI at least 80

               2. Able to give informed consent prior to initiation of any protocol required
                  procedures

          3. Autism Spectrum Disorder:

               1. Having a current primary diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (including
                  Asperger's Disorder) from a licensed psychologist/psychiatrist or from a school
                  diagnostician, as defined by the DSM-IV criteria.

               2. For this project, diagnosis will not be determined by our assessment. The
                  participants we enroll will already carry a current primary diagnosis of Autism
                  Spectrum Disorder. This verification of their diagnosis may also come from study
                  personnel who have seen and/or treated the patient prior to his or her
                  involvement in the project and can verbally confirm that they carry the proper
                  diagnosis.

          4. Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) must be at least 4-5 words (the intervention method
             requires this)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Speech-language criteria:

               1. Those who are not fluent in written and oral English will not be eligible to
                  participate, as many of the instruments are not validated in other languages.

               2. Significant hearing loss or other severe sensory impairment

               3. Inability to read self-report instruments

          2. Health criteria:

               1. Those whose clinical status (e.g., serious suicidal or homicidal risk) requires
                  inpatient or day hospital treatment

               2. Those with a history of seizures, or current use of anticonvulsants

               3. A fragile health status

               4. A history of significant head trauma or serious brain or psychiatric illness

               5. Having any other current psychiatric condition or complications, such as

             i. Diagnosed with substance dependence within the last three months. ii. Current use
             of prescription medications that may affect cognitive processes under study.

             iii. Current primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder I or II iv. Axis I psychopathology
             v. Depression

          3. Any metal or electromagnetic implants, including:

               1. Cardiac pacemaker

               2. Defibrillator

               3. Artificial heart valve

               4. Aneurysm clip

               5. Cochlear implants

               6. Shrapnel

               7. Neurostimulators

               8. History of metal fragments in eyes or skin
