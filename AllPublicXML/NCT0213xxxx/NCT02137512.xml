  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an automated insulin management system (&quot;study
      system&quot;) can safely be used at home to manage blood sugar. The study system includes (1) a
      CGM that measures glucose levels, (2) a computer program on a smartphone that determines how
      much insulin is needed and allows the study participant user to control the whole system, and
      (3) an insulin pump that delivers the insulin. The CGM will be from Dexcom. The pump will be
      from Roche. The CGM and pump are similar to the devices that are currently available for
      people to purchase and use. However, the smartphone device, the CGM sensor type used with it,
      and the overall study system can only be used for research at this time.

      The study will be completed by about 24 individuals at 6 centers in the United States and
      Europe. This study has several phases and will take about 11-14 weeks to complete depending
      on whether the study participant is a CGM user or not.

      At selected sites (based on subject eligibility and availability), approximately 10-20
      subjects who exhibit safe and competent use of the system at home will be given the option to
      continue home use of the system in Day-and-Night Closed-Loop mode for up to 5 months.

           will need to use the study CGM (visit 1)

        -  Up to 3 weeks using the study CGM (depends on your current CGM use), followed by an
           office visit (visit 2)

    <description>Episodes of severe hypoglycemia events during the 5-month extension phase defined as an event requiring assistance of another person due to altered consciousness to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. This means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat him or herself, was unable to verbalize his or her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or experienced seizure or coma. These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. If plasma glucose measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

        <title>Episodes of Severe Hypoglycemia Events</title>
        <description>Episodes of severe hypoglycemia events during the 5-month extension phase defined as an event requiring assistance of another person due to altered consciousness to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. This means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat him or herself, was unable to verbalize his or her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or experienced seizure or coma. These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. If plasma glucose measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.</description>

          <description>A control-to-range automated insulin management system using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and subcutaneous insulin pump infusion in individuals with type 1 diabetes in the home environment.
Closed-Loop Control System: The devices that will be used in the Closed-Loop Control System include the following components:
DiAs – a smart-phone medical platform;
Dexcom Dexcom G4 Platinum connected to DiAs via CGM receiver and USB-Bluetooth relay hardware;
Roche Accu-Chek insulin pump connected to DiAs via wireless Bluetooth;
Remote Monitoring Server connected to DiAs via 3G or local Wi-Fi network, and
Modular Closed-Loop Control Algorithm Running on DiAs, which is of Control-to-Range (CTR) class</description>
