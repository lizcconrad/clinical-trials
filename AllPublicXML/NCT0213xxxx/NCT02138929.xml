      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of LDE225 that
      can be given in combination with everolimus to patients with esophageal or GEJ cancer. The
      safety of the drug combination will also be studied.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to a combination dose level of the study drugs based on when participant joins this
      study. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level of LDE225. Each new group will receive a
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. All
      participants will receive the same dose level of everolimus. This will continue until the
      highest tolerable combination dose of LDE225 and everolimus is found. Up to 24 participants
      will be enrolled in this part of the study.

      Once the highest tolerable dose of the combination of LDE225 and everolimus is found, up to
      18 participants will receive the combination dose level that was found to be well tolerated
      in the earlier part of the study.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Every study cycle is 28 days.

      Participant will take up to 4 capsules or tablets of LDE225 by mouth 1 time every day.
      Participant's doctor will tell participant how many capsules/tablets participant will need to
      take. Participant should take the study drug each time with a glass of water (about 8 ounces
      total) at the same time every day. Participant should swallow the study drug whole, one
      capsule/tablet every 2 minutes, without chewing or opening the study drug. Participant should
      eat a light breakfast (such as toast and jam) at least 2 hours before taking the study drug,
      then participant should not eat or drink anything for at least 1 hour after the dose.

      Participant will take up to 2 tablets of everolimus by mouth 1 time every day with the LDE225
      capsules without food. Participant will take the tablets each time with a glass of water at
      the same time every day. The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed or crushed.

      If participant cannot swallow the everolimus tablets, the tablets should be dissolved in
      water just before taking them. Add about 2 tablespoons of water into a glass. The tablets
      should then be added and stirred gently until the tablets are dissolved. This mixture should
      then be drunk. Afterwards, the glass should be rinsed with an additional 2 tablespoons of
      water and drunk. Participant's doctor will discuss this with participant.

      If participant vomits after taking participant's dose of study drugs, participant should not
      take another dose that day.

      It is very important that participant takes the study drugs given to participant just as the
      study doctor tells participant and that participant does not miss any dose. If participant
      forgets to take a dose of LDE225, participant should take it as soon as participant remembers
      (within 6 hours of the missed dose). If more than 6 hours have passed, participant should
      skip that dose and take participant's next dose the next day as planned. If participant
      forgets to take a dose of everolimus, participant should skip that dose and take
      participant's next dose the next day as planned.

      If participant has a study visit that day, participant should take participant's dose of
      study drugs at the clinic.

      Participant will need to store LDE225 in participant's refrigerator at all times. Everolimus
      can be stored at room temperature. Participant should not share participant's supply of
      LDE225 and everolimus with anyone. Participant will keep a study drug diary to help
      participant keep track of participant's study drug doses. If participant misses or delays a
      dose, participant should write it down in the diary. Participant should bring the diary to
      every study visit.

      At the end of each cycle and when participant stops taking part in the study, participant
      will return any leftover study drugs to the study nurse.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected
           for a pregnancy test.

      Every week during Cycle 1 only, the study staff will call and ask participant how participant
      is doing.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every 2 cycles after that, participant will have an EKG.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every 2 cycles after that, participant will have a CT scan or MRI of
      the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, extra blood may be drawn to follow up on any side effects.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      participant's best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if
      the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to
      follow study directions.

      Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit (described below).

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 14 days after participant's last dose of study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the cholesterol
           levels in participant's blood, and to check how well participant's blood clots.
           Participant will need to fast for at least 8 hours before this blood draw.

        -  Participant will have an EKG.

        -  Participant will have a CT scan or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease, if the doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected
           for a pregnancy test.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      At 30 days after the end-of-study visit:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have an EKG.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected
           for a pregnancy test.

      About 3 months after the follow-up visit, participant will be contacted by the study staff by
      telephone and/or seen in the clinic. Participant will be asked about any drugs participant
      may be taking and about participant's general health. If participant is called, the call will
      take about 5-10 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. LDE225 is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available to treat kidney, breast, and pancreatic
      cancers. The combination of LDE225 and everolimus to treat esophageal or GEJ cancer is
      investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 42 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

          5. Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
             potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study.

          6. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable
             of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective methods of contraception during the
             study and 6 months after. Hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected,
             implanted) are not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the
             effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Highly effective contraception methods
             include combination of any two of the following: a) Placement of a non-hormonal
             intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal intrauterine system (IUS); b) Barrier
             methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)
             with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository; c. Total abstinence (When
             this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.);

          8. (Continued from # 7): or d) Male/female sterilization. (Sterilization: Patient has had
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only
             when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
             level assessment. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
             documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients,
             the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.]).

          9. (Continued from # 8): Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing
             potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
             appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or
             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
             ligation at least six weeks prior to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
             only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
             level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.

         10. Male patients whose sexual partner(s) are WOCBP who are not willing to use adequate
             contraception, during the study and for 6 months after the end of treatment (Male
             patients must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception (e.g.,
             spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and continuing
             using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months following the
             study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as during
             intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the study treatment
             via seminal fluid.).

         11. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

         12. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to LDE 225 or Everolimus in the study or other rapamycin analogs (e.g.
             sirolimus, temsirolimus).

         13. Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have
             narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment
             with LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with LDE225.

         14. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP 450 3A4 are ineligible.

         15. Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular
             dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on
             concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, such as
             HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and gemfibrozil, and that cannot be
             discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225 treatment. Patients who are
             planning on embarking on a new strenuous exercise regimen after initiation of study
             treatment, should also be excluded. Muscular activities, such as strenuous exercise,
             that can result in significant increases in plasma CK levels should be avoided whilst
             on LDE225 treatment.

         16. Concurrent medical condition requiring the use of immunosuppressive medications or
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic or absorbable topical corticosteroids (doses
             greater than 10mg/day prednisone or equivalent). Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids
             (with minimal systemic absorption) may be continued. Non-absorbed intra-articular
             steroid injections are allowed. The exception to the use of steroids is the treatment
             of serious adverse events (SAEs) such as pneumonitis and the prevention of emesis.

         17. Known history of HIV seropositivity.

         18. Patients who have received live attenuated vaccines within 1 week of start of
             Everolimus and during the study.

         19. Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant heart disease, including any one
             of the following: a) Angina pectoris within 3 months; b) Acute myocardial infarction
