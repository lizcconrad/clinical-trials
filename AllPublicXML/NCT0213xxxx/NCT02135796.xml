    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Echocardiography can provide evaluation of right or left ventricular dysfunction
      and volume status during resuscitation of patients with sepsis and septic shock and guide
      intravenous vasopressor and fluid therapy. While there are numerous echocardiographic studies
      regarding cardiac function and volume status in patients with established shock, there are
      none that describe these during the early resuscitation of septic shock.

      The study objective is to correlate echocardiographic findings with clinical parameters and
      net fluid balance measured during the early resuscitation of critically ill patients with
      sepsis and septic shock.

      Aim 1) correlate echocardiographic findings of cardiac function with physiologic markers in
      the early hours of resuscitation

      Aim 2) correlate cardiac function and fluid status with clinical outcomes

      Aim 3) evaluate the change in cardiac function over time in patients with sepsis and septic
      shock

      Aim 4) evaluate long term clinical outcomes for patients with sepsis and septic shock.

    <description>Correlate echocardiographic findings of cardiac function with physiologic markers in the early hours of resuscitation. Specifically, cardiac markers will be analyzed in relation to cardiac function, including ejection fraction, strain, and diastolic function, and correlate these with several clinical parameters, including receipt of fluid, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and septic cardiomyopathy</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - at least 13 years of age

        SEPSIS PATIENTS:

        Sepsis patients must have

          1. Suspected or confirmed infection

             AND

          2. Organ dysfunction as defined by a SOFA &gt;= 2 above baseline (if no baseline data
             available, SOFA assumed to be 0)

        OR

        SEPTIC SHOCK PATIENTS:

        AFTER INFUSION OF 20ML/KG CRYSTALLOID OR EQUIVALENT, Septic shock patients must have

          1. Suspected or confirmed infection

             AND

          2. Lactate &gt; 2 mmol/L

             AND

          3. Receiving vasopressors

               -  Enrollment of patients should occur within 8 hours of meeting criteria for severe
                  sepsis or septic shock if it is required that a research only TTE be performed in
                  the 0-6 hours after ICU admission. If a clinical TTE is performed in this
                  timeframe, patients may be enrolled up to 24 hours after ICU admission.
