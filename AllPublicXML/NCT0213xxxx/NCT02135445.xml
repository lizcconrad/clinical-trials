      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TAK-385 for achieving and
      maintaining testosterone suppression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-385. Men with prostate cancer benefit from
      receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to minimize testosterone levels before, during
      and after EBRT. This combination increases the potential success of treating their disease.
      This study will see if TAK-385 [an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist]
      brings testosterone levels down sufficiently, with the convenience and comfort of taking a
      pill. It will look at the time it takes to restore testosterone levels after radiation
      therapy as well. One hundred participants will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin)
      to a treatment group: 60 to TAK-385, and 40 to degarelix.

      Those assigned to TAK-385 will take a daily pill. Those assigned to degarelix will receive an
      injection under the skin once every four weeks at the clinic. They will start radiation
      therapy when testosterone is low enough, after at least 12 weeks of treatment. This trial
      will be conducted at clinics in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK). Participants
      will visit the clinic up to 14 times over 37 weeks for physical exams and blood tests, and
      might receive one follow-up telephone call.

    <description>AMS scale is a self-administered questionnaire used to 1) assess symptoms of aging (independent from those that are disease related) between groups of males under different conditions; 2) evaluate the severity of symptoms over time; and 3) measure changes before and after androgen therapy. Each question was answered between none (1) to extremely severe (5) for 17 items from psychological (5 items), somatic (7 items), and sexual (5 items) categories. Total score is sum of all the item scores and range from 17 (minimum) to 85 (maximum), where high score indicated high level of symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and last post-baseline value up to Week 37</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included 30 questions comprising 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties) and a global health and QOL scale. Most questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'Very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). All domain scores were calculated as an average of item scores and transformed to 0-100 score range where a high score from 0-100 indicates: A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/quality of life (QoL) represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problem.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-PR25 : EORTC module designed to supplement the QLQ-C30 for any application in prostate cancer. It Consist of 25 questions distributed on 6 domains: urinary symptoms (8 items), incontinence aid (1 item), bowel symptoms (4 items), hormonal treatment-related symptoms (HTRS) (6 items), sexual activity (2 items), and sexual functioning (4 items). Questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'). All raw domain scores are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores reflecting either more symptoms (urinary, bowel, hormonal treatment-related symptoms) or higher levels of activity or functioning (sexual).</description>

          <title>Primary Gleason Score</title>
          <description>Gleason score is a histological score that, together with other clinical factors may be used to predict the potential aggressiveness of the cancer and thus its risk of eventually spreading. Gleason scores range from 2-10, where 2-4: lower risk; 5-6: moderate risk; 8-10: higher risk with lower score representing most well-differentiated tumors and higher score representing least-differentiated tumors. Primary grading in Gleason score is assigned to dominant pattern of tumor which has to be &gt;50% of total pattern seen.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Aging Male's Symptoms (AMS) Total Scale Score</title>
        <description>AMS scale is a self-administered questionnaire used to 1) assess symptoms of aging (independent from those that are disease related) between groups of males under different conditions; 2) evaluate the severity of symptoms over time; and 3) measure changes before and after androgen therapy. Each question was answered between none (1) to extremely severe (5) for 17 items from psychological (5 items), somatic (7 items), and sexual (5 items) categories. Total score is sum of all the item scores and range from 17 (minimum) to 85 (maximum), where high score indicated high level of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included 30 questions comprising 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties) and a global health and QOL scale. Most questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'Very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). All domain scores were calculated as an average of item scores and transformed to 0-100 score range where a high score from 0-100 indicates: A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/quality of life (QoL) represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problem.</description>

        <description>EORTC QLQ-PR25 : EORTC module designed to supplement the QLQ-C30 for any application in prostate cancer. It Consist of 25 questions distributed on 6 domains: urinary symptoms (8 items), incontinence aid (1 item), bowel symptoms (4 items), hormonal treatment-related symptoms (HTRS) (6 items), sexual activity (2 items), and sexual functioning (4 items). Questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'). All raw domain scores are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores reflecting either more symptoms (urinary, bowel, hormonal treatment-related symptoms) or higher levels of activity or functioning (sexual).</description>
