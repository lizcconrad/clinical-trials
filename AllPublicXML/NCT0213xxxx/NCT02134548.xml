  <brief_summary>

      This study is a multi-site trial assessing the sensitivity of Chagas Detect™ Plus rapid test
      versus standard reference tests (e.g. IFA, IHA, RIPA) for Chagas diagnosis.

      The Chagas Detect™ Plus rapid test serves as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of
      Chagas infection in patients. This test is intended to be used on human whole blood or serum
      samples. Chagas Detect™ Plus results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by testing with
      a reference standard test.

      Subjects will be patients at clinical sites located in Chagas-endemic areas. After informed
      consent is obtained and the subject is screened for eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will be
      collected. One is blood from finger prick, and the other is blood from venous puncture (drawn
      from vein in arm).

      Rapid tests and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory
      staff members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the
      samples from each method independently.

        Human males and females of varying ages and geographical locations where Chagas infection
        is endemic. We will use retrospective (archived) and prospective human serum and blood
        samples.

        Retrospective (archived) serum samples are not collected specifically for this study and
        are not individually identifiable to the Investigators. These samples will fall under the
        category of &quot;leftover&quot; specimens as described by FDA guidance.

        Prospective whole blood samples will be collected in compliance with human subject
        protection. The first sample will be collected from finger prick; the second sample will be
        collected from venous puncture.
