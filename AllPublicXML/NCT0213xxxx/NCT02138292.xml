  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single-arm, one-site therapeutic trial of the combination of
      trametinib plus digoxin for advanced melanoma. endpoints are toxicities assessed by nCi CTCae
      v4.1 within the first 8 weeks, responses measured by ReCiST v1.1 criteria every 8 weeks with
      scans and exams, tumor sensitivity to the drug combination quantified by tumor regressions in
      nSG mice, and correlations of response with tumor sensitivity, BRaF status, MaPK inhibitor
      exposure history, and tumor sodium pump expression.

      Treatment Dosage and administration

      Study Drugs:

        1. Trametinib (2mg) will be administered orally on a daily basis.

        2. Digoxin (0.25mg) will be administered orally on a daily basis.

      on a 8-week cycle, duration of treatment can last from 8 to 104 weeks.

      endpoints

        1. Toxicities will be assessed via nCi's CTCae v4.1 toxicity criteria. DLTs will be defined
           based on the rate of drug-related (definitely or probably) grade 3-5 adverse events
           experienced within the first 8 weeks of study treatment. The MTD will be exceeded if
           more than 20% of patients on the study experience DLTs.

        2. Responses will be measured by ReCiST v1.1 every 8 weeks. Response duration will be
           defined as time from first documented response until disease progression. PFS is time
           from treatment until disease progression.

        3. Patient tumor sensitivity to the drug combination will be quantified by the amount of
           subcutaneous established tumor growth inhibition in nSG mice by 5d/week oral gavage with
           drugs.

        4. Tumor nRaS status will be determined by tumor Dna extraction, PCR amplification of exons
           and Sanger sequencing of nRaS.

        5. History of prior MaPK inhibitor therapies will document MeK inhibitor exposures.

        6. Sodium pump subunit expression will be analyzed by pretreatment tumor
           immunohistochemistry and a qualitative 0 to 3+ grading system.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To describe the toxicities and estimate the frequency of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)
           of digoxin in combination with trametinib in advanced melanoma patients and estimate the
           frequency of DLTs.

        -  To measure the response rate, response duration and progression free survival (PFS) of
           digoxin plus trametinib in advanced melanoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To correlate NSG xenograft sensivity to the drug combination with clinical response in
           the same patient.

        -  To compare response rates in MAPK inhibitor naive versus refractory patients and NRAS
           mutant versus wild-type patients and for sodium pump 3 subunit high tumor expression
           versus low tumor expression patients.

      Rationale: Having established cell culture and xenograft systems for studying patient
      melanoma samples, the researchers were able to grow tumors in vitro and in vivo from single
      cells and found a correlation of tumor metastatic behavior in immunocompromised mice and in
      patients. Recently they have extended the experiments to examine melanoma sensitivity to
      novel compounds. In screens of FDA approved drugs, they found several cardenolides including
      digoxin that reproducibly exhibited greater toxicity to primary human melanomas as compared
      to a range of normal human cells. They then examined the anti-tumor efficacy against primary
      human melanomas growing in vivo as xenografts. While trametinib, vemurafenib, and digoxin and
      digitoxin individually slowed the growth of human melanomas xenografts, they did not cause
      tumor regression. However, the combination of digoxin or digitoxin and trametinib caused
      substantial tumor regression using melanomas obtained from multiple patients, some with BRAF
      mutations and some without. The effects were dramatically better than trametinib, digoxin,
      digitoxin or vemurafenib alone. No difference in efficacy for the combination was seen in
      BRAF mutant and BRAF wild-type samples.
