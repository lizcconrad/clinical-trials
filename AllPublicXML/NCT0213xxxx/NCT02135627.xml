      Introduction: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding arising from malignant tumors is increasingly
      recognized as a result of oncological advances and improved detection methods, and stems from
      local vessel damage and tumor invasion with associated derangements in the hemostatic
      system(1, 2). Although conventional endoscopic hemostasis methods improve outcomes in UGIB
      due to peptic ulcers and other non-variceal benign bleeding lesions of the upper, and perhaps
      the lower GI tract, data on their use in hemorrhagic, upper or lower gastrointestinal
      neoplasms are scarce and associated with varying success in initial hemostasis and high
      rebleeding rates(3-7). Other recognized single or multimodality treatment approaches include
      radiation therapy, interventional angiography, and surgery. All exhibit disappointing
      rebleeding rates, and in the case of emergency surgery, high mortality(4, 8-11). Challenges
      associated with bleeding tumors include hematological derangements such as thrombocytopenia,
      disseminated intravascular coagulation, and neutropenia, as well as the endoscopic
      manipulation of friable, diffusely bleeding surfaces when attempting hemostasis(2, 12, 13).
      The recent advent of TC-325 (HemosprayTM) to Canada, Europe and Asia - referred henceforth as
      TC-325 - may provide a highly adapted novel endoscopic hemostatic therapeutic alternative for
      this refractory clinical entity, with promising uncontrolled observations having just been
      published by our group(13) and others(14). More robust controlled evaluative data are now
      needed. We propose to study the use of TC-325 in upper and lower malignant GI bleeding
      compared to contemporary standard of care, and more specifically seeks funding for a pilot
      study to inform a subsequent peer-review application for a larger, more definitive randomized
      clinical trial (RCT).
