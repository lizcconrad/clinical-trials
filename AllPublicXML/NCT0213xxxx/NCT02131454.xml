    <textblock>
      Pharmacologic treatment of asthma and COPD is based mainly on inhalations. The aim of the
      study is to determine if short training of inhalation technique in patients with obstructive
      diseases may influence the course of asthma and COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both asthma and COPD are common medical problems. Pharmacologic treatment of asthma and COPD
      is based mainly on inhalations. The inhalation technique is the key factor for effective
      management of bronchial obstruction. At the same time, a significant proportion of patients
      with asthma or COPD do not use inhalers properly.

      The aim of the study is:

        -  to analyze the frequency and type of common mistakes in inhalation technique and

        -  to determine the impact of short individual training of inhalation technique on the
           course of asthma and COPD.

      Fifty patients with asthma and 50 patients with COPD treated in the out-patient clinic or in
      the Department of Internal Medicine, Pneumonology and Allergology will be enrolled to the
      study.

      The stage of severity (COPD) and control of the disease (asthma), quality of life, proper
      inhaler intake will be assessed at the study onset and at a second visit after 6 months.

      At the second visit all patients will get a short, individual information about the etiology,
      course and general treatment plan of asthma / COPD. Patients will be randomized into two
      groups:

      A. group of patients trained in proper inhalation technique B. group of patients without
      inhalation technique training Control visits will be held 3 and 6 months after training.
