      The purpose of the study is to assess viral kinetics and clinical symptoms kinetics of
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in pediatric patients hospitalized with RSV confirmed lower
      respiratory tract infection (LRTI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory prospective study (a study in which the patients are identified and
      then followed forward in time for the outcome of the study). The study will consist of two
      phases: a screening phase (Day 1) and an assessment phase (Day 2 to Day 7). During screening
      phase, pediatric patients consecutively hospitalized with RSV-related infection will be
      enrolled in the study within 24 hours of admission if symptomatic for maximum 5 days before
      the hospital admission and if the informed consent form (ICF) was obtained. The diagnosis of
      RSV infection will follow using a standard of care (SOC) rapid point point of care (POC)
      detection method available in the hospital unit on nasal specimens .During the assessment
      phase the collection of nasal specimens will be done daily for a maximum of 6 days (Day 2 to
      Day 7 of hospitalization) or until patients will be discharged from hospital. Approximately
      50 patients will be enrolled in this study. The total duration of the study for each patient
      will be approximately 7 days. The study duration will extend until the targeted number of 50
      RSV hospitalized children have completed the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Respiratory Syncytial Viral Load (rate of viral clearance)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (baseline) to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>RSV viral clearance, defined as the change in log viral load (VL) from Day 1 to Day 3, where the VL is measured in nasal specimens with quantitative reverse transcript poly cycle reaction (qRT-PCR).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Symptoms Score (CSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (baseline) to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the RSV disease will be assessed using CSS. CSS will be computed based on clinical parameters (O2 saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate) and lung auscultation examination. CSS score ranges from 0 (best) to 15 (worst). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Medical Support Score (MSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (baseline) to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the RSV disease will be assessed using MSS. MSS will take into account the use of supplementary oxygen, the request for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission and the length of hospitalization. The MSS score ranges from 0 (best) to 5 (worst). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

             prior to any study-related procedure(s) being performed and is willing to allow the
             participation of child to the study for 7 consecutive days or until hospital discharge
             (whatever comes first)
