    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational drug (DFMO) in
      combination with bortezomib, for relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma. DFMO is an
      investigational drug because it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). This study will look at the safety and tolerability of DFMO in
      combination with bortezomib as well as the tumors response to this study drug.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: ≤ 21 years at the time of diagnosis.

          -  Diagnosis: Histologic verification at either the time of original diagnosis or relapse
             of neuroblastoma.

          -  Disease Status: For the purposes of this study, aggressive multidrug chemotherapy is
             defined as chemotherapy including 2 or more agents that must include an alkylating
             agent and a platinum-containing compound. Patients must have ONE of the following:

          -  First episode of recurrent disease following completion of aggressive multi-drug
             frontline therapy.

          -  First episode of progressive disease during aggressive multi-drug frontline therapy.

          -  Primary resistant/refractory disease detected at the conclusion of at least 4 cycles
             of aggressive multidrug induction chemotherapy on or according to a high-risk
             neuroblastoma protocol (examples include Children's Oncology Group trials: A3973,
             ANBL0532, ANBL09P1, etc.).

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease, including at least one of the following: Measureable

             therapy or no additional therapies proven to prolong survival with an acceptable
             quality of life.

          -  A negative urine pregnancy test is required for female subjects of child bearing
             potential (onset of menses or ≥13 years of age).

                    -  Serum bilirubin must be ≤ 2.0 mg/dl

               2. Subjects must have adequate Bone Marrow function defined as:

             marrow involvement with neuroblastoma are eligible provided that minimum ANC and

          -  Prior Therapy- Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all
             prior anti- cancer chemotherapy and be within the following timelines:

               1. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy: Must not have received within 2 weeks of
                  enrollment onto this study (6 weeks if prior nitrosourea).

               2. Hematopoietic growth factors: At least 5 days since the completion of therapy
                  with a growth factor.

               3. Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days since the completion of therapy
                  with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond
                  7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during
                  which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be

                  ≥ 2 months must have elapsed since transplant.

             infection is judged to be well controlled in the opinion of the investigator.
