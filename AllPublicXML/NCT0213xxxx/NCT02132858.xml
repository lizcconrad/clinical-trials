      This research trial studies genetic mutations in blood and tissue samples to see if they can
      be used to predict treatment response in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer
      undergoing chemoradiation. Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue in the laboratory from
      patients with cancer may help doctors learn more about genetic mutations or changes that
      occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and help doctors understand how patients respond to
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the tumor-specific mutation(s) detected using the CancerCode™ mutation panel
      as a predictor of pathologic response to chemoradiation for patients with rectal
      adenocarcinoma undergoing chemoradiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of utilizing biopsy specimens from locally advanced rectal
      adenocarcinoma to perform CancerCode™ mutation panel genetic testing.

      II. To assess disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated on
      study.

      III. To collect pilot data regarding the clonal heterogeneity of rectal adenocarcinoma, and
      the relationship of this heterogeneity with treatment response.

      IV. To evaluate the treatment response utilizing multiple fludeoxyglucose F 18-positron
      emission tomography (FDG-PET) parameters including heterogeneity and textural features as an
      exploratory study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood and tissue samples for analysis via sequencing.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years.

    <measure>Tumor response measured using the tumor regression grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Whether mutations in any gene on the CancerCode mutation panel are associated with tumor response will be assessed. In each sample, the presence or absence of mutations (0/1) for each gene on the panel will be evaluated. Each gene will be tested separately for its association with tumor response using a two-sample Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test with a type-I error of 0.05 for a two-sided test.</description>

    <measure>Tumor heterogeneity in patients with partial response to radiation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Whether there are differences in the mutation profiles in the 4 tumor samples will be assessed, with differences being considered evidence of possible heterogeneity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be calculated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier. If promising mutations are identified, survival between mutation positive and negative patients will be compared using the log-rank test.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be calculated using the methods of Kaplan and Meier. If promising mutations are identified, survival between mutation positive and negative patients will be compared using the log-rank test.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in mutation profiles</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Any differences between pre- and post- test results (a different mutation status for any gene on the panel) will be considered evidence of a change. The overall proportion of patients exhibiting pre-post differences will be characterized, and particular genes of interest may be tested individually with an exact test of marginal homogeneity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>PET-computed tomography parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum standardized uptake value will be calculated, as well as textural measures such as coarseness, busyness, contrast, and complexity. The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests will be used to examine association between image measures and response. Image measures before and after radiation using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data will be compared and differences in textural measures across tumor grades 0-3 will be assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Associations between textural measures and tumor mutation profiles will be explored, also using non-parametric tests.</description>
