  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate through a clinical spectrophotometric analysis
      the staining side effect of a 0.2% CHX mouthwash containing an anti discoloration system
      (ADS) compared with a 0.12% and a 0.2% CHX alone mouthwash after periodontal surgery. The
      efficacy of the products and the patient's opinion and acceptance were also assessed.
