  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to compare two different approaches to reducing levels of
      nicotine in cigarettes: an immediate reduction in nicotine content in cigarettes to
      non-addictive levels or a gradual reduction in nicotine content in cigarettes to
      non-addictive levels. These two approaches will then be contrasted to a group that continues
      to smoke cigarettes with nicotine content similar to conventional cigarettes.

      This project will be conducted to compare product use patterns and biomarkers of exposure
      between smokers who are assigned to a) gradual reduction in reduced nicotine content (RNC)
      cigarettes; b) immediate reduction to very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes or c)
      normal nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes. The outcomes from this study will provide
      information on different approaches to reducing levels of nicotine in cigarettes and will
      determine the approach with the most optimal outcomes taking into account the balance between
      overall risk reduction (possibly maximized by abrupt switching) and compliance and
      acceptability (possibly maximized by gradual reduction of RNC cigarettes).
