    <textblock>
      This is a parallel 3-group, multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind (evaluator)
      controlled pilot trial, with a 38- week follow-up. Patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder
      (BD) according to DSM -5 criteria for mild depression or subsyndromal depressive symptoms are
      assigned to one of the following 3 treatment groups: 1) psychopharmacological treatment plus
      Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT); 2) psychopharmacological treatment plus
      structured group psychoeducation; 3) treatment as usual (TAU), including standard psychiatric
      care with standard pharmacologic treatment.

      This is a parallel 3-group, multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind (evaluator)
      controlled pilot trial, with a 38- week follow-up. Patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder
      (BD) according to DSM -5 criteria for mild depression or subsyndromal depressive symptoms are
      assigned to one of the following 3 treatment groups: 1) psychopharmacological treatment plus
      Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT); 2) psychopharmacological treatment plus
      structured group psychoeducation; 3) treatment as usual (TAU), including standard psychiatric
      care with standard pharmacologic treatment. After written informed consent is signed,
      patients meeting the inclusion criteria are randomized (2:2:1 ratio) through a Random
      Allocation Software. All three groups are assessed at baseline (t0), immediately after
      completing the program (t1; 8 weeks) and at follow-up six months after randomization. The
      assessments include the following variables: depression, anxiety, general and social
      cognition, global functioning, BDNF, and other clinical variables. The evaluator who
      collected the biomarkers and the clinical and psychometric data will be blind to treatment.
      The interrater variability between all researchers will be checked.

    <description>The MBCT program is conducted in HULP (BRV and CBP), which also train therapists from Vitoria, in order to homogenize the intervention. Random sessions are video or audio recorded to be discussed and analyzed by the treatment team. The manualized MBCT therapy consists of 8 weekly sessions of 90 minutes and is applied in groups of approximately 10-15 patients. At least two programs in H. La Paz and two in the hospital de Santiago (Vitoria) will be provided.</description>

    <description>Psychoeducation program will be held in groups of 10 to 15 patients in 90-minute weekly sessions led by two therapists also outside the research team. The specific program of 8 sessions is focused addressing disease awareness, adherence to treatment and early detection of prodromal symptoms. Homework will also be included. The program is based on the Psychoeducation Manual for Bipolar Disorder . F.Colom , E.Vieta . Ars Medica, 2004. Attendance at least 80 % of the sessions of both interventions will be required to be considered complete.</description>
