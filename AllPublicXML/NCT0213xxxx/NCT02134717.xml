  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesizes that inhibition of the receptor CCR5 by maraviroc will diminish
      inflammation in patients with sarcoidosis. Subjects with active sarcoidosis will first
      undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to recover lung immune cells for baseline
      analysis. They will then receive the drug maraviroc for 6 weeks duration. They will then
      undergo a repeat bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to recover lung immune cells for
      analysis following maraviroc treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that inhibition of CCR5 by maraviroc may have a beneficial
      immunomodulatory effect on the granulomatous inflammation of pulmonary sarcoidosis. The
      specific aim of this proposal is the investigate the effect of CCR5 inhibition on the
      trafficking of mononuclear cells to the lung, skin, peripheral blood in subjects with active
      sarcoidosis exposed to the CCR5 inhibitor, maraviroc. A second aim will be to isolate by cell
      sorting cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+CCR5+ T cells for amplified gene expression
      profiling before and after CCR5 inhibition, experiments the investigators believe will
      elucidate genes associated with downstream activation and inhibition of CCR5 receptor
      function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven sarcoidosis from any site (noncaseating granulomas without other
             causes).

          2. Diagnosis of active sarcoidosis (Sec. 5.5.4.t) clinical stage II by Chest X-ray (CXR).

          3. Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &gt;45% and Diffusing Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO)
             &gt;50% of predicted values.

          4. Evidence of active sarcoidosis (see criteria above)

          5. Able and willing to complete all study procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy, post-drug
             surveillance)

          6. Age: 18+ years old (prevalence greatest in young adults; pediatric maraviroc safety
             not established).

          7. Not on immunosuppression for sarcoidosis at the time of recruitment, (e.g., steroids,
             tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) blockade)

          8. Liver function (transaminases, bilirubin), coagulation (International Normalized Ratio
             (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelet count), blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
             creatinine, and white blood count (WBC) within normal limits.

Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage: Bronchoscopy employs a flexible instrument that is inserted into the trachea and proximal airways after topical anesthesia. Bronchoalveolar lavage involves the instillation of saline solution through the bronchoscope into the airways followed by recovery under suction to collects lung fluid containing cells and proteins.
venipunctures: Venipunctures will be performed at study entry, after two weeks, and at the end of the study to collect blood for research studies and safety laboratories.
Skin biopsy: For subjects with sarcoidosis skin lesions, an optional skin biopsy specimen may be collected for research studies.</description>
