  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate results of slanted recession of the lateral rectus
      muscle for intermittent exotropia with convergence weakness
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study included 31 patients who underwent slanted lateral rectus muscle
      recession for intermittent exotropia with convergence weakness. Measurements of preoperative
      and postoperative deviation angle, stereopsis was performed.
