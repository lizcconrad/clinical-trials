  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, stratified, and randomized, open-label, placebo study in subjects with
      asthma to compare inhalers, ELLIPTA a new dry powder inhaler (DPI) and metered dose inhalers
      (MDI). This study is conducted to evaluate subject's preference of several inhaler-specific
      attributes individually between an existing MDI and the ELLIPTA a dry powder inhaler.
      Subjects who have not used the ELLIPTA inhaler in the past 6 months and their asthma must be
      controlled on their current therapy were enrolled. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria
      will be stratified according to their current inhaler use (stable for the past 3 months): 1.)
      Currently using a DPI as an inhaled asthma controller therapy OR 2.) Currently using an MDI
      as an inhaled asthma controller therapy (No fluticasone MDI use in the last 3 months) OR 3.)
      Currently using no inhaled asthma controller therapy (this includes patients using a LTM
      and/or SABA only). Once stratified, eligible subjects were randomized (1:1) to one of two
      sequences for using the inhaler: ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in Period 1 followed by MDI twice
      daily in Period 2 or MDI twice daily in Period 1 followed by ELLIPTA inhaler once daily in
      Period 2 for for 5-9 days each. In addition, subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1
      allocation) to receive one of two sets of questions: Version 1 presents response options in
      the order of ELLIPTA inhaler, MDI, No preference; Version 2 presents response options in the
      order of MDI, ELLIPTA inhaler, No preference. At the end of the second trial period, subjects
      answered questions which assessed their preference of inhaler attributes. ELLIPTA is a
      registered trademark of the GSK group of companies.
