    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate how treatment with Kinetic Oscillation Stimulation
      (KOS) in the nasal cavity in patients with non-allergic rhinitis can be optimized to minimize
      any patient reported discomfort during treatment procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with persistent (&gt;12w) symptoms of idiopathic rhinitis dominated by nasal
             congestion (± secretion) for an average of at least 1 h per day for at least 5 days
             during a period of 14 days

          -  Having nasal congestion as major symptom, and a nasal congestion score of at least 2
