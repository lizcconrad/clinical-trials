    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can provide
      comparable local control, with similar or improved toxicity rates compared to Radio Frequency
      Ablation (RFA) when treating small renal cell carcinomas.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to changes in scanning procedure, and infeasible biopsy and baseline imaging, the trial
    closed for poor accrual and inability to follow patients.

    <description>All patients will be followed to assess the development of treatment related pain, and resultant usage of analgesics (drug classification and dosage) for treatment related pain. Incidence and severity of pain will be recorded for all patients, using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), as will any resultant use of analgesics, and these will be compared between the two arms and analyzed in the non-randomized SBRT cohort.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for SBRT vs. RFA Randomization:

          -  Patients with renal cell carcinoma less than 4 cm in maximum diameter, who are poor
             surgical candidates are eligible for randomization between SBRT and RFA (Renal cell
             carcinoma must be pathologically proven).

          -  The primary tumor must be in a location amendable to RFA within the kidney.

          -  Patients must be appropriate candidates for RFA, with platelets ≥50,000/mm3 and an
             international normalized ratio of 1.5.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG (a measurement of general well being and activities of
             daily living; scores range from 0 to 5 where 0 represents perfect health) score ≤ 3.

          -  There is no required minimum renal function (patients will be counseled about the
             possible need for dialysis, if applicable, just as would be the case for radical or
             partial nephrectomy).

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent form approved for this purpose by the
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan Medical Center
             indicating that they are aware of the investigational aspects of the treatment and the
             potential risks.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  If a patient is randomized to the RFA arm, but is deemed not to be an anesthesia
             candidate, he/she will be placed in the non-randomized SBRT cohort.

        Inclusion Criteria for non-randomized SBRT arm:

          -  Patients with renal cell carcinoma less than 8 cm in maximum diameter, patients with
             metastatic RCC who require local palliation or are progressing through systemic
             disease, patients who are poor surgical candidates and have tumor location not
             amenable to RFA, or patients who would prefer a noninvasive means of treatment are
             eligible for the non-randomized SBRT cohort (Renal cell carcinoma must be
             pathologically proven).

          -  There are no limitations based on location of the primary tumor within the kidney.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG score ≤ 3.

          -  There is no required minimum renal function (patients will be counseled about the
             possible need for dialysis, if applicable, just as would be the case for radical or
             partial nephrectomy).

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent form approved for this purpose by the
             Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan Medical Center
             indicating that they are aware of the investigational aspects of the treatment and the
             potential risks.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients younger than 18 or pregnant women.
