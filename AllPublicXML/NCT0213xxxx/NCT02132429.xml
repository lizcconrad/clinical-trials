  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral
      doses of AMG 333 for 14 days in healthy subjects and migraine subjects. As part of the
      secondary objectives, the study will characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of AMG 333
      after multiple oral doses in healthy subjects and migraine subjects, as well as characterize
      the effect of multiple doses of AMG 333 on increases in blood pressure (BP) induced by the
      cold pressor test (CPT) in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending multiple-dose study
      evaluating AMG 333 in healthy subjects and subjects with migraines. Eight healthy subjects
      will be enrolled in each of cohorts 1 through 5. Study subjects will be randomized such that
      6 subjects will receive AMG 333 and 2 subjects will receive placebo (3:1 ratio) per cohort.
      Likewise, 8 migraine subjects will be enrolled in cohort 6 and randomized to receive AMG 333
      or placebo (3:1 ratio). All subjects will be housed for 15 days then allowed to return home.
      Migraine subjects will self-administer the headache diary at least once daily during the
      screening and out-patient portions of the study, and site personnel will administer the
      headache diary during the in-house period of the study. Healthy subjects will not keep the
      headache diary during screening and will have the headache diary administered by site
      personnel at least once daily starting on day 1 through day 14, and will then self administer
      throughout their participation in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects (cohorts 1 through 5) and male and female subjects
             with migraines (cohort 6), who are ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age at the time of
             screening, and have no history or evidence of clinically-relevant medical disorders as
             determined by the investigator in consultation with the Amgen physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder, condition, or disease that
             in the opinion of the investigator and Amgen physician, would significantly impair
             pain perception (eg, history of stroke, history of neuropathy), would pose a risk to
             subject safety or interfere with evaluation, procedures, or study completion.
