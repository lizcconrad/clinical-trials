  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contingency management (CM) treatments are highly efficacious in improving outcomes of
      substance abusing patients. However, CM has rarely been applied to individuals with alcohol
      use disorders, primarily because of technological limitations in monitoring drinking. The
      Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitor (SCRAMxÂ®) is a new technology designed to
      continuously monitor alcohol consumption 24 hours a day for 7 days per week. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CM in reducing alcohol use using SCRAMx. In total,
      120 alcohol abusing or dependent patients initiating outpatient treatment at community-based
      clinics will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: standard care, or standard care
      plus CM with reinforcement based on results of SCRAMx readings. Compared with standard care,
      it is expected that CM will result in fewer drinking days and longer durations of continuous
      non-drinking days.
