      The effect of the balloon on weight loss is investigated by multiple studies. However, the
      effect of the sequential balloons is not studied yet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are aiming to study the effect of the sequential balloons in the patients who had weight
      loss with the first balloon and they need subsequent balloons to have more weight loss after
      their first balloons are removed after 6 months.
