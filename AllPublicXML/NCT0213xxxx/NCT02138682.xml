  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigator initiated trial is designed to measure the accuracy of diagnosis of
      Parkinson disease through the use of DaTscan. Currently, DaTscan is FDA approved to measure
      dopamine transporter densities in human tissue. This measurement can assist in distinguishing
      between Essential Tremor and Parkinsonian Syndromes (idiopathic Parkinson disease,
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Multi Systems Atrophy, etc). This study will compare both
      clinical diagnosis of symptoms and the results of the scan to the pathological diagnosis
      received at time of death. Patients will be registered in the Parkinson Research Institute's
      brain donation program, receive a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease, have their brain
      scanned using DaTscan, and donate their tissue for research and autopsy purposes. The
      hypothesis of the study is that DaTscan will diagnosis Idiopathic Parkinson Disease as
      accurately as a clinician.
