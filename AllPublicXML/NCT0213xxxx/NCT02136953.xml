  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe and debilitating anxiety disorder afflicting
      2% of the population. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is considered first line
      psychological treatment for OCD, but there are a large number of treatment non-responders,
      and the majority of responders have residual symptoms. Aerobic exercise has shown potential
      benefit for general mood and anxiety disorders, but has not been widely tested in OCD. This
      study will examine the additive benefits of a standard 12-week aerobic exercise program to a
      standard 12-week CBT protocol in the treatment of OCD. The study will test if Exercise+CBT
      results in significantly better clinical outcomes compared to either treatment alone or no
      treatment at all. Treatment outcomes will be assessed in relation to symptom and cognitive
      measures of clinical improvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if a standard, evidence-based 12-week aerobic exercise program
      results in significant reduction of obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and associated
      cognitive dysfunction as a stand-alone intervention and when combined with the first-line
      psychological treatment, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). There are 3 broad aims to this
      study: 1) to compare the relative efficacy of Exercise, CBT, and their combination (CBT+Ex)
      versus a non-treatment waitlist control (WL), 2) to examine the extent to which
      neuropsychological features of OCD improve following treatments, and 3) to determine the
      extent to which the BDNF gene and protein are a) associated with learning and cognitive
      factors, and b) moderate symptom and cognitive change across treatments.

      The study design allows for a novel, well-powered and potentially landmark study on the
      impact of exercise on obsessive-compulsive symptom severity and cognitive functioning in OCD,
      both as a stand-alone treatment and when augmenting CBT. If this study can demonstrate that a
      short aerobic exercise program of 12 weeks duration can confer significant clinical gains for
      those suffering with OCD, then it could easily be translated into highly accessible, routine
      clinical care. Further, demonstration of improvement in OCD-associated cognitive dysfunction,
      given the refractory nature of the illness, would provide another avenue into the long-term
      enhancement of outcomes for this chronically affected population.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OCD symptom severity will be measured using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS).The YBOCS is a standardized rating scale measuring 10 items pertaining to obsessions and compulsions on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (severe symptoms). Both the self-report and clinician interview versions of the YBOCS have been shown to possess high internal consistency and validity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in cognitive domains sensitive to OCD, as measured by a targeted neuropsychological battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We have included core paper-and-pencil and computerized tests, such as those from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), which tap separable cognitive domains that are sensitive to OCD. CANTAB measures are standardized and have been shown to discriminate amongst many neurological and psychiatric illnesses To avoid practice effects, measures were selected to have either alternate form or to be amenable to calculation of reliable change indices (RCIs). RCIs will be used to determine if neuropsychology performance scores change significantly over time.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in fitness level as measured by incremental maximal exercise test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo an incremental maximal exercise test on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Lode Corival) to establish level of fitness. Peak heart-rate, peak watts, total duration and ratings of perceived exertion are all recorded during the test. Peak heart-rate will also be used to tailor the aerobic Exercise treatment to the individual participant in order to maximize health benefit.</description>
