  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this First Time in Patient study is to obtain initial information on the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical efficacy of repeat daily
      administration of danirixin in subjects with symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) having mild to moderate airflow limitation and are at high risk for future
      COPD exacerbations.

      The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A will be a two week open label, single arm
      study in patients with COPD to obtain pharmacokinetic data and safety information of repeat
      dosing of danirixin in the population of interest. Approximately 10 subjects will be enrolled
      in Part A of the study. Progression to and dose selection for Part B will occur following
      review of the data collected in Part A. Part B will be a 52-week, randomized, double-blind
      (sponsor unblind), placebo-controlled on top of standard of care, parallel group study. Part
      B will evaluate several clinical efficacy assessments related to exacerbations and
      respiratory symptoms. Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled with a target of 80
      subjects completing 52 weeks of danirixin administration.

    <measure>Monthly Weighted Means of EXACT-RS Domain Scores in Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 392 in Part B</time_frame>
    <description>EXACT-RS is a tool which consists of 11 items from the 14 item EXACT-PRO instrument, intended to capture information related to the respiratory symptoms of COPD. EXACT-RS domains included breathlessness, cough and chest symptoms. The EXACT-RS has a scoring range of 0-40, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. A par. had at least 10 days of diary data in any month to contribute a non-missing weighted mean AUC of daily values; otherwise the weighted mean for that month were considered missing. A mixed effects model in a Bayesian framework with repeated measures were performed. The posterior mean and corresponding 95 percent credible interval were calculated. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline for COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at the Indicated Time Points in Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 392 in Part B</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is a validated, 8 item questionnaire which has been developed designed to measure overall COPD-related health status for the initial assessment and longitudinal follow up of par. with COPD. Participants completed each question by rating their experience on a 6 point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a total scoring range of 0 - 40. CAT was assessed at Baseline (Day 1), Day 28, Day 112, Day 168, Day 280 and Day 364 where Baseline was considered as score on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Readings in Part B</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 392 in Part B</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a single item clinician reported outcome measure assessing the overall severity of COPD. Physicians rated disease severity on a four point scale ranging from 1-4 (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe) at Week 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 40 and 52. Baseline was considered as score on Day 1. A categorical summary of PGA is presented by treatment and visit.Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Vital signs including SBP, DBP, pulse rate, respiratory rate and body temperature were taken on Day 1 pre-dose and on Day 14 and at Follow-up (Day 21 to 28) in Part A. Measurements were obtained in a semi-supine/ supine position after 5 minutes rest. The mean of replicate assessments at any given time point was used as the value for that time point. SBP &lt;90 or &gt;160 millimeter of mercury (mmHg); DBP &lt;40 or &gt;110 mmHg, pulse rate &lt;35 or &gt;120 beats per minute (bpm) and respiratory rate &lt;8 or &gt;30 breaths per minute were considered as values of potential clinical importance and were presented as 'High' or 'Low' values.

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening and Day 14 in Part A to evaluate clinical chemistry parameters which included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, calcium, bicarbonate, chloride, creatinine, direct bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), glucose, potassium, total protein, sodium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid. Additional liver monitoring chemistry (ALT, AST, ALP and total and direct bilirubin) was done on Day 1 pre-dose. Clinical chemistry values of potential clinical importance were presented as 'High' or 'Low' values based on the reference laboratory standards.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at the Indicated Time Points in Part A</title>
        <description>FEV1 measures how much air a person can exhale during a forced breath in 1 second. FVC is the total amount of air exhaled during the FEV test. FEV1 and FVC were performed at Screening and on Day 1, 14 and at Follow-up visit (Day 21 to 28). FEV1 and FVC assessments at each time point (post-bronchodilator) were taken in triplicate. The maximum of the triplicate assessments were used. Baseline was considered as the measurement obtained at Day 1 pre-dose. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FEV1 and FVC at the Indicated Time Points in Part B</title>
        <description>FEV1 and FVC were performed at Screening and on Day 1, 28, 56, 112, 168, 280, 364 and at Follow-up (Day 378 to 392) in Part B. FEV1 and FVC assessments at each time point (post-bronchodilator) were taken in triplicate. The maximum of the triplicate assessments were used. Baseline was considered as the measurement obtained at Day 1 pre-dose. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated measures mixed effects model in a Bayesian framework. The estimate of the treatment difference and corresponding 95 percent credible interval was constructed for the difference between danirixin and placebo for each visit. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>HCRU COPD exacerbations are defined as moderate or severe exacerbations based on requirement of new prescription antibiotics or oral corticosteroids, hospitalization or emergency room visits for management of COPD exacerbation. For par. with less than 364 days on-treatment, the annual exacerbation rate was imputed as the number of recorded on-treatment exacerbations, divided by the number of 4-week treatment period intervals for which the par. was in the study, multiplied by 13. For par. with 364 or more days on-treatment, the annual exacerbation rate was calculated as the number of recorded exacerbations between study days 1 and 364. Statistical analysis was done using a Bayesian Cox model, assuming a negative binomial distribution for the underlying exacerbation rate. The exacerbation rates along with the ratio (danirixin/placebo), were estimated and corresponding 95 percent credible intervals were produced using non-informative priors. 1 par. was excluded from the analysis.</description>

The EXACT-RS has a scoring range of 0-40, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. A par. had at least 10 days of diary data in any month to contribute a non-missing weighted mean AUC of daily values; otherwise the weighted mean for that month were considered missing. A mixed effects model in a Bayesian framework with repeated measures were performed on the EXACT-RS monthly weighted mean AUC data. The posterior mean and corresponding 95 percent credible interval were calculated.

        <title>Number of EXACT-PRO Exacerbations Per Year in Part B</title>
        <description>EXACT-PRO is a 14 item patient reported outcome instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency, severity, and duration of COPD exacerbations. The total score for EXACT-PRO ranges from 0-100, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. For par. with less than 364 days on-treatment, the annual exacerbation rate was imputed as the number of recorded on-treatment exacerbations, divided by the number of 4-week treatment period intervals for which the par. was in the study, multiplied by 13. For par. with 364 or more days on-treatment, the annual exacerbation rate was calculated as the number of recorded exacerbations between study days 1 and 364. Statistical analysis was done using a Bayesian Cox model, assuming a negative binomial distribution for the underlying exacerbation rate. The exacerbation rates and the ratio (danirixin/placebo), were estimated and 95 percent credible intervals were produced using non-informative priors. 1 par. was excluded from analysis.</description>

        <title>Monthly Weighted Means of Exacerbations of EXACT-PRO Total Score in Part B</title>
        <description>EXACT-PRO is a 14 item patient reported outcome instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency, severity, and duration of COPD exacerbations. The total score for EXACT-PRO ranges from 0-100, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. A par. had at least 10 days of diary data in any month to contribute a non-missing weighted mean AUC of daily values; otherwise the weighted mean for that month were considered missing. A mixed effects model in a Bayesian framework with repeated measures were performed on the EXACT-PRO monthly weighted mean AUC data. The posterior mean and corresponding 95 percent credible interval were calculated. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Time to First HCRU COPD Exacerbation in Part B</title>
        <description>HCRU COPD exacerbations are defined as moderate or severe exacerbations based on requirement of new prescription antibiotics or oral corticosteroids, hospitalization or emergency room visits for management of COPD exacerbation. The time to the first on-treatment HRCU exacerbation were summarized by treatment group. It was analyzed using a Bayesian Cox proportional hazards model. The hazard ratio for the danirixin vs. placebo comparison, along with 95 percent credible interval, was derived, with terms for treatment group, smoking status and country. Posterior probabilities of the ratio of the percentage of par. with an HCRU exacerbation, adjusted for time to first exacerbation, in the danirixin group relative to the placebo group were calculated. 1 par. was excluded from analysis.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Duration of EXACT-PRO Events in Part B</title>
        <description>Duration is the length of time in days from onset to recovery. It was calculated as the difference in days between day of onset and day of recovery. Onset of event was identified as either an increase in EXACT-PRO score of &gt;=12 points above the par. current mean Baseline for 2 consecutive days, with Day 1 of the 2 days serving as Day 1 onset of the event, or an increase of &gt;=9 points above the par. current mean Baseline for 3 consecutive days, with Day 1 of the 3 days serving as Day 1 onset of the event. Duration was 3-day rolling average was used, which was initiated on Day 1 of onset and ended on Day 1 of Recovery. Recovery was defined as the first day in which par. experienced a persistent, sustained improvement in their condition i.e. decrease in the rolling average EXACT-PRO total score &gt;=9 point from the maximum observed value (highest rolling average EXACT-PRO total score observed the first 14 days of the event) during the first 14 days of an event that is sustained for 7 days.</description>

        <description>EXACT-RS is a tool which consists of 11 items from the 14 item EXACT-PRO instrument, intended to capture information related to the respiratory symptoms of COPD. EXACT-RS domains included breathlessness, cough and chest symptoms. The EXACT-RS has a scoring range of 0-40, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. A par. had at least 10 days of diary data in any month to contribute a non-missing weighted mean AUC of daily values; otherwise the weighted mean for that month were considered missing. A mixed effects model in a Bayesian framework with repeated measures were performed. The posterior mean and corresponding 95 percent credible interval were calculated. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline for COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at the Indicated Time Points in Part B</title>
        <description>The CAT is a validated, 8 item questionnaire which has been developed designed to measure overall COPD-related health status for the initial assessment and longitudinal follow up of par. with COPD. Participants completed each question by rating their experience on a 6 point scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a total scoring range of 0 - 40. CAT was assessed at Baseline (Day 1), Day 28, Day 112, Day 168, Day 280 and Day 364 where Baseline was considered as score on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Patient Global Rating of Severity (PGRS) Score in Part B</title>
        <description>PGRS is a single global question and was asked to participants to rate their COPD severity on a four point scale ranging from 1-4 (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe). Participants completed PGRS at Week 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 40 and 52. Baseline was considered as score on Day 1. A categorical summary of PGRS is presented by treatment and visit.Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>
