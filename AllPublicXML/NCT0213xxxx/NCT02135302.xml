  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label clinical study to assess the single-dose PK of
      eravacycline in subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects conducted at
      approximately 3 sites in the United States. This study includes an up to 21-day Screening
      Period, a 5-day Treatment Period, and an End of Study Visit occurring approximately 2 weeks
      (± 2 days) after initiation of study drug administration. Approximately 24 subjects will be
      enrolled: 18 subjects with impaired hepatic function (6 subjects who meet the criteria for
      each of the 3 Child-Pugh categories of mild [5 - 6 points], moderate [7 - 9 points], and
      severe [10 - 15 points]) and 6 healthy subjects without hepatic impairment. Healthy subjects
      will be matched to hepatically impaired subjects in gender, age, and body mass index (BMI).
      All subjects will be administered a single IV dose of eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg).

    <description>Eravacycline (TP-434) is a parenteral and oral antibiotic of the tetracycline class that is highly active in vitro and in established animal infection models against both nosocomial and community-acquired methicillin-susceptible or -resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible or -resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, eravacycline is highly active against clinically important species of Enterobacteriaceae (including those isolates that produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases and/or are carbapenem-resistant), Acinetobacter baumannii, and anaerobes.</description>

             diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (eg, liver firmness to palpation, splenic enlargement,
             spider angiomata, palmar erythema, parotid hypertrophy, testicular atrophy,
             gynecomastia);

         10. Subjects with hepatic impairment must be categorized in 1 of the following:
