    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the body's response to a life-threatening infection. This study will determine if
      zinc supplementation is safe to use in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. This
      study will also gather preliminary information to evaluate the impact that zinc has on the
      immune system (the body's defense system against infection) and whether zinc can help
      monocytes and macrophages (specific types of cells that remove infections from the body) work
      more effectively.

      Previous research has shown that zinc supplementation reduces the length and severity of some
      types of medical infections (examples include the cold virus and diarrhea). Because zinc has
      been shown to improve the immune system's function, some doctors provide mineral supplements
      such as zinc to their patients in the Intensive Care Unit. However, there are no studies to
      show how effective zinc is or that have evaluated what dose(s) of zinc are safe in patients
      with severe sepsis/septic shock. Nor have studies examined if tolerable doses for septic
      patients can improve how the immune system functions.

      If zinc is shown to improve how the immune system functions during sepsis, it could be used
      in the future as part of the treatment regimen for patients with sepsis.

    <description>This study consists of receiving a dose of zinc once daily while in the ICU for up to 7 days, up to four timed blood draws over the first 10 days of your hospitalization (if you remain in the hospital that long), and collecting some immune cells from your blood +/- lungs. We will review your medical chart at the time of the blood draws and again when you are getting ready for discharge.</description>
