  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No prospective randomized trials have evaluated the most efficacious dose of cyclophosphamide
      to mobilize autologous stem cells. We previously demonstrated that the time to collection of
      autologous hematopoietic stem cells is 10-12 days following the one dose of cyclophosphamide
      and daily G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor).9 This prospective randomized trial
      is designed to determine if a lower dose of cyclophosphamide (1.5 gm/m2) will be as
      efficacious as the intermediate dose (3 gm/m2), based on cell number collected, number of
      apheresis required and resource utilization.

    <description>Patients will receive intravenous mesna 15 minutes prior to cyclophosphamide and again at 4 and 8 hours afterwards. Each infusion will be given over 15 minutes. Oral mesna can be substituted for the two post-cyclophosphamide doses. Oral mesna will be administered at 2 and 6 hours after the start of cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide will be administered intravenously over one hour at the dose of 3 gms/m(2).</description>

    <description>Mechanism of action: Cyclophosphamide is a pro drug that requires activation. Following hepatic and cellular activation, phosphoramide mustard and acrolein are formed. Phosphoramide mustard is the alkylating agent that demonstrates cytotoxic effects. Acrolein binds to proteins but does not contribute to the anti-tumor effects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a pathologic diagnosis of one of the following malignancies:

        Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, including B- and T-cell lymphoma Multiple Myeloma or another plasma
        cell dyscrasia (Waldenstrom, Amyloidosis)

          -  The patient must be approved for transplant by the treating Transplant physician.

          -  This must be the patient's FIRST mobilization attempt.

          -  Patients are eligible if an autologous transplant is planned within approximately 12
             months from the time of collection of cells.

          -  Prior Treatment: No previous cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to initiation
             of therapy. (This does not include immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), proteasome
             inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies or steroids.)

          -  No radiation within 4 weeks of mobilization attempt.

          -  Age &gt;18, and &lt; 75 years

          -  Informed consent must be signed prior to the treatment. Patients must willingly
             consent after being informed of the procedure to be followed, the nature of the
             therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks and discomforts. (Human
