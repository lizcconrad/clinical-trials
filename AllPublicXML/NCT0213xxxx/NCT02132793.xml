  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate objective of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of Remote
      Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management (RELAX). The application is a remote,
      technology- enabled, anger treatment and management system based on current evidence-based
      CBT interventions. The project's objective was to show that RELAX (1) enables the practice of
      anger management strategies remotely through mobile phone interfaces; (2) integrates with
      evidence-based treatments through the implementation of an existing CBT anger management
      course; (3) provides information, direction, and feedback through physiological sensors and
      signal analysis; and (4) supports communication and direction by the therapist through a
      web-based therapist interface.

      This project conducted a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) anger management treatment groups
      with a Veteran population using the RELAX application, collected weekly feedback from
      participants, and collaborate with the Sponsor to document initial efficacy, feasibility, and
      safety of the RELAX system. Outcome domains included: 1) clinical outcomes (symptom severity,
      social functioning); 2) process outcomes (perception of treatment, satisfaction, group
      therapy alliance, treatment compliance, and attrition and treatment credibility); and (3)
      Technical feasibility of the RELAX application. Study clinicians were 1) trained to conduct
      baseline and follow-up assessments 2) trained to conduct the standardized Anger Management
      Therapy (AMT) protocol at acceptable levels of adherence and competence and 3) trained how to
      use the technology and how to respond to technical difficulties. Study clinicians tested the
      feasibility of the RELAX application and showed that it can be integrated with CBT anger
      management therapies and support therapist communication through the technology.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dimensions of Anger Reactions (DAR-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The DAR-5 is a reliable and valid screening measure of common anger reactions. Its brevity is useful for rapidly assessing the presence of anger problems in different populations. The strength of the DAR-5 is that it employs a minimum number of items to measure the anger construct. Item content pertains to anger frequency, intensity, duration, interpersonal aggressiveness, and the extent to which anger interferes with interpersonal relationships.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post treatment and 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The STAXI-2 is a revised and expanded version of the original STAXI. The measure consists of items assessing the intensity of anger as an emotional state (State Anger) and the tendency of an individual to experience state anger, or anger proneness (Trait Anger). The Trait Anger scale measures individual differences in the disposition to experience anger. The Anger Expression scale provides an index of the frequency of anger expression. The STAXI has demonstrated strong reliability and validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post treatment and 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL will be used as an additional measure of PTSD symptoms. The PCL has been found to be a reliable and valid self-report measure of PTSD. Respondents indicate the degree to which they have been bothered by each of the 17 PTSD symptoms during the past month on a 5-point Likert scale, and item scores are summed.</description>
