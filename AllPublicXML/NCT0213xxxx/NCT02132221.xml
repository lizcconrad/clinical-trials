  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to better understand how to help patients who are not receiving
      enough relief from opioid prescription medications for chronic non-cancer pain. Opioids are a
      group of medications that includes morphine, oxycodone-, hydrocodone-, etc. These medications
      are also called narcotics. Research has shown that patients not benefiting from their opioid
      prescription medication often feel better when they stop taking it. However, stopping or
      reducing pain medications can be a difficult transition. Although they do not have much
      benefit from their medication, many patients are afraid to stop because they feel these
      medications are the only things giving them a bit of relief. Different strategies can be used
      to help patients through the period of tapering and it is not clear which one is best. The
      investigators will test a specific approach used during regular care in the clinic: cognitive
      therapy.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Female, age above 18.

          -  Chronic non-cancer pain (pain for 6 or more months, current pain not attributed to a
             cancerous disease).

          -  Referrals to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Center for Pain Medicine for
             opioid taper.

          -  Chronic (more than 3 months) prescription of morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone,
             hydromorphone, codeine or any formulation of these medications.

          -  Morphine dose equivalent of 60 mg or above.

          -  Opioid treatment has to be stable (plus or minus20%) over the last 3 months.

          -  Meeting Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) criteria
             for exit from chronic opioid therapy

          -  Willingness to taper and participate in treatment as randomized (including cognitive
             workshop sessions), able to meet the protocol follow-up schedule and activities

          -  Agreement to undergo random urine toxicology assays, which will be recommended to
             prescribing physician during study.

          -  Agreement to sign an opioid contract, as recommended to prescribing physician.

          -  Informed consent to study (IRB approved informed Consent form).

          -  English Language Literacy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Methadone, suboxone or fentanyl patch: the tapering with these opioids would not be
             comparable to the other patients. As enrolment will be open during about 12 months, if
             a patient was motivated to participate in the study, they could be referred to the
             pain clinic for advice on a switch to a medication that could allow inclusion. They
             would, 3 months after this switch, become eligible for the study.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  History of epilepsy and drug-induced seizures.

          -  Proof of current diversion of drugs or recent substance related legal problems (e.g.
             buying/selling on the streets).

          -  Concurrent use of illicit drugs and narcotics (urine toxicology), active diagnosis of
             substance abuse or dependence disorder within last 3 months.

          -  Absence of the prescribed drug in the urine toxicology

          -  Refusal of taper or dose reduction trial.

          -  Preference for suboxone or related treatments.

          -  Severe psychiatric condition and/or cognitive deficits limiting patient's ability to
             participate

          -  Involved in concurrent opioid management for an acute pain condition.

          -  Current suicidal ideation.

          -  Severe and unstable medical illness including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal,
             respiratory, endocrine, neurological or hematological disease.

          -  General conditions that would impede participation in a group intervention, as
             assessed by evaluating physician (e.g. cognitive impairment, tendencies towards
             physical aggression).
