      This is a Phase 3 multicentre, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study to
      determine the effectiveness of the rotavirus vaccine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that a three dose series of BRV-PV administered orally to healthy Indian
      infants, with the initial dose given at 6-8 weeks of age and followed by vaccinations at
      monthly intervals, will significantly reduce the incidence of severe rotavirus
      gastroenteritis (SRVGE). Duration of follow-up is until aged 2 years of each enrolled child.
      The study is powered to detect vaccine efficacy significantly greater than 10% (95%
      confidence interval lower bound &gt; 10%) if the true vaccine efficacy is 50% or higher.
