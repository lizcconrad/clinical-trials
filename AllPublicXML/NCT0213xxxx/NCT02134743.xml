  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the stability of dental implant surface treated by
      sandblasting abrasive particles and acid subtraction (Control) with hydrophilic surfaces
      dental implants (chemical) and with a higher surface energy (Test) for a period of 16 weeks
      after installation. The evaluation will be made by analyzing the resonance frequency
      (Ostell). The hypothesis to be tested will be that implants with hydrophilic surface show
      increased secondary stability prior to the implants treated by acid etching.

      The selected patients will be randomly divided into two groups by computer-generated list.
      The control group will receive implant surface treated by acid etching and test group receive
      implants with hydrophilic surface (Test). Both the test and the control group will undergo
      the same pre-surgical, surgical and post-surgical protocols.

      The evaluation of the implant will be done by the analysis of resonant frequency wich will be
      performed on each implant with Osstell (Integration Diagnostics AB, Goteborg, Sweden)
      immediately after implant placement (baseline) and at follow-up sessions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th,
      8th, 12th and 16th weeks after installation) and coefficient of implant stability (ISQ) on
      these dates will be measured on a scale from 0 to 100. The smartpeg be used with special
      developed Healing without the use of pillars or intermediaries.
