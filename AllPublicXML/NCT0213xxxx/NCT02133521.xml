    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and controlled clinical study to investigate
      the effects of DLBS1033 in conjunction with standard therapy compared to standard therapy
      alone in acute ischemic stroke patients. It is hypothesized that the improvement in
      functional outcomes as measured by NIHSS and BI as well as the improvement in haemostatic
      parameters as measured by thrombocyte aggregation test (TAT), fibrinogen, and d-dimer in DLBS
      group will be significantly greater than those in the control group.

      Subjects in this study will be screened consecutively and eligible subjects will be
      randomized into two groups and receive the investigational drug, DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg
      three times daily or its placebo in addition to standard therapy for 28-days course of
      therapy. Standard therapy used in this study will consist of: aspirin 80 mg, simvastatin 20
      mg, and vitamin B complex.

      After hospital admission and diagnosis, patient will be handled as per acute ischemic stroke
      management in each study site. Right after the patient is confirmed eligible to the study,
      the treatment(s) will be switched immediately into the study treatments. Clinical and
      laboratory examinations to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy will be performed at
      baseline and 3, 7,14, and 28 days after study medication initiation; while safety
      examinations will be performed at the same time point, but 3 and 14 days after study
      medication initiation.
