    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and activity of gemcitabine plus
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab in patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2 (HER2)+ breast cancer who have progressed on at least one prior line of chemotherapy plus
      HER2 targeted agent such as T-DM1, trastuzumab, or lapatinib.

    <measure>Phase I: Recommended Phase II Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon Determination of Phase II Dose - Approximately 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Establishing the recommended phase II dose for the combination of gemcitabine+trastuzumab+pertuzumab with safety data described using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 terminology. Any patient who receives any dose of the study treatment will be evaluated for the safety/toxicity endpoints in the trial.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response Rate: Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) using Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for the combination of gemcitabine+trastuzumab+pertuzumab at the recommended phase II dose. Any patient who receives any dose of the study treatment will be evaluated for the safety/toxicity endpoints in the trial. To be considered evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint (ORR) the patient must undergo two treatment cycles followed by a response scan. CR: Disappearance of all evidence of tumor for at least two cycles of therapy. Tumor markers must be normal. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking a reference the baseline sum longest diameter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II: Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Median progression free survival (in months) for all patients evaluable for response. The time-to-event data will be summarized using Kaplan-Meir curve method for all patients who are evaluable for the ORR endpoint. Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the beginning of treatment or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <description>The Phase I trial will start at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for gemcitabine but will have a de-escalation dose levels in the event that an unacceptable toxicity requires dose reduction. Dose level 0 = gemcitabine (1200mg/m2) IV D1,8 q21 days; Dose level -1 = gemcitabine (1000 mg/m^2) IV D1,8 q21 days; Dose level -2 = gemcitabine (850 mg/m^2) IV D1,8 q21 days. The RP2D will be the dose level where 0-1 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in six patients occur.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult males or females (aged 18 or older) with histologically confirmed, metastatic
             human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ (by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or
             fluorescence in situ hydridization (FISH) ratio ≥ 2.0) breast cancer

          -  Have progressed on at least one prior line of chemotherapy plus HER2 directed therapy
             such as trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab in the metastatic setting. T-DM1 would count as
             a line of therapy and patients previously treated with T-DM1 are eligible.

          -  Have not been treated with gemcitabine in the metastatic setting
