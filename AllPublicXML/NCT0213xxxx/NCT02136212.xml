  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a computerized approach/avoidance
      training (AAT) procedure in a sample of individuals diagnosed with social anxiety disorder
      (SAD). The training procedure is designed to modify automatic approach responses for positive
      social stimuli. Previous research has shown that a single administration of approach-positive
      AAT influences social behavior in the laboratory. The goal of this study is to examine the
      effects of a four-session AAT procedure on measures of positive social-emotional functioning.
      The investigators hypothesize that individuals assigned to the approach-positive AAT
      condition will demonstrate larger increases in positive affect and improvements in social
      relationship functioning from pre- to post-assessment compared to those assigned to the
      control condition.
