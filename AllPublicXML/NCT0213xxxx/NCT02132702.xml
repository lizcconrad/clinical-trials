  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the performance attributes and user progression of participants
      with motor complete and incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) while utilizing the Ekso robotic
      exoskeleton in an eight week over ground, locomotor program. We hypothesize an improvement in
      progression and overall health while using Ekso.
