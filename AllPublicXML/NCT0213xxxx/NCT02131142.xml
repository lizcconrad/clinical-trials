      The purpose of this study is to collect additional safety and effectiveness data for on the
      Biosensors BioFreedom™ BA9 Drug Coated Coronary Stent in patients with native, de novo
      coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective trial of 100 patients at up to 15 centers. The study
      population will consist of patients preventing with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to
      de novo stenotic lesion(s) in native coronary artery(ies) with reference vessel diameter
      between 2.25 mm and 4.0 mm.

      The primary safety endpoint for this clinical trial is the occurrence of major adverse
      cardiac events (MACE) defined as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction,
      target lesion revascularization and academic research consortium (ARC) definite stent
      thrombosis within 9 months following the implantation.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint for this trial is in-stent late lumen loss at 9 months as
      compared to historical control

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individual is ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Individual must have clinical evidence if ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable
             angina, silent ischemia, or a positive functional study;

          -  Individual must be an acceptable candidate for percutaneous coronary intervention
             (PCI), stenting, and emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery

          -  Individual is competent and willing to provide informed consent to participate in the
             trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel, or a
             sensitivity to contrast media that cannot be adequately pre-medicated;

          -  History or known allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to drugs similar to BA9;

          -  A platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3, or a WBC &lt; 3,000
             cells/mm3;

          -  A creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dL;

          -  Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction with 72 hours of the intended stenting
             (defined as: Q wave or non-Q wave myocardial infarction having a Troponin either I or
             T pre-procedure elevated above the Institution's upper limit of normal);

          -  Previous or planned PCI of any vessel within 30 days pre or post procedure;

          -  Patient unable to take clopidogrel for 3 months or patient who have comorbidities that
             would prohibit the cessation of clopidogrel at 3 months;

          -  Planned adjunctive treatment during the intended stenting (eg balloon valvuloplasty,
             percutaneous endovascular intervention, etc)

          -  During the intended or index procedure the target lesion(s) requires treatment with a
             device other than a plain old balloon prior to stent placement (such as, but not
             limited to, cutting balloon, directional atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational
             atherectomy, thrombectomy, etc);

          -  History of documented prior stroke within 6 months of the intended procedure;

          -  Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal bleeding documented within the prior 6
             months;

          -  Individual is pregnant, nursing or planning to be pregnant;

          -  Any previous or planned treatment of the target vessel(s) with anti-restenotic

          -  Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months or
             individual has any serious medical condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, may adversely affect the safety and/or effectiveness of the participant
             or the study;

          -  Individual is currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial. If,
             however, if investigational trial device or drug becomes commercially available, these
             trials are not considered investigational;

          -  Previous ACS within 9 months of pre or post procedure
