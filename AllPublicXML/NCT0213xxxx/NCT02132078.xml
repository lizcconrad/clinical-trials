  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess incidence, treatment modalities and outcome of
      complicated and uncomplicated diverticulitis in highly immunosuppressed lung transplant
      recipients (LTRs) in order to establish improved treatment strategies in this high risk
      patient collective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sigmoid diverticulitis is common and potentially problematic in immunosuppressed patients.
      The choice between conservative and surgical treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis
      remains unclear, as well as the value of the Hartmann's procedure (HP) for complicated
      diverticulitis.

      Our aim is to assess incidence, treatment options and outcome of complicated and
      uncomplicated diverticulitis in highly immunosuppressed lung transplant recipients (LTRs) by
      retrospectively analysing our prospective database of around 400 lung transplant recipients
      transplanted between 1992 and 2013.
