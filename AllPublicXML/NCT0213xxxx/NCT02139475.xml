      The aim of this study is to clarify the factors influencing quality of bowel cleansing for
      colonoscopy in patients with colorectal cancer surgery and confirm the adequate bowel
      cleaning method for patients with colorectal cancer surgery. Through this, ultimately in
      patients with a history of colorectal cancer who have high risk of colorectal cancer, it
      could be possible to detect cancerous lesions early and increase the survival rate.

      This study is based on observational study Subjects are the patients with colorectal cancer
      surgery who visits the out patients clinic for follow-up colonoscopy The patient's medical
      records on the basis of information collected at the point of the colonoscopy performed
      Quality of bowel cleansing is calculated with the Boston bowel preparation scale Patient
      compliance and satisfaction are measured.

    <description>In this scale, the colon is divided in three segments: the right side (including cecum and ascending colon), the transverse colon (including the flexures) and the left sided colon, which includes the descending colon, sigmoid and rectum. Mucosal view should be scored after cleansing maneuvers like suctioning or washing have been performed. For all three sections cleansing is assessed and given a score ranging from 0 to 3. Therefore, the maximum BBPS score for a perfectly clean colon without any residual liquid is 9 and the minimum BBPS score for an unprepared colon is 0. BBPS score ≥6 in considered an adequate bowel preparation.</description>
