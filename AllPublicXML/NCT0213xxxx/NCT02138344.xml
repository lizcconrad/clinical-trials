    <textblock>
      Development of neuropathic pain is one of the most disabling sequels after spinal cord injury
      (SCI) and in peripheral nerve diseases. The functionality of the pain pathway in humans as
      well as its plastic changes following SCI can be assessed in vivo by surface
      electrophysiological recordings and functional magnetic resonance imaging after noxious heat
      stimulation of the skin. Aims: a) establishing a clinically applicable assessment of the pain
      pathway and characterizing its changes as a consequence of SCI and in peripheral nerve
      diseases in an objective manner, b) characterizing plastic changes in the pain pathway in SCI
      patients with neuropathic pain and in patients with peripheral nerve diseases and relating
      them to the development of neuropathic pain syndromes.
