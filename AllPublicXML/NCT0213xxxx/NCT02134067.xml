  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of TAS-119 and determine the most
      appropriate dose in combination with Paclitaxel for subsequent studies in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      TAS-119 is a novel, selective Aurora A kinase inhibitor, which has previously been
      demonstrated to enhance the activity of paclitaxel in preclinical studies
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale for study:

      In nonclinical pharmacology studies TAS-119 significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of
      the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel and TAS-119 is being developed for use in combination
      with paclitaxel.

      TAS-119 selectively inhibits the kinase inhibitor Aurora A. AurA regulates cell division by
      controlling the transition from G2 to M phase. Overexpression of AurA is associated with
      resistance to taxanes.

      The study will be conducted in two sequential phases:

      Dose Escalation Phase with the purpose to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the
      recommended Phase 2 dose of TAS-119 given in combination with paclitaxel

      An Expansion Phase in which additional patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the
      safety and preliminary efficacy of the recommended Phase 2 dose of TAS-119 in combination
      with paclitaxel, during which a subgroup of patients will be evaluated for DDI between
      paclitaxel and TAS-119 via PK assessment.
