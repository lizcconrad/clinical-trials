  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global medical problem with significant shortcomings in
      current therapy. Chief among these is the delay between initiation of pharmacologic therapy
      and clinical improvement in symptoms. Recently ketamine, an NDMA-receptor antagonist has been
      shown to rapidly and effectively reverse the symptoms of MDD. Nitrous oxide, another
      NMDA-receptor antagonist, may produce the same effect with a cleaner side-effect profile and
      perhaps without the need for intravenous access and anesthesia personnel. Therefore, we
      propose conducting a pilot randomized placebo controlled double-blind crossover study in
      which patients will receive up to 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen or up to 50% oxygen in air for
      a period of one hour in addition to standard medical therapy. Depression severity will be
      assessed by a blinded observer pre-treatment, 30 minutes and 2 hours post treatment using the
      Hamilton depression rating scale.

      We will study 20 patients with non-treatment resistant major depression and 20 patients with
      treatment-resistant major depression, defined as failure of at least 2 antidepressants in the
      current depressive episode and 3 lifetime medication failures.
