      This study is a randomized, open-label, controlled study that will compare the efficacy of
      S-1 in combination with gemcitabine to gemcitabine alone as adjuvant treatment for patients
      with surgically resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed resected ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma with macroscopic
             complete resection (R0 and R1). Subjects with neuroendocrine (and mixed type) tumors
             are excluded.

          2. Pancreatic cancer surgical staging: T 1-3, N0-1, M0.

          3. Subject should be able to start treatment no later than 12 weeks postsurgery.

          4. ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF).

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 6. Acceptable
             hematology parameters:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500 cell/mm3

               -  Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥9 g/dL 7. Acceptable blood chemistry levels:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)
                  and Alanine transaminase (ALT)/ Serum glutamic -pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤2.5
                  × upper limit of normal range (ULN)

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) (subjects with Gilbert's syndrome
                  can have bilirubin of up to 1.5 x ULN)

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine within upper limits of normal or calculated clearance ≥50
                  mL/min/1.73 m2. If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be used
                  for calculating creatinine clearance (eg, using the Cockroft-Gault formula). For
                  subjects with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m2, lean body weight should be used
                  instead 8. Cancer antigen (CA)19-9 &lt;100 U/mL assessed within 14 days of
                  randomization 9. Acceptable coagulation studies as demonstrated by Prothrombin
                  Time (PT) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) within normal limits (±15%)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior neo-adjuvant treatment or radiation therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma

          2. Presence of or history of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma

          3. .Any other malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization, with the exception of
             adequately treated in-situ carcinoma of the cervix, uteri, or nonmelanomatous skin
             cancer (all treatment of which should have been completed 6 months prior to
             randomization)

          4. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic
             therapy, defined as ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without
             improvement despite appropriate antibiotics, antiviral therapy, and/or other treatment

          5. Known infection with hepatitis B or C, or history of human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) infection, or subject receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive
             medications that would in the opinion of the investigator, increase the risk of
             serious neutropenic complications

          6. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine or any of
             their excipients

          7. Serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems, or serious
             psychiatric disorders, which could compromise the subject's safety or the study data
             integrity. These include, but are not limited to:

        1).History of connective tissue disorders (eg, lupus, scleroderma, arteritis nodosa)
        2).History of interstitial lung disease, slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough,
        sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypersensitivity
        pneumonitis or multiple allergies 3).History of the following within 6 months prior to
        Cycle 1 Day 1: a myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris,
        coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV
        heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant cardiac dysrhythmia or ECG
        abnormality, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or seizure disorder
