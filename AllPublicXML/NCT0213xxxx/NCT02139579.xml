      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase is one of most popular target
      molecules in the field of anticancer drug research. EGFR is highly expressed in many types of
      tumor cells, which could activate EGFR cytosolic kinase activity by binding to its ligand
      EGF, and regulates gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis through
      different signal transduction pathways. Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), competitive to specifically combined with the EGFR kinase domain, thus
      inhibits its kinase activity, thereby blocking cancer cell proliferation or metastasis. At
      present, EGFR-TKI has been widely used in clinical activity, especially in patients with EGFR
      mutations, which had been proved to achieved a certain effect. But with the passage of time,
      a drug resistance is inevitable.

      At present, studies have found that the cessation of treatment immediately after EGFR-TKI
      resistance may lead to rapid progress of cancer. Chemotherapy, as one of the most widely
      accepted modality in cancer treatment, might also be one of the salvage therapies of target
      treatment. Therefore, in patients with better physical status (PS) scores, chemotherapy is
      commonly applicable.

      In January 2010, a study published in the journal of Clinical Lung Cancer reported the
      application of chemotherapy as salvage treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) patients with resistant to first-line EGFR-TKI treatment. Of the 114 patients
      enrolled, 67 received sequential chemotherapy, the other 47 patients received best supportive
      care. The results showed that, sequential chemotherapy can improve the survival time of the
      patients, compared with chemotherapy and supportive care groups (11.2 months vs. 3.8 months,
      P&lt; 0.01). Furthermore, in those who received sequential chemotherapy, a regimen containing
      paclitaxel got higher efficiency and disease control rate than those without (48.7% vs.
      21.4%, 79.5% vs. 53.5% , P&lt; 0.05), as well as longer progression-free survival (PFS, 5.1
      months vs. 1.8 months, P&lt; 0.01) and overall survival (OS, 12.7 months vs. 7 months, P&lt; 0.01).

      Another study in Taiwan which enrolled 195 patients treated with at least 1 cycles sequential
      chemotherapy after first-line gefitinib shown similar results. Generally, gefitinib as a
      first-line treatment had PFS for 5 months, and the second-line treatment efficiency was
      14.4%. Regimens of platinum or paclitaxel had a better treatment efficiency (50.6%). A poor
      therapeutic effect was reported for gefitinib as second-line therapy (5.6%). In total, the
      median OS of second-line treatment was 12.2 months. In addition, platinum containing regimens
      survival better (21.7 months vs. 8.9 months, P&lt; 0.01); patients with mutant EGFR benefit more
      in a platinum-based chemotherapy (24.5 months vs. 8.5 months, P&lt; 0.05).

      Bevacizumab (trade name Avastin ®) is a kind of recombinant humanized monoclonal
      immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) antibody, which can selectively inhibit the combination process
      of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor, Flt-1 and kinase domain
      receptor (KDR) in endothelial cells. A reduction of tumor angiogenesis, blood supply, oxygen
      and other nutrients supply could be obtained after the VEGF loss of its biological activity,
      thus inhibit tumor growth. The drug was approved for the first-line treatment of advanced
      colorectal cancer in 2004 by America food and Drug Administration (FDA),thus became the first
      for clinical use of drugs that targeting VEGF. As the first globally approved anti-angiogenic
      monoclonal antibody drugs, bevacizumab has approved for advanced colorectal cancer, lung
      cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and malignant glioma patients, which was used in
      more than 500000 cases. In the field of advanced NSCLC treatment, clinical results confirm
      bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy can prolong OS and PFS of patients with NSCLC, and
      well tolerated.

      The thirty-fifth annual meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference
      released a meta analysis results of bevacizumab combined with platinum chemotherapy for
      first-line treatment of advanced non squamous NSCLC. It is confirmed that, treatment with
      bevacizumab based chemotherapy for advanced non squamous NSCLC patients could achieve
      significant survival benefit, prolong remission time, and expected safety.

      Therefore, the investigators design this phase II to testify the efficacy and safety of
      bevacizumab + chemotherapy for EGFR-TKI resistant non squamous NSCLC.
