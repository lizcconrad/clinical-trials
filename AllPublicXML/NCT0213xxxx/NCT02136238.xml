  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the functional performance of voluntary opening (VO) and voluntary
      closing (VC) body powered prostheses. We hypothesize that the ability to sense cable tension
      and produce progressively higher pinch from shoulder force will result in advantages for the
      VC terminal device (TRS, Grip 3) in terms of proprioception and overall function. The
      specific aims of this clinical trial are to:

        1. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in reduced
           compensatory motion during activity.

        2. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in improved function
           in activities of daily living.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the performance of the prehensors, subjects will complete a randomized A-B
      crossover study with a subjective follow-up. Two subject categories will be evaluated: 1.)
      healthy non-amputees, and 2.) unilateral transradial amputee subjects who currently use, or
      are interested in using a body-powered prosthesis. We anticipate data collection data with 10
      non-amputee subject, and 8 amputee subjects.

    <description>Simulation of 10 activities of daily living (i.e. donning a shirt, sweeping, walking stairs). Measured in units of time, distance and mass to provide a singular, continuous scaled score of function (from 0-100). A score of 100 is the maximal score and indicates the highest level of independent function where a score of 0 indicates the poorest score. Persons scoring lower scores will likely be at increased risk of dependency with daily function.</description>

        <title>Physical Function Performance 10 Test Score</title>
        <description>Simulation of 10 activities of daily living (i.e. donning a shirt, sweeping, walking stairs). Measured in units of time, distance and mass to provide a singular, continuous scaled score of function (from 0-100). A score of 100 is the maximal score and indicates the highest level of independent function where a score of 0 indicates the poorest score. Persons scoring lower scores will likely be at increased risk of dependency with daily function.</description>
        <time_frame>Based on preliminary experience with the intervention, accommodation can range from 1 month to 2 months. Assessment was scheduled within 1-2 weeks following accommodation.</time_frame>
