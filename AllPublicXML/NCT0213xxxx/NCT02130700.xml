    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical study is to determine the safety and efficacy of VT-464, a
      lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17, in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC) who have been previously treated with Enzalutamide, Androgen Receptor Positive
      Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients, and Men with ER positive Breast Cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 open-label study of VT-464 in patients with progressive, metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been previously treated with
      enzalutamide, female patients with triple negative, AR positive breast cancer and men with ER
      positive breast cancer. The study consists of five cohorts: patients in Cohort 1 must have
      never received prior chemotherapy. Patients in Cohort 2 must have received at least one (and
      not more) prior course of chemotherapy for CRPC. Women with TNBC will be stratified into two
      cohorts AR 1 to 9% (cohort 3) and AR &gt; 10% (cohort 4). Cohort 5 will consist of men who have
      been diagnosed with ER+ breast cancer and have failed at least one prior endocrine therapy.

             of the prostate.

             must be radiographic evidence of disease after primary treatment with surgery or
             radiotherapy that has continued to progress radiographically or biochemically (rising
             PSA levels on successive measurements) despite adequate androgen-deprivation therapy,
             which is defined as having undergone bilateral surgical castration or continued
             treatment on GnRH agonists or antagonists.

          -  All patients in this trial must have been treated with enzalutamide.

          -  Patients in Cohort 1 will not be allowed to have received prior chemotherapy; patients
             in Cohort 2 must have received one (and not more) prior course of chemotherapy for
             mCRPC.

          -  Progression must be evidenced and documented by any of the following parameters:

               -  PSA progression defined by a minimum of two rising PSA levels with an interval of
                  â‰¥ 1 week between each determination

               -  Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan

               -  Progressive measurable disease by RECIST 1.1
