    <textblock>
      Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired airway
      mucociliary clearance leading to recurrent respiratory infections, bronchiectasis and
      eventually respiratory insufficiency. Diagnosis of PCD is difficult and relies on complex
      methods which are not widely available (1).

      Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is reduced in PCD patients as compared to normal subjects, and nNO
      measurement has been proposed as a non-invasive screening tool for PCD. However, nNO
      measurement techniques are not standardized and reference values are lacking (2, 3).

      The NIOX MINO is a handheld analyzer developed for the non-invasive measurement of exhaled NO
      (eNO) in asthmatics. Measurement of nNO with the NIOX MINO has been reported in only few
      studies (4-6), which mainly compared the NIOX MINO with others NO analyzers. However, no
      study attempted to establish reference values with the NIOX MINO in a large number of normal
      subjects.

      One critical issue in nNO measurement is to avoid contamination of nasal air by exhaled
      alveolar air during nNO sampling. This can be obtained by either breath holding, or by a
      breathing technique allowing soft palate closure during sampling, such as mouth breathing
      again resistance. However, as sampling times with the NIOX MINO are long (2 minutes at a flow
      of 2 ml/min, and 45 seconds at a flow of 5 ml/min), these techniques may be difficult to
      apply.

      In this pilot study, we will determine normal nNO values in 100 healthy men and women aged 20
      to 70 years using 3 different breathing techniques:

        1. breath holding during 45 seconds

        2. mouth breathing through a fixed resistance (a straw), to create a small positive
           pressure in the oropharynx during expiration only

        3. mouth breathing through a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) apparatus, which
           produces continuous soft palate closure during quiet spontaneous breathing, thus
           allowing long sampling times for nNO measurement.

      This study will allow: 1) to determine whether nNO can be reliably measured with the NIOX
      MINO in adult normal subjects, 2) to identify the most reproducible breathing technique, 3)
      to determine normal values of nNO as measured by the NIOX MINO, and 4) to explore possible
      differences between genders and age groups.
