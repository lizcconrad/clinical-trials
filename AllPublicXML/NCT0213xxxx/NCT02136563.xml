  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational clinical research on patients with chronic kidney disease who are
      not on hemodialysis and receiving darbepoetin alfa to treat diagnosed renal anemia; the major
      objective is to explore novel erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) response index in
      association with deterioration of renal function as well as occurrence of cardiovascular
      disease events.
