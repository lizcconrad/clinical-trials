      This Phase Ib dose escalation study will evaluate BTH1704, a monoclonal antibody that targets
      an aberrantly glycosylated antigen Mucin 1, and Imprime PGG, a glucan contained in yeast that
      is essential in triggering a leukocyte-mediated cytotoxic response towards tumor cells, in
      combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced PDAC. The three intravenous drugs are
      taken in tandem 4 times in a 28-day cycle. The MAD of BTH1704 (BTH, 3 dose levels) in
      combination with gemcitabine (Gem) and Imprime PGG (I) will be determined using a standard
      &quot;3+3&quot; design. Treatment continues until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, physician
      discretion, or patient refusal.

             pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma, pancreatic anaplastic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic
             signet ring carcinoma, papillary mucinous carcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, and
