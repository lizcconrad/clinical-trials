  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hypothesis:

      A large reduction in weight is not associated with a change in accurately measured glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR) (51Chromium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma clearance
      (51Cr-EDTA)).

      Secondary hypothesis:

      A large reduction in weight is associated with a greater change in estimated GFR (The
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-formula)) than in accurately measured GFR.

      Other formulas for estimated GFR (Cockcroft Gault, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
      Collaboration (CKD-EPI), CKD-EPI with cystatin C) are better correlated with accurately
      measured GFR.
