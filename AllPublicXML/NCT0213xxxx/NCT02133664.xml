    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to collect data to determine the correct effect size on the primary
      outcome to aid in the design of a larger study: The primary outcome is to determine if lipoic
      acid and omega-3 fatty acids can improve cognitive function in people with multiple sclerosis
      that have cognitive dysfunction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. The
      primary aim of the study is to determine if lipoic acid and omega-3 fatty acids can improve
      cognitive function over 12-weeks in people with multiple sclerosis that have a baseline score
      of at least two standard deviations below normative values on any one of four cognitive tests
      that include, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), Stroop Color-Word Test, California
      Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT).

      The secondary aim is to determine treatment effects on markers of endothelial inflammation,
      insulin dysregulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction that may be related to cognitive
      dysfunction by measuring soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) levels,
      homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and MRI phosphorus imaging in a subset of
      study participants. The study will also measure safety by adverse event reports and
      laboratory measures; plasma fatty acid levels; serum lipoic acid levels.

    <measure>Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PASAT is a measure of working memory and sustained attention frequently used in multiple sclerosis treatment outcome studies. The examinee is presented with a series of numbers at 2 second intervals on an audiotape and responds by always adding the last two numbers on the tape before the next number is presented. The change in total number of correct responses from baseline to 12 weeks is the measurement for the outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop Color-Word Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop test assess attention and executive function.The task consists of 3 tasks with only red, green, and blue colors used. The first task asks the subject to name the colors of spots on cards. If a subject can perform this task the second task is performed in which a subject must read the names of colors listed on cards (which are printed in congruent colors). In the third task, the subject is shown a series of words naming colors but the words and colors are mismatched; so the word &quot;yellow&quot; may be red, the word &quot;blue&quot; may be green and so forth. The subject is instructed to ignore the word and name the color. The subject will have the tendency to read the word rather than name the color, the so-called Stroop effect. This third part of the test is referred to as the interference condition and is the critical measurement. The change in time it takes to complete the interference from baseline to 12 weeks is the outcome measure.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CVLT-II is a measure of verbal learning/memory. It is comprised of lists containing 16 words, each of which fit into one of four categories of &quot;shopping list&quot; items. Five trials are administered followed by presentation of a different list. Free and cued recall of the original list is assessed. The change in long delay free recall from baseline to 12 weeks will be the measurement used for outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The COWAT is a letter fluency test. Participants are asked to generate as many words as possible beginning with a particular letter of the alphabet during one minute. Alternate versions using 3 letters are used for each examination. The change in total number of words produced for the 3 letters from baseline to 12 weeks will be the outcome.</description>

        <title>Stroop Color-Word Test</title>
        <description>The Stroop test assess attention and executive function.The task consists of 3 tasks with only red, green, and blue colors used. The first task asks the subject to name the colors of spots on cards. If a subject can perform this task the second task is performed in which a subject must read the names of colors listed on cards (which are printed in congruent colors). In the third task, the subject is shown a series of words naming colors but the words and colors are mismatched; so the word “yellow” may be red, the word “blue” may be green and so forth. The subject is instructed to ignore the word and name the color. The subject will have the tendency to read the word rather than name the color, the so-called Stroop effect. This third part of the test is referred to as the interference condition and is the critical measurement. The change in time it takes to complete the interference from baseline to 12 weeks is the outcome measure.</description>
