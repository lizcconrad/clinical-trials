  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROPS trial is for men being considered for radiotherapy due to the suspicion that their
      prostate cancer has recurred following the surgical removal of their prostate
      (prostatectomy). This suspicion is based on rises seen on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)
      blood tests. Only men who demonstrate the absence of disease on standard imaging scans
      (Computed Tomography (CT) and bone scans) will be invited to participate.

      This study will be assessing if the imaging probe 18-F Fluorocholine (18F-FCH) used during
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, can better
      predict who will benefit from radiotherapy by identifying the source of cancer recurrence.
      This will be determined by measuring the number of men who have disease identified outside of
      the prostate bed (the small pocket or depression where the prostate used to be) on their
      18F-FCH PET scan. Since F-18-FCH has been shown to be more sensitive in detecting prostate
      cancer that may have spread into lymph nodes or bone, it may potentially identify areas of
      prostate cancer spread not seen with standard imaging.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be a non-randomized, prospective study of men with suspected local recurrence
      of prostate cancer post-prostatectomy with negative conventional re-staging studies (bone
      scan and CT of the abdomen and pelvis; MRI of the pelvis as part of re-staging is allowed
      where it is the institutional standard of care). The clinician will develop an initial
      treatment plan based on conventional re-staging information.

      Patients enrolled onto trial will undergo hybrid PET/MR imaging using 18F-FCH (sites without
      access to a hybrid PET/MR scanner will conduct a 18F-FCH PET/CT in addition to a full body
      MRI). A consensus staging report based on local and centralized review of the 18F-FCH PET
      imaging will be provided to the attending clinician, who will document a second treatment
      plan based on this additional information. The treatment plan to be implemented (initial or
      second) will be left to clinician discretion, but will be documented.

    <description>Patients will first undergo screening to ensure eligibility. If eligible, they will undergo a PET/MRI scan using 18F-FCH as the radiolabeled tracer. If prostate cancer is detected outside the prostate, patients may undergo a biopsy or follow-up 18F-FCH PET/MRI to confirm the results.</description>
