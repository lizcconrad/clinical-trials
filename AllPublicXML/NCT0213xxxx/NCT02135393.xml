  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the assumption that, in humans, folic acid, a dietary
      supplement is biotransformed (reduced and methylated) to the natural circulating plasma
      folate 6S-5Methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF) in the intestinal mucosa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current thinking, based mainly on rodent studies, is that physiological doses of folic acid
      (pteroylmonoglutamic acid), like dietary vitamin folates, are biotransformed in the
      intestinal mucosa and transferred to the portal vein as the natural circulating plasma
      folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF), before entering the liver and the wider
      systemic blood supply.

      Study design:Open labelled study that samples portal and peripheral veins for labelled folate
      concentrations following oral ingestion with physiological doses of dietary supplements
      stable-isotope-labelled folic acid, or, the reduced folate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolic acid
      (5-FormylTHF). The study was performed in subjects with a Transjugular Intrahepatic Porto
      Systemic Shunt (TIPSS) in situ at the time of a routine annual patency check to allow blood
      samples to be taken from the portal vein. The aim of this study is to test the assumption
      that, in humans, folic acid is biotransformed (reduced and methylated) to 5-MTHF in the
      intestinal mucosa.
