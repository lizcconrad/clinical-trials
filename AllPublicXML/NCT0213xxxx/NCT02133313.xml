      The time on peritoneal dialysis may be limited for a significant number of patients that use
      this modality of renal replacement therapy due to the inability of the peritoneal membrane to
      clear solutes or achieve adequate ultrafiltration, termed peritoneal membrane failure (PMF).
      This can be devastating for patients who have become accustomed to the quality of life
      provided by peritoneal dialysis and who otherwise have done well on this therapy. There is
      clinical evidence suggesting that icodextrin preserves the peritoneal membrane transport
      characteristics which may be linked to reduced cumulative glucose exposure of the peritoneal
      mesothelial cells. Theories to explain the role of dextrose in PMF have focused for the most
      part on the high intracellular concentrations of glucose without consideration to the
      potential pathogenic role of the glucose transporters which allow glucose entry into the
      cell. Experimental evidence in non-mesothelial cell lines indicate that some cellular
      processes that occur under high glucose conditions may not be related to intracellular
      glucose metabolism but to the type of glucose transporter allowing glucose entry. 3,4
      However, little is known about these glucose transporters in peritoneal mesothelial cells and
      their potential role in the development of PMF.

      We hypothesize the following

        -  The presence of Sodium Glucose Co-transporter (SGLT1) on peritoneal mesothelial cells
           plays a role in PMF under hyperglycemic conditions.

        -  Regulation of pro-fibrotic mediators such as reactive oxidative species,transforming
           growth factor Î², and vascular endothelial growth factor are modulated by SGLT1
           activation by glucose rather than glucose metabolism or concentration.

        -  Icodextrin does not activate the SGLT1 transporter establishing a mechanism that may
           explain the beneficial effects of icodextrin on peritoneal membrane transport.

      Participants enrolled in this study will have pertinent clinical information entered into a
      database. Participants will then have spent peritoneal dialysate collected at least every 6
      months and analyzed for markers of fibrosis. Patients undergoing a special type of peritoneal
      dialysis start call urgent start peritoneal dialysis will have spent peritoneal dialysate
      collected more frequently at the start of peritoneal dialysis and then every 6 months. The
      results from the analysis of the peritoneal dialysate will then be correlated with data in
      the patient registry.

      Quality assurance- As this is a single center trial all data will be monitored by the PI.
      Data will be entered in a prospective manner into the database by a research coordinator.
      Every 6 months data will be checked for accuracy by comparing to data collected for routine
      clinical purposes by both the home dialysis unit which tracks all hospitalizations,
      peritonitis, exit site infections, technique failures. As well as the dialysis access
      database maintained by the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

      Source data verification- Data will come from both the history and physical of the primary
      investigator as well as electronic medical records at the University of Alabama at Birmingham
      and Falcon Electronic Health Record from Davita.

      Standard Operating Procedures: Patient recruitment will be from the University of Alabama at
      Birmingham Home Dialysis unit.

      Sample size: As there are no data on which to base the power calculation for this unique
      study on glucose transporters and their role in peritoneal membrane fibrosis, descriptive
      statistics will be used to gain insight into the proposed research questions. Continuous
      variables will be summarized with mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile
      range depending on the distribution. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequency
      and percentage.
