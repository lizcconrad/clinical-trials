  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is for a series of descriptive analyses conducted within a cohort of patients
      using linagliptin, other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and other oral and
      non-insulin injected hypoglycemic medications between May 2011 and July 2012.

      Understanding 1) the existing utilization patterns for linagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin,
      and other oral and non-insulin injected hypoglycemic agents and (2) the differences in
      utilization patterns between these agents will help with the design, analysis and
      interpretation of comparative effectiveness and safety studies of linagliptin, other DPP-4
      inhibitors, and other agents.

      The study will provide an overview of existing utilization patterns for linagliptin, other
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, other oral and non-insulin injected hypoglycemic
      agents, in order to detect potential selective prescribing patterns that might lead to
      channeling bias.
