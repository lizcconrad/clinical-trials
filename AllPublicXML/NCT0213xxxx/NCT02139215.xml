  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV multicenter trial to evaluate real-world health outcomes and economic
      impact of panitumumab versus standard-of-care (SOC) in the treatment of patients with
      chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

      The study will enable real-life health economics and outcome research (HEOR) to assess the
      impact of panitumumab in the Quebec population.

      The primary objective is to evaluate real-world health outcomes and economic impact of
      panitumumab in the treatment of patients with chemotherapy-refractory mCRC in comparison with
      SOC. The secondary objectives are to confirm survival data, to assess the quality of life of
      patients and to assess the health care resource utilization of patients.

      Patients with a mutated KRAS gene will be treated with standard-of-care (SOC) and patients
      with a non-mutated (wild type) KRAS gene will be treated with panitumumab.

      During the course of the study, data will be collected on quality of life and work
      productivity. Patients will be asked to fill a set of questionnaires at their recruitment in
      the study and at every 3 months after treatment initiation.
