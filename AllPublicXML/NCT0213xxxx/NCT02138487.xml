    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to better understand the relationship between
      activity restrictions and women's satisfaction following urogynecologic surgery for prolapse.
      We hypothesize that women with less stringent postoperative restrictions will have higher
      levels of satisfaction 12 weeks following surgery with no difference in respect to anatomic
      outcome.

    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor disorders (PFD) dramatically affect millions of women's quality of life (QOL),
      and 30% of American women will undergo reconstructive surgery for urinary incontinence or
      pelvic organ prolapse to improve bothersome symptoms and quality of life. Surgical goals of
      women with PFD is often to resume their normal activities, which they have limited secondary
      to bothersome symptoms. Yet, traditionally surgeons placed strict postoperative restrictions
      on patient's activity levels for 3 months; sometimes even recommending life long lifting and
      activity restrictions. Activity restrictions are imposed on the premise that exercise can
      &quot;weaken&quot; surgical healing; however, emerging data from other fields suggests that increased
      activity may actually promote the healing process. We aim to determine whether satisfaction,
      recovery, and anatomic outcomes after surgery are related to type of postoperative activity
      recommendations (liberal versus restricted). Women having surgery for PFD will be randomized
      to receive either liberal or restricted postoperative activity recommendations and
      satisfaction, symptoms, QOL and anatomic outcomes will be measured after surgery. We
      hypothesize that women with liberal activity recommendations will recover more quickly and
      report higher satisfaction and QOL, have fewer symptoms, and have similar anatomic outcomes
      to women with restricted activity restrictions. These data will change paradigms of women's
      health and recovery after surgery.

    <description>Satisfaction will be assessed following reconstructive pelvic surgery for prolapse using a question which assesses a patient's global impression. Specifically, patients will be asked the question &quot;how satisfied are you with your prolapse surgery?&quot; at 12 wks to assess overall satisfaction. Possible responses include &quot;completely satisfied,&quot; &quot;mostly satisfied,&quot; &quot;neutral,&quot; &quot;mostly dissatisfied,&quot; and &quot;completely dissatisfied.&quot;</description>
