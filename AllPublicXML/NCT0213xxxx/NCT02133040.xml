  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to evaluate the effect of thyroid hormones on brown adipose tissue in
      humans in an observational study on patients with thyrotoxicosis. In the investigators
      evaluation the investigators will use FDG-PET/CT, indirect calorimetry and fat biopsies in
      the acute phase of the disease and in the euthyroid phase after treatment.

      It is the investigators hypothesis that high levels of circulating T3 might affect amount and
      function of brown adipose tissue.

  <detailed_description>

      10 patients with thyreotoxicosis (T3 &gt; 3 nmol/L and suppressed TSH) will be investigated at
      diagnosis and after 3-6 months of euthyroidism induced by antithyroid treatment. The patients
      will all be over the age of 50 due to the radiation given by the scans (requested by the
      local Ethical Committee). All will be scanned for active BAT by the integrated FDG PET-CT
      before and after treatment.BAT is activated by means of crushed ice placed under the feet in
      individualized intervals during the scan procedure. Indirect calorimetry is done to determine
      the basal metabolic rate and subcutaneous fat biopsy to examine the effect on subcutaneous
      white fat and the possible &quot;browning&quot; effect.
