  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Encouraged by the recent data published ,the investigators think that a waiting time of 10
      minutes is feasible while preserving diagnostic accuracy and would like to assess the
      feasibility and diagnostic efficacy of W10 compared with W30 imaging in a pilot study. By
      combining W10 imaging with half-time acquisition, the time of the technetium-99m myocardial
      perfusion imaging procedure could be shortened by at least 50%, lasting only 40 minutes for
      W10 (10-minute waiting) imaging compared with 90 minutes for W30 imaging (30-minute waiting).

      The investigators hypothesize that (1) W10 MPI is clinically feasible and tolerable by the
      patients, that (2) W10 MPI provides high image quality and that (3) W10 MPI provides
      diagnostic accuracy comparable to W30 MPI.

    <description>The investigators will evaluate image quality of W10 and W30-qualitatively (visually) by 2 independent readers and semi-qualitatively by means of region of interest (ROI) count/pixels parameters of W10 and W30 data and compare their diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction.</description>

    <description>Each patient will complete a total of 6 questionnaires on the day of testing before and after each stress W10 and W30 scanning. The participants will be asked to rate how they felt, and if present, how they perceived their headache during scanning. Patients will also be asked how they felt and how severe was their headache when comparing the rest W10 and W30 and the stress W10 and W30.</description>
