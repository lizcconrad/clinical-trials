  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, study will investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antil-CLL activity of VAY736 in patients with
      relapsed/refractory CLL who have received at least two prior regimens. The study will include
      one arm in the dose escalation phase and two arms in the dose expansion phase.

    <description>VAY736 is a human immunoglobulin of the G class (IgG1/k) monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to specifically bind the BAFF receptor. VAY736 binds primarily to B-cells through its fragment antigen binding (Fab) region, in human whole blood and spleen samples; it does not bind to natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, granulocytes, or platelets.</description>
