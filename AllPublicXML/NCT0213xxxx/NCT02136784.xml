  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of opioid analgesics on acute pain in
      participants maintained on buprenorphine+naloxone (Suboxone) for opioid use disorders. Seven
      medication conditions will be tested in a cold pressor test (CPT) paradigm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design is a single-blind examination of the analgesic effects of a single dose of seven
      test medications provided in an experimental pain paradigm using a cold pressor test (CPT).
      Test medication conditions include buprenorphine, morphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone,
      oxycodone, and two placebo conditions to match test medication formulations (oral tablet,
      sublingual tablet). Each medication condition will be tested on separate days (seven total
      days, completing within 12 weeks), with random assignment to order of study medications.
      After screening, eligible participants will be scheduled for 7 days of testing with test days
      at least 3 days apart to provide a sufficient medication wash-out period. Pain testing will
      utilize cold pressor tests (CPT), in which the participant submerges his arm and hand in a
      bath of ice cold water to determine pain threshold and tolerance. Participants will be given
      a practice trial to provide familiarity with the test and reduce test anxiety. Two CPTs will
      occur on each test day, and pre- and post-CPT assessments will be administered. Blood samples
      will be taken on each test day to measure blood levels of buprenorphine. Daily procedures
      include: (1) A baseline CPT (BL-CPT), (2) Administration of the test medication (active drug
      or placebo), (3) CPT administered at the time of maximum drug effect (Tmax-CPT) specific to
      medication (range 30-120 minutes), (4) Pupillometry conducted at baseline (before BL-CPT),
      and at time of maximum drug effect (before Tmax-CPT). Each participant will be discharged
      after clinical determination of the participant's safety and well-being. Testing will
      continue until twelve trials of each medication condition are completed.
