      The 'Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé (IRSS)', in collaboration with
      Micronutrient Initiative (MI), the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) Antwerp (Belgium),
      and the Health District of Tougan, will conduct a study to assess the effectiveness of a
      promotional package in the prevention and management of malnutrition among children aged 6-23
      months.

      This promotional package includes:

        1. A monthly follow-up sessions promoting growth in which detailed advice on feeding
           practices infant and young child feeding (IYCF) will be given to the mothers of children
           6-23 months . These behavioral change informations be developed based on the rapid
           assessment of practices and foods available in the community and adaptation of the WHO
           manual.

        2. The distribution of micronutrient powders (MNP) (15 micronutrients) to mothers of
           children 6-23 months of age for home fortification of complementary foods

        3. Intensive counseling sessions and cooking demonstrations every two weeks for moderately
           malnourished children . Cooking demonstrations will include instructions on adding
           micronutrient powders and oil to meals .

    <description>Growth monitoring and promotion sessions will take place every month at village level for all children 0-23 months of age and will serve as an entry point for all the interventions. During these sessions children under 24 months will be weighed monthly and screened for MAM and uncomplicated SAM for treatment in the community as well as complicated SAM for referral to health facility During the monthly sessions cooking demonstrations will take place in which the community Health workers will instruct the mother how to prepare a good complementary food for 6-23 months olds adding the MNP. These meals will be given to the child during the session. Mothers will be encouraged to prepare the same meal at home During the monthly sessions enhanced IYCN counseling will be given to the mothers of 6-23 months olds, using improved BCI messages developed based on the rapid assessment of practices and foods available in the community and adaptation of the WHO manual.</description>
