  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation improves health conditions with reduction of the risk factors for
      cardiovascular and respiratory disease, as functional capacity and quality of life. Smoking
      cessation has positive effects on the miRNAs regulation, however, genomics has been little
      explored. Smoking and aging induces changes miRNAs. Among the changes in airway epithelial
      cells, miR-125 called attention because it is enrolled in the suppression of ERBB7 (tirosin
      kinase receptors), a codified sequence of the growth factor receptor (EGFR) frequently
      expressed in cancer. The reduction of miR-125 expression may reduce cancer suppression
      resulting in cancer development. Other miRNA changes can be observed, such as miR-218 that
      were found in smokers airway epithelial cells as in MiR-15b that were found in lung tissue of
      COPD smokers. These miRNAs participated in the signalling pathway of TGF-β enrolled in
      leukocyte migration and cell proliferation. The investigators hypothesize that smoking
      cessation has a role in the regulation or reduction in the genetic changes smoking-induced.
      The investigators will assess the subject genomic profile at the baseline, 6 months and 12
      months after smoking cessation.

      After agreement with the written informed consent, 36 volunteers, male and female, aged
      between 18 and 70 years will be recruited at Medical School University of Sao Paulo and in
      the Ambulatory of Smoking Cessation Program of the Clinics Hospital. Exclusion criteria are
      inability to taste saccharin, nasal surgery, respiratory infection in the previous 30 days to
      the enrollement into the study. All volunteers will be assessed at Basal, 6 months and 12
      months. The present study aims to assess the effects of smoking cessation on the airway
      defense mechanism, airway inflammation and genomics (miRNAs) in humans by using (a) saccharin
      transit time test to assess mucociliary clearance; (b) mucus physical properties; (c) EBC pH;
      (d) Nasal lavage pH, cellularity,cytokines (IL-1β, TGF-β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
      IL-13, MPO, MUC5AC, cotinine, proteomics, (e) lung function; (f) genomics (miRNAs) and (g)
      quality of life with rhinosinusitis questionnaire (SNOT20), sleep disturbances questionnaire.

    <description>Blood sample will be collected in paxgene tube (BD do Brasil, SP, Brasil). MicroRNAs will be extracted from the blood samples by using PAXgene blood miRNA kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, USA).

    <description>We evaluate the nasal MCC by measuring nasal saccharine transport time (STT). The subject is asked to avoid alcohol, tea and coffee for 6 hours and to eat or drink nothing for 2 hours before the measurements. The STT assessment is performed in a quiet room at a temperature of 21-22ºC and relative humidity of 63-71%. Subjects sat in a chair and are asked to maintain regular breathing, to avoid deep breathing, coughing, sneezing, sniffing or talking during STT measurements. Twenty-five µg saccharin particles are deposited 2 cm from the anterior end of the non-obstructed nostril and the timer is stopped at the first perception of sweet taste. The maximum delay between the deposition and perception is set at 60 minutes for non-detection.</description>

    <description>The EBC is obtained as previously described. At the start of EBC collection, all subjects rinse their mouths with distilled water and are instructed to swallow saliva as necessary and to hold a slight head extension (approximately 15o). The EBC sample is collected over 15 min of quiet and normal breathings (regular tidal volumes and respiratory rate) through a mouthpiece that is connected to a collector device with dry ice (-20 °C). The total EBC (2.0-2.5 ml) is immediately divided and transferred to sterile 500 μl polypropylene tubes. One aliquot is immediately used for pH measurements. The remaining EBC sample aliquots are coded (for blinding purposes) and stored for a maximum of 4 weeks at -80°C for the determination of cytokine levels.</description>

Celularity: the cell pellet is resuspended in one milliliter of phosphate buffer saline solution (PBS). Thereafter, 20 µl of the mixed solution is added to a Neubauer chamber, and the cells are counted using a 400x light microscope (Olympus CH2, Olympus America Inc., Palo Alto, USA). For differential cell counts, 100 µl of the mixed solution is centrifuged (96 g, 25°C, 6 min) to obtain a slide with two areas of cells that are stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Differential cell counts are performed with the aid of a 1000x light microscope (Olympus CH2, Olympus America Inc., Palo Alto, USA) by two different observers.</description>
