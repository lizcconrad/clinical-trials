  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-year study to evaluate the effect of sequential therapy of Forteo
      (teriparatide) and denosumab on bone density at the spine, hip, leg and forearm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to maximize the early anabolic effect with teriparatide (TPTD), and to avoid the
      development of tachyphylaxis to the continued daily administration of TPTD beyond 6 months,
      cyclic therapy might be optimal. Since Denosumab (Prolia) is a potent antiresorptive agent
      with a rapid off-effect, it might be the optimal agent to help maximize bone gains with
      cyclic TPTD/antiresorptive therapy. Our primary hypothesis is that the increment in bone
      density of the spine by DXA will be greater in women randomized to receive the cyclic
      sequential regimen (three separate 6 month cycles of daily subcutaneous TPTD, each followed
      by one subcutaneous injection of Denosumab) compared with daily sequential therapy (18 months
      of daily subcutaneous TPTD followed by Denosumab therapy for 18 months).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:Subjects should be postmenopausal &gt;age 45, and of any racial origin.
        They must not be on any osteoporosis medication. They should be willing to participate for
        the duration of the study and have no physical or psychological illness that would prohibit
        them from participating. Pregnant women, protected individuals (institutionalized), and
        those unable to give informed consent will not be recruited. Exclusion criteria are
        detailed below.

        Subjects who meet initial pre-screening criteria will present for an on site screening
        visit and have a full medical history, brief physical exam, BMD and lab evaluation to
        confirm eligibility. Osteoporosis will be defined by DXA BMD T-Score &lt; -2.5 at lumbar spine
        (at least 2 evaluable vertebrae between L1 and L4), or total hip or femoral neck. In
        addition, women with confirmed vertebral deformity on radiograph or lateral DXA image, or
        prior osteoporosis-related fracture at age &gt;45 along with a DXA BMD T-Score &lt; -1.5 at one
        or more skeletal sites will be eligible to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The use of drugs known to affect skeletal or calcium homeostasis.

          -  Multiple vertebral fractures or severe lumbar degenerative changes with fewer than 2
             evaluable lumbar vertebrae

          -  Current use of anti-resorptive medicines
