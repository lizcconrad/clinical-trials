  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that therapeutic and supratherapeutic plasma
      exposures to ponesimod do not have an effect on cardiac repolarization exceeding the
      threshold of regulatory concern as measured by the QTc (interval from beginning of the Q wave
      until end of the T wave corrected for heart rate) interval duration after administration of
      multiple oral doses of 40 mg and 100 mg to healthy male and female subjects.

      This is a Phase 1, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo and positive-controlled,
      double-dummy, parallel group, multiple-dose, up-titration study of the electrocardiographic
      effects of ponesimod in healthy male and female subjects with a nested cross-over comparison
      between moxifloxacin and placebo.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to Group A (ponesimod treatment group) or Group B (placebo
      treatment group) in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in Group B will be further randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to one of the following sequences: 400 mg moxifloxacin followed by
      moxifloxacin-matching placebo or moxifloxacin matching placebo followed by 400 mg
      moxifloxacin.
