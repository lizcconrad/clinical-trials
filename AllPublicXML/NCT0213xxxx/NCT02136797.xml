  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well transfusions of T-cells work in treating CMV.
      Tcells are a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body from infection. A
      transfusion is the process by which blood from one person is transferred to the blood of
      another. In this case, the T-cells are made from the blood of donors who are immune to CMV.
      The T-cells are then grown and taught to attack the CMV virus in a lab.

    <description>The T-cells to be infused will be selected from our bank of GMP grade CMVpp65-CTL. T-cells will be administered by bolus intravenous infusion. In this phase II trial, patients will be treated at doses of 1 x 10^6 CMVpp65-CTL/kg/dose/week for 3 weeks. Patients will be observed for the following 3 weeks. Additional 3 week courses of CMVpp65-CTL may be administered if levels of CMV DNA in blood are still detectable despite disease stabilization or improvement.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each patient must satisfy at least one of the following criteria:

               1. The patient must have a clinically documented condition associated with CMV (e.g.
                  interstitial pneumonia, hepatitis, retinitis, colitis) Or

               2. The patient must have microbiological evidence of CMV viremia or tissue invasion
                  as attested by viral culture, or detection of levels of CMV DNA in the blood or
                  body fluids consistent with CMV infection.

          -  Patient must also satisfy at least one of the following criteria:

               1. The patient's CMV infection is clinically progressing or CMV viremia is
                  persistent or increasing (as evidenced by quantitation of CMV DNA in the blood)
                  despite two weeks induction therapy with antiviral drugs.

                  Or

               2. The patient has developed CMV viremia as attested by viral culture, or detection
                  of levels of CMV DNA in blood or body fluids while receiving prophylactic doses
                  of antiviral drugs to prevent CMV infection post transplant.

                  Or

               3. The patient is unable to sustain treatment with antiviral drugs due to drug
                  associated toxicities (e.g. myelosuppression [ANC&lt; 1000μl/ml without GCSF
                  support] or nephrotoxicity [corrected creatinine clearance ≤ 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2
                  or serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl]) CMV infections are life threatening, and may
                  involve multiple organ systems such as the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract,
                  hematopoietic and central nervous systems. Antiviral drugs used for treatment may
                  also compromise renal and hematopoietic function. Therefore, dysfunctions of
                  these organs will not affect eligibility for this protocol.

          -  Patients must meet the following clinical criteria to receive CMVpp65-CTL infusions

               1. Stable blood pressure and circulation, not requiring pressor support

               2. Evidence of adequate cardiac function as demonstrated by EKG and/or
                  echocardiography.

               3. A life expectancy of at least 3 weeks, even if requiring artificial ventilation.

               4. There are no age restrictions

          -  Patient must also satisfy at least one of the following criteria:

               1. The patient's HCT donor has not been previously infected by or sensitized to CMV
                  (e.g. a cord blood transplant or a marrow or PBSC transplant from a seronegative
                  donor).

               2. The patient's HCT donor, if seropositive, is either not available or not willing
                  to provide leukocytes for generation of CMV-specific T-cells.

               3. There are CMVpp65-specific T-cells available in appropriate doses in the MSKCC
                  Adoptive Immune T-cell Therapy Bank that are matched with the patient for 1 HLA
                  allele and that exhibit CMVpp65-specific cytotoxic activity that is restricted by
                  an HLA allele shared by the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients requiring high doses of glucocorticosteroids (≥ 0.3 mg/kg prednisone or its
             equivalent)

          -  Patients who are moribund

          -  Patients with other conditions not related to CMV infection (e.g. uncontrolled
             bacterial sepsis or invasive fungal infection) which are also life-threatening and
             which would preclude evaluation of the effects of a T-cell infusion.

          -  Patients who are pregnant
