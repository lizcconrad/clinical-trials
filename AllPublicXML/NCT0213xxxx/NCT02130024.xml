  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, randomised, controlled, masked study recruiting patients with one
      treatment-naïve eye presenting with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to
      wet AMD. At screening, following the informed consent process, patients will be assessed for
      study eligibility by assessment of visual acuity using logarithm of the minimum angle of
      resolution (logMAR), stereoscopic biomicroscopic slit-lamp fundus examination (78 D or
      similar lens); fluorescein angiogram (FA); colour fundus photography; fundus autofluorescence
      and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

      Eligible patients will be enrolled and then randomised to one of two arms: Arm 1: 0.5 mg
      ranibizumab using an inject and extend regimen Arm 2: 2.0 mg aflibercept using an inject and
      extend regimen.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for study eye:

          -  Diagnosis of active subfoveal CNV secondary to wet AMD without restriction of lesion
             size, with visual impairment being exclusively due to an active wet AMD lesion. Active
             lesions will be characterised by any of the following: abnormal retinal thickness,
             with evidence of intraretinal, subretinal or sub-pigment epithelial fluid
             accumulation, confirmed by OCT; presence of intraretinal or subretinal haemorrhage;
             leakage shown on a FA unless solely due to dry, fibrotic staining; visual acuity
             deterioration considered likely to represent CNV.

          -  BCVA score at both Screening and Baseline must be 23 letters or more as measured by
             the 3 metre Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like charts,
             inclusively (or approximate Snellen equivalent to 3/60+3).

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Inability to comply with study or follow-up procedures.

          2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          3. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during
             dosing of study treatment.

             Exclusion criteria for systemic medical history and conditions:

          4. Any type of systemic disease or its treatment, including any medical condition
             (controlled or uncontrolled) that could be expected to progress, recur, or change to
             such an extent that it may bias the assessment of the clinical status of the patient
             to a significant degree or put the patient at special risk.

          5. Stroke or myocardial infarction less than 3 months prior to Screening.

          6. Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as systolic value of &gt;160 mm Hg or diastolic value
             of &gt;100 mm Hg at Screening or Baseline.

          7. Known hypersensitivity to ranibizumab or aflibercept or any component of the
             ranibizumab or aflibercept formulation, or fluorescein.

             Exclusion criteria for ocular medical history and conditions:

             For both eyes:

          8. Any active periocular or ocular infection or inflammation (e.g., blepharitis,
             conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, endophthalmitis) at the time of
             Screening or Baseline.

          9. 1 or more patches of geographic atrophy &gt; 250µm in longest linear dimension.

         10. Uncontrolled glaucoma (intraocular pressure [IOP] ≥30 mm Hg on medication or according
             to investigator's judgment) at the time of Screening or Baseline.

         11. Neovascularisation of the iris or neovascular glaucoma at the time of Screening or
             Baseline.

         12. Inability of obtaining multimodal images of sufficient quality to be analysed.

             For study eye:

         13. Visually significant cataract (likely to require surgery within the next 12 months),
             aphakia, severe vitreous haemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, proliferative
             diabetic retinopathy or CNV of any cause other than wet AMD (e.g., ocular
             histoplasmosis, pathologic myopia macular hole) at the time of Screening and Baseline.

         14. Structural damage within 0.5 disc diameter of the centre of the macula (e.g.,
             vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membrane, scar, laser burn, foveal atrophy) at the
             time of screening that in the investigator's opinion could preclude visual function
             improvement with treatment.

             Exclusion criteria for prior or current systemic medication:

         15. Use of other investigational drugs within 30 days or 5 half-lives from baseline,
             whichever is longer.

         16. Current or planned use of systemic medications known to be toxic to the lens, retina
             or optic nerve as outlined in the Lucentis and Eylea Product Information.

             Exclusion criteria for prior or current ocular treatment:

             For study eye:

         17. Treatment with any anti-angiogenic drugs (including any anti-VEGF agents) prior to
             Baseline in eye.

         18. Any intraocular procedure (including Yttrium-Aluminium-Garnet capsulotomy) within 2
             months prior to Baseline or anticipated within the next 6 months following Baseline.

             Exclusion criteria of prohibited treatments (study eye):

         19. Intra or periocular corticosteroids (including sub tenon but excluding topical
             formulations)
