             echocardiography

          -  Subjects with severe chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy manifested by Canadian
             Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class II or greater angina, and/or New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) class II or greater dyspnea

          -  Patients who have undergone diagnostic coronary angiography demonstrating &gt; 70%
             diameter narrowing of at least two major coronary arteries or branches OR &gt; 50%

          -  Significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction evaluated by echocardiography or LV
             angiography (LVEF 25 to 40%) due to a prior myocardial infarction. This area of left
             ventricular dysfunction should be akinetic or severely hypokinetic, not aneurysmal,
             when assessed by echocardiography or LV angiogram

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Need for urgent or emergent revascularization

          -  Patients with confirmed myocardial infarction within 14 days, and/or rising cardiac
             biomarker proteins (i.e., CK-MB or troponin), and/or worsening ECG changes

          -  Patient supported by balloon pump pre-op

          -  Moderate or severe (&gt; 1+) aortic insufficiency as determined by echocardiogram

          -  History of severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring treatment

          -  Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy, or
             congenital heart disease

          -  Prior cardiac operations

          -  Anticipated for concomitant surgical procedure at the time of CABG (e.g., valve repair
             or replacement, aneurysm resection, carotid endarterectomy, etc.)

          -  Active infection, with a temperature greater than 37.5°C and an unexplained white
             blood cell count in excess of 15,000/mm3 within 48 hours prior to surgery

          -  Hemoglobin less than 10g/dL, white blood cell count less than 4,000/mm3, absolute
             neutrophil count less than 1500/mm3

          -  Primary coagulopathy or platelet disorder, including thrombocytopenia with absolute
             platelet count &lt; 80k or active state of disseminated intravascular coagulation

          -  Hemodynamically unstable patients, as defined by heart rate &lt;40/min or &gt;100/min,
             and/or systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or &gt;200 mmHg, and/or ongoing need for
             intravenous inotropic or vasopressor medications

          -  Severe pulmonary hypertension as defined by PVR &gt; 8 Wood units, that is unresponsive
             to vasodilator therapy within 14 days of enrollment

             vascular disease history must have acceptable stenosis documented by a carotid doppler
             study)

          -  Severe chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt;2.5mg/dl, estimated glomular
             filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;35 mL/min/1.73m2 or need for dialysis)

          -  Evidence of intrinsic hepatic disease as defined as liver enzyme values (AST or ALT or
             total bilirubin) that are &gt; 5 times the upper limit of normal within 30 days of

             acute decompensation as determined by the Investigator

          -  Significant peripheral vascular disease defined by claudication, rest pain or leg
             ulceration

          -  Active or known non-dermatological malignancy undergoing treatment including
             chemotherapy and radiotherapy or any other condition that would place the patient at
             increased risk for complications during the first 6 months after the procedure in the
             judgment of the attending cardiologist or cardiac surgeon

          -  Immunosuppressive medication (e.g. prednisone, cyclophosphamide, etanercept, etc.)

          -  Previous solid organ transplantation or anticipated need for solid organ transplant
             other than heart (with the exception of corneal transplant)

          -  Hematological disorders (e.g., aplastic anemia) or bone marrow disorders

          -  Myelodysplastic syndrome

          -  Any condition associated with a life expectancy of less than 6 months

          -  Contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including presence of an
             implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) or permanent pacemaker (PPM), or cases in
             which it is anticipated that an ICD or PPM will be implanted prior to the 6 month
             follow-up or claustrophobia (thus precluding performance of follow-up MRI scans)

          -  Contraindication to the administration of heparin, warfarin or anti-platelet agents

          -  Known allergic reaction or sensitivity to porcine material

          -  Significant cognitive impairment or psychiatric disease (including drug or alcohol
             abuse) that is likely to impair compliance with the study protocol

          -  Current participation or participation within the last 3 months in the study of an
             investigational drug, device, or biologic
