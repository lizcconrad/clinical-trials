    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether clobazam, brand name Onf®, is more effective
      as an adjunctive or monotherapy in terminating Epilepsia Partialis Continua (EPC) than either
      lorazepam and/or clonazepam.

    <textblock>
      First approved in the United States in 2011 for use in treating Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,
      clobazam is the only 1, 5-benzodiazepine that is currently approved for clinical use in the
      United States. In previous clinical trials clobazam has been shown to have a greater efficacy
      and produce fewer side effects in individuals when it's adverse event profile is compared to
      the traditional 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam. As a
      benzodiazepine, clobazam has been found to have anticonvulsant properties, and structural
      differences as a 1,5-benzodiazepines that appear to have a broader spectrum of anticonvulsant
      activity than those found in 1,4-benzodiazepines. In previous reports, clobazam has been seen
      to be effective in ether terminating or reducing both EPC in particular and partial status
      epilepticus.

    <description>Subjects who are assigned the clobazam treatment group will receive a 10mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 5-25 mg bid starting 12 hrs after the loading dose. If subjects are found to have failed to respond to treatment with clobazam, the physician investigator has the ability to either start another AED or increase the dose of clobazam depending on the clinical situation. Subjects still being treated with clobazam at discharge will be given a 30 day supply of clobazam.</description>
