    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label clinical study to assess the single-dose PK of
      eravacycline in subjects with renal impairment and healthy subjects conducted at
      approximately 2 sites in the United States. This study includes an up to 21-day Screening
      Period, a 5-day Treatment Period, and an End of Study Visit occurring approximately 2 weeks
      (±2 days) after study drug administration. Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled: 6
      subjects with ESRD and 6 healthy subjects with normal renal function. Healthy subjects will
      be matched to renally impaired subjects in gender, age, and body mass index (BMI). All
      subjects will be administered a single IV dose of eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg).

             Healthy subjects without renal impairment:

         11. Must be in good health as determined by screening medical history, physical
