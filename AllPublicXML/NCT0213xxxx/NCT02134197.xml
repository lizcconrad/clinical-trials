      The purpose of this study is to evaluate:

        -  The side effects of BAY1129980 when given every 21 days different dose levels.

        -  Determine the dose level of BAY1129980 that should be tested in future clinical research
           studies.

        -  Measure how much BAY1129980 is in the blood at specific times after administration.

        -  If treatment with BAY1129980 shows any effect on reducing the tumor growth.

        -  If there are specific biomarkers that might be able to explain why some patients respond
           to treatment and others do not.

        -  If treatment with BAY1129980 causes an immune response from the body against the drug
           (immunogenicity).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relatively restricted C4.4a expression pattern provides a target for the selective
      delivery of a cytotoxic drug to C4.4.a-expressing tumor cells by means of a suitable
      antibody-drug conjugate. The subject population eligible for the current study will be those
      subjects with advanced malignancies known to express C4.4a, which are refractory to standard
      therapy or those without standard therapy or actively refusing any treatment, which would be
      regarded as standard and in whom, in the opinion of the investigator, experimental therapy
      with BAY1129980 may be beneficial.Depending on the number of dose-escalating steps and the
      occurrence of DLTs, the planned numbers of subjects could vary.It is expected that up to 90
      subjects may participate in the dose-expansion phase of the study and up to 6-9 subjects may
      particpate in the dose re-esclation phase.The study assessments in the expansion phase of the
      study are identical to those in the dose-escalation phase.

      Amendment # 3 includes changes to DLT criteria (hematological and non-hematological) and
      allows for frequent follow-up for subjects experiencing drug-related liver toxicity that
      warrants dose reduction or dose interruptions.
