    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well thyroid gland removal with or without central lymph node
      dissection works in treating patients with thyroid cancer or suspected thyroid cancer that
      has not spread to the lymph nodes (randomized into Arms I and II). Arms I and II are compared
      to a standard of care (SOC) Arm III to enable comparison of quality of life among various
      surgical treatments. Currently, the standard treatment for thyroid cancer is total
      thyroidectomy, or complete removal of the thyroid. The lymph nodes in the central part of the
      neck may also be surgically removed, called central lymph node dissection. Prophylactic
      removal of the lymph nodes may increase the risk of life-threatening complications, and may
      reduce post-surgery quality of life. It may also prevent the cancer from returning and reduce
      the need for additional surgery. It is not yet known whether recurrence rates and
      complication levels are lower after thyroid gland removal alone or with central lymph node
      dissection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of transient and permanent hypocalcemia

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of voice and swallowing problems.

      II. To determine the degree to which quality of life (QOL) is compromised.

      III. To determine the degree to which accurate quality of life measures can be extracted from
      patient interview narratives using natural language processing techniques.

      IV. To determine clinical recurrence rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms, if ineligible into a SOC arm.

      ARM I: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy alone.

      ARM II: Patients undergo total thyroidectomy with ipsilateral prophylactic central neck
      dissection (CND).

      ARM III: Patients ineligible to be randomized into ARM I or II, Standard of Care (SOC)
      comparator receiving same follow up.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 1, 2 and 6 weeks, and 6
      and 12 months.

    <time_frame>Post-operative day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be analyzed using a mixed model 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) examining the effects of treatment group, time and factor interactions, such as radioactive iodine dose. Evaluation time periods (pre-surgery, week 2, week 6, month 6, and 1 year) will serve as between subjects factor and treatment group (prophylactic CND vs no CND) will serve as the between subjects factor. Experiment-wise error will be controlled with an appropriate adjustment to the alpha-level. Data will be transformed as necessary. Nonparametric statistics will be used when assumptions for ANOVA are not achieved.</description>

    <time_frame>Post-operative day 1 - Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of transient and permanent hypocalcemia will be determined by assessing the following:

Hypocalcemia symptoms in first 2 weeks (average episodes/day) IV. Hypocalcemia symptom severity scale (range 1-5) V. Requirement for calcium and calcitriol at Month 6 (or, if laboratory values at visit reveal calcium &lt; 8 mg/dL and PTH &lt; 15 pg/ml
