  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This
      increased risk is thought to be driven by inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction, an
      initial step in atherogenesis. Treatment with TNFalpha inhibitors (TNFi) improve endothelial
      function in patients with RA. Discontinuation of TNFi could therefore worsen endothelial
      function even in the absence of recurrence of systemic inflammation or reactivation of
      arthritis. If stopping TNFi results in worsening of endothelial function this would strongly
      suggest a higher cardiovascular risk in association with TNFi-wthdrawal

      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. This
      increased risk is thought to be driven by inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction, an
      initial step in atherogenesis. Both systemic as well as local (intra-arterial) treatment with
      anti-TNF-antibody therapy improves endothelial function in patients with vasculitis or RA as
      reflected by the vasodilator response to intra-arterially infused acetylcholine. Also other
      vascular functions that are (at least partially) endothelium-dependent such as flow-mediated
      dilation of the brachial artery and pulse wave velocity are improved when active RA patients
      are being treated with methotrexate plus TNFi, i.e. infliximab or etanercept. ( Therefore one
      may hypothesize that when TNFi therapy is stopped, endothelial function may worsen even in
      the absence of recurrence of systemic inflammation or reactivation of arthritis. Endothelial
      function tests are a marker of long-term cardiovascular mortality. If stopping TNFi results
      in worsening of endothelial function this would strongly suggest a higher cardiovascular risk
      in association with TNFi-wthdrawal. These findings would indicate an important drawback for
      stopping TNFi in RA patients.

      To date it is unclear whether the worsening of endothelial function occurs within half a year
      following the (successful) cessation of TNFi, whether this decline occurs simultaneously, or
      prior to RA exacerbation and whether this deterioration process is delayed by additional use
      of statin and/or ACEi.

      To improve cardiovascular prognosis in RA significantly it is important to increase our
      knowledge regarding these processes.
