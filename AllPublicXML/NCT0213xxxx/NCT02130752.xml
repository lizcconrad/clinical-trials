    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer as one of the most common gastrointestinal cancers, radical resection of
      primary lesions combined with dissection of regional lymph-nodes is acknowledged by surgeons
      all over the world. By the invented and adopted energy surgical instruments, surgical
      procedure is safer and easier than before. The newly surgical instruments reduce the
      post-operative mortality and morbidity combined easy procedures of surgery. As the most
      popular instruments used in the gastric surgery, ultrasonic scalpel and monopolar
      electrocautery were received lots of attention and concern. Some studies have shown some
      advantage of the two instruments, which were they can facilitate the surgical treatment and
      make the surgery safer and more effective. Although, some small retrospective sample reports
      claimed that ultrasonic scalpel brought benefit in blood loss, dissection lymph-node
      intraoperative complications and even postoperative complications. And Korea small sample
      randomized controlled trail presentation that ultrasonic scalpel can reduced blood loss and
      surgical duration. However, postoperative complications were with no statistical significance
      between the two instruments. Cost- effective analysis of the energy instruments is still
      controversial. Large sample randomized control trail with high quality is needed.

      By the reasons above, a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted by 9 hospitals from
      North to South in China aims to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes, when using
      of the ultrasonic scalpel or monopolar electrocautery in traditional open gastrectomy. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of ultrasonic scalpel compared with monopolar
      electrocautery in D2 distal gastrectomy, include, intraoperative parameters, postoperative
      complications, cost data, and post-operative quality of life.

      Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

        1. Preoperative evaluation Patients satisfied with inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
           informed to join in the clinical study and signature the inform consent.

        2. Randomization preoperative evaluation found that R0, D2 Gastrectomy can be performed,
           the case will entrance into the Randomization period. Random numbers are
           computer-generated, with the third party applications.

        3. Surgical procedures The surgical treatments is adopted the traditional open gastrectomy
           approach and adjuvant D2 lymphadenectomy. The SOP of the surgical treatments are
           according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer treatments guidelines, 2010, Version 3.

        4. Postoperative recovery Postoperative recovery period need to collect those relevant
           parameters of all the patients. All the relevant parameters had definitely definition in
           the Case Report Form of this study.

        5. Follow-up The follow-up of this study divide into two parts, the postoperative quality
           of life and tumor characteristics outcomes. The information of the postoperative quality
           of life is collected by the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire in four
           postoperative time intervals. The tumor related outcomes included long-term
           postoperative complications, recurrence type, relapse free survival (months) and the
           overall survival (months).
