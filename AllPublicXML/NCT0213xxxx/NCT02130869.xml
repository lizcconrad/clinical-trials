  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical trial investigating the addition of haploidentical natural killer
      cell infusion to autologous stem cell transplantation. This intervention will be evaluated in
      children with high-risk solid tumors for whom autologous transplantation is indicated.
      Natural killer cells from a haploidentical family member will be given after high dose
      chemotherapy and positively selected autologous stem cells. In patients with neuroblastoma,
      the anti-GD2 antibody hu14.18K322A will also be given. The effect on normal hematopoietic
      cell recovery will be evaluated and survival of children treated with this approach will be
      determined.

      The investigators expect to enroll 36 participants. Haploidentical family members (donors)
      will also be recruited to provide natural killer cells.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate day +35 ANC engraftment in autologous stem cell transplantation for high
           risk pediatric malignancies after stem cell selection and immunotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To estimate incidence of relapse, disease-free survival and overall survival.

        -  To characterize lymphocyte and hematopoietic reconstitution in these patients.

        -  To describe the characteristics of the stem cell and natural killer cell grafts.

        -  To estimate the overall survival of patients treated without stem cell manipulation or
           NK cell infusion due to off therapy criteria

    <description>Feasibility will be determined based on ANC engraftment defined as ANC ≥500/mm^3 for 3 consecutive tests performed on different days evaluated before day 35 post-transplant. If the study is considered feasible, the ANC engraftment rate will be 100% (95% Blyth-Still-Casella (BSC) CI: 76.45%-100%) without any failure, 92% (BSC 95% CI: 65.11%-99.57%) with 1 failure, and 83% (BSC 95% CI: 55%-96.95%) with 2 failures. In addition, if more than 2 (≥ 3) on-therapy patients die due to any protocol treatment-related causes during the first 12 months post-transplant across all groups (3 deaths among 36 participants), the study will be stopped. Deaths due to treatment not specified in this protocol will not be included in evaluation of this stopping rule.</description>

The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products).

      <textblock>
        The transplant recipient will be evaluated for eligibility at two time points during study
        participation. The first phase will be when the autologous stem cell product is collected.
        The recipient will later need to meet specific eligibility criterion at the time of the
        autologous stem cell infusion. The two phases and the respective criteria are described
        below.

        Inclusion criteria for autologous stem cell collection (Phase 1 - transplant recipient):

          -  Less than or equal to 21 years of age.

          -  Malignancy at high risk of treatment failure for which autologous hematopoietic stem
             cell transplantation is considered within standard practice.

          -  Does not meet donation eligibility requirements as outlined by 21 CFR 1271 and agency
             guidance.
