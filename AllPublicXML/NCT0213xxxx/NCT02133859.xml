  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing is very common in patients with chronic heart failure with
      reported prevalence rates of 50-75%. Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV) can be used to treat
      sleep apnea in these patients. This is an observational study to document changes in
      respiratory parameters in HF patients using ASV for a period of 12 months.
