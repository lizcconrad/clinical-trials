    <textblock>
      Insufficient sleep is common, affecting 20-40% of adults, and resulting from sleep disorders,
      medical conditions, work demands, stress/emotional distress, and social/domestic
      responsibilities. It produces significant social, financial and health-related costs, and it
      has increasingly become a major public health concern as population studies worldwide have
      found that reduced sleep duration is associated with increased risks of obesity, morbidity,
      and mortality. It is well established that sleep loss causes fatigue and sleepiness, as well
      as errors and accidents that are due to its adverse neurobehavioral effects on alertness,
      mood, and cognitive functions. However, there are substantial, trait-like differences among
      people in the extent to which they experience such neurobehavioral deficits when sleep
      deprived. Common genetic variations involved in sleep-wake, circadian, and cognitive
      regulation may underlie these large inter-individual differences in neurobehavioral
      vulnerability to sleep deprivation, though it remains unclear whether different types of
      sleep deprivation involve the same phenotypic responses and same genotypic contributors. This
      project will be the first large-scale investigation of markers of differential cognitive
      vulnerability to both acute total sleep loss and chronic partial sleep loss. It will identify
      individuals who are at significant risk for fatigue and severe impairments from sleep loss. A
      total of 110 healthy adults will undergo a 13-day laboratory protocol to thoroughly
      characterize their cognitive, psychological and physiological responses to two of the most
      common forms of sleep loss--acute total sleep deprivation (1 night of sleep loss) and chronic
      partial sleep deprivation (5 nights of sleep limited to 4 hr). The findings from this study
      will represent a critical first step toward tailoring appropriate follow-up interventions for
      sleep loss and its symptomatic relief by finding predictors of at-risk individuals who should
      avoid sleep loss whenever possible, and/or seek effective countermeasures. Whether or not
      markers of neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep loss are identified, the results of the
      project will help inform public policies pertaining to the need for adequate sleep and for
      countermeasures for sleep loss, and also will further our understanding and management of
      vulnerability to excessive sleepiness due to common sleep and medical disorders.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A total of N=110 adult subjects (aged 21-50 yr), N=55 females and N=55 males of all
             ethnicities, will be randomized to the 2 different experimental conditions. Subjects
             must also be comparable in terms of their homeostatic and circadian sleep-wake
             regulation parameters. In order to be eligible to participate, subjects must meet the
             following inclusion criteria:

               1. Age between 21 and 50 years (average age of our current protocols is 31 years)

               2. Body mass index (BMI) within 20.5% of normal

               3. Stable, normally-timed sleep-wake cycle as determined by interview, 2-week daily
                  sleep log, and 2-week wrist actigraphic evidence, and defined by:

               5. Habitual morning awakening between 0600h and 0930h

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. No evidence of habitual napping 2. No shift work, transmeridian travel or irregular
             sleep/wake routine in the past 60 days 3. No sleep disorder, determined by history,
             actigraph, pulse oximetry and PSG 4. No history of mania or psychosis 5. No current
             depression as determined by the Beck Depression Inventory 6. No alcohol or drug abuse
