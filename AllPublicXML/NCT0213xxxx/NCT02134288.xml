  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently looking for individuals that have received a kidney transplant, are experiencing
      delayed graft function (DGF), and meet the criteria for study participation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who undergo kidney transplantation require long term immunosuppressive therapy
      (therapy that reduces your body's ability to respond to anything foreign) to prevent damage
      to the graft, and some experience delayed graft function (DGF, a condition in which the
      transplanted kidney does not function properly) after transplantation. This study is being
      conducted to determine if kidney transplant recipients with delayed graft function (DGF) who
      are switched to the immunosuppressive regimen of belatacept with mycophenolate and steroid
      will recover from delayed graft function (DGF) in less time (which could potentially lower
      the risk of rejection associated with delayed graft function) than kidney transplant
      recipients with delayed graft function (DGF) who remain on the current standard
      immunosuppressive regimen (standard of care).
