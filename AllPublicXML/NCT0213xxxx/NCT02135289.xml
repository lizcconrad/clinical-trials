      Hong Kong is a region of intermediate TB burden, and the reactivation of latent TB in IMID
      patients treated with anti-TNF can be a serious problem. This study aims to investigate the
      role of IGRA in screening for latent TB in IBD patients and control subjects. In part II of
      the study, patients of other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) will also be
      included to investigate the role of serial interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) for the
      diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) infection in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory
      diseases (IMID) treated with biologics

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is rising in Hong Kong. Anti-tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (anti-TNF)-α is effective and increasingly being used for the treatment of
      patients with refractory disease and complicated disease behaviour. The reactivation of
      latent tuberculosis (TB) is a well-recognised complication associated with the use of
      anti-TNF therapy, and most cases occurred in endemic regions. Hong Kong is a region of
      intermediate TB burden, and the reactivation of latent TB in IMID patients treated with
      anti-TNF can be a serious problem. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence of TB,
      but it remains unclear whether monitoring during anti-TNF therapy is effective. Despite
      reported efficacy with the current screening strategy, active TB developed in up to 11.4% of
      patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. There is therefore an urgent need for better disease
      monitoring and prevention, particularly in regions where TB is endemic.

      Part I of this study aims to investigate the role of IGRA in screening for latent TB in IBD
      patients and control subjects. Part II of this study is a prospective study of serial
      interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) infection in
      patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) treated with biologics
