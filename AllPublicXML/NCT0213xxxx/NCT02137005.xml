  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate longitudinally, the walking ability of
      individuals with cerebral palsy who are transitioning into adulthood and to cross-sectionally
      examine the health status of these individuals in the context of their walking ability. Young
      adults who received instrumented gait analysis (IGA) as children will show significant
      decreases in overall gait performance, as measured by kinematics, kinetics, temporal-spatial
      parameters, and gait deviation index, compared to their last childhood IGA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a prospective, longitudinal, cross-sectional, and
      patient-centered outcome study of walking ability and current health status to investigate
      important health outcomes that impact the quality of life, participation, and activity on
      adults with cerebral palsy who took part in a gait analysis during childhood at the Center
      for Gait and Movement Analysis (CGMA). The goal is to see whether their health and walking
      ability has changed since leaving the Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) system and
      understand if there is a relationship between maintaining proper walking ability and health
      status. The investigators are including the measure of health outcomes to better understand
      if a decline in walking ability relates to a decline in health status. The first aim is to
      study the walking ability of adults with cerebral palsy by comparing their results of a gait
      analysis to the same results collected when they were children. The second aim is to study
      the presence of heart disease risk factors by testing each participant's blood levels of
      lipids, glucose, and insulin. The investigators will also measure each participant's blood
      pressure. The third aim is to study the relationship(s) between inflammatory markers,
      neurotrophic factors, and pain and fatigue levels. The investigators will measure
      inflammatory markers through a blood test and pain and fatigue levels through standardized
      assessments. The fourth aim is to study each participant's mental health. The investigators
      will measure this through standardized psychological assessments. The fifth aim is to study
      each participant's self-perceived health and quality of life as well as employment status.
      The investigators will measure these levels also through standardized assessments.
