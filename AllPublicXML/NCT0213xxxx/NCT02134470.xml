  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that chemical testing of biologic fluids is the most objective means
      of diagnosis of drug use. In recent years saliva has attracted much attention. The prime
      advantage of saliva is that it offers non-invasive, stress-free and real-time repeated
      sampling whereas blood collection is undesirable, difficult and expensive. In addition, it is
      known that androgens such as testosterone can be assayed in saliva, as these steroids pass
      the endothelial-epithelial barriers by passive diffusion. Nevertheless, the correlations of
      blood, urine and saliva concentrations are not well documented. In recent reviews, it is
      pointed out that salivary hormone analysis could be a promising method for sports medicine
      and doping control, but much work is needed before the use of saliva samples in this area
      receives the acceptance. According to recent studies the increase of testosterone
      concentration in saliva is significantly higher than alterations of steroid concentrations
      (or ratios) in blood or urine. Saliva concentration may therefore serve as screening
      parameter to select suspicious cases for further target evaluation (e.g. by IRMS). This may
      be beneficial to identify cases of transdermal administration of low steroid doses. It is
      therefore the aim of the present project to detect administered testosterone in saliva and
      compare these levels to those in blood and urine. The intention is not to detect high dosage
      but low dosage abuse of testosterone, as a single-dose by patch application. From the
      practical point of view saliva could offer a complementary specimen for a pre-screening of
      testosterone. So it could be assumed that salivary testosterone exceed upon plasma and/or
      urine levels. So the present study could be the base for a new method to preselect the
      suspicious samples for testosterone abuse.

    <description>Chemical testing of saliva is an objective method to quantify steroid hormones. Recent studies indicate that salivary testosterone is significantly higher than in other body fluids. Therefore, saliva may serve as pre-screening parameter to select suspicious cases for further target evaluation. The aim of the present project is to detect administered testosterone in saliva and compare these levels to those in blood and urine. Therefore, each participant represents its own control.</description>

    <intervention_name>Testosterone supplementation</intervention_name>
    <description>Low-dose testosterone supplementation will be facilitated by using hormone patches. For pharmacokinetic aspects circadian profiles of saliva/blood/urine will be measured under native conditions and under exogene hormone application. In addition, cross-reactivity of a standardized exercise bout and hormone application will be of further interest.</description>
