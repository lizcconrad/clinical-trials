      The purpose of this study was to determine whether L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14
      delivered via capsules to the vagina of post-menopausal women over a three day course of
      treatment can restore and maintain a lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. Exploratory analysis
      of microbial ecology, human microarrays and multiplex immunological assessments are included
      to characterize potential effects.
