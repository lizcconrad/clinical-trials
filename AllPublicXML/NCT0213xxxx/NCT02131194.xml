      To determine the efficacy of Lenstatin™, an over-the-counter nutritional supplement, in
      inhibiting the progression of nuclear cataract in eyes after pars plana vitrectomy.

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

      There are conflicting reports on the effectiveness of nutritional antioxidants in preventing
      or slowing the growth of age related cataracts, despite extensive laboratory evidence
      suggesting that oxidative damage to lens epithelial cells is a common underlying etiologic
      factor in cataractogenesis. One reported review of nine clinical trials involving over
      117,000 patients suggested that beta-carotene, Vitamin E, and Vitamin C had no effect in
      preventing or slowing the progression of age-related cataract. Conversely, a randomized trial
      of over 14,000 US male physicians indicated that long-term daily multivitamin use modestly
      and significantly decreased the risk of cataract.

      Cataract formation following pars plana vitrectomy is a well recognized post-operative
      complication of the procedure, with the reported incidence of clinically significant cataract
      development as high as 80% within 2 years after pars plana vitrectomy.

      INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT

      Lenstatin™ is a proprietary formulated nutritional supplement containing 11 micronutrients
      and anti-oxidants intended to be taken for the nutritional support of the human crystalline
      lens.

      INTERVENTION

      Participants will be randomized to treatment with Lenstatin or Placebo for (6) months
      following pars plana vitrectomy.

      STUDY METHODS

      Participants will have baseline nuclear density (cataract) measurements using the Pentacam
      Nucleus Staging (PNS) program. The Pentacam Scheimpflug imaging system is a non-contact and
      non-invasive anterior segment imaging device which has been shown to provide an immediate,
      quantitative, examiner-independent measurement of lens density which correlates with the LOCS
      III cataract grade. Serial Pentacam nuclear density measurements will be taken on each
      participant at (1) month intervals for (6) months.

    <description>The endpoint for determining the efficacy of Lenstatin in inhibiting cataract growth is a 95% confidence level of a statistically significant greater than 5% reduction in the rate of of increase in Pentacam nuclear density measurements in the Lenstatin™ treatment group compared to the placebo treatment group at 6 months postoperative pars plana vitrectomy.</description>
