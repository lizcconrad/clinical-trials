    <description>Each whole body vibration session will consist of a 20 min timed stand on the vibration platform where participants will stand with their knees in a slightly flexed position (120°) while the plate oscillates. The vibration frequency will be set at ranges between 20-40Hz and the amplitude set at 2mm displacement.</description>
