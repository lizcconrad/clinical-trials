  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial is to provide preliminary
      indicators of the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with continuous glucose
      monitoring compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose alone on: (1) metabolic control and
      (2) fear of hypoglycemia. Additional objectives will be: (1) to provide an estimate of
      recruitment rates, (2) to assess compliance with allocated treatment, and (3) to determine
      participants' satisfaction with allocated treatment.

      With increased and immediate information related to current and future (trend) glucose
      information provided by the continuous glucose monitor, children can then act upon this
      knowledge to prevent hypo- or hyperglycemia, thus, experiencing a reduction in glucose
      variability, leading to an improvement in metabolic control as shown by a reduction in HbA1c
      levels.

      Research on the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring on metabolic control in
      children with T1D using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion has been limited. Therefore,
      a pilot clinical trial will be designed to provide preliminary indicators of the feasibility
      and acceptability of continuous glucose monitoring on metabolic control and address the
      following objectives.
