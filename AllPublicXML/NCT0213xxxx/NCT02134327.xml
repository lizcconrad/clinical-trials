      Following an obtained written consent, a child presenting for ear tube surgery will be
      randomized into one of three groups for receiving a premedication. One group will be the
      current therapy with midazolam, another group will be another drug dexmedetomidine, and the
      third group will be a combination of midazolam plus dexmedetomidine. Observers in the study
      (the investigators fellow and advance practice nurse) will not know which group each patient
      belongs, and will then make three separate assessments: preoperative sedation, mask
      acceptance, and postoperative delirium.

      Mask acceptance: Induction of anesthesia, or the beginning of the process for the patient to
      fall asleep and lose consciousness, involves placing a mask over there face, specifically the
      nose and mouth. The mask is connected to their anesthesia machine via tubing, or a circuit,
      through which their anesthetic gases flow. Some children fight the mask as it can be seen as
      new and frightening. Other children, sometimes depending on how sedated they are after
      receiving a premedication, do not fear the mask on their face and do not resist induction.
      How well or easily this happens can be described as &quot;mask acceptance.&quot; Postoperative delirium
      can be seen in patients of any age or after any surgery and can be better defined as a mental
      disturbance during the recovery from general anesthesia consisting of hallucinations,
      delusions, and confusion manifested by moaning, restlessness, involuntary physical activity,
      and thrashing about in bed. It has been considered a common postanesthetic problem in
      children and adults since 1960.

      Each patient will then have a set of numbers for each scale; following conclusion of the
      study the investigators will be able see which drug each patient received and statistical
      analysis can be completed. The investigators goal is to see if there is any difference in any
      of the scales depending which medication was administered. The scales to be utilized include
      the pre-operative sedation scale, the mask acceptance scale, and the pediatric emergence
      delirium scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children presenting for ear tube surgery (bilateral myringotomy and ventilating tube
      insertion) often suffer from postoperative delirium in the recovery room. It has been
      hypothesized this may be a result or side effect of a premedication, midazolam. Midazolam is
      frequently administered to children preoperatively as a means of decreasing separation
      anxiety. An alternative medication, dexmedetomidine, is sometimes used as an alternative to
      midazolam and has also been effective in treating postoperative delirium. In this study the
      investigators would like to see if there is in fact a measurable difference between children
      receiving the standard midazolam or dexmedetomidine.

      Patients would be randomized into one of three groups (versed alone, dexmedetomidine alone,
      or a combination). Patients included would be those presenting for BMT surgery who are an ASA
      physical status 1 or 2, not falling into any exclusion criteria.

      Exclusion criteria would be patients with vital signs outside the normal limits as documented
      under the research plan. Also to be excluded are those patients with known genetic
      abnormalities predisposing to a derangement in hemodynamics or challenging airway.

      The anesthesiologists listed as team members are the ones who are involved with this study
      and would be responsible for providing a standard anesthetic (same technique with
      inhalational anesthetic agents and intraoperative pain management) so no other variability
      would need to be taken into consideration for assessment in the recovery room. The
      investigators researchers, both anesthesiologists and observers will be blinded during the
      study. The pharmacy will have a list of patients who have consented, and then will randomly
      allocate them into one of the three groups. Only for analysis will the investigators (myself
      as the PI and other members) know which patient received which drug or combination. Also, by
      having the same team members performing assessment of each of the three parameters (1. Pre-op
      sedation scale, 2. Mask acceptance score, and 3. Post operative emergence delirium scale),
      there would be good reliability. A briefing session will be performed prior to the study's
      commencement showing pictures to the reviewers so there can be an agreed upon assessment. The
      MOASS or pre-operative sedation scale as well as the mask acceptance and PAED scale have been
      utilized and validated in previous studies (10), while the mask acceptance scale has been
      successfully utilized as well (11, 12, 13). The investigators goal is to decrease variability
      by having only two members make observations.
