  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if SGI-110 can help to control MDS. The
      safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. SGI-110 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug are designed to work.

      Up to 103 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive injections of
      SGI-110 under the skin 5 days every study cycle. Each study cycle is 4-8 weeks depending on
      how you tolerate the drug and how the disease responds to it. The study staff will tell you
      how often you should receive the drug.

      You will need to stay in Houston to receive the study drug, but you may return home after you
      have finished your dose for each cycle. When you have study visits where you are not
      receiving study drug (described below), the tests performed at these visits can be performed
      by your local doctor.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every cycle, you will have a physical exam. At Cycle 1, this will not be needed
      if the screening physical exam was performed within 2 days before this visit.

      Every week during the first cycle, and then every 2-8 weeks after that, blood (about 1/2
      teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests. The study doctor will tell you how often you need
      to have these tests performed.

      At the end of Cycle 1 and/or 2, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of
      the disease. If the disease does not appear to have gotten better by the end of Cycle 2, your
      next bone marrow aspirate will depend on the results of your blood tests. These samples will
      also be used for cytogenetic testing. Cytogenetic testing looks at how changes to cell DNA
      (genetic material) may affect how the disease may react to the study drug.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for up to 24 cycles (about 2-4 years). You will no longer be able to
      receive the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if
      you are unable to follow study directions.

      Follow-up Visits:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, and then about every 2 months after that,
      you will be called by a member of the study team and asked how you are feeling. Each call
      should last about 10 minutes.

    <description>Primary endpoint is complete response (CR) in patients with higher risk MDS treated with SGI-110. CR first evaluated at the end of week 12 from the start of treatment (after 3 cycle), then repeated every 3 cycles thereafter as long as the patient continues treatment.
Complete Remission: Normalization peripheral blood and bone marrow with &lt;/= 5% bone marrow blasts, without evidence of dysplasia; a peripheral blood granulocyte count &gt;/= 1.0 x 109/L, and a platelet count &gt;/= 100 x 109/L. Hgb &gt;/= 11 g/dL, maintained for at least 4 weeks.
Complete response and overall response rates estimated along with the 95% credible intervals.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with higher risk MDS (IPSS int-2 or high; or &gt;/= 10% blasts as defined by
             WHO). - No prior intensive chemotherapy or high-dose cytarabine (&gt;/= 1 g/m2). - Prior
             biologic therapies (&lt;/= 1 cycle of prior decitabine or azacitidine), targeted
