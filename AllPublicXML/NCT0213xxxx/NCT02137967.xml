  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Formocresol (FC) is the most universally taught and most widely used pulpotomy medicament in
      the primary teeth. However, concerns have been raised over the use of FC because of its
      toxicity and potential carcinogenicity. A substitution for FC has been investigated but
      evidence is lacking to conclude which is the most appropriate technique for pulpotomies in
      primary teeth. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) has been used in root canal irrigant for more than
      80 years, and it is at present the most popular irrigant in root canal treatment. Studies
      have showed that NaOCl is biological compatible and is a very good antimicrobial solution
      without being a pulpal irritant. Recent studies using sodium hypochlorite as pulpotomy
      medicament in primary molars showed promising results. In this project, the investigators
      propose a randomized clinical trial, which will be performed in Pediatric Dentistry
      Department of the National Taiwan University Hospital, to compare the treatment outcomes
      between NaOCl and FC in human primary molars needing pulpotomy treatment. The aim of this
      sudy is to determining weather NaOCl is a suitable replacement for FC in the pulpotomy of
      human primary molar teeth. To assess this aim, 200 healthy children from 2.5 to 9 year-old,
      who have at least one primary first or second molars diagnosed to receive pulpotomy treatment
      will be recruited in this project. The involved teeth will be randomly assigned to the
      control group (dilute 20% Formocresol (DFC)) or experimental group (2.5% NaOCl). At 3, 6, 9,
      12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months post-treatment, the randomly assigned teeth will be clinically
      and radiographically evaluated by blinded independent evaluators to the treatment group. The
      differences will be statistically analyzed using chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and
      t-test, using a statistical significance at p&lt;0.05.

Criteria for clinical scoring
Asymptomatic, clinical score=1
Slight discomfort: percussion sensitivity; mobility＞1mm but＜2mm, clinical score=2
Minor discomfort :long-lasting chewing sensitivity; gingival swelling; periodontal pocket formation without exudate; mobility＞2mm but＜3mm, clinical score=3
major discomfort: Late pathological changes; spontaneous pain; periodontal pocket formation with exudate; sinus tract; mobility≧3 mm; premature tooth loss due to pathology, clinical score=4</description>

Criteria for radiographic scoring
Dentinal bridge, clinical score=1, regeneration tissue response
No change, clinical score=2, no pathological changes
Pulp canal obliteration, clinical score=3, slight pathological changes, no clinical significance
Periodontal ligament widening, clinical score=3, slight pathological changes, no clinical significance
