  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of pertuzumab (Perjeta) in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment in participants with HER2-positive
      locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage breast cancer. Each investigator will choose a
      treatment regimen (A or B) for all of their participants to follow. Treatment regimen A (for
      Cohort A) will include dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (ddAC), followed by
      paclitaxel, with pertuzumab and trastuzumab given from the start of paclitaxel. Treatment
      regimen B (for Cohort B) will include 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC),
      followed by docetaxel, with pertuzumab and trastuzumab given from the start of docetaxel.
      Participants in both cohorts will subsequently undergo surgical treatment and then resume
      pertuzumab and trastuzumab treatment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III and IV Heart Failure During the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is defined as heart failure. NYHA classifies participants' heart failure condition based on the participant's symptoms. Class III: marked limitation of the physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea. Class IV: Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases. 95 percent (%) confidence intervals (CIs) are calculated with the use of the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

    <description>Clinical response was classified as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD).

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 401 participants were enrolled, 199 in Cohort A and 202 in Cohort B. One participant in Cohort B who was human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative and was enrolled by error, was excluded. Hence, 199 participants were included in Cohort A and 201 participants in Cohort B.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Cohort A: ddAC, Paclitaxel, Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab</title>
          <description>ddAC: dose dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Participants received doxorubicin 60 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2; as an intravenous [IV] bolus over 3-5 minutes [min] or as an infusion over 15-30min) once in every 2 weeks (q2w) and cyclophosphamide 600mg/m^2 (IV bolus over 3-5min or as an infusion, in accordance with local policy) q2w, for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel 80mg/m^2 IV infusion once weekly (qw) for 12 weeks. Pertuzumab 840 milligrams (mg) loading dose IV, then 420mg IV q3w and trastuzumab 8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) loading dose, then 4mg/kg q3w were given along with paclitaxel for 4 cycles (8 cycles of chemotherapy in total prior to surgery). Following surgery, participants received further adjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab q3w (13 cycles), such that a total of 17 cycles of pertuzumab and trastuzumab therapy are given during the study.</description>

        <description>Clinical response was classified as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). CR: disappearance of all target lesions; PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter compared to Baseline. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient (20%) increase to qualify for disease progression, in addition to no new target lesions. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter observed at previous tumor assessment, or the appearance of any new lesions. 95% CIs are calculated with the use of the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
