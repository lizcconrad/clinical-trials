  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: research show that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective inreducing
      bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder's (BED) symptoms. Today, with the development
      of technology there are efforts being made for developinga treatment to these eating
      disorders threw the media, most of these attempts are based on the CBT method. The size of
      the effect that CBT given threw the internet has on BN and BED is still not entirely clear.
      Research presented today are mostly based on treatments that were given threw email or
      Skypeor an automatic self- help stage program. These researches show heterogenic results
      about the effect it had on eating disorders. In this research we aim to investigate the
      effect size that a CBT treatment threw a smartphone application that combines a clinician
      online reply and an automatic feedback in addition to astandard ones a week clinic treatment
      has on BN and BED symptoms frequency.

      Methods: Our aim is to make a research using an application that treats that offers an
      automatic and human therapist and dietitian reply threw a similar application that is suited
      for them. A selected 40 BN or sub-threshold BN or BED patients, men and women ages 18-60
      ,that will turn to the &quot;Sheba eating disorder medical center&quot; will include the research. Half
      of the participants will receive aCBT treatment threw a smartphone application along with
      astandardclinical treatment that includes ones a week session with a therapist and ones a
      week session with a dietitian and the other half will receive a standardclinic treatment
      alone. We will test the eating disorder symptoms using eating disorders questionnaires at the
      starting point, at the end of a six months treatment and six months after finishing the
      treatment.

      Importance: This research will allow testing the need and benefit that a personal and direct
      patient- therapist connection has over a standardones a week meeting connection format. In
      addition, treating with a web application in the future might have a benefit of saving time
      spent on getting to the clinic, will allow to shorten the time of the session in the clinic
      and will save cost of the face to face treatment.
