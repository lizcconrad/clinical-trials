      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether increases in the blood flow from the
      heart (the cardiac output), induced by the administration of intravenous fluids, lead to an
      increase in the blood flow to the vital organs, in patients undergoing bowel surgery.

      This study will involve 2 phases. Firstly, potential volunteers will be invited to meet the
      research fellow (medical doctor) undertaking this study, who will check their suitability to
      participate in the study and who will obtain informed consent.

      The second phase is the study itself which will take place whilst volunteers are having their
      bowel operation. They will attend theatre in the normal way, but once they have been
      anaesthetised (put to sleep), a special monitor called an oesophageal doppler probe will be
      placed into their oesophagus (food pipe) via the nose. This monitor is frequently used in
      bowel surgery to help assess how much intravenous fluid to administer to a patient by
      measuring the cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped out of the heart each minute). Using
      the cannula (drip) already inserted in the arm to allow administration of the anaesthetic, a
      special fluid, called an ultrasound contrast agent, will be injected into the drip, to allow
      a contrast enhanced ultrasound scan of the abdominal organs to be performed, to measure the
      blood flow to these organs. A small sample of blood will be taken from the earlobe to allow
      us to measure a chemical in the blood called lactate.

      After this, intravenous fluid will be administered in order to increase the amount of blood
      pumped out of the heart. Once the oesophageal doppler monitor suggests that an adequate
      amount of fluid has been given, a second ultrasound scan will be performed to measure whether
      blood flow to the abdominal organs has also increased. A further blood sample will be taken
      from your earlobe to measure any change in lactate level.

      At the completion of the operation, a third ultrasound scan will be performed and another
      sample of blood taken from the earlobe, to help assess blood flow to the organs.

      Potential participants (patients with colorectal cancer offered an operation) will be
      highlighted from the Derbyshire NHS trusts colorectal multidisciplinary team meeting. All
      patients who fulfil entry requirements will be seen by the research fellow after their
      outpatient meeting with their particular surgeon (if they agree). Information packs
      containing details of the study (information sheet and consent form) will be given and any
      questions answered. Patients will be allowed to take the packs away with them and decide
      whether they would be keen to participate. Interested patients will be consented by the
      research fellow during their subsequent pre-operative clinic appointment.

      The study will take place intra-operatively. Monitoring will be instituted as determined
      necessary by the attending anaesthetists, but as a minimum will consist of pulse oximetry,
      ECG and non-invasive blood pressure recording. Intravenous cannulae will be sited and general
      anaesthesia induced by the anaesthetist responsible for the patient, as would be normal for
      this type of surgery. Once the patient has been transferred to the operating theatre, the
      research fellow will insert an ODM probe via either the nasal or oral route and the CO and SV
      will be measured; this constitutes normal care. A sterile Phillips iU22 USS probe will be
      placed on the patient's abdomen and the research fellow will administer SonoVue contrast
      agent intravenously via the cannula already sited to facilitate anaesthesia, up to a maximum
      dose of 2.4ml. Visceral MVBF will be measured using this CEUS technique. Capillary blood
      samples will be taken from earlobe for measurement of blood lactate levels by the research
      fellow. At this stage, as would typically occur during an operation of this nature, the
      research fellow will administer intravenous colloid suspension in boluses of 3ml/kg, up to a
      maximum of 15ml/kg, until the CO has been maximised, as judged by the ODM. At this stage, the
      research fellow will perform a further CEUS of the abdominal viscera by administering Sonovue
      contrast agent (2nd dose of up to 2.4ml) and measuring MVBF with the Phillips iU22. Repeat
      samples of capillary blood will be drawn to measure the lactate level by the research fellow.
      At the end of the operation, a 3rd CEUS of the abdominal viscera, along with further SV &amp; CO
      readings, will be made.
