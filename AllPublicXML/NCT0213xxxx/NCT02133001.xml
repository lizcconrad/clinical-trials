  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 milligram
      (mg) compared with intranasal placebo along with standard care treatment, in reducing the
      symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) (an affective disorder manifested by either a
      dysphoric mood or loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities, the mood disturbance is
      prominent and relatively persistent), including the risk for suicide as assessed by the
      Investigator, in participants who will be assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.

      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind
      (neither physician nor participant knows assigned study treatment), placebo-controlled
      (participants are randomly assigned to a test treatment or to an identical-appearing
      treatment that does not contain the test drug), and multicenter (when more than one hospital
      or medical school team works on a medical research study), study of esketamine in
      participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) in participants who will be assessed to be
      at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from Baseline on the
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at 4 hours postdose on Day 1.
      The duration of study will be approximately 81 days per participant. The study consists of 3
      parts: Screening (that is, with in 1 day before study commences on Day 1) and double-blind
      Treatment (from Day 1-25) and Follow-up (from Day 26 up to Day 81). All the eligible
      participants will be provided standard care treatment and will be randomly assigned to either
      esketmaine or placebo treatment. Esketamine/placebo will be administered by intranasal route
      (delivery of medications through the nasal mucosa) two times per week for 4 weeks. Efficacy
      of the participants will be primarily evaluated through MADRS. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The MADRS measures the overall severity of depressive symptoms. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist. Items are rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms).</description>

    <description>Clinician's assessment of suicide risk will be assessed by SIBAT. The SIBAT clinical global judgment of suicide risk is derived from the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Suicidality (CGI-SS) of the Intersept Scale for Suicidal Thinking (ISST). The clinical global judgment of suicide risk summarizes clinician overall judgment of suicide risk based on information gathered from the full instrument. The SIBAT will serve as both an efficacy and safety parameter.</description>

    <description>The BSS is a participant-rated version of Beck's original, clinician-rated Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI). The BSS is a 19-item, participant-completed questionnaire to assess characteristics of depression. Each of the 19 items corresponding to a symptom of depression is summed to give a single score. There is a 3-point scale for each item ranging from 0 to 2 (0 = not present; 2 = present in the extreme). The total score ranges from 0 to 38 with higher the score indicating more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) Score at Day 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 25</time_frame>
    <description>The BHS measures the extent of negative attitudes about the future. It has particular utility as an indirect indicator of suicidal risk in depressed examinees or individuals who have made suicide attempts. It consists of 20 true-false items that examine the respondent's attitude over the past week by either endorsing a pessimistic statement or denying an optimistic statement; 9 are keyed false and 11 are keyed true. These items fall within 3 domains: (1) feelings about the future; (2) loss of motivation; and (3) future expectations. For every statement, each response is assigned a score of 0 or 1. The total BHS score is a sum of item responses and can range from 0 to 20, with a higher score representing a higher level of hopelessness. Total scores that range from 0 to 3 are considered within the normal range, scores 4 to 8 identify mild hopelessness, scores 9 to 14 identify moderate hopelessness, and scores greater than 14 identify severe hopelessness.</description>
