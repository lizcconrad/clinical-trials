      This phase II trial studies the effects, good and bad, of gamma secretase inhibitor
      PF-03084014 and to see how well it works in treating patients with acquired immune deficiency
      virus (AIDS)-associated Kaposi sarcoma. Gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may shrink
      the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the tolerance and clinical response of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) tumors to PF-03084014
      (gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014) with assessments of partial response (PR) and
      complete response (CR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of PF-03084014 on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load in
      plasma and the effect of PF-03084014 on cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ cell number.

      II. Assess the effect of PF-030840414 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
      tumors on Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latent and lytic gene expression.

      III. Assess effects of PF-03084014 on activation of Notch target genes including
      tumor-associated endothelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation markers.

      IV. Assess effects of trough PF-03084014 drug levels on clinical response and toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with PR, CR, or stable disease (SD) at the end
      of 4 courses may receive an additional 4 courses of gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.

             improvement over the past month

          -  There should be no evidence for improvement in KS in the 3 months prior to study
             entry, unless there is also evidence for progression of KS in the 4 weeks immediately
             prior to study entry

          -  Serologic documentation of HIV infection by any of the Food and Drug Administration
             (FDA)-approved tests

          -  All participants must be on antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection with CD4 count &gt;
             50/mm^3 and viral load &lt; 2,000 copies/mL; participants must be on a stable regimen for
             at least 12 weeks prior to study entry; participants may receive any FDA approved
             antiretroviral therapy except for zidovudine or boosted protease inhibitors

               -  If antiretroviral regimen contains zidovudine or strong cytochrome P450, family

                  by HIV viral load =&lt; 200/mL), then antiretroviral therapy must be adjusted to a
                  less toxic therapy not containing these antivirals and enrollment may proceed
                  without waiting 12 weeks

               -  If on antiviral therapy with zidovudine or boosted protease inhibitors, and viral

          -  Total bilirubin should be =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); if, however, the
             elevated bilirubin is felt to be secondary to atazanavir therapy, participants will be
             allowed to enroll on protocol if the total bilirubin is =&lt; 3.5 mg/dL provided that the
             direct bilirubin is normal
