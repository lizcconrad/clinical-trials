    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research study is to collect vaginal and cervical biopsies from
      healthy HIV negative participants. These samples will enable investigators to optimize
      laboratory methods and explore implementation challenges associated with the ex vivo
      challenge model. The first objective is to assess which HIV virus is best for use in the
      model. The second objective is to determine the best endpoint for the assay.

      The primary aim of this study is to collect an adequate number of cervical and vaginal
      biopsies to support the optimization of an ex vivo challenge model. This ex vivo challenge
      model has been and will continue to be used in topical microbicide clinical trials to predict
      the efficacy of candidate drugs.

      The development of surrogates to predict HIV prevention product safety and efficacy is a high
      priority. An ex vivo challenge model is one such promising surrogate. Colonic tissue exposed
      to rectally applied microbicides in vivo and then challenged with HIV in the lab showed
      significant reduction in HIV replication when compared to tissue exposed to placebo gel.
      Currently, the ex vivo challenge model for ectocervical and vaginal tissue is being developed
      at the Dezzutti lab at the Magee Womens Research Institute in Pittsburgh, PA. Questions which
      need to be addressed in order to optimize the model include which HIV virus is most
      appropriate to use to challenge the tissue, is qPCR a more appropriate endpoint and marker of
      infection, and can frozen tissue perform as well as fresh tissue in the challenge model.

      In this study, we will collect vaginal and cervical biopsies to use in the optimization of
      laboratory procedures. We will obtain the sample(s) from healthy HIV negative women. Samples
      will be collected and taken to Magee-Womens Research Institute as laboratory specimens.
      Written consent will be obtained by an investigator or co-investigator prior to the
      collection of any samples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18-45

          2. Free from abnormal vaginal discharge or other current vaginal symptoms

          3. HIV uninfected. Note: if a woman recently participated in a recent research study and
             has an HIV test result available from that study, this will suffice provided the date
             of the test is within 6 months of the enrollment visit for this trial. Otherwise, the
             potential participant should under go testing at the first study visit.

          4. Willing and able to give informed consent to take place in the study

          5. Willing to undergo a pelvic examination and genital biopsies

          6. Willing to provide contact information

          7. Agree to be sexually abstinent for two weeks beginning one week prior to the
             enrollment visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Menopausal

          2. Pregnant or within 90 days of last pregnancy

          3. Hysterectomy

          4. Use of a diaphragm, NuvaRing or spermicide for contraception

          5. Reports a course of antibiotic therapy in the 14 days prior to enrollment

          6. Known history of platelet disorder or coagulapathy.

          7. Participation in another microbicide or contraceptive study or a study involving
             cervical and/or vaginal biopsies within one month of enrollment

          8. Use of any spermicide or spermicide-lubricated condom within one week of enrollment.

          9. Use of any internal vaginal device or product with the exception of tampons within one
             week of enrollment

         10. Any other condition that in the opinion of the site investigator would preclude
             provision of informed consent, make participation in the study unsafe, complicate
             interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study
             objectives
