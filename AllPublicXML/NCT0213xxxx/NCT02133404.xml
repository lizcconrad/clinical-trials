      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, Cinacalcet hydrochloride-controlled,
      parallel-group, dose-ascending study. Subjects judged to be eligible will be registered and
      randomized into either ASP7991 group (receiving ASP7991 and cinacalcet-placebo) or Cinacalcet
      group (receiving cinacalcet and ASP7991-placebo), and will receive 12-week (84 days)
      administration of study drug from first dialysis day in a week (treatment period), in a
      double-blind manner. The dose of the study drugs will be increased every 3 weeks in
      dose-ascending manner.

      Follow-up assessment will be performed before starting first dialysis in a week, 1 week (7
      days) after the completion of the treatment period.
