  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel blockade may be promising in the
      treatment of pulmonary oedema and dyspnoea in heart failure (HF) and acute decompensated
      heart failure (ADHF) patients by re-establishing the alveolar septal barrier. Dynamic
      contrast enhanced (DCE) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an established technique for
      assessing changes in vascular permeability and interstitial water volume. The aim of this
      study is to establish the potential utility of DCE-MRI as a novel endpoint for dose ranging
      and proof of mechanism studies of TRPV4 blockers. The DCE-MRI markers of vascular
      permeability and pulmonary oedema will be measured in subjects with HF (group 2) and healthy
      volunteers (HV) (group 1) at rest to determine if there is a difference between the two
      populations. Apart from this, exercise induced changes relative to rest in interstitial
      volume and exchange rate will be evaluated in both HV and subjects with HF. Additionally, the
      capability of DCE-MRI to detect changes in interstitial lung fluid in patients with acute
      decompensated heart failure (ADHF) (group 3) will be investigated. DCE-MRI markers of
      pulmonary oedema will be assessed when patients are initially hospitalized with ADHF and
      subsequently after receiving standard of care treatment to determine whether differences can
      be detected by this methodology.This study will enrol a sufficient number of subjects to have
      at least 24 subjects in Group 1 and 2 (group 1:12 HV and group 2: 12 subjects with HF) and
      atleast 5 subjects in Group 3. For each subject, the MRI data must be of sufficient quality
      to enable DCE-MRI modelling from 2 Sessions. For group 1 and 2, the subjects will have
      screening visit and 3 MRI sessions. For the first scanning session, subjects will undergo the
      baseline procedure. The second imaging session will occur approximately one week later to
      measure within subject variability. A third imaging session (which will be conducted in 2
      visits) will incorporate a bicycle exercise challenge prior to the MRI scan, and this third
      scan will be performed approximately one to three days after the second imaging session. For
      group 3: Screening will occur during hospitalization for eligibility. Session 1of MRI will be
      conducted while the subject is still hospitalized. Session 2 will be conducted within 4 weeks
      of the first scan, when the signs of pulmonary oedema are considered to be resolved. If a
      subject's pulmonary oedema has not resolved at Session 2, then the subject will be not be
      scanned by MRI at Session 2 and will be brought back for Session 3 up to 4 weeks after
      Session 2 for their second MRI.
