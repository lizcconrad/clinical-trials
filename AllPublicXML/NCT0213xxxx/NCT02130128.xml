      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the LungPoint ATV
      System in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose highly suspicious
      lung cancer.

    <textblock>
      The LungPoint ATV System is an image-guided navigation system used to access tissue samples
      in the lungs. This feasibility study is being conducted to assess the safety and yield of the
      LungPoint ATV System in patients who are scheduled for standard bronchoscopy to diagnose
      highly suspicious lung cancer. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor
      is conducted.

    <description>The number of serious adverse events (SAEs) rated as probably or definitely related to the study device and/or procedure divided by the number of patients in whom an attempt at study device use was made. This study protocol focuses specifically on sub-chronic pneumothorax, but will also track hemoptysis.</description>

             largest dimension

          3. No known endobronchial tumor

          4. Tumor located anywhere in parenchymal tissue &gt;1 cm from pleura and accessible
             bronchoscopically through a POE.

          5. Willing to participate in all aspects of study protocol for duration of study

          6. Able to understand study requirements

          7. Signs study-related informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any contraindication to bronchoscopy, for example: (a.) Untreatable life-threatening
             arrhythmias, (b.) Inability to adequately oxygenate the patient during the procedure,
             (c.) Acute respiratory failure with hypercapnia (unless the patient is intubated and
             ventilated), (d.) Recent myocardial infarction, (e.) Previously diagnosed high-grade
             tracheal obstruction, (f.) Uncorrectable coagulopathy.

          9. Any other severe or life-threatening comorbidity that could increase the risk of
             bronchoscopic biopsy or ATV tunneling, for example: (a.) ASA class &gt; 3, (b.) &gt; stage 3
             heart failure, (c.) severe cachexia, (d.) severe respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia
