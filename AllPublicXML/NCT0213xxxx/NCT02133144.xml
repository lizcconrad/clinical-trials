      A. BACKGROUND Accumulation of fat in the liver due to non-alcoholic causes (NAFLD) is
      associated with hepatic insulin resistance, which impairs the ability of insulin to inhibit
      the production of glucose and VLDL . This leads to increases in serum glucose, insulin and
      triglyceride concentrations as well as hyperinsulinemia. Recent epidemiologic studies have
      shown that a major reason for the metabolic syndrome as well as the accompanying increased
      risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes is overconsumption of simple sugars. The
      investigators have recently shown that overeating simple sugars (1000 extra calories/day,
      &quot;CANDY&quot; diet) increases liver fat content by 30% within 3 weeks (4), and recapitulates
      features of the metabolic syndrome such as hypertriglyceridemia and a low HDL cholesterol
      concentration.

      The fatty acids in intrahepatocellular triglycerides may originate from peripheral lipolysis,
      de novo lipogenesis, uptake of chylomicron remnants by the liver and from hepatic uptake of
      fatty acids released during intravascular hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (the
      spillover pathway). A classic study using stable isotope methodology by the group of
      Elisabeth Parks showed that in subjects with NAFLD, the excess intrahepatocellular
      triglycerides originate from peripheral lipolysis and de novo lipogenesis.

      It is well-established that ingestion of a high carbohydrate as compared to high fat diet
      stimulates de novo lipogenesis in humans. Meta-analyses comparing isocaloric high fat and
      high carbohydrate diets have shown that high carbohydrate but not high fat diets increase
      increase serum triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol. Since hypertriglyceridemia results
      from overproduction of VLDL from the liver, these data suggest the composition of the diet
      influences hepatic lipid metabolism. Whether this is because overfeeding fat leads to
      preferential deposition of fat in adipose tissue while high carbohydrate diets induce a
      relative greater increase in liver fat is unknown. There are no previous studies comparing
      effects of chronic overfeeding of fat as compared to carbohydrate on liver fat or and the
      sources of intrahepatic fatty acids.

      A common polymorphism in PNPLA3 at rs738409 (adiponutrin) gene is associated with a markedly
      increase liver fat content. This finding has been replicated in at least 20 studies across
      the world. The investigators have shown that PNPLA3 is regulated by the carbohydrate response
      element binding protein 1. Mice overexpressing the human I148M PNPLA3 variant in the liver
      exhibit an increase in liver triglycerides and cholesteryl esters on a high sucrose but not
      high fat diet. These data suggest that overfeeding a high carbohydrate as compared to a high
      fat diet may increase liver fat more in subjects carrying the I148M allele than in
      non-carriers.

      B. HYPOTHESIS The investigators hypothesize that overfeeding a high fat as compared to an
      isocaloric high carbohydrate diet influences the source of intrahepatocellular triglycerides.
      During a high fat diet, relatively more of intrahepatocellular triglycerides originate from
      peripheral lipolysis and less from DNL than during a high carbohydrate diet in the face of a
      similar increase in liver fat. It is also possible given the lack of previous overfeeding
      data comparing 2 different overfeeding diets that the high fat diet induces a smaller
      increase in liver fat than a high carbohydrate diet even in the face of an identical increase
      in caloric intake because a greater fraction of ingested fat is channeled to adipose tissue
      than the liver. The investigators also hypothesize that liver fat may increase more in
      carriers than non-carriers of the I148M variant in PNPLA3 during a high carbohydrate than a
      high fat diet.

      C. SPECIFIC AIMS The investigators wish to randomize, using the method of minimization
      (considers baseline age, BMI, gender, liver fat, PNPLA3 genotype) 40 non-diabetic subjects
      with NAFLD as determined by the non-invasive score developed in our laboratory or previous
      knowledge of liver fat content based on MRS to overeat either a high carbohydrate or high fat
      diet (1000 extra calories per day) for 3 weeks. Before and after the overfeeding diets, will
      measure liver fat content by 1H-MRS and the rate of adipose tissue lipolysis using doubly
      labeled water (DDW) and [1,1,2,3,3-2H5] glycerol as described in detail below. The
      investigators also wish to characterize glucose, insulin, fatty acid and triacylglyceride
      profiles before and while on the experimental diet. An adipose tissue biopsy is taken to
      determine whether expression of genes involved in lipogenesis or lipolysis, or those involved
      in adipose tissue inflammation change in response to overfeeding, and for measurement of LPL
      activity. After overfeeding, both groups will undergo weight loss to restore normal weight as
      described in our recent study. The metabolic study is repeated after weight loss.
