      Background: Balance control relies on accurate perception of visual, somatosensory and
      vestibular cues. Sensory flow is impaired in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and little is known
      about the ability of the sensory systems to adapt after neurological lesions reducing sensory
      impairment. The aims of the present study were to verify whether:

        1. Balance rehabilitation administered in a challenging sensory conditions would improve
           stability in upright posture

        2. the improvement in a treated sensory condition would transfer to a non treated sensory
           condition.

      Methods: Fifty three persons with Multiple Sclerosis, median (min-max) Expanded Disability
      Status Scale score of 5 (2.5-6.5), participated in a Randomized Controlled Trial and were
      randomly assigned to two groups. The Experimental group received balance rehabilitation aimed
      at improving motor and sensory strategies. The Control group received rehabilitation
      treatment which did not include training of sensory strategies. Persons with Multiple
      Sclerosis were blindly assessed by means of a stabilometric platform with eyes open, eyes
      closed and dome, on both firm surface and foam. Anterior-posterior and medio-lateral sway,
      velocity of sway and the length of Center of Pressure (CoP) trajectory were calculated in the
      six sensory conditions.

    <description>Multivariate assessment. Length [mm]: length of CoP trajectory computed as sum of CoP displacement on the platform surface for each frame; Velocity: velocity of oscillations along anterior-posterior (VelAP) and medio-lateral (VelML) axes. These are computed as the first time derivative of CoP AP and ML displacement.
Sway: standard deviation of CoP time series along anterior-posterior (SwayAP) and medio-lateral (SwayML) axes;</description>

    <description>Experimental group received balance rehabilitation aimed at improving motor strategies and sensory strategies. Subjects in this group were treated to improve recovery of sensory impairment and were given exercises in the impaired sensory conditions, inhibiting the reliable sensory systems and forcing the Central Nervous System to use the impaired ones.</description>
