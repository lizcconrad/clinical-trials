          -  Age between 18 to 65 years

          -  A verified diagnosis of DM type 1 for minimum 2 years (HbA1C=7%)

          -  Stable DM treatment (Treatment is considered stable when the patient has been treated
             with basal-bolus insulin, premixed insulin or continously infused insulin with an
             insulin dose considered stable by investigator for at least 3 months prior to
             screening.)

          -  The participants must be able to read and understand Danish.

          -  Peripheral diabetic neuropathy ensured by having abnormal nerve conduction velocity

          -  BMI equal to or above 22

          -  Personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient has
             been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.

          -  Patients willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests and other trial procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (s-creatinin/eGRF) &lt; 60 ml/min/1.37m2

          -  Calcitonin &gt; 25

          -  HbA1c level &lt; 7%

          -  Patients with any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, that in the opinion
             of the investigator may increase the risk associated with trial participation or may
             interfere with the interpretation of the trial results.

          -  Patients on GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment (exenatide, liraglutide or others) or
             pramlintide or any DPP-4 inhibitor within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Other neurological and/or psychiatric disease

          -  Treatment of other endocrinological disease except hypothyreosis

          -  Malignant neoplasms requiring chemotherapy, surgery, radiation or palliative care in
             the previous 5 years.

          -  Family or personal history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or familial
             medullary thyroid carcinoma.

          -  Personal history of non-familial medullary thyroid carcinoma

          -  Known abuse or alcohol and/or medicine (Alcohol use in accordance with the
             recommendations by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority are allowed).

          -  Known allergy to liraglutide.

          -  Participation in other clinical trials less than 3 months prior to inclusion

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating, or intend to become pregnant and male
             patients who intend to father a child during course of the study.

          -  In women, a serum pregnancy test will be conducted at baseline based on h-CG in the
             blood. The investigator will have to ensure that fertile female patients use a safe
             contraception method during the study and for at least 15 hours after termination of
             the study medication period.
