  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized study the investigators aim to determine the effects of a whole-food
      plant-based vegan diet on markers of inflammation and glucometabolic profile in patients with
      cardiovascular disease. The investigators hypothesize that a whole-food plant-based vegan
      diet will reduce markers of inflammation and improve glucometabolic profile compared with the
      American Heart Association (AHA)- recommended diet at 2 months follow-up in patients with
      coronary artery disease (CAD). The investigators are also evaluating endothelial function
      using the EndoPAT device and stool microbiome.
