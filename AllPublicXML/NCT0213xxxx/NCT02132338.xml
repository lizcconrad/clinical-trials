  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this sense, from the perspective that the routine monitoring of users with type 2 diabetes
      should be performed at the primary health care, which has the structural axis the family
      health team, and that education is fundamental to the self-management of diabetes mellitus
      care, applying a evaluative research based on an educational program to check before and
      after clinical, anthropometric data and validated instruments can provide an effective means
      of control and prevention of disease.

      The purpose of randomization is to compare the effects and values of the dependent variables
      ( knowledge about diabetes mellitus, psychological attitudes, adherence to practices related
      to physical activity and diet self-care, empowerment for self-care in diabetes mellitus and
      control of clinical indicators ) in the experimental group with the group control, which are
      associated with the independent variable ( educational program). For the experimental group
      an educational systematized process, to evaluate the scope for enhancing the educational
      process with emphasis on Diabetes empowerment to provide self-care, thereby improving disease
      control will be performed. Have the control group will maintain the traditional care through
      individual consultations and information about the disease, through leaflets that could
      assist in the educational process for self-management of care. All subjects in the
      experimental group and the control group will be questioned in the pre -test and post - test
      by related instruments: (1) knowledge of the diabetes mellitus, (2) attitudes toward the
      psychological aspects, (3) self-care (medication adherence, diet and physical activity), (4)
      empowerment for self-care in diabetes mellitus and (5) clinical indicators.

    <description>The operation of the educational program for the group under intervention will consist of groups operating with the triad of diabetes mellitus (pathophysiology of the disease, physical activity and diet), to be held in five times (cycles) approach, an interval of three months being held between them . In each session, participants will be the same (under multidisciplinary team intervention), the content will also be the same, however, using different educational strategies. During the intervals between cycles these users will be monitored by phone by equity and / or nursing students of the Federal University of São João Del Rei properly trained to do so. The educational program will be developed in five times (T0, T3, T6, T9, T12) and with an interval of three months. At every moment the educational process will be conducted with three consecutive meetings with one week interval. In summary, 15 educational sessions with the experimental group will be held.</description>
