  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quetiapine, a second generation antipsychotic, is only available as oral tablets. However,
      topical and rectal formulations have been produced in compounding pharmacies. There is no
      data available suggesting that topical or rectal formulations provide serum levels similar to
      oral medication. In the clinical setting, when oral administration of quetiapine is not
      possible (for example, when a patient is extremely ill physically or mentally or both),
      clinicians and pharmacists have collaborated in such cases and have at times had to
      administer quetiapine compounded in other dosage formulations such as rectal or topical
      formulations. Despite clinical effectiveness of these other formulations, there are no
      available studies that have investigated blood levels of the drug other than the oral form.
      The investigators are therefore designing this pharmacokinetic study to evaluate the the
      systemic absorption of quetiapine in oral, rectal and topical formulations. If the
      investigators are able to demonstrate detectable levels from rectal and topical quetiapine
      formulations compared to the oral form, this knowledge will enhance clinical psychiatric
      practice by providing a more broad route of administration for quetiapine which is a commonly
      used drug for psychiatric symptoms.
