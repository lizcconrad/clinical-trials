  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      639667 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose
      proportionality as well as investigation of linearity and pharmacodynamics (PD) of BI 639667
      after single dosing and the assessment of the PK/PD relationship.

             pressure greater than 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg at
             screening

          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          4. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          5. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders
