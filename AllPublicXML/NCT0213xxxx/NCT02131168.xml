  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory disorders of the gut which cause
      major life-long disability. They affect males and females, with the commonest age of onset in
      childhood, teens and early adult life. Previously restricted almost exclusively to the West,
      these conditions are becoming much more common in Asian countries, including Hong Kong - the
      cause of this dramatic change is unknown.

      The cause of IBD is widely accepted as relating to the mucosal immune response to stimulation
      from the gut bacteria, on a background of genetic susceptibility. The bacteria and other
      organisms in the gut play a central role in the development of IBD in the West. However it is
      unknown if the gut bacteria differ between Chinese patients with IBD and non-IBD (healthy
      subjects) in Hong Kong, and whether it is affected by diet or changes in diet. A family
      history is the largest risk factor for the disease. More than 50 different genes associated
      with IBD have recently been identified in the West and preliminary data showed that Chinese
      patients have a different genetic profile to Western populations.

      This project aims to explore the true incidence of IBD in Hong Kong and factors that may be
      contributing to, or causing, the increase of IBD in Hong Kong. Investigators aim to
      investigate the number of new cases of IBD within a five year period and factors that may
      account for the cases. Investigators will also study the choice of medical therapy, quality
      of life and quality of health care in patients with IBD.

      Investigators will create the first web-based Hong Kong inception cohort database. Via the
      web registration investigators intend to form a new prospective, uniformly diagnosed,
      population-based inception cohort of patients with IBD. Physicians, gastroenterologists,
      family doctors, surgeons and pathologists in our study area will be notified repeatedly about
      the study by letter, telephone, internet, personal visit of the investigators, and encouraged
      to inform investigators of every possible new case of IBD (persistent or relapsing diarrhoea,
      blood and/or mucus in the stools for more than three weeks, or abdominal pain and weight
      loss). Endoscopic, pathology and radiology records will be canvassed repeatedly for likely
      cases, both electronically and manually. By these methods investigators intend to capture
      over 90% of possible cases. New patients will be included during a five-year period,
      01.04.2011 - 31.03.2016, followed by a five year follow-up period until 31.03.2021. All
      patients are required to meet the diagnostic criteria for IBD on the basis of clinical
      symptoms, endoscopic or radiological evidence or mucosal biopsies. Infectious
      gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, entamoeba and cancer have to be ruled out. The web-based
      Database application will be used for online registration of the various registration forms
      and questionnaires (see list of additional materials), and the database is located on a
      central secured server.
