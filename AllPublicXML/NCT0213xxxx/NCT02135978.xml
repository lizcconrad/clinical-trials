  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a shoulder exercise program can prevent the
      onset of shoulder pain and improve community participation in persons who have a spinal cord
      injury (SCI). Upon entry into the study patients will have pain-free shoulders and will be
      followed for 3 years to determine rate of shoulder pain development. Patients will learn a
      simple shoulder home exercise program and will be instructed on techniques to protect their
      shoulder during wheelchair propulsion, transfers and activities of daily living. Patients
      will be instructed to perform the home exercise program 3 days per week. Two types of
      treatment (training) delivery approaches that have been documented to reduce chronic shoulder
      pain will be compared. The rate of shoulder pain development for the two groups will be
      compared to the rate of shoulder pain development in the historical control group. The
      investigators hypothesize that the rate of shoulder pain development will be lower in the
      experimental treatment groups compared to the historical control group. Any differences
      between the two treatment delivery approaches for the experimental treatment groups will help
      to provide guidelines for the most effective delivery approach of a shoulder pain prevention
      program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All persons are at risk for shoulder pain from a shoulder injury or rotator cuff injury.
      Persons with SCI are at a greater risk because of the increased use of their shoulders.
      Lifestyle changes following SCI place a large demand on an individual's shoulders. Pushing a
      wheelchair, transferring, and performing pressure relief raises are three common activities
      that put added strain on the shoulders. In addition to these activities, reaching from a
      wheelchair can put strain on the shoulder because many environments are not ideally set up
      for wheelchair users. These new stressors are believed by the medical community to lead to
      shoulder pain. The prevalence of shoulder pain for persons with spinal cord injury is 30-70%.
      Untreated, shoulder pain may lead to additional losses in function and community mobility.

      Previous research shows that shoulder exercises along with education on how to improve one's
      technique for wheelchair propulsion, transfers, and weight relief raises can significantly
      reduce chronic shoulder pain and improve quality of life. The investigators aim to not only
      reduce existing shoulder pain, but also to prevent the onset of new pain.

      The current study will teach the same 4 simple shoulder strengthening exercises performed in
      the prior study to patients with healthy shoulders. Half of the patients will receive 2
      sessions of one-to-one training with a physical therapist, and the other half will receive 4
      sessions of training combined with an interactive education program on techniques to protect
      their shoulder in a class format led by a physical therapist and a peer mentor with a spinal
      cord injury. Patients will be followed for 3 years to learn if they develop shoulder pain.

    <description>Presence of shoulder pain will be measured using the &quot;Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index&quot;. This questionnaire uses a visual analog scale to rate level of shoulder pain during the previous week while performing 15 common daily activities such as transferring from the bed to a wheelchair or pushing a wheelchair &gt; 10 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 2-3 months over the 3 year study</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be called every 2-3 months to report the frequency and intensity of their shoulder exercise program. Patients will be asked questions about their arm use specific to their functional abilities during the previous 1 to 3 days, such as the number of transfers performed, number of depression raises performed, how often they use their arms for chores or use their arms to help with walking (if applicable). All patients with a manual wheelchair will have an odometer installed on their wheelchair and will report their distance and speed of wheelchair propulsion.</description>

    <description>Shoulder torque testing will be performed using either a Biodex machine or a handheld dynamometer for the motions of isometric shoulder abduction, adduction, flexion, extension, internal rotation and external rotation.</description>

    <description>Patients will attend four classes held each week for 4 consecutive weeks. The classes are led by a physical therapist and a peer mentor (with a spinal cord injury). Two to four research patients are in each class. Classes begin with an interactive education presentation on techniques and recommendations to protect the shoulder during transfers, wheelchair propulsion, raises and activities of daily living. This is followed by performance of the home exercise program. Patients will be called every 3 to 6 months by a peer mentor to receive encouragement, praise, and/or problem solve barriers to exercise.</description>
