  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intrathecal morphine (ITM) alone or its
      combination with peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) provides better analgesia for patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery is associated with severe pain. The success of knee
      rehabilitation following surgery depends largely on adequate pain control that permits early
      physical therapy. Postoperative modern analgesic recommendations specific to TKA propose
      either spinal block with intrathecal morphine (ITM) or a combination of general anesthesia
      with single shot femoral nerve block (SFNB). Femoral nerve block (FNB) too has proven
      analgesic advantages in TKA surgery. However, we do not know if the combination of the two
      analgesic techniques, ITM and peripheral nerve blocks (PNB), provides superior analgesia to
      ITM alone.

      Thus, this study aims to determine whether ITM alone or its combination with PNB provides
      better analgesia for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      Eligible patients undergoing unilateral TKA under spinal anesthesia consenting to a
      multimodal analgesic regimen inclusive of ITM, FNB, and SNB will be recruited. All patients
      will receive spinal with intrathecal morphine. Patients will be randomly assigned using a
      computer generated table of random numbers to receive either spinal with intrathecal morphine
      (morphine group), a combination of intrathecal morphine and femoral nerve block
      (morphine-femoral group), or a combination of intrathecal morphine and femoral nerve block as
      well as sciatic nerve block (morphine-femoral-sciatic group).
