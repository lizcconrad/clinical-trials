  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits of treating a surgical scar
      post excision with an ablative fractionated CO2 laser with the goal of decreasing the
      appearance and size of the scar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to determine, through a split scar study, that treating a
      post excision scar with a fractionated ablative CO2 laser improves both the texture and
      cosmetic appearance of the scar. An attempt will be made to determine the ideal timing for
      treating the excision scar as previous studies have ranged from treating the day of the
      excision up till 10 weeks post-excision (2-4). In order to evaluate the treated portion
      versus untreated portion of the scar, investigators and the subjects will use a quartile
      rating scale. In addition, punch biopsy samples will be taken to quantify the difference in
      collagen architecture 9 weeks after treatment with the laser.

      There will be a total of 7 study visits to include the day of the excision and laser
      treatment if randomized to this group, post-op day number 10 for suture removal as well as
      laser therapy if the subject has been randomized to that treatment group, 4 weeks post-op, 9
      weeks post-op and laser treatment for subjects randomized to this time frame for treatment,
      12 weeks post-op, 17 weeks post-op and 24 weeks post-op. Each visit will last approximately
      30-45 minutes each in which clinical photos of the surgical scar will be taken and any wound
      care or side effects of the laser therapy or surgery will be addressed. Healing and scar
      appearance will be reviewed and rated at each of the six postsurgical visits.

    <description>Biopsies of the treated and untreated portions of the scar will be examined and compared by histology. To evaluate this ultrastructure, confocal microscopy using fractional dimension and lacunarity analysis will be used. Further scar analysis will be performed by H&amp;E staining photographs captured on an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus America Inc. Center Valley, PA) equipped with MicroFire 2.2 digital camera (Optronics, Goleta, CA) using PictureFrame 2.0 software at 40X magnification. Image analysis will then be performed using NIH's shareware program, ImageJ and the Scar index will be determined.</description>

    <description>The subject will receive ablative fractional resurfacing with the Deep and Active FXTM platforms of the Lumenis Ultrapulse CO2 laser. The settings for treatment of scars on the face with the Deep platform will be 15% coverage, 15mJ at 150 Hz and 15% coverage, 12.5 mJ at 150 Hz for off the face. The Active platform settings will be 90 mJ with a density of 3 for the face and 70 mJ and a density of 2 for off the face. The DeepFXTM platform will be applied to the scar prior to the ActiveFX TM platform. Half of the excision scar will be treated with the appropriate settings and half will go untreated.</description>
