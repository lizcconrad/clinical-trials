      This study seeks to determine cerebral blood flow changes in single ventricle patients during
      staged surgical reconstruction as compared with normal children. Two general groups of single
      ventricle patients will be recruited for this study, corresponding to the two approaches
      used. An aged-match group of healthy subjects will be included as a control.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single center study designed to measure and determine
      the changes in cerebral blood flow in a cohort of single ventricle patients followed across
      all three stages of surgical (Fontan) reconstruction. In addition, cerebral blood flow
      response to hypercarbia will be determined after the first 2 operations as a measure of
      cerebral blood flow reserve and the &quot;intactness&quot; of the cerebral autoregulatory system. MRI
      data from this cohort will be compared with that collected in age-matched healthy children
      and in a cross sectional group of patients who will not necessarily be followed through all
      stages of surgery, but may undergo one or two of the MRI evaluations depending on their stage
      of surgery. Neurological exams and EEGs will be performed. Medical history, cardiac
      catheterization data, where available, will also be collected. Factors such as
      cardiopulmonary bypass time and socioeconomic class will be controlled for.

    <description>Subjects will be single ventricle patients who will be prospectively recruited when they are at the first stage of Fontan reconstruction; they will be followed throughout all 3 stages with cerebral blood flow measurements and brain MRIs.
Additional single ventricle patients who will not participate in the study for all 3 stages but who may participate for one of two. For example, patients who completed their Stage I and hemi Fontan/bidirectional Glenn operations before this study began will be recruited before Fontan stage completion. Also, patients whose Stage I and hemi Fontan/bidirectional Glenn surgeries will be completed during the study, but who will not complete all 3 surgical stages before this project ends. Cerebral blood flow measurements and brain MRIs will be completed after each surgical stage which occurs during study participation.</description>

    <description>Children likely to have a normal brain MRI will be asked to participate. After the brain MRI is obtained as part of routine clinical care, and a normal brain scan is confirmed, measurement of cerebral blood flow using velocity mapping in the jugular veins and the aorta will be performed. This will add approximately 10 minutes to the scan but no extra sedation medications will be administered to obtain this data.</description>

        Single ventricle patients will be recruited from the cohort of patients treated and/or
        followed at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in the cardiology program and
        surrounding hospitals/institutions. In specific, patients will be approached to participate
        in the study during clinic visits or visits to the hospital for other reasons. Children for
        the normal control group will be recruited from children who are undergoing clinical MRIs
        at CHOP. A full understanding of all study related procedures and processes will be
        explained to the subject, including all MRI scans, how the MRI scanner works and how the
        proposed research will help medical practice. Children likely to have a normal brain MRI
        will be asked to participate and sign an informed consent form.

        Inclusion Criteria - Single Ventricle Subjects:

          -  Males or females up to age 10 years.

          -  Any complex congenital heart lesion that has single ventricle physiology. These single
             ventricle lesions will be of either right or left ventricular morphology.

             deep sedation. Patients will undergo determination of their physical ability to
             undergo the MRI prior to being enrolled in the study by parameters such as blood
             pressure, heart rate, cardiac rhythm, and respiratory rate. MRI involves laying still

             scan is performed for headache) at the time of the scan.

          -  Ability to undergo an MRI scan of at least 60-90 minutes under general anesthesia or
             deep sedation. Normal patients will undergo determination of their physical ability to
             undergo the MRI prior to being enrolled in the study by parameters such as blood
             pressure, heart rate, cardiac rhythm, and respiratory rate. MRI involves laying still
             in the supine position for at least 60-90 minutes.

          -  Parents signing informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria - Single Ventricle Patients :

             detrimental to the patient.

          -  Stenosis of the branch pulmonary arteries or coarctation of the aorta.

          -  Any significant arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia, trigeminy, etc.

             is permitted.

          -  Systemic hypertension.

          -  Primary lung disease (eg bronchopulmonary dysplasia).

          -  Any known significant neurological disease outside of the usual state of single

          -  Parents/guardians or subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be
             non-compliant with study schedules or procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria - Normal Control Group:
