  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sulfatinib (HMPL-012) is a novel oral small molecule that selectively inhibits vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3 and inhibits FGFR kinase activity has
      demonstrated potent inhibitory effects on multiple human tumor xenografts. This
      first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      dose for phase II ,to evaluate the pharmacokinetics , safety and preliminary anti-tumor
      activity of HMPL-012 at single doses and multiple doses .

      This will be an open-label, phase I study. This study will evaluate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of HMPL-012 after a single administration followed by a 28-Day continuous
      course of therapy; evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy in an open-label
      administration of at the MTD. All subjects of this study will be permitted to continue
      therapy with only safety monitoring and monthly assessments for progression, if the product
      is well tolerated and the subject has stable disease or better

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability during dose escalating</measure>
    <time_frame>1-28days after every drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety during the first 28-day cycle 1 of therapy following the initiation of multiple dosing of HMPL-012. The safety variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including serum chemistry, hematology , and urinalysis (with detailed sediment analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for protein), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) in triplicate</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To measure the plasma concentration of HMPL-012 in single and repeated doses</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1-3 Single Dose and Day 1-56 Steady State</time_frame>
    <description>In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles of HMPL-012 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of HMPL-012 on Day 1 to Day 3. At multiple-dose, PK sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 1,4,8,12 hour time points on days 1,14,28 of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 2, 3, 7, 15 and 29 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy and pre-dose on days 56 of the cycle 2.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>every 4 weeks until 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-tumoral efficacy will be assessed by best radiographic response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.0) at baseline (Day -14 to -1) and at the end of two 28-Day cycles of therapy . For patients that continue on repeat 28-Day cycles after the primary evaluation period, progression will be assessed after each two 28-Day cycles of therapy.</description>
