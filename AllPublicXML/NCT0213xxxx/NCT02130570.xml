  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to design and implement a set of procedures (the intervention)
      to improve patients' experiences when they are discharged home from the hospital. Second,
      this study aims to look at how the intervention affects problems that are known to occur
      after discharge, including medication issues, worsening medical problems, or readmission to
      the hospital. The investigators will study how well patients recover the ability to do the
      things they could before they were admitted to the hospital and their opinions of the
      discharge process. Lastly, this study will look to understand the best way to implement the
      intervention into different hospitals and practices, and which types of patients benefit from
      it most.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To develop, implement, and refine a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary transitions
           intervention with contributions from hospital and Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH)
           personnel.

           Hypothesis: a collaborative transitions intervention can be designed and implemented
           within an ACO that reliably provides the components of an ideal transition in care.

        2. To evaluate the effects of this intervention on post-discharge adverse events,
           functional status, patient engagement, and emergency department and hospital utilization
           within 30 days of discharge.

           Hypothesis: compared with usual care, a collaborative transitions intervention will
           decrease post discharge adverse events, improve post-discharge functional status,
           increase patient engagement, and reduce emergency department and hospital utilization in
           the post-discharge period.

        3. To understand barriers to and facilitators of successful implementation of this
           intervention across practices.

      Hypothesis: several barriers to and facilitators of implementation can be identified and used
      to create lessons learned for other health systems to successfully implement this type of
      intervention.

    <description>During the inpatient enrollment period, patients will complete a modified Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-12 (SF-12) regarding functional status and health-related quality of life one month prior to admission. 30 days after discharge, SF12 questions will be repeated so that functional status can be compared to prior to admission.</description>

    <description>During the 30 day post-discharge follow-up phone call we will ask patients about their participation in, understanding of, and ability to carry out the post-discharge plan. These questions will include questions from the Interpersonal Processes of Care survey, and several additional questions from the HOMERUN study of readmitted patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects will be adult patients admitted to medical and surgical services at BWH
        and MGH, likely to be discharged back to the community, and whose PCP belongs to one of the
        Partners Community Healthcare, Inc. (PCHI) primary care practices that has met &quot;Primed&quot;
        criteria for being a PCMH, admits at least 2 patients to BWH or MGH, and has agreed to
        participate. Primed criteria are a standard set of requirements that cover 6 essential
        building blocks of PCMH practices: electronic health record, patient portal, team-based
        care, practice redesign, care management, and identification of high-risk patients. We
        estimate that of the approximately 300 PCHI adult primary care practices, 150 of them will
        meet PCMH criteria during the study and that 20 of them will qualify and be willing to
        participate in the study. We estimate that 12,000 such patients will be admitted to BWH and
        MGH over the 18-month study period, of which we will enroll 1700 patients. These patients
        are broadly representative of hospitalized patients and include several vulnerable
        populations, including the elderly (33% 65 or older), patients with multiple chronic
        conditions (47% with Elixhauser comorbidity score 5 or more), and racial and ethnic
        minorities (14% African American, 13% Latino).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Likely discharge to a location other than home (or to a caregiver's home)

          2. Police custody

          3. No telephone or homeless

          4. Previous enrolment in the study

          5. Patient unable to communicate in either English or Spanish
