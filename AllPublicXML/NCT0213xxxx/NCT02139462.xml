    <textblock>
      This study will use a data base of archived therapy sessions of family therapy for adolescent
      anorexia nervosa to determine the role of fidelity to treatment and outcome. In addition, it
      will develop a novel, more efficient way to train therapists in family therapy for adolescent
      anorexia nervosa and examine if it is feasible to conduct a trial comparing this novel
      training to standard, more intensive training.
