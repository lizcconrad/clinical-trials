  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with endometrial cancer who have planned robotic laparoscopic hysterectomy and full
      bilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy will receive injections of a fluorescent
      dye, Indocyanine green (ICG). ICG spreads through the lymphatic system, and will be
      visualized using near-infrared (NIR) imagers. Upon visualization of the path of the ICG,
      sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), the first nodes to receive drainage from the primary tumor, will
      be identified. SLNs will be surgically removed and provided to Pathology for evaluation.
      Non-sentinel nodes will also be surgically removed, as is consistent with routine medical
      care for these patients, and given to Pathology for evaluation. A positive SLN may be the
      most accurate identifier of the extra-uterine spread of disease, and will provide information
      about the extent of surgical node removal necessary.
