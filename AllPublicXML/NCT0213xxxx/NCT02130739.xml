    <textblock>
      This study prospectively evaluates the incidence of Horner's syndrome after thoracic epidural
      anesthesia following continuous thoracic epidural analgesia for mastectomy. The incidence was
      1.36% and the mechanism of Horner's syndrome was cephalic spread of the local anesthetic.

    <textblock>
      Transient Horner's syndrome has been recognized rare complication of epidural anesthesia and
      the incidence is not exactly well-known in thoracic epidural anesthesia. Therefore, this
      study prospectively evaluates the incidence of Horner's syndrome after thoracic epidural
      anesthesia following continuous thoracic epidural analgesia for mastectomy.

      Six hundred thirty three Patients, who scheduled for mastectomy with/without breast
      reconstruction, were eligible for this prospective observational study from September 2010 to
      December 2013. Thoracic epidural anesthesia performed using 0.375% or 0.5% ropivacaine 15mL
      followed by sedation consisting of propofol without muscle relaxation. After the operation,
      thoracic epidural analgesia continued; supplemented by a continuous epidural infusion of
      ropivacaine 0.15%, 2 ml/h with fentanyl 8mcg/h. At 1 hour, 2hour, 1 day, 2 day and 3 day
      after the operation, postoperative surveillance consisted of the occurrence of symptoms of
      Horner's syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and hyperemia) were performed by anesthesiologists.
