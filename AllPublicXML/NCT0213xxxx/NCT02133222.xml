  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapies that target specific molecules markedly inhibit cancer growth in several
      malignancies, and provide valuable strategies for the treatment of advanced melanoma. In
      recent years, BRAF and KIT have become established therapeutic targets in melanoma patients
      showing activating mutations in these oncogenes. However, it is crucial that genetic
      mutations present in the melanoma lesions are identified if the investigators are to design
      tailormade therapies for individual patients. The tumour genotypes that determine the
      selection of molecular-targeted therapies are usually identified in primary tumours; however,
      primary tumours are not always representative of metastases. Circulating free DNA may be a
      source of valuable information because it can be obtained via routine blood sampling, it
      provides real-time information about a patient's current disease state, and it allows
      monitoring and molecular characterization before and after chemotherapy. The aim of the study
      is to determine the mutational status in circulating DNA in melanoma metastatic patients,
      with the Sequenom Mass Array, a next generation sequencing technology. Results obtained
      before and after treatment will be compared with the primary tumor genotype.
