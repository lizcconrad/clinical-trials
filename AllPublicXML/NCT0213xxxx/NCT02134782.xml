      Fatigue is a major problem in children, adolescents and adults receiving intensive
      chemotherapy for cancer and in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT). Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest that all patients,
      including children as young as 5 years of age, should be routinely screened for fatigue at
      the initial visit and at regular intervals throughout and following anti-cancer treatment.
      These guidelines also suggest that fatigue should be managed according to clinical practice
      guidelines. However, evidence demonstrating effective interventions for fatigue in children
      with cancer is scarce. Exercise is an effective intervention for cancer-related fatigue in
      patients of all ages. However, patients receiving the most intensive treatments may be too
      ill to participate in a standardized exercise program. A unique and potentially effective
      intervention that combines exercise and relaxation is yoga. This randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) will determine whether a 3 week program of individualized yoga is associated with less
      fatigue, better quality of life (QoL) and less systemic opioid use compared to the control
      program of an Apple tablet (iPad) games, music, movies or books. This is a single-site,
      parallel-group, randomized trial of individualized yoga for fatigue. Subjects are inpatients
      8-18 years of age receiving intensive chemotherapy for cancer or undergoing HSCT who are
      expected to remain in hospital for 3 weeks. Participants will be randomized to the
      individualized yoga program or to the iPad activity control program. For those who remain
      hospitalized on day 21, the alternate intervention will be offered for 1 week and the
      preferred strategy will be determined. Yoga has the potential to significantly reduce
      fatigue, a prevalent and distressing symptom, in children with cancer and HSCT. The
      investigators have assembled the optimal team with the expertise and track record to
      accomplish this important trial. This trial is an incremental and critically important step
      in a program of research designed to improve health for children at the highest risk for poor
      quality of life. Results may have broad applicability to other hospitalized pediatric
      populations and has the potential to change in-hospital care for these patients.

      Background: Fatigue or tiredness is a major problem in children, adolescents and adults
      receiving intensive chemotherapy for cancer and in those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT). While exercise is good for reducing fatigue, these patients are often
      too sick to participate in regular exercise sessions. A unique, potentially effective type of
      exercise is individualized yoga. Yoga is particularly good since it can be tailored to be
      more or less intensive depending on how the child is feeling. The investigators have
      previously performed a feasibility study of yoga in children admitted to the hospital
      receiving very intensive chemotherapy or HSCT and found that our program of yoga is doable.
      The investigators also found children and their parents like the program.

      Preliminary Data: The investigators' team completed a feasibility study of yoga in 11
      children with cancer or HSCT recipients meeting similar eligibility criteria as the proposed
      study. In short, these results demonstrated the feasibility of individualized yoga and
      suggested several design changes to enhance compliance with outcome ascertainment. The
      investigators found that the mean ± standard deviation for the baseline and day 21
      proxy-report PedsQL MFS general fatigue scores were 46.4±26.8 and 55.6±15.5. These scores are
      much lower compared to fatigue scores observed in two studies of healthy children in which
      scores of 88.8±12.3 and 89.3±13.3 were described. This data suggest that fatigue is expected
      to be very severe in our patient population.

      Objectives: Primary: To determine if a 3 week program of individualized yoga for hospitalized
      children receiving intensive chemotherapy is associated with lower general fatigue or
      tiredness compared to the control intervention of iPad games, music, movies or books.
      Secondary: To determine if a 3 week program of yoga is associated with better quality of life
      and less pain medication use when compared to an iPad activity control program.

      Methods: This is a single-site, randomized trial of individualized yoga for fatigue.
      Participants are children 8-18 years of age receiving intensive chemotherapy for cancer or
      undergoing HSCT who are expected to remain in hospital for 3 weeks. Participants will be
      randomized to individualized yoga or to the iPad activity control program. The intervention
      is an individualized yoga program in which intensity level may change with each session. The
      control program consists of visits in which games, music, movies or books on a study-supplied
      iPad will be offered. Yoga sessions will be conducted once a day during the regular work week
      and will be led by a trained yoga teacher. In the control arm, the yoga teacher will visit
      once a day and will offer children games, music, movies or books on an iPad. Fatigue and
      quality of life will be measured by the parent at baseline, on day 10 and on day 21. For
      subjects who remain hospitalized on day 21, they will be offered the alternate arm for one
      week to promote retention.

      The investigators intend to record 10% of yoga sessions using the iPad to ensure quality
      control and monitoring of sessions. Recorded files will be downloaded to a secure File
      Transfer Protocol (FTP) site. Any deviations from the protocol will result in feedback to the
      site within 1 week of the session and ideally, within 2 days. The research team will also
      routinely audit the data submitted to ensure completeness of the data submissions.

      The investigators plan to enroll 210 subjects at 1 centre in Canada over 4 years.

      Significance: Yoga has the potential to significantly reduce fatigue, a prevalent and
      distressing symptom, in children with cancer and HSCT. The investigators have assembled the
      optimal team with the expertise and track record to accomplish this important trial. This
      trial is an incremental and critically important step in a program of research designed to
      improve health for children at highest risk for poor quality of life. Results may have broad
      applicability to other hospitalized pediatric populations and has the potential to change
      in-hospital care for these patients.

    <description>Yoga will be administered individually by a trained yoga instructor, and offered daily for 21 days (excluding weekends and holidays). There will be a common structure for all sessions that will include relaxation and breathing exercises. Additional poses focused on strength, flexibility, and balance will be incorporated at low, moderate or high intensity levels based upon the wishes and abilities of the child and parent and the judgment of the yoga instructor. The target intensity will be documented and may change with each yoga session. Each yoga session will vary in duration between 15 and 45 minutes. Modifications will be made to accommodate devices such as central venous lines, particularly if accessed. For children who are in isolation, the research team will follow hospital policies and procedures.</description>

    <description>For those randomized to the control group, visits by the same yoga instructors will occur at the same schedule as the yoga intervention. Contact will be offered daily excluding weekends and holidays, for 21 days. The yoga instructor will offer games, music, movies or books on a study-supplied iPad, which will be loaned to the child for 3 weeks. The instructor will offer to interact with the child (for example, read to, or play games with the child) for a maximum of 45 minutes (the maximum length of yoga sessions). This approach will allow us to control for contact frequency and the individual providing contact, and consequently, to better measure the independent effect of yoga. These children will not receive yoga during the 3 week iPad activity period; instructors will receive specific training to ensure that no yoga occurs during this time frame. Use of child or hospital supplied iPad activities will be permitted instead of the study-supplied iPad activities.</description>
