    <textblock>
      The NUsurface® Meniscus Implant Randomized Study is a multi-center, prospective randomized,
      interventional clinical trial to test the hypothesis that the NUsurface implant is superior
      to the non-surgical standard of care in treating the target population.The rationale for
      performing this clinical study is to gather clinical data to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the NUsurface device compared to the Standard of Care.

      The NUsurface® Meniscus Implant is intended for use in patients with medial compartment pain
      that have had a previous partial medial meniscectomy.

      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned by balanced randomization
      into one of two groups: the Meniscus Implants versus non-surgical standard of care. The KOOS
      (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and IKDC (International Knee Documentation
      Committee) forms will be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the patients'
      pre-intervention and post-intervention condition including activity levels, pain, swelling,
      locking, stability, support, sports activity, and quality of life assessment.

    <description>The NUsurface Meniscus Implant is a Polycarbonate-Urethane (PCU)-based device reinforced with high tensile Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibers. The product is available in different sizes, left and right, and with trials so as to allow the surgeon several size options for implantation. The NUsurface® Meniscus Implant, is designed to be conceptually analogous to the natural meniscus whose structural characteristics include a highly orientated collagen fiber network supports the large hoop stresses to produce better distribution of contact pressures within the knee joint. Restoring the distribution of joint loads post-meniscectomy is thought to reducing joint overload and to reducing pain.</description>
