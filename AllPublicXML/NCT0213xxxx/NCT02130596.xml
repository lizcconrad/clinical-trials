  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity occurs at 2-3 times the general population rate in persons living with a psychotic
      illness. The risk of obesity-related serious medical conditions like diabetes and heart
      disease are also two to three times higher in this population. Traditional behavioral weight
      management approaches help more than half of these individuals to lose weight, but a
      significant proportion are not helped. This pilot study is intended to determine the
      feasibility, efficacy, acceptability, and potential clinical utility of an intervention that
      integrates mindfulness, acceptance, distress tolerance, and motivation and commitment
      combined with traditional behavioral strategies for weight loss. This is the first study to
      investigate such an acceptance-based behavioral intervention for weight loss in psychotic
      illness. The results from this study will help to determine whether future research in this
      area is warranted with a larger sample, over a longer period of time.

      Primary hypothesis: Weight loss will be greater in individuals who receive the acceptance
      based behavioral intervention, relative to those who receive nutritional counseling.
