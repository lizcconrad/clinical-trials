  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe traumatic brain injury is associated with life-threatening and incapacitating
      secondary injury.

      Contemporary therapeutic interventions are aimed at preventing and treating secondary damage.
      In this context, improved cerebral metabolism is an important target in modern neurointensive
      care.

      The main hypothesis is that continuous intravenous infusion of glutamyl-alanyl dipeptide
      restores disturbed brain metabolism following severe traumatic brain injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from severe traumatic brain injury and requiring multimodal
      neuromonitoring during pharmacological coma will receive alanyl-glutamine dipeptide
      (Dipeptiven) as part of standard clinical nutrition.

      In two groups of patients the influence of different duration of infusion (group 1: 24 hours;
      group 2: 5 days) will be investigated. For this, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      parameters in plasma and brain are determined.

      Increased plasma glutamine and alanine in arterial and jugular venous plasma and in cerebral
      microdialysates are to reflect efficacy of Dipeptiven infusion.

      Plasma glutamate levels as well as changes in cerebral glutamate, lactate, lactate/pyruvate
      ratio, intracranial pressure, bispectral index electroencephalography will be measured to
      exclude potential adverse effects
