    <measure>Change in Quality of caregiver-child interactions from baseline at 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>We are using the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Teaching Scales to assess quality of caregiver-child interactions. Caregivers select an activity that their child cannot perform, such as drawing, and spend up to 5 minutes teaching this activity to the child. The interaction is video-recorded and coded for the caregiver's sensitivity to cues, response to distress, and fostering of social, emotional, and cognitive growth, as well as for the child's clarity of cues and responsiveness to the caregiver.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver helplessness from baseline at 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver helplessness is measured by the Caregiving Helplessness Questionnaire, comprising 45 items specific to interactions with the child. We evaluate 2 subscales for this study: Mother-Child Frightened and Mother Helplessness (&quot;mother&quot; is changed to &quot;caregiver&quot;)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver stress from baseline at 3 months and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver stress is measured by the Parenting Stress Index/Short Form, a 36-item questionnaire with 3 subscales: caregiver distress, caregiver-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of delivering the Promoting First Relationship (PFR) program. PFR comprises 10 sessions and lasts approximately 12 weeks. Each session begins with a brief discussion and education on the target topic for that week . Then 20 minutes is spent on video recording a structured interaction between the caregiver and child or viewing the previous session's recording and engaging in reflective discussion about successful caregiving strategies and child's response to caregiver behavior (alternating weeks). Trained PFR specialists who are community members use the 5 &quot;consultation strategies,&quot; labeled Joining, Positive Feedback, Instructive Feedback, Reflective Questions and Comments, and Instruction with Handouts.</description>

    <description>The Resource &amp; Referral program consists of 1) an initial needs assessment to determine if the enrolled family has any unmet needs (housing, financial, health, mental health, etcâ€¦), 2) a tailored resource and referral packet will be mailed to the participant with the most important referrals marked, 3) a follow-up call will be made two weeks after mailing the packet to verify that the participant has received it, and 4) a second follow-up call will be made three months after the initial session, to assess types of services actually received, barriers to receiving services, and reassessing resources needed and providing additional referrals if needed.</description>
