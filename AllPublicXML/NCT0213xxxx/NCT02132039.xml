  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the efficacy of a home-based structured exercise programme (12-step
      sitting Tai Chi) involving both persons with dementia and their caregivers with a standard
      non-exercise social contact control in treating depression among caregivers. The effects of
      exercise on their cognition, quality of life and balance ability are also assessed. We will
      also examine if BDNF polymorphisms modulate mood changes in response to exercise
      intervention. Focus groups will be organised at the end to find out the facilitators and
      barriers in taking up exercise. The findings may offer an avenue of intervention by providing
      a low cost, relatively safe and effective treatment for dementia caregivers, which may in
      turn benefit the persons with dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-blind randomised controlled trial for two years. We will
      compare the efficacy of a home-based structured exercise programme (12-step sitting Tai Chi)
      for both carers and care recipients with a standard non-exercise social contact control in
      the treatment of depression among caregivers of persons with dementia. The study hypotheses
      include:

        1. The structured home-based exercise programme will reduce caregiver depression. (Primary
           outcome)

        2. The home-based exercise will improve caregivers' cognitive performance, quality of life
           and balance ability at the end of the study. (Secondary outcome)

        3. The home-based exercise will improve the cognitive performance, quality of life and
           balance ability of persons with dementia at the end of the study. (Secondary outcome)

        4. We also hypothesise that BDNF gene modulates mood changes in response to exercise
           intervention. (Secondary outcome)

    <description>The proportion of participants who are classified as responders by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17). HAM-D-17 is a widely used and reliable measure of depressive symptoms. The scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater depression severity. Response to intervention is defined as a reduction of HAM-D-17 total score by ≥50% from baseline to endpoint.</description>
