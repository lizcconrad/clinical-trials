      In this study, the investigators introduce a surgical procedure called &quot;IOL-shell technique&quot;
      in the purpose of reduce complications of surgeries for dense cataract, and report a
      prospective randomized controlled study aiming at assessing efficacy and safety of the
      IOL-shell technique, which showed that the new procedure offered a safer way for hard
      cataract surgery over the conventional phacoemulsification procedure without compromise in
      efficacy.

    <textblock>
      A Prospective, randomized controlled study of 80 eyes with dense nucleus were enrolled.
      Patients were assigned to two groups: Group I: IOL was traditionally implanted after all
      nuclear fragments were completely removed, while in Group II, IOL was innovatively implanted
      in the bag before last residual nuclear fragment was removed. This novel adjusted surgical
      procedure, featured by using IOL as a protective barrier (named &quot;IOL-shell technique&quot;), not
      just as a refractive alternative, was conceptual different from the traditional step-by-step
      procedure. Clinical examinations including uncorrected visual acuity, central corneal
      thickness (CCT), temporal clear corneal thickness and the corneal endothelial cell density
      were carried out.

    <description>In this group, before the emulsification of the last nuclear fragment, cohesive viscoelastic material was injected below the nuclear fragment and a foldable IOL was implanted into the well inflated capsular bag posterior to the nuclear fragment. The remaining last piece of nuclear fragment was then emulsified and removed within the capsular bag.</description>

    <description>In this group, a Sensar IOL (AMO Laboratories) was implanted in the capsular bag with the injector system after the lens material was completely removed. The nuclear fragmentation was performed using the Phaco-chop technique, which was then followed by ultrasound emulsification of the nuclear fragments piece by piece. Due to lack of cortical shell within the capsular bag, special care was taken to carry out the emulsification of the last nuclear fragment at a relatively more anterior anatomical position between the iris plan and the anterior chamber.</description>

    <description>Phacoemulsification was performed with the same device and handpieces, using the same phaco chop technique as in the conventional procedure group. What was different was that before the emulsification of the last nuclear fragment, cohesive viscoelastic material was injected below the nuclear fragment and a foldable IOL was implanted into the well inflated capsular bag posterior to the nuclear fragment. The remaining last piece of nuclear fragment was then emulsified and removed within the capsular bag.</description>
