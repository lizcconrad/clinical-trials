      This randomized phase III trial compares topical or ablative treatment with active monitoring
      in preventing anal cancer in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and high-grade
      squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). Anal HSIL is tissue in the anal canal that has been
      damaged by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and is at risk for turning into anal
      cancer. It is not yet known if treating HSIL is more effective than active monitoring in
      preventing patients from developing anal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effectiveness of treating anal HSIL to reduce the incidence of anal
      cancer in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men and women.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety of infrared coagulation, electrocautery, imiquimod, 85% trichloroacetic
      acid and 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil) treatments for anal HSIL.

      II. Compare quality of life measures between arms.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the human papilloma virus (HPV) type in cancer and compare to that of overlying
      HSIL and HSIL biopsies collected concurrently that did not progress to cancer.

      II. Determine the strain variant of HPV 16 in participants who progressed to anal cancer and
      compare to participants with HSIL biopsies who did not progress to cancer.

      III. Determine the HPV integration site in overlying anal cancer to that of HSIL overlying
      the cancer and HSIL biopsies collected concurrently that did not progress to cancer.

      IV. Perform gene expression array analysis comparing expression in anal cancer with HSIL
      overlying the cancer; perform gene expression array analysis comparing expression in HSIL
      biopsies that progressed to cancer with non-progressing HSIL biopsies at other locations;
      perform similar analyses comparing expression in HSIL biopsies that progressed to cancer with
      the same lesion at earlier time points prior to progression.

      V. Characterize genetic changes in anal cancers compared with HSIL overlying the cancer;
      characterize genetic changes in HSIL biopsies that progressed to cancer compared with
      non-progressing HSIL biopsies at other locations; characterize genetic changes HSIL biopsies
      that progressed to cancer with the same lesion at earlier time points prior to progression.

      VI. Identify host and viral biomarkers of progression from HSIL to cancer. VII. Evaluate
      medical history and behavioral risk factors for HSIL progression to cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients are directed to receive either topical or ablative treatment at the
      discretion of the clinician. Patients receiving topical treatment apply imiquimod
      intra-anally, peri-anally or both thrice weekly for up to 16 weeks, fluorouracil twice daily
      for 5 days every 2 weeks for up to 16 weeks, or trichloroacetic acid every 3 weeks up to 12
      weeks. Patients receiving ablative treatment using infrared coagulation,
      hyfrecation/electrocautery, or laser. Patients may undergo excision under anesthesia if the
      clinician believes none of the other treatment approaches will be effective. The number and
      timing of such treatments will be at the discretion of the investigator. Patients with
      persistent HSIL should continue a protocol-approved treatment or a new protocol treatment
      should be considered.

      ARM II: Patients undergo active monitoring with examinations every 6 months. Every 12 months,
      patients undergo biopsies of visible lesions. Patients have cytology performed at every
      visit.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.

    <description>The log-rank test will be used to compare the treatment and control arms with respect to time to detection of anal cancer. For each arm, the hazard rate and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated. The proportional hazards model will be used to assess the association of study site, lesion size, lesion location, nadir CD4 level and gender with time to detection of anal cancer.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events for each treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Summarized by type of adverse event and severity grade for each of the treatments. For adverse events that occur in more than 5% of any of the treatments, the Poisson rates will be used to estimate the number of adverse events per unit time and the binomial proportion and its 95% confidence interval will be used to estimate the proportion of participants who reported the event.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used for subscales and scores for each arm and each time point. General estimating equations will be used to compare the two arms with respect to subscales and scores across time points and adjustment for intra-participant variability.</description>

    <measure>Viral factors in HSIL progression to cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the integration locus of HPV In the invasive cancers and whether they differ from those of the overlying HSIL. Descriptive statistics will also be used to determine if the loci differ in HSIL that have progressed and concurrent HSIL biopsies that did not progress. In each case only tissues that contain HPV 16 will be analyzed.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Host factors in HSIL progression to cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Linear models will be fitted for each gene. Moderated t-statistics, fold-change and the associated p values will be calculated for each gene. Since thousands of genes will be tested, false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted values will be calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. FDR values indicate the expected fraction of falsely declared differentially expressed (DE) genes among the total set of declared DE genes, i.e. FDR = 0.15 would indicate that 15% of the declared DE genes were expected to be false due to experimental noise instead of actual differential expression.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>For each risk factor of interest, Fisher's exact test or Pearson's chi-square test will be used to determine if there is an association. Factors associated with invasive anal cancer at the 0.10 significance level will be incorporated into a logistic regression model to determine if they are independently associated with invasive anal cancer. Cox regression analyses will also be used to evaluate the association between risk factors and time to diagnosis of invasive anal cancer.</description>
