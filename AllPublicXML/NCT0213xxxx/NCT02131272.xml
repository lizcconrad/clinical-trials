  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted globally. The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of insulin detemir versus insulin Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) in combination with
      the maximum tolerated dose of metformin and diet/exercise on glycaemic control in children
      and adolescents with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on the maximum tolerated dose
      of metformin with or without other oral antidiabetic drug(s) with or without basal insulin.

    <time_frame>week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change in body weight standard deviation score (SDS) from baseline to week 26. In order to reduce the variability in body weight measurements, SDS were calculated. SDS for weight was derived by comparing the actual measurements with standard growth charts for the United States. Standard values provided by the standard growth charts according to the subject's sex and age at the time of the measurement were used to calculate the SDS.</description>

A total of 24 sites in 11 countries randomised subjects to treatment.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Insulin Detemir + Metformin + Diet/Exercise</title>
          <description>Subjects were treated with insulin detemir 100 U/mL administered subcutaneously in the thigh region once or twice daily for a period of 26 weeks. For insulin naïve subjects, insulin detemir was initiated at a dose of 0.1−0.2 U/kg with a maximum dose of 10 U at the investigators discretion. Subjects who were already on basal insulin were switched to insulin detemir unit-to-unit once or twice daily, depending on previous injection frequency. Subjects were dosed according to individual requirements during the trial period. All subjects continued treatment with metformin on their pre-study dose(s) throughout the trial. The diet/exercise intervention was performed through changes in eating and activity behaviours.</description>

          <description>Subjects were treated with insulin detemir 100 U/mL administered subcutaneously in the thigh region once or twice daily for a period of 26 weeks. For insulin naïve subjects, insulin detemir was initiated at a dose of 0.1−0.2 U/kg with a maximum dose of 10 U at the investigators discretion. Subjects who were already on basal insulin were switched to insulin detemir unit-to-unit once or twice daily, depending on previous injection frequency. Subjects were dosed according to individual requirements during the trial period. All subjects continued treatment with metformin on their pre-study dose(s) throughout the trial. The diet/exercise intervention was performed through changes in eating and activity behaviours.</description>
