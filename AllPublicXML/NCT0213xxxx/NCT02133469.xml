      A parallel-group, randomized, open-label study will be performed in subjects receiving PCV7
      and subjects receiving controlled vaccine Hib vaccine, to claim the efficacy of PCV7 in the
      prevention of NP carriage of vaccine-serotype S. pneumoniae (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C,
      19F, and 23F combined) in 2 to 5 years old healthy Chinese children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2005, clinical trials with PCV7 (Prevenar) were first conducted in China. In the phase 3
      study involving Chinese infants, Prevenar was shown to be immunogenic, well tolerated, and
      safe when given either separately or concomitantly with a diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular
      pertussis (DTaP) vaccine at 3, 4, and 5 months of age. Controlled clinical trials elsewhere
      in the world showed the correlation between immunogenicity and disease prevention. In
      addition to the direct effect of Prevenar, immunization of children has also reduced the
      incidence of disease in adults. The changes are presumed to be due to reductions in
      nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotype S. pneumoniae in children who have been
      vaccinated.

      The purpose of this study will be to assess the effectiveness of Prevenar vaccination to
      reduce vaccine serotype (VT) NPC rates in Chinese children aged 2 to 5 years old.
