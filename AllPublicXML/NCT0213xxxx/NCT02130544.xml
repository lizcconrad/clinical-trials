    <textblock>
      Viedo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery(VATS) have became popular in recent years. There is no
      golden rule of postoperative analgesia for VATS. Compared with lobectomy, wedge resection
      preserves better pulmonary function and is suitable for elder patients and patients who could
      not afford to have lobectomy. In addition to surgery time„ÄÅrecovery time and hospital stay,
      wound incisions and organization damages are different,too. Will patients also have different
      response to pain control after these two surgery? The retrospective study is to compared the
      differences of postoperative pain management between VATS lobectomy and wedge resection.
