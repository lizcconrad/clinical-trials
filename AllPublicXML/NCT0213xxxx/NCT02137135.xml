  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluctuations of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle influence pain perception.
      Endogenous pain is pronounced in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The
      investigators tested the primary hypothesis that the women having surgery during their
      follicular phase have more acute pain and require more opioids than those in the luteal
      phase, and secondarily the investigators tested that women who have surgery during their
      follicular phase have more incisional pain at 3 month postoperatively.

      127 adult females having laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to have surgery during
      the luteal or follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Standardized anesthesia and pain
      management regimen was given to all patients. Pain and analgesic consumption were evaluated
      in PACU and every four hours in first 24 hours. Adverse effects were also questioned every
      four hours. Time to oral intake and ambulation were recorded. Post-surgical pain, hospital
      anxiety and depression scale, and SF-12 questionnaire were also evaluated at 1- and 3-month
      visits.
