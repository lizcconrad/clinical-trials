  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of a wearable therapeutic
      ultrasound device for relief of pain associated with the trapezius muscle of the upper back
      over a 4-week period. The trapezius muscle is a wide, flat, superficial muscle that covers
      most of the upper back and the posterior of the neck.The hypothesis is that the ultrasound
      device will lower the reported daily pain level of subjects suffering from trapezius muscle
      pain in their upper back.

      Subjects who participate in the study will self-administer the ultrasound device beginning at
      the onset of trapezius muscle pain, which is defined as a score of 3.0 or higher on a scale
      of 1-10. Subjects will be required to visit the clinical site at enrollment and weeks 2 and 4
      for a total of 3 visits. Subjects will report their daily pain levels in a diary.

      The wearable ultrasound device, SamÂ®, has been cleared by the FDA for pain relief, relief of
      joint contracture, relief of muscle spasm, and increased circulation.

      The study will have approximately 60 subjects randomly assigned into a user group (active
      ultrasound device) of 40 participants or a control group (inactive ultrasound device) of 20
      participants with an equal number of males and females in each group. The research
      coordinator will be blinded to the assignment of devices to each group.

      The daily pain scores reported by patients who receive active devices will be compared to
      those who receive placebo devices.

      Background:

      Approximately 50 to 80 million people in the United States suffer from some form of chronic
      pain. Back pain is the most common neurological disorder in the United States after headaches
      and costs consumers nearly $50 billion annually. Pharmaceuticals currently dominate the
      treatment options despite a myriad of public health problems including cost, untoward side
      effects, and addiction to widely available opioid analgesics. Non-pharmaceutical treatments,
      such as the one under test, provide a safer and potentially lower cost alternative to
      traditional analgesic use.

    <description>Patients apply the ultrasound device when trapezius muscle pain exceeds a score of 3 or higher by VAS. Device maybe be worn safely for 4 h per day for 7 days a week. Patients record VAS score on days when the device is applied - before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The certified examiner will measure depth at each trigger point location with a pressure algometer. The examiner will identify 2 trigger points on the subject's left and right upper trapezius muscle and place the algometer at the location. The examiner will apply small amounts of pressure to the algometer to measure the tightness of the muscle.</description>
