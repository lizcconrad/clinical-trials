      This pilot clinical trial studies how well magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before biopsy
      works in diagnosing patients with prostate cancer. MRI is a procedure in which radio waves
      and a powerful magnet linked to a computer are used to create detailed pictures of areas
      inside the body. This diagnostic procedure may aid in identifying lesions in the prostate
      which may have cancer. The lesions can then be targeted during the prostate biopsy to improve
      the accuracy of identifying prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identification of one of more lesions suspicious for prostate cancer using a novel MRI
      protocol, not identified by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) alone and to determine if the
      lesions identified by MRI demonstrate clinically significant prostate cancer based on
      pathologic findings (ie. Gleason &gt;= 7 or percentage of core involved with cancer &gt; 50%).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Average time for MRI scan per patient. II. Correlation of lesions on MRI to radical
      prostatectomy specimens. III. To determine whether MRI 3 dimensional (3D) T2 half-Fourier
      acquired single turbo spin-echo (HASTE) or sampling perfection with application optimized
      contrast using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) protocols provide improved rates of
      prostate cancer detection.

      IV. Yield of additional clinically significant prostate cancer diagnoses based on MRI
      targeted lesions on biopsy.

      V. Rate of benign pathology identified by MRI (i.e. false positives). VI. To compare costs
      associated with the use of MRI over TRUS biopsy alone.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo pelvic MRI. Within 1-2 weeks, patients undergo scheduled prostate
      biopsy.

        This is a pilot study of patients from the University Hospitals urology clinics who have
        not previously been given a diagnosis of prostate cancer but who are awaiting a prostate
        biopsy due to an elevated PSA or abnormal digital rectal exam
