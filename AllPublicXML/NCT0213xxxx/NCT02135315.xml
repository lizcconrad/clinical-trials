  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intensive arterial pressure control in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) during the first 24
      hours can improve the prognosis in the short and long term.

      We compare two treatment strategies (standard and intensive treatment) to assess their
      efficacy and safety in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome is often associated with arterial pressure elevation which are
      deleterious for the heart and needs urgent intervention to lower the blood pressure to the
      required values, however there is no clear recommendations concerning the treatment intensity
      in this situation.

      The investigators know that high arterial pressure increases the oxygen myocardial
      consumption and it is deleterious in acute coronary syndrome, so , it is logical to reduce
      intensively this pressure.
