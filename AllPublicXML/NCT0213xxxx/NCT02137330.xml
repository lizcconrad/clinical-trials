  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing global rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among all ages and among
      all ethnic groups, figures into a real epidemic phenomenon. This is accompanied by a higher
      incidence in serious health risks, already present at an early age, &quot;switching-on&quot; the engine
      towards obesity-related co-morbid diseases and morbid obesity. Weight loss is the only way to
      avoid systemic and cardiovascular complications of obesity.

      Weight loss devices have been recently introduced in bariatric surgery, also in children.
      They mostly require invasive procedures to be applied. Mini-invasive devices would be needed
      to obtain weight loss in the pediatric population, since the early age of involved patients.

      Obalon intragastric balloons, are swallowable devices. They are filled with liquid or air,
      and have been used to induce weight loss in obese adults. The investigators aimed to perform
      a pilot study in pediatrics, and monitor weight loss, metabolic and cardiovascular parameters
      modifications, after up-to-3 Obalon® Gastric Balloons placement.
