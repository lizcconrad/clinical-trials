  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of two types of
      prolonged release formulation of tamsulosin hydrochloride in Chinese healthy subjects. The
      safety of tamsulosin formulation is also compared.

      There will be two studies. One study will be conducted under fed condition, and the other
      study will be conducted under fasted condition. Each study is a single center, randomized,
      single dose, open-labeled, cross-over study.

      Study 1 will be conducted under fed condition:

      Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine their eligibility within 7 days
      prior to the study enrollment. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility in the
      evening prior to dosing for each period. All subjects will receive tamsulosin formulation-A
      and formulation-B in one of two randomly assigned treatment sequences at 0.5h after the start
      of a standard breakfast. There will be a 7-day washout period between each dose.

      Study 2 will be under fasted condition:

      A single oral dose of tamsulosin formulation-A or formulation-B will be given to subjects
      under fasted condition (fasting for at least 10 hours since 20:00PM the night before the
      administration). Blood will be sampled at the same time point as in Study 1. Also, safety
      evaluation will be performed at the same selected times throughout the study as in Study 1.
