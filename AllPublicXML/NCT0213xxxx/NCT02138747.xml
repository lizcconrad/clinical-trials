      The purpose of this study was to assess tolerability of mirabegron compared to tolterodine ER
      in the treatment of participants with symptoms of Overactive Bladder (OAB) as well as the
      impact of treatment on micturition frequency and incontinence episodes.

    <measure>Participants Tolerability Assessed by the Medication Tolerability Scale of the Overactive Bladder-Satisfaction (OAB-S) Questionnaire at the End of Treatment (EOT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 (End of Period 1) and Week 18 (End of Period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The medication tolerability scale measured the level of bothersomeness related to the occurrence of a side effect that was known to be related to the approved OAB medication (i.e., constipation, dry mouth, drowsiness, headache, nausea and blurred vision). The OAB medication tolerability score was calculated as a sum of the responses and converted to a scale from 0 to 100, where higher score indicates better perceived OAB medication tolerability (less bother from side-effects).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants Preference Based on a 5-Point Scale at the End of Period 2 in Participants Who Completed at Least 14 Days of Study Drug in Both Study Treatment Periods.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 18 (End of Period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to choose which treatment period they preferred and the degree of preference. Preference was assessed on a 5-point scale assessed at the end of period 2 (&quot;strong preference for period 1,&quot; &quot;mild preference for period 1,&quot; &quot;no preference,&quot; &quot;mild preference for period 2,&quot; &quot;strong preference for period 2&quot;). Participants who selected either a &quot;mild preference&quot; or &quot;strong preference&quot; were considered as having a preference for a specific study drug and participants who selected &quot;no preference&quot; were considered as having no preference for one study drug over the other study drug.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Scale of the OAB-S Questionnaire at the End of Treatment Period: OAB Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 (End of Period 1) and Week 18 (End of Period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>OAB control was scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better OAB control.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 8 (End of Period 1) and Week 18 (End of Period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The final item score for overall assessment of patient's fulfillment of OAB medication expectations ranged from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating better fulfillment of OAB medication expectations.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruited participants were male and female over 18 years of age with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms and naïve to pharmacologic treatment. The study was conducted at 36 sites (8 sites in Canada and 28 sites in the US).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After screening, participants were randomized into 1 of 4 sequences in a 5:5:1:1 ratio (mirabegron/tolterodine extended release (ER), tolterodine ER/mirabegron, mirabegron/mirabegron or tolterodine ER/tolterodine ER. Each participant completed 2 double-blind treatment periods with a 2-week washout period between the two periods.</pre_assignment_details>
