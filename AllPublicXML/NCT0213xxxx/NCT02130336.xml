    <textblock>
      Background. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been increasing, and its risk is
      positively correlated with age. Due to ageing society in Taiwan, how to treat metabolic
      syndrome and decrease the complications is an important health issue. Relatively few studies
      have been focusing on the effects of exercise training in patients with MetS with long-term
      follow-up. Recently, high-intensity interval training or aerobic interval training (AIT)
      consisting of high intensity separated by active recovery has been proposed to be more
      effective than isocaloric continuous moderate-intensity exercise (CME) in raising exercise
      capacity (VO2max) in some specific patient population.

      Purpose. The purposes are to (1) compare the effects of 16-week CME and AIT on reducing the
      numbers of metabolic risk factors in patients with MetS and the prevalence.

      Hypothesis: 16-week AIT reduces more metabolic risk factors than CME in patients with MetS.

      Methods. This study will be a multiple-center trial. One hundred and twenty patients, aged
      ≥45 years, with a diagnosis of MetS for each center will be recruited. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to either control, CME, or AIT group after baseline assessments.
      Participants in control group will receive usual care and the others in two exercise groups
      will undergo 16-week exercise training. All subjects will receive 16-week, 6-month and 1-year
      follow-ups including blood test, body composition (body mass index, waist circumference),
      pulse wave velocity, and maximal exercise testing. Statistical analysis will be conducted
      using SPSS 11.5, p &lt; 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Data will be presented in
      mean±standard deviation or number (percentile) with intention-to-treat analysis. Chi-square
      test or one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare whether there are
      between-group differences at baseline. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc test will
      be performed to examine time and group effect if there is interaction effect, otherwise
      Bonferroni will be used. The subgroup analysis between MetS and n-MetS after training will be
      performed using the same statistical methods.

      Intervention (exercise) protocol:

        1. CME group: exercise at least 30-minute moderate intensity 5 times a week, twice on
           treadmill under supervision and home exercise 3 times a week. CME protocol including
           10-minute warm-up at 40% maximal heart rate (HRmax), 30-minute moderate intensity
           exercise at 50-70% HRmax and 5-minute cool-down at 40% HRmax

        2. AIT group: exercise 3 times a week including twice on treadmill under supervision and
           home exercise once a week. AIT protocol including 10-minute warm-up and 5-minute
           cool-down at 40% HRmax, participants and exercise 4-minute high-intensity training at
           85-90% HRmax and 4 times separated by 3-minute active recovery at 70% HRmax.
