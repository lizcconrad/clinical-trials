  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3 to 4 months, multi-site, prospective randomized clinical study of patients
      diagnosed with a chronic wound. The primary objective is to assess changes in healing rate,
      by measuring differences in wound area when treating chronic wounds with the Next Science
      Wound Gel compared to the Triple Antibiotic Ointment Neosporin (Standard of Care, SOC). At
      the end of the study period, patients may continue receiving their assigned study treatment
      provided they have signed the &quot;Continuation of Treatment Informed Consent&quot; and the rational
      for continuation is documented by the investigator.

    <description>Subjects randomized to Neosporin will be required to complete 1 month of treatment comprising a screening/baseline, 2-week and 1-month visits. After 1 month the following may occur based on wound progression and/or the investigator's clinical judgment:
Subject may continue the application of Neosporin until wound closure or
Subject may cross over to the treatment group for 3 months</description>
