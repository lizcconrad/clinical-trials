  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, 11,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the U.S. Within the first year,
      there are profound declines in physiologic function, forming the underlying substrate for
      future cardiovascular disease . In fact, acquired cardiovascular disease is an increasingly
      recognized consequence of SCI and is the leading cause of death in SCI. Though incompletely
      understood, the almost 10-fold prevalence of cardiovascular disease results in part from
      profound physiologic 'detraining' resulting from motor impairment and immobility. Currently,
      effective interventions preventing acute declines that lead to cardiovascular compromise and
      increased risk in SCI are lacking - exercise therapy for those with SCI is challenging and
      when employed, is typically limited to the upper body. Recently, the investigators refined a
      unique form of exercise for those with SCI that specifically mirrors exercise performed by
      those without SCI. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Row Training (RT) couples
      volitional arm and electrically controlled leg exercise, resulting in a hemodynamic profile
      that produces the beneficial cardiac loading conditions of large muscle mass exercise. As
      such, FES-RT may be a safe and effective way to attenuate cardiovascular declines following
      SCI. The investigators aims are to test the overall hypotheses that FES-RT will: 1) mitigate
      against increased visceral adiposity and reduced insulin sensitivity, 2) prevent worsening
      lipid profile and compromised baroreflex function, and 3) counter ventricular wall thickening
      and declining ventricular function occurring with acute SCI, and that these effects will be
      greater than that observed with an arms-only exercise group. Changes with FES-RT will be
      compared to a time (wait-list) control and to arms-only-RT. Individuals with an SCI within
      the last 3-6 months will be randomized to immediate FES-RT, to a time control beginning
      FES-RT after a 6 month wait, or 6 months of arms-only-RT followed by FES-RT. Measures will be
      made at baseline and every 3 months. The investigators work will provide results that clearly
      delineate potential health benefits of FES-RT, and if FES-RT is effective in a majority of
      those with SCI, its application, implementation, and integration could be easily replicated.
