  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scarring of the lungs is common in patients with scleroderma and is one of the main causes of
      death. Patients with scleroderma very frequently have problems with their gullet (esophagus),
      the food pipe that leads into the stomach.

      Normally, a small circular muscle at the base of the esophagus opens to allow food to pass
      into the stomach and closes to keep the digestive fluids from flowing back up into the
      gullet. In patients with scleroderma, the muscle may become weak and no longer close
      properly. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is the medical term for reflux of stomach contents
      into the esophagus.

      Our hypothesis is that small amounts of GER can move back up into the esophagus and get
      inhaled into the lungs, and may be one of the triggers for lung scarring. We propose to look
      for certain substances normally only found in the stomach in the &quot;exhaled breath condensate&quot;
      which is collected by breathing comfortably into a cooled cylinder, allowing the breath to
      condensate. In a smaller group of patients, we also plan to perform a bronchoalveolar lavage,
      a more widely studied test in which a small amount of fluid is introduced into a small part
      of the lungs through a fine tube, and then removed for examination, to evaluate whether the
      two tests provide similar measurements. We will also evaluate the correlation between these
      molecules and other tests, including lung function, and markers of lung scarring activity,
      and tests to look at how the esophagus is working so that we can get a clearer picture of how
      this affects patients' daily lives. Finally, we will be following up patients over time with
      lung function to see whether evidence of GER into the lungs is linked with a greater
      likelihood of worsening of lung scarring in the future.
