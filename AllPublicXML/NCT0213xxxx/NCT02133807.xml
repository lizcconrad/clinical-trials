  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether specific lipoprotein(a) apheresis on the top of optimal medical therapy
      could affect atherosclerotic disease burden in coronary and carotid arteries of coronary
      heart disease patients with elevated Lp(a) levels.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the hypothesis that if Lp(a) excess has a pathogenic role in atherogenesis, then
      specific elimination of circulating Lp(a) should affect plaque growth and stability, we
      evaluated the efficacy of Lp(a) apheresis on changes in coronary plaque volume and
      composition and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with CHD on the background of
      optimal medical treatment.

    <description>Since all included patients had high Lp(a) levels, to avoid overestimation of LDL-C fraction estimated LDL-C levels were corrected for cholesterol derived from Lp(a).
Corrected LDL-C (LDL-C corr) was calculated using Dahlen's modification of the Friedewald formula: LDL-C corr = TC - (HDL-C) - (TG / 2.2) - (0.3 x Lp(a) / 38.7).
