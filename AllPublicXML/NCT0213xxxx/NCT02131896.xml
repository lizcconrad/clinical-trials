  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional therapy has a major role in diabetes care, achieving and maintaining metabolic
      control: normal glucose homeostasis, normal lipid profile, normal blood pressure and
      desirable weight. Controlled nutritional diet, as introduced by the professional committees
      aims at achieving better general health condition.

      There is a growing body of evidence showing that Mediterranean diet has a major role in
      prevention of diabetes sequelae in type 2 diabetes patients. Hitherto, the effects of
      Mediterranean diet on patients with type 1 diabetes has not been studied, with the exception
      of one Italian study.

      Six months after education to consume Mediterranean diet in a cohort of 96 children with type
      1 diabetes the authors observed decreased fat and cholesterol consumption, increased dietary
      fiber consumption, lower LDL cholesterol levels and better HDL to LDL cholesterol ratio.

      The proposed study is aimed to assess the impact of Mediterranean nutrition compared to the
      accepted nutritional guidelines, in newly diagnosed type 1 children and adolescents on lipid
      profile, metabolic control, C peptide, daily insulin dose, Inflammatory parameters,
      endothelial function and anthropometric parameters 12 months following diagnosis.

      The study designed as a two parallel arms, randomized, single center, intervention study.

      Patients enrolled to the study will be randomly assigned, to one of the following groups in a
      1:1 ratio. Interventional Arm: Patients assigned to the interventional arm will receive
      nutritional instructions of Mediterranean diet and Control Group: Patients assigned to the
      interventional arm will receive regular nutritional instructions in accordance with the
      accepted nutritional guidelines
