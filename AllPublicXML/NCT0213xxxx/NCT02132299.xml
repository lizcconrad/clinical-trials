      This trial will evaluate whether relatively non-immune populations in endemic countries can
      effectively generate significant cellular and humoral immune responses that confer protection
      against P. falciparum infection after inoculation of aseptic, purified, vialed, metabolically
      active, non-replicating (live, radiation attenuated) Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ
      Vaccine) administered intravenously (IV).

      This is a single center, Phase 1, dose escalating, randomized, double blind, controlled
      trial. Seventy-three healthy male volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years will be recruited. The
      study will have 5 study groups that will include 49 volunteers who will be intravenously
      injected with PfSPZ Vaccine, 8 control volunteers who will receive normal saline and 16
      additional control volunteers who will be recruited at the time of controlled human malaria
      infection (CHMI) at 3 and 24 weeks. The control volunteers will help better assess the
      occurrence of AEs compared to background disease patterns that occur in this tropical area,
      and the performance of the vaccine.

    <description>Three volunteers will receive 3 ascending doses of PfSPZ Vaccine by IV administration four weeks apart. The three doses are 3x10^4, 1.35x10^5, and 2.7x10^5 PfSPZ. This is the safety group that will be inoculated first before all others for demonstration of safety and will be followed up for assessment of safety after the completion of the three doses. The follow up will be at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 after completion of vaccination. Volunteers in Group 1 will not undergo CHMI. Group 1 is unblinded.</description>
