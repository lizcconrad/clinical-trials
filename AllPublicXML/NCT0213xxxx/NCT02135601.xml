  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Water exchange method has been shown to reduce medication requirement and pain experienced
      during colonoscopy. It may increase the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Water exchange provides
      salvage cleansing and the refractive index of water (n equals about 1.3) is larger than that
      of air, which creates optical distortion that likely contributes to objects appearing larger
      underwater, making smaller lesions easier to visualize and it may help draw attention to
      those smaller lesions during withdraw. These principles facilitate to the higher adenoma
      detection rate.

      There is a large number of literature on the adenoma detection rate during water exchange
      colonoscopy, but most studies have been conducted in only one centre, simple-size, and under
      sedation patients, the influence of adenoma detection rate under unsedation patients was
      unclear.

      The aim of this study is to compare the ADR of colonoscopy by using the water exchange method
      versus the conventional air method in unsedation patients in multiple centers in China.

    <description>Colonoscopy will be performed without medications and aided by water infusion in-lieu of air insufflation during insertion of the colonoscope. The water infusion involves putting warm sterile water into the colon to open up the colon for advancement of the colonoscope until the end of the colon (cecum) is reached. The water is delivered through scope irrigation channel by an infusion pump equipped with a foot switch which will be controlled by the endoscopist. Infused water used to cleanse residual fecal matter will be suctioned as needed to clear the colonic lumen.</description>
