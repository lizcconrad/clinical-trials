  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicinoids (the active ingredient in hot peppers) have been shown to cause a moderate
      increase in energy expenditure (50 kcal/day) as well as reductions in appetite, energy
      intake, and (visceral) adiposity. As such, there is considerable interest in capsaicinoid for
      weight loss supplements. Owing to the fact that these changes are believed to be driven by
      catecholamine release and alterations in fat oxidation, there is growing belief that
      capsaicin may also offer potential ergogenic benefits (performance enhancement) during
      exercise, similar to the affect of caffeine, which works through similar pathways. Of
      particular interest are the recent findings that free-fatty acids in the blood are elevated
      2-2.5hrs post ingestion, yet changes in typical cardiovascular or sympathetic nervous tone
      indicators (heart rate, blood pressure) were unaffected, suggesting some of the negative
      consequences of other stimulants may be avoided. At present, however, more in depth
      investigations of the effects on endothelial function, vascular autonomic tone and
      inflammation are lacking.

      Although there are some indications that capsaicinoid ingestion may alter factors associated
      exercise performance (such as increased fat oxidation for glucose sparing), to date these
      studies have primarily used very low exercise intensities wherein these effects are typically
      unnecessary, and results are not generalizable to the typical race intensities of endurance
      sport competition. Performance measures have also been a noticeably absent outcome from
      research to date.

      Hypotheses: 1), Exercise performance will improve, at a level similar to those demonstrated
      for caffeine ingestion 2) ratings of perceived exertion will go down with the effect of
      causing intensity to go up 3) During sustained aerobic activity approaching the aerobic
      threshold alterations in substrate use will be minimal (but possibly meaningful in regard to
      performance); alterations at rest will be more pronounced. 4) acute alterations (6o min post
      single dose) in blood pressure, HRV, arterial stiffness and RMR will mirror the effects
      observed for more prolonged exposure in phase 1.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be male or female, 18 yr -45yr and free from any known or suspected chronic
        conditions. General health and suitability to participate in an exercise/health research
        study will be confirmed through use of the PAR-Q+ screening questionnaire

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any participant who has a positive answer to a screening question will be required to seek
        physician approval prior to any physical exercise. Baseline arrhythmia (tachycardia
        (&gt;100pbm) and systolic or diastolic hypertension (&gt;140/90 mmHg) will also be reason for
        exclusion. During baseline anthropometric assessment we will confirm that participants all
        fall within a typical BMI range (20-30 kg/m2) of either &quot;normal&quot; weight or &quot;overweight&quot;,
        but not &quot;underweight&quot; or &quot;obese&quot;. Persons who take cardiovascular medications, metabolic
        medications, smoke cigarettes, excessively consume alcohol, are prone to heartburn, or have
        a previous diagnosis of hyperlipidemia or hyperinsulemia will also be excluded
