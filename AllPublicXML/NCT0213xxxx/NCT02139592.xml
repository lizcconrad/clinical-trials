      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of brentuximab vedotin (recombinant) for
      IV infusion (ADCETRIS IV Infusion 50 mg) in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30+ Hodgkin's
      lymphoma or anaplastic large cell lymphoma in the routine clinical setting, as well as to
      collect efficacy information for reference.

    <textblock>
      The present survey was designed to evaluate the safety of brentuximab vedotin (recombinant)
      for IV infusion (ADCETRIS IV Infusion 50 mg) in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30+
      Hodgkin's lymphoma or anaplastic large cell lymphoma in the routine clinical setting.

      The usual adult dosage is 1.8 mg/kg (body weight) of brentuximab vedotin (recombinant)
      infused intravenously once every three weeks. The dose should be adjusted depending on the
      patient's condition. See the &quot;PRECAUTIONS&quot; section of the package insert.

    <description>The frequencies of all adverse events observed during the observation period will be tabulated by type and seriousness. Adverse events are defined as unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless of relationship to the medicinal product.</description>

    <description>Based on findings of neck, chest, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography and positron emission tomography, and in accordance with evaluation criteria for antitumor efficacy, the antitumor efficacy (best response) of ADCETRIS will be assessed as one of the following: complete response, unconfirmed complete response (when no PET data are available), partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease.</description>
