    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective open-label single-center study in previously treated patients
      with Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Treatment efficacy and safety of the combination of
      Oshadi D and Oshadi R with Docetaxel will be will be evaluated.

      Patients will receive Docetaxel in combination with Oshadi D and Oshadi R. Patient will be
      evaluated throughout the study for safety and tolerance to multiple dose regimens of Oshadi D
      and Oshadi R.

      CT or MRI imaging will be performed prior to treatment initiation and at the end of every 3
      Docetaxel cycles (12 weeks). In case of disease progression, dose augmentation will be
      considered or subsequent therapy.
