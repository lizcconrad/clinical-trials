  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience that is one of the main symptoms of
      temporomandibular disorder (TMD). One way to assess pain is through algometry. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate, by the pressure pain threshold measurements, the efficacy of a
      short-term conservative treatment for the management of temporomandibular disorders. This
      study is a randomized controlled clinical trial where 84 participants were diagnosed with
      myofascial pain according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders
      (RDC/TMD), with a mean age of 44 years old ranging from 18 to 76 years old. These individuals
      were asked about parafunctional habits and the treatment was applied by providing an
      explanation concerning the role of pain, possible aetiological factors of the patient's TMD,
      the relationship between chronic pain and psychosocial distress, and its benign character.
      They also had to perform once daily application of hot packs on both sides of the face for 20
      minutes and after that they must perform active free therapeutic exercise of mouth opening
      for 10 times. The pressure pain threshold of the masseter and temporalis muscles and the
      lateral pole of the condyle were obtained at baseline (T0), between 15 and 30 days after (T1)
      and at 75 to 90 days after (T2) representing the end of the treatment. Two groups of subjects
      were obtained. The first was considered the study group (SG) and included those who underwent
      the treatment proposed. The control group (CG) consisted of participants who did not undergo
      treatment because they did not believe in it.
