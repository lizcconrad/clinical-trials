    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn if a new 7 day patch ECG recording monitor can
      serve the same purpose as standard monitoring systems. The new 7day patch is significantly
      smaller and lighter than previous ECG recorders.

      The primary purpose of this research is to evaluate ECG signal quality of the BDx 7 day ECG
      Patch heart monitor after 7 full days of wear, establishing that the device is safe and
      effective to wear for up to 7 days.
