  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-Asian-centre randomised controlled trial of Rebamipide alone vs Rebamipide
      with Esomeprazole in the treatment of adult patients with Functional Dyspepsia. The
      hypothesis is that a combination therapy is superior to mono-therapy in the control of
      patients' symptoms and quality of life improvement.

      Primary Objective: To assess the efficacy of Rebamipide in combination with Esomeprazole in
      the improvement of symptoms of Functional Dyspepsia in Asian patients compared to
      Esomeprazole alone Secondary Objective: i. To assess the efficacy of Rebamipide in
      combination with Esomeprazole in the improvement of quality of life in Asian patients with
      Functional Dyspepsia compared to Esomeprazole alone ii. To assess the cost-effectiveness of
      Rebamipide in combination with Esomeprazole compared to Esomeprazole alone after 8, 12 weeks
      of treatment iii. To assess the safety of Rebamipide in combination with Esomeprazole in
      adults with functional dyspepsia after 8 weeks of treatment.

      Statistical Methodology:

      Primary Endpoint Change in Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (LDQ) total score from baseline to 8
      weeks of treatment

      Secondary Endpoint

        1. The change in Health-Related Quality of Life (EQ-5D) from baseline to 8 weeks of
           treatment

        2. The cost effectiveness based on cost per QALY gained between the study groups compared
           to the control group at 8, 12 weeks

        3. The change in Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (LDQ) total score and Health-Related Quality
           of Life (EQ-5D) from baseline to 12 weeks

      Summary statistics of the endpoints will be provided. Mean change will be evaluated by two
      sample t-test or Wilcoxon's rank sum test according to the normal distribution of analyzed
      variable.

      Safety Endpoint

        1. Adverse events The number of cases of AEs and the proportion of patients who experienced
           AEs will be summarized by descriptive statistics (frequency and proportion) for each
           study group.

        2. Laboratory Test and Vital Signs All laboratory values and vital signs will be compared
           within study group and between study groups.
