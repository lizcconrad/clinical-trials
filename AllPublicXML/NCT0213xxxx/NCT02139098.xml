  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether drug efficiency of zolpidem and
      amitriptyline can be conditioned according to learning theory in patients with primary
      insomnia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that repeated drug treatments can be regarded as conditioning
      processes. Sleep disorders are especially of interest to be investigated under the
      perspective of conditioning with drugs, since sleep quality can be defined both in terms of
      subjective ratings (self-rated sleep quality parameters) and objective measures (via
      polysomnographic assessment PSG; e.g., total sleep time, sleep onset, sleep architecture). By
      using two different drugs (zolpidem, amitriptyline) that modulate sleep differentially, the
      investigators intend to implement a conditioning paradigm in sleep disorders dissociating
      conditioning effects on subjective and objective sleep parameters. Both drugs should affect
      objective and subjective sleep parameters positively, while only amitriptyline should
      modulate the objectively assessed sleep architecture by REM-suppression (latency of REM-sleep
      onset, percentage of REM-sleep).Patients with mild to moderate insomnia will undergo a
      classical conditioning paradigm with one of two study medications: amitriptyline or zolpidem.
      After an acquisition period and a wash-out period, conditioned sleep changes are assessed in
      an evocation trial. During a second treatment phase of 7 days, patients receive different
      doses of amitriptyline (between 0mg and 50mg per night) or zolpidem (between 0mg and 5mg per
      night) to evaluate alternative dosing regimens in the pharmacotherapy of mild to moderate
      Insomnia.
