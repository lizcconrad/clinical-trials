  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an immunosuppressive
      medication, Belatacept, as a replacement for a calcineurin inhibitor, in combination with a
      standard of care regimen of immunosuppressive medications and plasma exchange (plasmapheresis
      and immunoglobulin treatment) for kidney transplant patients who are moderately sensitized
      against their deceased donor and at-risk for delayed graft function. The hypothesis is that
      moderately sensitized patients who receive Belatacept treatment with the standard of care
      regimen will lead to lower acute rejection rates than historical controls based on assessment
      of standard of care biopsies and standard Banff criteria.

      This exploratory single-center, open-label safety and efficacy study will enroll 20 adult
      kidney transplants candidates, moderately sensitized against their deceased donor and at-risk
      for delayed graft function (DGF), to receive Belatacept (days 0,5, weeks 2,4,8 and 12 (10
      mg/kg), and every 4 weeks thereafter (5 mg/kg)), plasma exchange (once before and twice after
      transplant) and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) (100 mg/kg after each plasma exchange),
      along with Thymoglobulin (ATG) induction and Dexamethasone tapered dosing starting on the day
      of transplant at 100mg IV, tapered through Day 4, followed by prednisone at 30 mg on Day 5
      with tapered dosing to prednisone 10 mg/d by one month, with a total observation period of 1
      year. Patients will be tapered off tacrolimus by week 8 and will remain on mycophenolic acid
      and prednisone for the total length of the study. Subjects will be followed until 1 year post
      transplant.

    <description>Enrolled patients will start with standard of practice treatment including plasmapheresis and IVIG therapy twice after transplant, on days 2 and 4 and potentially once before transplant. Plasmapheresis and albumin exchange for one volume of blood will be performed in the infusion center at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics (UWHC). Each pheresis session will be completed by IVIG infusion. While plasmapheresis will help with the removal of circulating Donor Specific Antibodies (DSA), IVIG therapy will provide immunomodulatory characteristics that include sterilizing immunity from infections, inhibiting and scavenging activated complement fragments, modifying cell-mediated immune responses, inducing regulatory T cells and importantly, inhibiting deleterious antibody production.</description>
