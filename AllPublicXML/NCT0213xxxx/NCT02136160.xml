  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Population based intervention at elementary school setting aimed at contributing, to a major
      extent, to health education and health promotion for children aged approximately 5-10 years
      in Germany. Health education units with theoretical and practical exercises for use by
      teachers, children, and parents addresses physical activity, sedentary behavior, relaxation,
      nutrition, personal hygiene and body awareness.

      Main questions of the pilot are:

      Does health promotion take on an important role in primary schools? How do teachers evaluate
      training materials, homepage, content and framework conditions? How do teachers assess the
      efficiency of teaching units?

      The program is based on actual cognitions and methods of the early education science. In the
      pilot phase study part (3/2013-5/2013) the investigators evaluated 210 classes of five states
      in Germany: NRW, Thüringen, Berlin, Sachsen-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein.

      The long-term aim of this project is to provide an innovative concept based on current
      concepts in social studies and science that addresses health education of pupils in
      elementary schools.
