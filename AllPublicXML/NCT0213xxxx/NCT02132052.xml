  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that there are specific characteristic of each cognitive and motor
      condition that can be defined using brains scans.

  <detailed_description>

      Specific Aim 1: Determine which features of resting Magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain
      activity most sensitively discriminate between PD with normal cognition, PD with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI), and PD dementia (PDD). Investigators predict that frontal network
      slowing and connectivity will discriminate between normal cognition and MCI while
      visuospatial network involvement will distinguish the PDD group.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine which features of resting MEG brain activity most sensitively
      discriminate PDD from Alzheimer's Disease. Investigators predict that PDD will be
      distinguished from Alzheimer's (AD) on the basis of increased network connectivity,
      particularly in frontal and visuospatial networks.

      Specific Aim 3 Investigate how resting state MEG activity correlates with task related brain
      activity. Investigators predict that resting state slowing will be associated with decreased
      task related brain activity.

      Specific Aim 4: Determine which features of resting MEG brain activity most sensitively
      discriminate between motor subtypes of PD and also other relevant clinical populations
      (essential tremor and Parkinson plus syndromes). Investigators predict that frontal and
      parietal slowing and connectivity will discriminate PD from related conditions and that
      patterns of motor cortex connectivity and activity will differentiate among PD motor
      phenotypes.

    <description>Focal oscillatory activity: Focal band power for delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (9- 13 Hz), low beta (13-20 Hz), high beta (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) activity will be derived from the autoregressive models.</description>

    <description>2) Spectral coherence: Coherence is a measure of interdependence between two time series and can be applied to MEG data to determine functional networks.4a-chen Coherence will be derived from the autoregressive models.</description>

    <measure>Spectral Granger analysis:</measure>
    <time_frame>May 2014</time_frame>
    <description>3) Spectral Granger analysis: Granger analysis is a measure of the directionality of the relationship of two time series and can be applied to sensors or sources found to have significant coherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reactivity:</measure>
    <time_frame>May 2014</time_frame>
    <description>Reactivity: Reactivity refers to changes in oscillatory activity between the eye open and eye closed conditions. Prior research in AD has shown significantly reduced reactivity compared to age-matched controls.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complex network analysis:</measure>
    <time_frame>May 2014</time_frame>
    <description>Complex network analysis: Complex network analysis, originally developed in graph theory, is an approach to the study of complex systems such as brain networks. It allows investigators to characterize brain networks with a small number of neurobiologically meaningful and easily computable measures, including transitivity, global efficiency, and betweenness. These measures will be used to reveal the hypothesized connectivity abnormalities in PD and to differentiate different cognitive phenotypes in PD.</description>
