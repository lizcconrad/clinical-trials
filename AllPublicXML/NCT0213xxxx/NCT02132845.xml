  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well next generation sequence target-directed
      therapy works in treating patients with cancer. Next generation sequencing is a test that
      screens for mutations to cancer related genes. Target-directed therapy is a type of treatment
      that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific types of cancer cells
      that may have less harm to normal cells. Next generation sequencing may help identify these
      specific types of cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall (composite) response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. 4-month progression free survival (PFS). II. Mutation rate. III. Adverse event
      rate/severity. IV. Overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Targeted agent rate. II. Available protocol rate. III. Protocol enrollment rate. IV.
      Disease site influence.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for analysis via next
      generation sequencing. Patients receive standard of care therapy based on the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      ARM B: Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for analysis via next
      generation sequencing. Based on the results of the next generation sequencing, patients
      receive target-directed therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer

          -  Patients must have evaluable disease; measureable disease is not required; however, if
             measurable disease is present, it is defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension in accordance with Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version (v.) 1.1; furthermore, if only
             evaluable disease is present, a relevant tumor marker (per investigator discretion)
             must be &gt;= 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) at baseline, and can be used as a
             response indicator

          -  Patients must be considered good candidates for a phase 1 trial and the treating
             physician must intend to enroll the patient on a phase 1 clinical protocol, if
             possible; patients are not required to have progressed on their last line of therapy
             prior to enrollment

               -  Other clinical trials are also acceptable; for example, an applicable phase 2 or
                  phase 3 trial may exist for which the patient would be eligible and for which
                  available information (inclusive of next generation sequencing [NGS]) would be
                  relevant to such enrollment; regardless, the pertinent point is that it is the
                  intent of the physician to use NGS data, to the degree possible, to select
                  appropriate therapy, when selecting patients for this trial

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt; 80,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 times ULN and stable X 1 month

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic
             oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]/serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) &lt; 3
             times ULN (if liver metastasis is present then =&lt; 5 X ULN)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 X ULN and stable X 1 month OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             Ml/min/1.73 m^2

          -  Estimated life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and Health
             Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with more than one type of active malignancy; an active malignancy is defined
             as one that is being treated with therapeutic intent and for which survival may be
             impacted, within 3 years of enrollment

          -  Patients with known active brain metastases; patients with a history of treated brain
             metastasis are eligible if the patient is off systemic steroids and there are no
             clinical indications of central nervous system (CNS) progression for a least 1 month;
             patients with glioblastoma multiforme are eligible if the above criteria are otherwise
             met; note: many clinical trials do not allow enrollment of such patients; if the
             physician, in good conscience, feels that applicable protocols for their patient do
             exist, enrollment onto this trial is acceptable, assuming other eligibility criteria
             are met

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination
             antiretroviral therapy

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding
