  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating picture that all the neonatologists are
      afraid of facing during the follow up of newborns. During the last years, investigators ran
      retrospective observational studies abut NEC developing within the 48 hours after red blood
      cell transfusion. In the previous studies, the incidence of transfusion associated NEC
      (TANEC) was found to be 20-35%.Multiple transfusions potentially cause an increased risk for
      retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and NEC. Investigators have also proposed a hypothesis about
      transfusion related acute gut injury (TRAGI), an adverse reaction of transfusion, similar to
      transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) seen in adults.In most of the neonatology
      clinics, withholding feeds during transfusion is not preferred. But several recent studies
      show an increase in the incidence of TANEC if the newborn goes on feeding before, during and
      after the transfusion process, especially if it is fed with a formula. The main aim of this
      study is to investigate the effect of withholding feeds during transfusion, on the
      development of TRAGI.
