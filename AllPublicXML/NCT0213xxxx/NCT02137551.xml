      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate how engaging ACO beneficiaries in the
      appointment based model for one year impacts medication adherence and healthcare costs
      compared to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) Foundation has partnered with a federally
      qualified health center (FQHC), a supermarket community pharmacy, and an accountable care
      organization (ACO) to participate in this ABM for ACO Beneficiaries initiative. The FQHC, El
      Rio Community Health Center pharmacy, and supermarket pharmacy, Fry's Pharmacy, will serve as
      implementing pharmacy study sites and will implement the ABM for beneficiaries of the ACO who
      utilize their pharmacies for medication refill services. The ABM involves synchronizing all
      medications to come due on the same day of the month and the individual receives a
      pre-appointment phone call from the pharmacy staff to review medications and identify any
      changes. The ACO will provide medical and claims data on enrolled subjects as well as a
      control group for the intervention population. The APhA Foundation will aggregate
      intervention, prescription fill, and economic data from the 3 partners in an effort to
      evaluate the impact of the ABM on healthcare costs and medication adherence. The APhA
      Foundation has an a priori intent to publish the project results.
