  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) almost always affects bladder function as well. As a result of this
      bladder dysfunction, individuals with SCI have to undergo regular invasive examination of
      their bladder function (urodynamic examination).

      The nerve growth factor (NGF) is released from smooth muscle cells of the bladder, and there
      are reports, that the concentration of NGF is elevated in the urine of patients with bladder
      dysfunction. The NGF concentration can also be measured in the blood. The concentration of
      NGF in the blood and urine of SCI individuals has not yet been investigated. These
      concentrations may correlate with the severity of bladder dysfunction, and may thus be used
      to replace or at least reduce the number of the more invasive urodynamic examinations.

      The hypothesis that urine and blood NGF concentrations in individuals with SCI are higher
      compared to individuals with healthy bladder function will be tested.
