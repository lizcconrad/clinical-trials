  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the limitations and the invasive nature of liver biopsy, there has been extensive
      interest in developing non-invasive tests to measure liver fibrosis (1). These are
      alternatives to liver biopsy that can be used in clinical practice, with benefits in terms of
      cost, risk, and patient convenience (2). Clinically applicable non-invasive tests include
      radiological studies, transient elastography (TE), and serum markers. We aim at studying
      acceptability, reliability, applicability and practical aspects of invasive and noninvasive
      methods for assessment of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis among hepatologists.

      acceptability, reliability, applicability and practical aspects of invasive and noninvasive
      methods for assessment of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis among hepatologists.

      Methods:

      The study is a survey study among hepatologists. Four thousand hepatologists will be invited
      to participate in the questionnaire through e-mail invitations to answer 50 questions of the
      questionnaire. The questionnaire will be hosted on Survey monkey website and results will be
      analyzed to get the consensus opinion of participants for the use of invasive and
      non-invasive methods for assessment of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis and factors affecting
      their preferences.

      Statistical analysis plan Analysis of data will be performed using Statistical Package for
      Scientific Studies 17 for Windows. Description of qualitative variables will be in the form
      of numbers (No.) and percent (%). Description of quantitative variables will be in the form
      of mean, standard deviation (SD). Questionnaire results will be compared against different
      baseline characteristics of the studied group. According to the type and distribution of
      data, suitable tests for inferential statistics will be used. Significance of the results
      will be presented in the form of P-value.
