  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether Butrans Transdermal System (BTDS)
      reduces RLS symptom severity in patients with moderate to severe idiopathic RLS who are naïve
      to opiate treatment.

      The secondary objective of the study is to investigate the effects of BTDS on mood, sleep,
      and quality of life.

      The study will consist of nine visits. Depending on the need for medication titration, there
      may also be two scheduled telephone contacts.

      Visit 1: This is a screening visit to determine study eligibility. Eligible subjects who
      choose to participate must undergo medication washout as described in the detailed protocol
      between visits 1 and 2.

      Treatment period #1 (Visits 2 - 5; day 0 - 28): Baseline measures will be recorded and
      subjects randomized to treatment order at visit 2 (day 0). Study medication as well as rescue
      medication (l-dopa, a non-blinded active treatment to be used within a limited dose range as
      described in the detailed protocol) will be dispensed. Subjects will begin treatment period
      #1 immediately after this. The study medication will be titrated within the allowed range
      according to subject's reported symptoms during visit 3 (day 7), visit 4 (day 14), telephone
      contact (day 21). Visit 5 will occur on day 28 and will include assessment of outcome
      measures for the first treatment period. Visit 5 will also mark the beginning of the second
      treatment period.

      Treatment period #2 (Visits 6 - 8; day 28 - 56): Procedures will be similar to those
      described above during treatment period #1. Visit 8 will mark the end of the second treatment
      period during which outcome measures will be ascertained.

      Follow up visit (Visit 9; day 70): This will be a safety follow-up visit approximately two
      weeks after visit 8 for review of adverse events.
