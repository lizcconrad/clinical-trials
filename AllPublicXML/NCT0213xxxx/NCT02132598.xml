  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II clinical trial designed to allow a preliminary assessment of
      the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib in unselected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
      patients with metastases to the brain and in the subset of patients with c-MET amplified
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with metastases to the brain. Previously treated patients with
      non-squamous NSCLC who have had brain metastases at any point in their treatment history are
      eligible for enrollment on this clinical trial. Patients with clinically asymptomatic
      untreated brain metastases will be allowed on trial at the discretion of the treating
      investigator. Patients who have undergone treatment for their brain metastases with
      Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgery must be
      clinically stable and recovered from all procedures at the time of study enrollment.

      This is a Phase 2, single-arm, open-label study of cabozantinib in subjects with molecularly
      unselected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with metastases to the brain and in patients
      with c-MET amplified Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with metastases to the brain.

      Patients will receive cabozantinib at 60 mg orally once daily and continue on treatment until
      disease progression, death or unacceptable adverse events. Treatment cycles are 4 weeks in
      duration.

      The primary endpoint is Overall Response Rate (ORR) in both the unselected NSCLC population
      and the molecularly selected patients on the basis of c-MET amplification.

An MRI of the brain with contrast (or CT brain with contrast in patients who are unable to obtain an MRI, e.g., has a pacemaker) will be performed every 8 weeks to assess intracranial disease.
In patients whose first site of disease progression is extra-cranial disease, a brain MRI (or CT brain with contrast in patients who are unable to obtain an MRI) will be performed at the time of extra-cranial disease progression and every 12 weeks in the study follow-up period.
Subjects continuing to show benefit, (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]) as defined by RECIST v1.1 may continue on study. Subjects with PD as defined by RECIST v1.1 should have their treatment discontinued, and they should enter the post-treatment phase of the study.
