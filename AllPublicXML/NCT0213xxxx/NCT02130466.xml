  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-part dose-finding and preliminary efficacy study of pembrolizumab (Pembro) +
      dabrafenib (D) + trametinib (T) for participants with advanced melanoma. Parts 1 and 2 are
      open-label to find and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose
      (MAD) for Pembro+D+T. The primary hypothesis (Parts 1 and 2) is that Pembro+D+T is
      sufficiently well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation. Part 3 is a double-blind study
      of Pembro+D+T versus placebo+D+T. The primary study hypothesis (Part 3 only) is that the
      Pembro+D+T improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo+D+T. Part 4 is
      nonrandomized and open-label and is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability and
      identify the MTD or MAD of Pembro+T in participants who have v-raf murine sarcoma viral
      oncogene homolog B1 [BRAF] mutation-negative (without V600 E or K) melanoma or solid tumors
      [irrespective of BRAF status]. The primary hypothesis (Part 4) is that Pembro+T is
      sufficiently well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation. Part 5 will confirm the dose(s)
      identified in Part 4 in participants BRAF wild type [without V600E or K] melanoma or solid
      tumors [irrespective of BRAF status] and will further evaluate the safety and preliminary
      efficacy (Objective Response Rate [ORR]) of Pembro+T in participants who have BRAF wild type
      [without V600E or K] melanoma only. The primary hypotheses (Part 5) are that Pembro+T is
      sufficiently well-tolerated at the MTD/MAD to permit further clinical investigation and is
      effective in attaining objective responses based upon Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by Investigator review in participants who have melanoma without
      BRAF V600 E or K mutations.

      Parts 1 and 2 of the study will also explore the MTD/MAD for open-label Pembro+T (for BRAF
      mutation-negative participants) concurrently with the Pembro+D+T arm; Pembro+D (for BRAF
      mutation-positive participants).
