  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated study to measure the impact of an educational intervention
      of the basic palliative approach for a multidisciplinary staff team of an outpatient HIV
      clinic early in disease trajectory. The study aims to 1) refine a curriculum for
      non-palliative clinicians caring for persons living with HIV disease early in disease
      trajectory; 2) assess the impact of this palliative educational intervention on outcomes for
      2 target populations: a) staff (burn-out and caregiving stress) and b) patients (retention in
      care, mental health, and quality of life). It is hypothesized that training outpatient HIV
      staff in palliative competencies will improve care provided that might, in turn, improve
      clinical outcomes for one group of HIV patients receiving care from the clinic. Quantitative
      data will be augmented by qualitative interviews of selected staff and patients in the final
      year of the study to appreciate response to the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence exists in African populations that palliative care delivered early in HIV disease
      trajectory can improve symptom management and mental health issues. This study represents a
      proof of principle for HIV care delivery in the US using observed distillation of critical
      palliative elements.

      Care and Support Access (CASA) is a complex multidisciplinary care strategy in which a
      palliative approach is integrated into the delivery of standard HIV care, using an iterative
      teaching method and on-site mentored training of site-based care teams. CASA will implement
      patient-centeredness into HIV treatment at the practice setting to improve patient-level
      outcomes for persons with HIV/AIDS known to have difficulty in engaging in care, initiating
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), and remaining in routine follow-up. This lack of retention puts
      them at high risk for experiencing health-related symptoms and poor quality of life (QOL).

      The study design is quasi-experimental with longitudinal observation of the HIV positive
      young men who have sex with men (YMSM) population and staff who deliver their care at two HIV
      outpatient clinics. We will use mixed methods (surveys and qualitative interviews) with
      patients and staff of these clinics.

      The Specific Aims are:

      (1) To refine, deliver and determine the acceptability and applicability of an
      interdisciplinary professional education program to prepare a site-based multidisciplinary
      health care team to demonstrate proficiency in basic palliative domains fundamental to
      patient-centered care being integrated with standard HIV care.

      2) To describe and measure the impact of early integration of a palliative approach upon YMSM
      relative to: a) improvement of mental health status and overall QOL; b) increased retention
      in care measured by clinic attendance and treatment adherence.

      3) To describe and measure the impact upon staff of the early integration of the palliative
      approach with regard to: a) reducing work-related stress and burn-out and, b) obtaining
      insights regarding the CASA experience.

      The anticipated impact of the CASA study will be to improve clinical practice with regard to
      engagement and retention of difficult to engage and retain patient populations by introducing
      a basic palliative approach to care management.
