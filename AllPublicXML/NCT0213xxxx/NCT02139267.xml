      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of GX-188E for the Phase 3 and
      access the efficacy and safety of GX-188E according the protocol in patients with Cervical
      Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3 (CIN3).

      Subjects who are eligible for this study are allocated to one of the two treatment groups of
      GX-188E. All Subject received GX-188E intramuscularly using the electroporator(EP) on
      alternating deltoid muscles which will be performed totally three times during the study
      period.
