      Background and Rationale

      In multiple sclerosis (MS), significant pathology correlating to disease progression, to
      expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and to cognitive decline, takes place outside the
      plaque areas, i.e. in areas of normal appearing white matter and gray matter.
      Neuropathological studies suggest that mechanisms involved in this widespread pathology
      include activation of microglial cells, oxidative stress and deficiency in mitochondrial
      functions. Activated microglia can be detected in vivo with a translocator protein (TSPO),
      expressed in activated, but not resting microglia) binding radioligands and positron emission
      tomography (PET). 11Carbon-PK11195 radioligand is one such radioligand. Importantly, the
      possible effect of MS therapies on microglial activity can be evaluated in patients in vivo
      with PET-imaging performed before and after the treatment.

    <measure>Change of 11C-PK11195-radioligand binding using PET</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be switched to fingolimod from first-line therapies as per indication and as part of their normal treatment regimen, and those who will consent to participate in this investigator-initiated PET study, will be imaged at baseline (pre-treatment phase) and after 6-8 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment. Purpose is to compare the binding of the radioligand between these three time points.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Having signed the informed consent of the investigator-initiated PET study

          -  Age 18 - 58 years at the time of informed consent.

          -  MS according to Poser or McDonald criteria

          -  EDSS score from 0.0 to 6.5.

          -  Moderate to heavy lesion load ( &gt;9 T2 lesions) in MRI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Patients with other neurodegenerative disease than MS

          -  Disease modifying therapy (DMT) within 4 weeks of imaging

          -  Corticosteroid treatment within 4 weeks of imaging

          -  Patients with significant abnormal findings other than MS in the screening MRI.

          -  Patients with claustrophobia, or a history of moderate to severe anxiety disorder or
             panic attacks (which could potentially lead to preterm termination of the imaging)

          -  Contraindication to PET scan investigations

          -  Exposure to experimental radiation in the past 12 months such that radiodosimetry
             limits would be exceeded by participating in this study.

          -  Intolerance to previous PET scans; i.e. previous hypersensitivity reactions to any PET
             ligand or imaging agent or failure to participate in and comply with previous PET
             scans.
