      The study is a Prospective, Open-lable, Multi-center, Randomized trial. 2000 primary coronary
      artery disease patients will be enrolled with a 1:1 randomization ratio(AVI:1000,Firebird
      2:1000) at approximately 40 sites, Subject follow-up be at 30 days, 6 months, 9 months, 12
      months, 2-5 years after procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Ischemic heart symptom and/or myocardial ischemia, include chronic stable/unstable
             coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome(ST elevated MI and Non-ST elevated
             MI)

          3. At least one lesion diameter stenosis(DS) ≥70％, reference vessel diameter between
             ≥2.5mm, and ≤3.5mm.

          4. If the subject has multiple vessel lesions, the implanted stents must be the same
             brand. The staged procedure only be allowed within 3 months after procedure, the
             implanted stent must be the same brand stent as the index procedure.

          5. Subject has no CABG contraindication.

          6. Subject or legal representative is informed the property of the study, understand the
             stipulations in the protocol, ensure the compliance and sign the ICF.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing patients and those who plan to become pregnant up to 1 year post
             index procedure.

          2. Subject has a tendency to bleeding or coagulation disorders, or has contraindication
             of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy, or can't accept the continue DAPT within
             6 months.

          3. Poor compliance or expectation of life less than 1 year.

          4. Implanted any brand stent in the same target vessel within 1 year.

          5. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) of ＜30％

          6. Cardiogenic shock or haemodynamics abnormal, needs inotropic agents or mechanical
             support.

          7. The subject is allergic to asprin, heparin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, stainless steel
             alloy, Arsenic trioxide, sirolimus, styrene-butene-styrene or polylactic acid(PLA)
             polymer and contrast agent.

          8. Severe tortuous and/or heavy calcification lesion.

          9. Two or more proximal chronic total occlusion lesion.

         10. Bifurcation lesions with double stents.

         11. The subject has multi vessel lesions but can not be implanted the same brand stents

         12. The subject that the investigator considers he/she was unfit to implant the AVI stents
             and Firebird 2 stents.

         13. The subject attended other drug/device study or in the follow-up period.
