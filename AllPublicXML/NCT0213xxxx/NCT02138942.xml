    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that the LIR (Learning Intravenous
      Resuscitator) Closed-Loop Fluid Administration System (hereafter the &quot;LIR system&quot;), a new
      device for the automated administration of intravenous fluids during major abominal surgery
      and which allows the reinjection of 250 ml of saline filling (crystalloid or colloid),
      maintains blood volume at values that are acceptable by the &quot;gold standard&quot;, i.e. the
      anesthetist in charge of the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, bi-center, open &quot;Phase II&quot; type study on a medical device (the LIR
      system). It is the first trial of the device on humans.

      The study, which begins at the signing of consent (made the day before or the day of
      surgery), ends when the patient leaves the hospital. The LIR system is used on a small
      population of patients under general anesthesia for the automated administration of
      intravenous fluids during major abdominal surgery by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Several
      criteria describing the fluids administered, cardiac output, blood pressure and other
      parameters will be identified during surgery.

      This Phase II study is carried out in two, subsequent stages of size &quot;n1&quot; = 19 and &quot;n&quot; = 42.

      Strengthening of security :

        -  The device will be used under the direct supervision of an anesthesiologist ; he / she
           can regain control instantly when needed .

        -  An independent oversight committee will be formed and consulted every 10 patients.

    <time_frame>Day 0, just after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A change may be non-validated in the following two situations:
Stopping criteria when using the LIR system:
malfunction of the device
malfunction of the electric syringe (Agilia, Fresenius Kabi, Germany)
an abnormality of cardiac output measurement or appearance of a limitation to the use of pulse pressure variation (cardiac arrhythmia, spontaneous ventilation, tidal volume &lt;7 ml / kg of theoretical ideal weight).
Non-validation criteria for fluid administration despite a positive indication by the LIR device: If the answer to the two following questions are both yes, preventing the LIR device from acting is not theoretically justified, and the anesthesiologist must justify stopping the device and record the reason for his/her non-validation of the administration of fluid therapy.
The last fill increased cardiac output more than 15%? yes/no
The prediction parameter for filling response (pulse pressure variation) indicates vascular filling? yes/no</description>

    <description>The usual patient pathways and recommendations concerning vascular filling remain strictly unchanged in this study.
