      This study will investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation enhances the
      effects of cognitive training in healthy older adults.

    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate methods for enhancing cognitive training effects in
      healthy older adults by employing a combination of interventions facilitating neural
      plasticity and optimizing readiness for learning. Adults over the age of 65 represent the
      fastest growing group in the US population. As such, age-related cognitive decline represents
      a major concern for public health. Recent research suggests that cognitive training in older
      adults can improve cognitive performance, with effects lasting up to 10 years. However, these
      effects are typically limited to the tasks trained, with little transfer to other cognitive
      abilities or everyday skills. An adaptive pilot randomized clinical trial will examine the
      individual and combined impact of pairing cognitive training with transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation that directly
      stimulates brain regions involved in active cognitive function and enhances neural plasticity
      when paired with a training task. We will compare changes in cognitive and brain function
      resulting from CT and CT combined with tDCS using a comprehensive neurocognitive, clinical,
      and multimodal neuroimaging assessment of brain structure, function, and metabolic state.
