    <textblock>
      Intraoperative fluorescent cholangiography (IFC) with concomitant fluorescent angiography is
      a recently developed method for non-invasive visualisation of the relevant anatomy during
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The objective of this study was to assess the time required by
      routine-use of IFC and to evaluate success-rate of the procedures.

      Methods Thirty-five patients scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and operated by the
      same surgeon were consecutively enrolled. A standardized protocol with IFC including
      concomitant angiography was performed during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intra-operative
      time-registration and exposure of predefined anatomical structures were recorded.

    <time_frame>Four months</time_frame>
    <description>The operating surgeon completed a structured questionnaire immediately after each operation regarding anatomical identification by IFC (visible cystic duct, -common bile duct, -common hepatic duct, -right and left hepatic ducts, -cystic artery, -aberrant bile ducts, and/or other abnormalities).
Successful IFC was defined as exposure of the junction between the cystic duct, common bile duct and common hepatic duct by IFC. Success-full fluorescent angiography was defined as adequate visualisation of the cystic artery within Calot´s triangle by the method.</description>

    <description>The investigators included patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy by a single surgeon between September and December 2013 at a single centre university department with unrestricted referral of patients. The included patients represented all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy by one surgeon during the study period. All patients underwent intra-operative fluorescent cholangiography (IFC) with concomitant angiography, according to a standardized protocol, during their laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</description>
