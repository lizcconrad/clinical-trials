  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sub-Saharan Africa, engaging men in HIV prevention, care, and treatment has proven
      challenging. Along all steps of the HIV care-seeking cascade, men exhibit worse care-seeking
      behaviors than women. They are less likely to be tested for HIV, initiate combination
      antiretroviral therapy (cART), and be retained in cART care. Additionally, men rarely engage
      in the care of their female sex partners, even though couple care-seeking is associated with
      marked improvements in condom use within HIV-discordant couples. Option B+, Malawi's program
      for providing immediate, lifelong combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to all
      HIV-infected pregnant women at the time of diagnosis, is an important entry-point for
      involving male partners in care.

      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (N=200 women) comparing two strategies of male
      partner involvement within the Option B+ program. In both arms (patient referral and contract
      referral) women will be encouraged to invite their male partners to accompany them to the
      clinic for couple HIV counseling and testing. In the contract referral arm, if the couple
      does not present within one week, the male partner will receive a home visit encouraging them
      to present to the clinic. We will compare the two arms for 1) uptake of couple HIV counseling
      and testing (cHCT), 2) uptake of cART for women, and 3) linkage to care for HIV-infected men.
      Results are expected to inform a larger trial and ultimately improve care-seeking in Malawi's
      HIV program.

      Objective 1: Determine acceptability of male partner recruitment for cHTC within an Option B+
      context. We will assess acceptability of eligible females to participate in this pilot RCT
      and reasons for non-participation.

      Objective 2: Assess whether study arm (patient referral versus contract referral) is
      associated with cHTC uptake. We will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
      male partner recruitment. This study will contain two arms: patient referral and contract
      referral for uptake of cHTC (primary outcome).
