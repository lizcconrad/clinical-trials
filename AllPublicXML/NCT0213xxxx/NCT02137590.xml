  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of Spanish Black Radish on phase I and phase II enzyme
      activity in healthy adult males. The primary objective is to determine the effect on phase I
      and phase II enzyme activity by measuring plasma and urine acetaminophen metabolite
      concentrations prior to and after a 28 day supplementation period with Spanish black radish
      product.

    <description>The effect on phase I and phase II enzyme activity determined by measuring plasma and urine acetaminophen metabolite concentrations Subjects will ingest 1000 mg of acetaminophen. Blood will be collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after acetaminophen dosage for the analysis of plasma acetaminophen metabolites. These measurements will be performed prior to and after 4 weeks of treatment with Spanish Black Radish product.</description>
