  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate reduction of fluoroscopy time/dosis and safety of atrial fibrillation ablation in
      patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using fluoroscopy image integrated 3-dimentional
      electroanatomical mapping system, comparing to using 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping
      system without fluoroscopy image integration

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel fluoroscopic image integrated 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system is
      designed for minimizing the exposure to X-ray for physician, staff and patients. This
      randomized single-center study is to evaluate the reduction on fluoroscopy levels (time and
      dosis) in catheter interventional treatment of symptomatic, antiarrhythmic refractory
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using fluoroscopic image integrated 3-dimentional
      electroanatomical mapping system, comparing with using 3-dimentional electroanatomical
      mapping system without fluoroscopic image integration. Patients with documented paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation, who are going to receive a catheter interventional treatment to atrial
      fibrillation, will be randomized (1:1) into two groups after signing an informed consent.
      Group 1 (CARTOUNIVU): using fluoroscopic image integrated 3-dimentional electroanatomical
      mapping system. Group 2 (CARTO3): using 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system
      without fluoroscopic image integration.

      The ablation strategies in both study groups are the same, including circumferential
      isolation of ipsilateral pulmonary veins (PV) and voltage map guided substrate modification.
      According to the randomization, the ablation procedure will be performed with or without
      fluoroscopic image integration.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the evaluation of reduction on fluoroscopy levels
      (fluoroscopy time and dosis) during atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. Secondary
      endpoints include complete isolation of the pulmonary veins, completely bidirectional block
      of linear ablation lines, total procedure time, ablation-related complications.
