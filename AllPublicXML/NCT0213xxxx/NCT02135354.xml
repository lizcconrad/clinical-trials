  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project (funded by the IWT-TBM program) will organize a randomized placebo-controlled
      multicenter intervention trial in 500 COPD patients to study the effectiveness and safety of
      azithromycin therapy in the acute setting of COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission.
      Although long-term use of azithromycin is proven effective to prevent exacerbations, inherent
      risks outweigh the benefits. By reducing the dose and duration of the azithromycin treatment
      and by restricting the treatment to acute periods with highest risk for treatment failure,
      benefits may counterbalance potential side effects, which may result in a new treatment
      strategy for these acute events.

      The present study is designed by the services of respiratory medicine of the Leuven and Ghent
      University hospitals but will run in total in 17 different large hospitals in Belgium, of
      which 12 are located in Flanders.

    <textblock>
      In this 9 month, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter intervention
      trial, 500 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either azithromycin or
      placebo on top of standard therapy in the acute treatment of COPD exacerbations requiring
      hospitalization. The study drug (azithromycin or placebo) will be initiated and uploaded
      within 48 hours after hospital admission (500mg once a day for 3 days) and subsequently
      administered for a prolonged period of 3 months at a lower maintenance dose (250mg every 2
      days). An additional follow-up period of 6 months without study drug will be foreseen to
      study relapse after study drug withdrawal.

    <masking_description>The identity of the study drug will be concealed by the use of a format that is identical in packaging, labelling, schedule of administration and appearance.
Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either azithromycin or placebo, with a permuted block size of ten and sequential assignment, stratified by the center.
Randomization of the study drug is based on an online generated randomization schedule (http://www.randomization.com). Unique randomization codes are locally obtained through a secured Web-based program.
At all times, randomization codes are kept strictly confidential during the study, with the exception of an ad hoc independent safety committee adjudicating cardiovascular side effects and mortality after 300 patients.
Nevertheless, code breaks will be available at the site and un-blinding may occur in the case of an emergency which will require knowledge of the treatment assignment.</masking_description>

    <measure>Time to clinical failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed between day 1 (from 1 hour after first drug intake) till day 90 (24 hours after last study drug intake)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical failure is a composite endpoint as multiple clinical interventions may indicate that an initiated therapy is failing. Clinical failure is defined as the composite of death, treatment intensification (additional dose of systemic steroids, switch antibiotics for respiratory reasons or new course of systemic steroids and/or antibiotics) and step up in hospital care for respiratory reasons (from ward to ICU during index event, or from home to ward or ICU (new admission) after discharge).
