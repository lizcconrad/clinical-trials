  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-to-peer program (P2P) in
      addition to Shared Medical Appointments (SMAs) compared to SMAs alone for the treatment of
      diabetes in five VA health systems, and to study the implementation process in order to
      gather information required to disseminate the program more broadly in the VHA system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Providers are often unable to communicate as frequently as needed with diabetes patients who
      have poor risk factor control and face significant self-management challenges. Moreover, many
      VA patients face barriers to attending frequent face-to-face visits. This project will
      evaluate the implementation of a novel program found in a recent VA randomized, controlled
      trial to significantly improve VA patients' diabetes-specific social support, insulin starts,
      and glycemic control compared to usual nurse care management. The program uses periodic group
      sessions in conjunction with calls between paired patients with diabetes to promote more
      effective care management as well as peer-to-peer (P2P) communication among diabetes patients
      who both have poor glycemic control and are working on similar care goals. &quot;Peer buddies&quot; are
      encouraged to talk by phone at least weekly to provide mutual support and share their
      progress on meeting their self-management goals. The goal of this service is to enhance the
      effect of shared medical appointments (SMAs), a service model demonstrated to be effective in
      improving outcomes among patients with diabetes and other chronic conditions and now being
      widely implemented in VA. Based on the success of the efficacy trial of this intervention,
      the investigators now seek to evaluate a wider-scale implementation of this program. During
      implementation of the P2P program in conjunction with shared medical appointments (SMAs) in
      five diverse VA facilities, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of SMAs alone
      and SMAs+P2P compared to usual care, and study the implementation process in order to gather
      information required to disseminate the program more broadly in Veterans Health
      Administration (VHA).

    <description>Glycemic control (measured by Hemoglobin A1c) in each group will be assessed by the comparison of an average of the values obtained during routine outpatient clinical practice in 6-month windows preceding baseline and following the 6 and 12-month post-enrollment evaluation periods. In addition to measuring absolute values of HbA1c, the investigators will also examine the change in the percentage of patients with an average HbA1c &gt; 8%.</description>

    <description>The number of participants who are not on insulin at baseline and are started on insulin during the 6 month and 12-18 month post-enrollment periods will be totaled and compared for the SMA group, the SMA+P2P group, and the no intervention control group. For the no intervention control group, baseline will be the date they are identified by the data manager. For the SMA and SMA+P2P groups, baseline will be the date of the first SMA.</description>

Outpatient visits will be limited to those clinics most likely to be impacted by the intervention (e.g., primary care visits, diabetes specialty visits, and nurse visits).</description>
