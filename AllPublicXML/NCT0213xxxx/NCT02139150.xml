  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if PET/CT scans that use a radioactive substance called
      [18F] fluorothymidine (FLT), can detect and monitor changes in the tumor. Radioactive
      substances are used with PET/CT scans to &quot;see&quot; cancer cells, and are also called
      radiotracers. FLT is a new radiotracer that has been given to people in prior studies. FLT
      PET/CT is an experimental scan unlike FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET scan which is a standard
      clinical scan and is commonly used. The investigators would like to know if there is any
      evidence of early treatment response by obtaining FLTPET/ CT scans before and after
      treatment.

      This protocol is an &quot;umbrella&quot; or &quot;companion&quot; protocol to be used in conjunction with other
      protocols that are evaluating treatment response in solid or hematologic malignancies. The
      aim of this protocol is to determine if PET imaging with the proliferation marker 18FFLT can
      monitor changes in FLT uptake parameters, in particular changes in the standardized uptake
      value (SUV), within tumor target lesions.

    <measure>change from pre- to posttreatment</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will describe the distribution of the change and explore if it is associated with the findings of standard-of-care imaging such as FDG-PET or CT/MRI using rank based methods such as Spearman correlation and the signed-ranks test. In addition we will also explore the value of the change in the FLT metrics in predicting the clinical outcome using logistic regression (for response) and proportional hazards regression (for progression and survival).</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a target injection of up to 10 mCi of FLT. Optionally, dynamic PET imaging over a chosen index lesion (based on size and/or high FDG-avidity on preceding CT and/or FDG PET/CT scans done for clinical purpose such as staging), may be performed. Otherwise, static PET images are obtained at approximately 60 min (+15 min) post FLT injection. In general this &quot;body&quot; scan will cover at least the region from skull base to the upper thigh for extracranial malignancies; depending on the specific location, extremities maybe also be scanned (e.g., extremity sarcoma), or the scan may be restricted to the brain (e.g. glioma).</description>
