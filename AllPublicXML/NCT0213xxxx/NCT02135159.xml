      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal sequences of combined trastuzumab
      emtansine (T-DM1) and whole-brain radiotherapy in patients presenting brain metastases from
      HER2-positive breast cancer in terms of acute toxicities and blood/cerebrospinal fluid T-DM1
      pharmacokinetics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.

          2. HER-2 positive primary tumor, defined as: IHC3+, or IHC2+ and ISH positive.

          3. Non operable brain metastases (n ≥ 2) with at least one measurable CNS lesion ≥ 10 mm
             on T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced MRI.

          4. No stereotaxie radiotherapy indication

          5. At least two weeks from any specific breast cancer treatment (such as Trastuzumab,
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy/biological response modifiers, endocrine therapy and
             radiotherapy).

          6. Adequate hematologic function (ANC ≥1x109/L, platelets ≥100 000/L; Hb &gt;10g/dL), renal
             function (creatinine ≤ 1.5x UNL) and hepatic function (albumin ≥2.5 g/dL; serum
             bilirubin ≤1.5x ULN unless due to Gilbert's syndrome; AST and ALT ≤ 5x ULN if
             documented liver metastasis or ≤ 3x ULN without liver metastasis).

          7. At least 18 years old.

          8. ECOG Performance Status of 0 to 2.

          9. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.

         10. Potentially reproductive patients must agree to use an effective contraceptive method
             while on treatment, beginning 2 weeks before the first dose of investigational product
             and for 28 days after the final dose of investigational product for women. Males able
             to father a child must practice adequate methods of birth control or practice complete
             abstinence from intercourse from the first dose of investigational treatment until one
             week after the final dose of investigational treatment.

         11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days of enrollment and/or urine pregnancy test 48 hours prior to the administration of
             the first study treatment.

         12. Patients must be affiliated to a Social Security System.

         13. Patient information and written informed consent form signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or brain stereotaxie radiotherapy.

          2. Planned or concurrent systemic treatment or radiation therapy (other than
             corticosteroid, bisphosphonates or mannitol).

          3. Known contra-indication to MRI.

          4. Active concurrent malignancy. If there is a history of prior malignancy, the patient
             must be disease free for at least 10 years.

          5. Patients with other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease which could
             compromise participation in the study, such as :

               -  infection,

               -  cardiac disease such as uncontrolled hypertension, congestive cardiac failure,
                  ventricular arrhythmias, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction
                  within one year, LVEF ≤ 50%,

               -  current active hepatic or renal disease

          6. Pregnant women, women who are likely to become pregnant or are breast-feeding.

          7. Patients with significantly altered mental status prohibiting the understanding of the
             study or with psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.

          8. Known hypersensibility to any component of T-DM1

          9. Patients who received any other investigational drugs within the 30 days prior to the
             screening visit.

         10. Individual deprived of liberty or placed under the authority of a tutor.

         11. Leptomeningeal metastases diagnosed by MRI

         12. Inclusion in another protocol within 30 days

         13. Brain metastases with severe intracranial hypertension clinical signs

             carcinoma
