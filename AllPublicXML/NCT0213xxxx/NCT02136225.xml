    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine the implementation and effectiveness of an
      intervention, delivered in a health care setting, to decrease home firearm access by youth.
      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. parents who receive means restriction education provided by their primary care provider
           will be more likely to report, at the one month and one year follow-up, that they are
           storing their guns locked compared to parents who do not receive means restriction
           counseling.

        2. parents who receive a free gun locking device(s) will be more likely to report, at the
           one month and one year follow-up, that they are storing their guns locked compared to
           parents who receive means restriction counseling alone;

        3. parents whose adolescents are assessed at high risk for violence (&gt; 5 on the Violence
           Injury Protection and Risk Screen (VIPRS)) or depression (&gt;9 on the Patient Health
           Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)) will be more likely to report storing their gun(s) locked at
           the one month follow-up compared to parents whose children are assessed as low risk,
           regardless of whether they receive the counseling alone or counseling plus free locking
           devices and 4) youth whose parents receive a free gun locking device(s) will be more
           likely to report less access to guns, at one year follow-up, compared to parents who
           receive means restriction counseling alone.
