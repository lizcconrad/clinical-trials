    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study of Rabies Immune Globulin (Human),
      Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (RIG-C), in approximately 12 healthy subjects. The purpose
      of this study is to characterize the rabies virus-specific antibody titer after a single
      intramuscular injection of 20 IU/kg RIG-C and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      RIG-C.
