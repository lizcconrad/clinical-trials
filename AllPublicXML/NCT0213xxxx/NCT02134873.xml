  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies show that babies in hospital undergo an average of 4 to 5 painful procedures,
      such as heel lances, every day. Sucrose (sugar water) has been shown to be effective for
      reducing pain during invasive procedures and is a standard of care for painful procedures.
      The purpose of this study is to see what is the least amount of sucrose that can be given to
      a baby to reduce pain during procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants in the NICU receive an average of 4 - 5 painful procedures daily for diagnostic and
      therapeutic purposes; less than half receive interventions to manage pain. Both immediate and
      long term effects of unmanaged pain in these vulnerable infants have been reported, including
      impaired brain development. To ensure optimal outcomes for hospitalized infants in NICUs,
      there is a crucial need to minimize procedural pain and its associated consequences. Multiple
      clinical trials have identified sucrose as an effective strategy for reducing procedural pain
      in infants. Despite its inclusion in neonatal pain guidelines, standards, and consensus
      statements sucrose has been inconsistently used. The under-utilization of sucrose may be
      explained by knowledge gaps in relation to the minimally effective dose and the influence of
      concurrent opioid analgesia, as well as the short and long-term effects of repeated
      administration. Once infants in the NICU are determined to be eligible for the study and
      parents consent, infants will be randomized to one of 3 dose of sucrose and their pain will
      be assessed using a validated pain assessment measure.

    <description>Sucrose will be administered by a research nurse experienced in neonatal intensive care using a standardized procedure and timing consistent with policies in the participating units, including: (a) administering sucrose 2 minutes prior to the heel lance to ensure peak effects; (b) giving the total volume of sucrose drop by drop via syringe on the anterior surface of the tongue, as tolerated, over a period of up to 1 minute to allow for individual infant swallowing rates and to ensure analgesic effects are sustained during the heel lance procedure; and (c) offering a pacifier for non-nutritive sucking (NNS) immediately following sucrose administration.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants 24 to 42 weeks gestational age (GA) at birth, admitted to the Neonatal
             Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and scheduled to receive a heel lance will be eligible.
             Parents will be approached for participation within the first 2 weeks of the infant's
             life. Infants will be eligible for Trial 1, the non-opioid trial, if they have not
             received any opioids within 24 hours prior to the heel lance. Infants will be eligible
             for Trial 2, the opioid trial, if they are currently receiving an opioid infusion.
             Furthermore, observation of the procedures will be timed to ensure that no additional
             sucrose doses are provided within the previous 4 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants will be excluded if they have a contraindication for sucrose administration
             (e.g., unable to swallow, pharmacologically muscle relaxed, or heavily sedated) due to
             safety concerns and/or inability to assess pain accurately (e.g., unable to clearly
             view the infant's face).
