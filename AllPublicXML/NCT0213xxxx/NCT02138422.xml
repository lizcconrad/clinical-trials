    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to assess how effective Xilonix is in the
      treatment of patients with symptomatic colorectal cancer. By blocking a substance that helps
      tumours grow and spread, Xilonix therapy may not only slow tumour growth, but also may
      improve symptoms of muscle loss, fatigue, appetite loss, and pain in patients with colorectal
      cancer. The effectiveness of the therapy will be measured by assessing the change in these
      symptoms for patients treated with Xilonix versus those treated with placebo. Reversal of
      muscle loss will be assessed with a type of X-ray called a DEXA scanner. Improvement in pain,
      appetite loss, and fatigue will be measured with a questionnaire that is completed by
      patients enrolled on the trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with pathologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma that is metastatic or
             unresectable and which is refractory to standard therapy. To be considered refractory,
             a subject must have failed both an oxaliplatin (oxaliplatin may have been in the
             adjuvant setting) and an irinotecan based regimen.

          2. Symptomatic Disease: One symptom from each domain (metabolic and functional) must be
             present.

               -  Evidence of metabolic dysfunction, defined as the presence of one or more of the
                  following:

               -  Any degree (up to 20%) of unintentional total body weight loss in the previous 6
                  months

               -  Serum Interleukin 6 levels ≥10 pg/ml

               -  Evidence of reduced function or presence of cancer related symptoms as determined
                  by EORTC QLQ-C30.

               -  Appetite reduction, with a score of &gt;10

               -  Presence of fatigue, with a score of &gt;10

               -  Presence of Pain, with a score of &gt;10

               -  Decreased Role, Emotional and Social function, with a score of &lt; 90.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 1 or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mechanical obstruction that would prevent adequate oral nutritional intake.

          2. &gt;20% total body weight loss in the previous 6 months.

          3. Serious uncontrolled medical disorder, or active infection, that would impair the
             ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy.

          4. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including:

               -  A myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.

               -  Uncontrolled angina within the past 3 months.

               -  Congestive heart failure within the past 3 months, if defined as NYHC-II.

               -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome.

               -  Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as
                  ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW)
                  syndrome, or torsade de pointes).

               -  Any history of second or third degree heart block (may be eligible if currently
                  have a pacemaker).

               -  Heart rate &lt; 50 beats per minute on pre-entry electrocardiogram.

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;150 mm Hg systolic and &gt;95 mm Hg

             Extensive radiation therapy is defined as treatment of more than one axial bony
             metastasis. However for subjects with rectal cancer pelvic irradiation, in addition to
             treatment of one axial bony metastasis, is acceptable.
