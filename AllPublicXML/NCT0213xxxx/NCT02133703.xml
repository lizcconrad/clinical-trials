  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-therapeutic trial is for women who have received results of genetic testing for
      BRCA1/2 mutations. The trial compares decision support tools designed to facilitate informed
      decision making regarding risk management following testing to usual care. The researchers
      will test separate decision support tools for women who receive positive test results and
      women who receive negative/inconclusive test results. Among women who receive a positive test
      result, an interactive decision support intervention will be compared to a print
      intervention. Among women who receive an inconclusive result, an interactive intervention
      will be compared to usual care.
