  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1 trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and
      tolerability of oritavancin in patients &lt;18 years old with a confirmed or suspected bacterial
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, PK, safety and tolerability study of oritavancin
      in pediatric patients (&lt;18 years of age) with suspected or confirmed Gram-positive bacterial
      infections. Approximately 52 patients will be enrolled at 5-10 US centers. This study will
      include 5 age cohorts and patients will be entered in a stepwise approach starting with the
      older age cohort (12-&lt;18 years). The starting dose will be IV oritavancin 15 mg/kg. The
      safety, tolerability and PK data will be reviewed at the completion of each cohort to ensure
      safety and determine the appropriate dose for the next age cohort. At least 8 patients will
      be enrolled in each cohort except for the birth to &lt;3 month age cohort which will have at
      least 16 patients enrolled. Three PK samples will be collected over 14 days. The safety
      follow-up will complete with a 60-day phone call to the caregiver.

          -  Suspected or confirmed Gram positive bacterial infection receiving antibiotic therapy

          -  Intravenous access to administer study drug

          -  In the investigator's opinion, the patient will require hospitalization for at least

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Septic shock or acute haemodynamic instability.

          -  History of immune-related hypersensitivity reaction to glycopeptides (such as
             vancomycin, televancin, or teicoplanin) or any of their excipients.

          -  Subjects who have taken vancomycin, telavancin, teicoplanin or other glycopeptide
             within 24 hours of screening or who are anticipated to need these drugs within 48
             hours after administration of study drug.

          -  Females who are of childbearing potential and unwilling to practice abstinence or use

             control during the entire study period

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would put

             the study drug.

          -  Patients whom the investigator considers unlikely to adhere to the protocol, comply
             with study drug administration, or complete the clinical study

          -  Treatment with investigational medicinal product or investigational device within 30
             days (or 5 times the half-life of the investigational medicine, whichever is longer)
             before enrollment and for the duration of the study.

          -  Any clinically significant disease or condition affecting a major organ system,
             including but not limited to gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrinologic,
             broncho-pulmonary, neurological, metabolic or cardiovascular disease.
