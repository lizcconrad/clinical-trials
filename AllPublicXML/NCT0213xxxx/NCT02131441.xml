  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical experience showed that laparoscopic hepatectomy has advantages of minimally
      invasive compared to open liver resection, however, laparoscopic liver resection is still
      difficult and risky. Currently it is only carried out in a few large medical centers with
      slow development. The related research studies were retrospective analysis, there were no
      prospective randomized controlled multi-center study reported. Because of its relatively
      simple anatomical advantages, left liver seems to be as the best platform to ensure maximum
      safety and feasibility of prospective randomized study for laparoscopic hepatectomy .This
      project intends to carry out a prospective randomized controlled multi-center study to look
      for evidence of safety, efficacy and minimally invasive of laparoscopic left liver resection,
      evaluate the long-term efficacy including overall survival, disease-free survival as well as
      time to disease recurrence for the left liver carcinoma.
