    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with malignant mesothelioma of the lung lining (called pleura) who
      have had previous chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen whose disease has progressed.
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive, frequently drug resistant, and
      incurable disease that is increasing in incidence in the UK and worldwide. All patients with
      MPM will relapse following first line chemotherapy and at present, there is no standard
      treatment available for patients in the second line setting. The vinca alkaloid chemotherapy
      drug vinorelbine has shown promising activity in a single arm UK trial. However to date,
      there has been no randomised evaluation of vinorelbine in mesothelioma in the second line
      setting. In addition, there have been no trials which have looked at underlying molecular
      changes in mesothelioma which may predict vinorelbine efficacy; This might allow vinorelbine
      to be used in patients only where there is a chance of benefit. Studies suggest that
      vinorelbine requires a gene called BRCA1 (shown to be absent in 38% of mesothelioma cases) in
      order to induce cell death in mesothelioma. The VIM trial aims to establish whether
      vinorelbine in patients with MPM helps them live longer and whether the BRCA1 gene is helpful
      in selecting patients most likely to benefit from treatment.

      Patients will be randomised (1:2) to receive either active symptom control (ASC) (which is
      all supportive care deemed necessary for pain management excluding disease modifying
      treatment) or ASC with vinorelbine. Patients will continue vinorelbine treatment until
      evidence of disease progression (or unacceptable toxicity to the drug or patient withdrawal).
      If vinorelbine activity is demonstrated, we will use the results from this trial to inform
      the design of a future phase III trial.

    <description>Anti-tumour activity of vinorelbine will also be measured by progression free survival. We will document time from randomisation to any disease progression and/or death, defined according to strict RECIST v1.1.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The toxicity profile of oral vinorelbine in this setting will be used to assess safety. An independent data monitoring committee will convene and assess safety 6 months after the first patient has been randomised. If the trial is deemed safe to continue then safety will be assessed again approx every 6 months. Toxicity data will be assessed alongside serious adverse events.</description>

    <description>Tumour and blood samples will be collected for future translational research. BRCA1 expression as a putative predictor of vinorelbine sensitivity will be measured primarily in the samples.</description>

    <description>Vinorelbine was first licensed in the UK for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and advanced breast cancer in 1997. Vinorelbine (Navelbine®) is a semi-synthetic, third generation, vinca alkaloid. The cytotoxic effect of vinorelbine is through the disruption of mitotic spindle formation, blocking mitosis at the G2-M stage resulting in cell death.</description>
