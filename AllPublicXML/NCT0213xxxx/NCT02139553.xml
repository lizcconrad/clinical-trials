  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rhythmic upper-limb movement training in
      post-stroke patients allows to improve only this particular type of movements or if it also
      improves some parameters of discrete movements. Based on our results we hope to be able to
      answer a fundamental question: are rhythmic and discrete movements two independent
      primitives?

      Patients are assessed four times during this longitudinal study. One month separates the
      first two assessment, next patients are trained 12 times during one month with rhythmic
      movement training on an end-effector robot. After this month, patients are assessed a third
      time and three months later a fourth time in order to study long-time benefits of the
      therapy.

    <description>Patients undergo a first evaluation, and a second evaluation one month later to determine their natural evolution. The following month, patients get 12 sessions of rhythmic therapy. A third evaluation is organized straight after this month and a fourth evaluation, 3 months after to assess the after-effects of the therapy.</description>
