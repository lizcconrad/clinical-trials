  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pirfenidone as anti-fibrosis drug developed in recent years demonstrated the potential anti-
      fibrotic effect, but so far there were no domestic studies about pirfenidone's efficacy and
      safety evaluation in china. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      pirfenidone in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) through the observation of a
      large sample of clinical cases.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) through the observation of a large sample of clinical
      cases. During the observation, study visits will occur at the end of 12w, 24w, 36w, 48w.all
      participants will be required to check the various efficacy and safety indicators.
