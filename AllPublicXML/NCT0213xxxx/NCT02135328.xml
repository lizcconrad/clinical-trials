  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a community based participatory action research (CBPAR)
      approach to 1) create &quot;radio stories&quot; about Somali, Latino and Hmong families' real success
      stories with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in managing their disease through implementation
      of healthful lifestyle behaviors (nutrition and physical activity), and 2) test the
      effectiveness and acceptability of radio stories on participant intentions to engage in or
      improve healthful lifestyle behaviors. Participants in the Intervention condition listened to
      the &quot;radio stories&quot; and the participants in the control condition listened to an audio
      brochure with relevant information. We hypothesized that the intervention participants would
      report higher intensions to engage in various healthful lifestyle behaviors than the control
      participants after both participants listened to their respective health information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the high rate of type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes) in minority and immigrant
      communities, implementing culturally and linguistically appropriate health promotion
      activities that improve families' diet and physical activity behaviors is imperative. &quot;Radio
      Stories&quot; is an education entertainment strategy that has significant potential as a health
      promotion tool. Through a CBPAR process, we aimed to create and test the effectiveness and
      acceptability of &quot;SoLaHmo Radio Stories&quot; about changing knowledge and behaviors to prevent or
      manage diabetes for Somali, Latino, and Hmong families.

      Methods: SoLaHmo community researchers interview 3 families (1 Somali, 1 Latino, and 1 Hmong)
      who have successfully implemented lifestyle changes to prevent or manage diabetes, and then
      create 3 &quot;radio stories&quot; based on the families' experiences. To test the stories, we are
      conducting a two-arm trial that includes intervention groups (20 people per community) that
      listen to the radio stories and control groups (20 people per community) that receive a
      brochure with similar information (N=120). Effectiveness and acceptability of the program
      will be tested with pre-and post questionnaires.

      Anticipated Results: Higher rates of satisfaction, increased knowledge, and intention to
      change in participants receiving the radio stories, as compared to control group
      participants, will indicate radio story program effectiveness and acceptability.

    <description>The baseline and follow-up survey questions to test the &quot;radio stories&quot; included 15 items referring to intentions to change or improve a specific diet, physical activity, and health related behavior. There were four Likert scale response categories, from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree.' In addition, the follow-up survey included questions to assess participant perceptions of the radio stories relating to their emotional connection to the story, relevance with their own experience, believability, and increase awareness and concern about type 2 diabetes.</description>
