      The aims of the present study are to evaluate the concentrations of vitamin D in the plasma
      and of calcium in the plasma and in the urine as well as to evaluate bone mineral density
      using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT), after supplementation of vitamin D
      with 30µg (1200 IU) and 40µg (1600 IU), in comparison with currently recommended
      supplementation of vitamin D with 10µg (400 IU). In this pilot study supplementation is given
      to infants from 2 weeks of age to 3 months of age.

      Vitamin D deficiency is common around the world. In Finland vitamin D levels are low in all
      age groups. Especially infants are predisposed to vitamin D deficiency. Partly this is due to
      low exposure to sunlight but mainly it is due to low dietary intake of vitamin D. Vitamin D
      prophylaxis was introduced in Finland in the 1950´s to overcome rickets. However, the
      recommended dose has decreased from 50µg (2000 IU) in the 1960´s to 10µg (400 IU) from
      beginning of the 1990´s. The serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25OHD) is used as
      a marker of vitamin D status in the body. Although there is no consensus of optimal
      concentration of S-25OHD, it has been proposed that concentrations lower than 50 nmol/l
      indicate deficiency. According to recent findings on 25-OHD concentrations in Finnish
      children, currently recommended intake of vitamin D is inadequate.
