    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether using losartan and amlodipine together will be non-inferior
      in lowering blood pressure than amlodipine alone.

    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (MSDBP) at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic blood pressure was assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment with the participant in a seated position using an auto sphygmomanometer. Three measurements were performed at 2-minute intervals and the average of the 3 values of was recorded.</description>

    <description>Diastolic blood pressure was assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with the participant in a seated position using an auto sphygmomanometer. Three measurements were performed at 2-minute intervals and the average of the 3 values of was recorded.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Target Blood Pressure at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were evaluated at Week 8 to ascertain if target blood pressure had been obtained. Criteria for meeting target BP were: sitting diastolic BP (sitDBP) &lt;90mmHg or sitting systolic BP (sitSBP) &lt;140mmHg) or sitDBP change more than 10mmHg from baseline or sitSBP change more than 20mmHg from baseline.</description>

    <description>Participants were evaluated at Week 4 to ascertain if target blood pressure had been obtained. Criteria for meeting target BP were: sitting diastolic BP (sitDBP) &lt;90mmHg or sitting systolic BP (sitSBP) &lt;140mmHg) or sitDBP change more than 10mmHg from baseline or sitSBP change more than 20mmHg from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Had Peripheral Edema During the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A pitting assessment of edema on both legs was performed at baseline and throughout the study. Participants were assessed in a seated position with both feet extended and the right ankle in a neutral dorsiflexion position. The index finger was pressed firmly over the bony prominence approximately 3cm proximal to the midpoint of the medial malleolus of the right ankle and will be held for three seconds. Presence of a residual indentation in the area after releasing pressure on the index finger was considered positive for pitting edema.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ankle Circumference at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Each ankle was marked with a semi-permanent marker at approximately 3 cm proximal to the midpoint of the medial malleolus to aid consistency in the performance of the measurements. Ankle circumference was measured in both ankles at baseline and Week 8 using a tension controlled tape to minimize error.</description>

        <description>A pitting assessment of edema on both legs was performed at baseline and throughout the study. Participants were assessed in a seated position with both feet extended and the right ankle in a neutral dorsiflexion position. The index finger was pressed firmly over the bony prominence approximately 3cm proximal to the midpoint of the medial malleolus of the right ankle and will be held for three seconds. Presence of a residual indentation in the area after releasing pressure on the index finger was considered positive for pitting edema.</description>
