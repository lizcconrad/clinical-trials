      STUDY PROTOCOL:

      The study will include 30 patients ages 18-80y that had a gastroscopy for various reasons.
      The patients should not be on PPI therapy . If during the gastroscopy there are some
      pathologies that require a second look endoscopy after some weeks of therapy (ulcers or
      esophagitis), the investigators will repeat the gastroscopy within a month.

      During the first gastroscopy a biopsy will be taken for histological examination and for a
      rapid urease test and an urea breath test will be done soon after the procedure.

      If one of the tests is positive the investigators postulate that the Helicobacter pylori is
      actually present.

      After the gastroscopy the patient is given a full dose of PPI (as indicated) and helicobacter
      tests are repeated in the next endoscopy (under PPI therapy) . Any positive test that become
      negative in the second endoscopy is considered false negative.
