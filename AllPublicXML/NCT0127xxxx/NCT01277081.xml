    <measure>Breathing Scores Post 15 Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A mean breathing score was calculated at baseline, 30 seconds, 2, 5 and 15 minutes, derived from participant responses to questions relating to breathing i.e. &quot;my breathing feels easy&quot;, &quot;I feel airways are open&quot;, &quot;I feel a cooling sensation in my throat&quot;, &quot;I can feel the air flowing to my lungs easily&quot;, &quot;My nose feels less blocked&quot; and &quot;I feel my breathing is comfortable&quot;. The breathing scores were rated by the participants on a 5 point (0-4) rating scale with '0' being labeled as 'strongly disagree' and '4' being labeled as 'strongly agree'. For each participant, a mean score was derived by summing the responses and dividing by the number of questions answered.</description>

    <measure>Cold Symptoms Score Post 15 Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A mean Cold symptom score was calculated at baseline, 30 seconds, 2, 5 and 15 minutes from participant responses to questions relating to cold symptoms i.e. &quot;My head feels clear&quot;, &quot;I feel soothing in my throat&quot; and &quot;I feel my cough is being soothed&quot;. The cold symptom scores were rated by the participants on a 5 point (0-4) rating scale with '0' being labeled as 'strongly disagree' and '4' being labeled as 'strongly agree'.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 15 and 60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Soothing attribute of test treatment was assessed by asking the question &quot;if the hot drink is soothing&quot; at baseline, 15 and 60 minutes. The response to the question was rated by participants on a 5 point (0-4) rating scale with '0' being labeled as 'strongly disagree' and '4' being labeled as 'strongly agree'.</description>

    <description>Overall cold symptom score was assessed by asking the question &quot;my cold symptoms are improved&quot; only post consuming the drink at baseline, 15 and 60 minutes . The response to the question was rated by participants on a 5 point (0-4) rating scale with '0' being labeled as 'strongly disagree' and '4' being labeled as 'strongly agree'.</description>

        <description>A mean breathing score was calculated at baseline, 30 seconds, 2, 5 and 15 minutes, derived from participant responses to questions relating to breathing i.e. “my breathing feels easy”, “I feel airways are open”, “I feel a cooling sensation in my throat”, “I can feel the air flowing to my lungs easily”, “My nose feels less blocked” and “I feel my breathing is comfortable”. The breathing scores were rated by the participants on a 5 point (0-4) rating scale with ‘0’ being labeled as ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘4’ being labeled as ‘strongly agree’. For each participant, a mean score was derived by summing the responses and dividing by the number of questions answered.</description>

        <title>Breathing Score Post 60 Minutes</title>
        <description>A mean breathing score was calculated at baseline, 30 seconds, 2, 5, 15 and 60 minutes, derived from participant responses to questions relating to breathing i.e. “my breathing feels easy”, “I feel airways are open”, “I feel a cooling sensation in my throat”, “I can feel the air flowing to my lungs easily”, “My nose feels less blocked” and “I feel my breathing is comfortable”. The breathing scores were rated by the participants on a 5 point (0-4) rating scale with ‘0’ being labeled as ‘strongly disagree’ and ‘4’ being labeled as ‘strongly agree’. For each participant, a mean score was derived by summing the responses and dividing by the number of questions answered.</description>
