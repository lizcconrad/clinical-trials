    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if Eculizumab (Soliris®) can safely be used in
      addition to conventional therapy in patients with active ANCA (Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic
      Autoantibodies ) vasculitis and lead to a more rapid decrease in disease activity.

      ANCA vasculitis is an inflammation of the small vessels whereby ANCA antibodies
      inappropriately activate one's own white blood cells (neutrophils) and cause damage to the
      small blood vessels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent laboratory studies have identified that an important pathway of inflammation called
      the &quot;complement pathway&quot; may play an important role in how Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic
      Autoantibodies (ANCA) cause damage to the blood vessels. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody
      that targets a key component of the complement pathway named C5, and blocks its activation.

      In a mouse model of ANCA vasculitis, it has been shown that blocking C5 activation can block
      the development of vasculitis or greatly reduce its severity.

      The researchers in this study would like to see if taking eculizumab, in addition to the
      drugs usually used to treat ANCA vasculitis, would be beneficial in treating ANCA vasculitis.

      Currently, the conventional treatment of ANCA vasculitis consists of corticosteroids and
      cyclophosphamide. The corticosteroids are given as by vein (methylprednisolone) for 3 days
      followed by prednisone by mouth daily for about 4-5 months. Cyclophosphamide is typically
      given by vein every 4 weeks for at least 3 months, but sometimes longer depending on whether
      the vasculitis is still active or not. After the vasculitis is in remission, a maintenance
      treatment with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil may be used. For patients who cannot
      tolerate cyclophosphamide, or who have received it in large doses previously, another
      medication called rituximab may be used instead. However, patients who need rituximab or have
      recently been treated with rituximab cannot participate in this study.

      The study drug, eculizumab, is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for indications
      other than ANCA vasculitis. It is an investigational drug and it is NOT FDA-approved for the
      treatment of ANCA vasculitis.

      In this study, eculizumab will be given in addition to the standard of care treatment for the
      patients that will be randomised to the eculizumab group.

    <description>induction : pulse methyl prednisolone (7 mg/kg/day x3) then prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 60 mg/day) for 4 weeks, then taper over the following 12 weeks. Cyclophosphamide starting at 0.75 gm/m2 IV (decreased to 0.5 gm/m^2 for patients &gt; than 70 or with estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt; 20 ml/min) to be titrated up to 1 gm/m^2 depending on the 2 week white blood count (WBC) nadir &gt; 3000 cell/μL. Subsequent cyclophosphamide will be given every 4 weeks for at least 2 more doses. Once complete remission for 2 months, patient may be switched from cyclophosphamide to maintenance therapy with azathioprine 1.5-2 mg/kg/day for 6-9 months (to a total of 12 months of therapy) .
For patients who cannot tolerate cyclophosphamide, or who have received it in large doses previously, another medication called rituximab may be used instead. However, if rituximab is indicated for the patient, he cannot participate in the study.</description>

    <description>In addition to conventional therapy, patients randomized to eculizumab will receive 600 mg by IV infusion over 35 minutes every 7 days for the first 4 weeks, then 900 mg by IV infusion for the fifth dose 7 days later (week 5), then 900 mg every 14 days thereafter, for a total of 9 doses (about 3 months of treatment). This dosing scheme is based on that used for the treatment of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH). The length of treatment is shorter than for PNH, based on a desire to target the addition of eculizumab to the period of maximal disease activity, while limiting the risks of infectious complications in this first pilot study.</description>
