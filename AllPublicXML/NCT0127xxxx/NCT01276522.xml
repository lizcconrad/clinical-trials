  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schnitzler syndrome is a disabling inflammatory disease, characterized by chronic urticaria,
      fever, arthralgia, bone pain and gammopathy, which can so far only be effectively treated
      with anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. However, this drug is not registered for
      use in Schnitzler syndrome, and it needs to be injected daily, which is uncomfortable and
      unpractical. Therefore other treatments targeting IL-1 are needed. Canakinumab is a
      long-acting monoclonal antibody against IL-1β that has been registered for bimonthly use in
      the rare autoinflammatory disease Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). We
      hypothesize that it will be effective in Schnitzler syndrome too in view of clinical
      similarities to CAPS and the targeting of IL-1B, which is also blocked by anakinra (which
      blocks both IL-1B and IL-1A).

      This is a 6-month open-label, single treatment arm study of canakinumab 150 or 300 mg (in
      case of insufficient response to 150 mg) subcutaneous injection once per month in patients
      with active Schnitzler syndrome, in which efficacy and safety will be assessed.

      More on Canakinumab:

      Canakinumab is a high-affinity human monoclonal anti-human interleukin-1β (IL-1β)antibody of
      the IgG1/k isotype), developed for the treatment of IL-1β driven inflammatory diseases.
      Canakinumab binds human IL-1β and functionally neutralizes the bioactivity of this
      pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-1β is produced mainly by mononuclear phagocytes in response to
      injury and infection and plays a dominant role in the pathobiology of autoinflammatory
      syndromes (e.g. Cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome, CAPS), systemic Juvenile Idiopathic
      Arthritis and gout. Canakinumab is expected to treat the signs and symptoms of inflammation
      and the underlying structural damage of disease. Canakinumab has been administered in
      clinical trials as an intravenous (i.v.) infusion or as a subcutaneous (sc) injection and has
      been approved under the trade name ILARIS® in the US for patients ≥ 4 years of age with CAPS
      and in the European Union and Switzerland for CAPS patients ≥ 4 years of age.
