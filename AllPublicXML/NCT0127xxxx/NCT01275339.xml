  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, aortic stenosis (AS) is considered a &quot;surgical disease&quot; with no medical therapy
      available to improve any clinical outcomes, including symptoms, time to surgery, or long-term
      survival. Thus far, randomized studies involving statins have not been promising with respect
      to slowing progressive valve stenosis. Beyond the valve, two common consequences of aortic
      stenosis are hypertrophic remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) and pulmonary venous
      hypertension; each of these has been associated with worse heart failure symptoms, increased
      operative mortality, and worse long-term outcomes. Whether altering LV structural
      abnormalities, improving LV function, and/or reducing pulmonary artery pressures with medical
      therapy would improve clinical outcomes in patients with AS has not been tested. Animal
      models of pressure overload have demonstrated that phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition
      influences nitric oxide (NO) - cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling in the LV and
      favorably impacts LV structure and function, but this has not been tested in humans with AS.
      Studies in humans with left-sided heart failure and pulmonary venous hypertension have shown
      that PDE5 inhibition improves functional capacity and quality of life, but patients with AS
      were not included in those studies. The investigators hypothesize that PDE5 inhibition with
      tadalafil will have a favorable impact on LV structure and function as well as pulmonary
      artery pressures. In this pilot study, the investigators anticipate that short-term
      administration of tadalafil to patients with AS will be safe and well-tolerated.

      Subjects with moderately severe to severe aortic stenosis (AS), left ventricular hypertrophy
      (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, preserved ejection fraction, and no planned aortic valve
      replacement over the next 6 months will be eligible for this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, pilot study. There will be a diabetic cohort (n=32) and non-diabetic
      cohort (n=24); each cohort will be randomized 1:1 to tadalafil vs. placebo. During a baseline
      study visit, the following will be obtained: clinical data, 6 minute walk, quality of life
      questionnaire, blood draw, and an echocardiogram. A 3-day run-in will occur to initially
      assess tolerability and compliance. If the drug is tolerated during this run-in period,
      participants will be randomized. An MRI will also be performed during this randomization
      visit. Follow-up study visits and testing will occur at 6 and 12 weeks and 6 months.
