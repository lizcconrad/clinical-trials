  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease
      (ALD) and viral hepatitis have the potential to progress to cirrhosis and finally
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Early diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases is important
      since progression is likely and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
      However, in daily clinical practice no specific and non-invasive biomarkers are used for the
      diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver diseases. It is known that patients with liver
      diseases produce compounds that can be excreted in breath as a consequence of metabolic
      processes, inflammation and/or oxidative stress. These are called volatile organic compounds
      (VOCs). Analysis of VOCs in exhaled air has been reported to provide valuable information in
      patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
      Also, in patients with liver disease, exhaled VOCs have been detected.

      The investigators hypothesize that analysis of VOCs in exhaled air of patients with liver
      diseases can be used for diagnosis and follow-up.
