  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the effectiveness of BOTOX-A® (botulinun toxin A) placed between
      two different injection sites, namely at the proximal portion of the gastrocnemius(GCM)
      versus at the midbelly of the GCM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have used the midbelly of a muscle as the position where the motor endplates
      are most densely located. The reasoning behind this method was based on the previous works
      that showed most bands of cholinesterase activity to be located in specific topographical
      patterns at the center of the muscle fiber. These results have been used as landmarks to
      place the injections. Current standard guidelines recommend that botulinum toxin be placed at
      the 4 quadrants of the midbelly portion of the gastrocnemius (GCM) muscle. However, recent
      cadaveric research studies on the distribution of the intramuscular endings of the GCM
      suggest that the highest branch density is found within the upper 20-30% length of the calf.
      Therefore, in accordance to the theory that effect of botulinum toxin are greatest at sites
      where the intramuscular endings are most dense, the location where these toxins should be
      placed would be at these proximal sites of the GCM rather than at the midbelly.

      40 recruited patients will be allocated into either the intramuscular ending targeted
      (ie.upper portion of calf) or midbelly targeted group.

      Each subject will undergo a total number of 4 assessments; prior to the injection and 2,4and
      8 weeks post injection.
