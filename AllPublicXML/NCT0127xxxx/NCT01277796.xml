  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current standard therapies with chemotherapy (CT) for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) are
      expensive, toxic/allergenic, frequently ineffective, burdensome, and often unavailable.
      Thermotherapy is a clinically validated first line alternative for the treatment of Cutaneous
      Leishmaniasis in South America. However, current heat-delivery modalities are either too
      costly or lack governmental approval required to be made widely available to endemic areas.
      The investigators have adapted a reliable, safe, and low-cost heat pack for Cutaneous
      Leishmaniasis that the investigators have named the HECT-CL device. In this pilot study the
      investigators will enroll 25 patients who have either failed or are not candidates for
      pentivalent antimonies. The hypothesis states that the HECT-CL device demonstrates efficacy
      non-statistically inferior to estimates for current South American Pentavalent Antimonial
      cure rates (76%) while demonstrating basic safety and tolerability.
