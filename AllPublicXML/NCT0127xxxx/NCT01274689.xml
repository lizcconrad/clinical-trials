      The note re-introduces the external lid loading with the help of a lead weight for the
      temporary treatment of lagophthalmos. Although simple and effective, the technique is rarely
      used.Instead of wearing a monoculus, the patient uses an individually tailored lead weight
      (0.8 mm thickness, 1.0 -2.0 g) sticked on the lid, it enables its closure. A spontaneous
      ptosis indicates a too heavy weight. With the M. levator palpebrae intact, lid lifting is
      possible. The effect is gravity dependent, so that the patient has to wear the monoculus at
      night. To minimize the risk of lead intoxication, the surface of the weight is varnished. In
      case of a persistent paresis of the M. orbicularis oculi an internal lid loading can follow.
      A total of 152 lagophthalmos cases have been treated since 1997.All patients could close the
      lid immediately. Almost half of the patients had to re-adjust the weight several times per
      day due to hooded eyelids. The compliance was high, and a partial or complete restoration of
      the function of the M. orbicularis oculi occurred in 60% of the cases. In some subjects, the
      restoration of the M. orbicularis oculi was faster than of the M. orbicularis orbis. The
      external lid loading for the temporary treatment of lagophthalmos is simple and effective.
      Compared to a monoculus, the vision is unimpaired and the aesthetic is more appropriate for
      most patients. The faster restoration of the M. orbicularis oculi hints at a potentially
      facilitatory effect of the weight.
