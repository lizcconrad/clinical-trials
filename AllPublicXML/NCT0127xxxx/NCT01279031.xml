        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients at least 21 scheduled to undergo bilateral phacoemulsification with
             implantation of multifocal IOLs.

          -  Both eyes must have similar degrees of cataract and astigmatism (topographic cylinder
             difference of &lt;2.00D as well as similar globe axial length as measured by the IOL
             Master of &lt;0.5mm).

          -  Visual potential of UCVA 20/25/ or better.

          -  Clear intraocular media other than cataract.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant differences between eyes in ocular disease or pathology.

          -  Presence of glaucoma, macular disease, or foveal disease to an asymmetrical degree.

          -  Asymmetrical use of ocular medications.
