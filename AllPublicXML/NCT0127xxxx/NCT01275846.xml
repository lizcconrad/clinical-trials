    <textblock>
      This purposed of this study is to ascertain if the implementation of remote patient
      management systems utilizing American Heart Association (AHA) guideline-based heart failure
      protocols and educational content can improve the management of patients with congestive
      heart failure.

      This prospective, comparative study uses a pre-post test design to ascertain if the
      implementation of remote patient management systems utilizing AHA guideline-based heart
      failure protocols and educational content can successfully address the following objectives:

        -  validate the suitability of the Intel Health Guide to deploy AHA guideline-based patient
           care protocols and health content to patients managing congestive heart failure

        -  confirm that the AHA protocols as deployed on the HGS are supportive for clinicians
           following the AHA guidelines in a telehealth environment

        -  validate and verify that the data intended to be collected was effectively collected

        -  measure patient and provider satisfaction with use of the system

    <description>Participants in the study will receive the use of the Intel Health Guide, a telehealth device, with AHA customized heart failure protocols, response algorithms and educational content. Participants interact with the Intel Health Guide device, receiving immediate feedback when transmitting vitals measures and health question responses to a site monitored by their nurse case managers. Nurse case managers review and address concerns raised in vitals and/or question responses through standard care protocols established by their institution. Nurse case managers strive to enhance the participants quality of life, support continuity of care, facilitate provision of services in the appropriate setting to promote positive health outcomes.</description>
