    <textblock>
      Adults with Crohn's disease that is clinically active despite conventional treatment will be
      eligible for this study. Patients may receive one of three doses of PF-00547659 (experimental
      drug) or placebo (inactive drug). Disease activity will be measured every two weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 70 Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a number which consists of information collected from a 7-day diary from the participants regarding symptoms. Remission is considered a score of 150 or less. Active disease is considered 200 or greater. A response to therapy is considered a decline in CDAI score of 70-points from baseline. CDAI response rate at week 8 and week 12 was measured between the investigational product group and the placebo group.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 70 Response Rate</title>
        <description>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a number which consists of information collected from a 7-day diary from the participants regarding symptoms. Remission is considered a score of 150 or less. Active disease is considered 200 or greater. A response to therapy is considered a decline in CDAI score of 70-points from baseline. CDAI response rate at week 8 and week 12 was measured between the investigational product group and the placebo group.</description>
