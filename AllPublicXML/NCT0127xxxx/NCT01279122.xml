        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients who have bilateral NanoFlex implantation at least 3 months previously.

          -  No significant ocular pathology causing DCVA to be less than 20/25 or causing
             significant visual loss.

          -  DCVA of 20/25 or better in both eyes.

          -  Spherical equivalent in the dominant eye to be +/-.50 or less and in the non-dominant
             eye to be between-1.00 and -1.87.

          -  Uncorrected VA in dominant eye 20/25 or better.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of ocular trauma or prior ocular surgery (minor ocular trauma is allowed such
             as small superficial corneal scar not effecting vision; some prior ocular surgery is
             allowable so long as it has not impacted visual acuity.

          -  Amblyopia or strabismus, significant visual field loss, or posterior capsular
             opacifcation.

          -  Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that
             affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy, etc.).
