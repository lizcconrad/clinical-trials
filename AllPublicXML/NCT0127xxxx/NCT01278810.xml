      To assess safety, tolerance and PK profile of different doses(50mg,100mg,200mg,300mg, 400mg,
      500mg,QD)of Icaritin in advanced breast cancer Patients in China

    <textblock>
      ERa36 predominantly localizes on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm and mediates a
      membrane-initiated &quot;nongenomic&quot; signaling pathway. Membrane-initiated estrogen signaling has
      been linked to rapid responses to estrogen and generally activates signaling pathways like
      MAPK/ERK, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and protein kinase C pathways. Preclinical study
      demonstrated that ERa36 was expressed in tumor cells and might be the driving force of breast
      cancer cell proliferation. 40% of breast cancer tumors which used to be considered as ER
      negative also express ERa36. In the former study the investigators found that 40% of
      ERa66-positive breast cancer patients express high levels of ERa36 in their tumors, and this
      subset of patients are less likely to benefit from tamoxifen treatment compared with those
      with ERa66-positive/ERa36-negative tumors.

      Icaritin is a newly discovered small molecular compound which is high selective ERa36
      modulators and perhaps will be a very promising new drug to treat advanced breast cancer by
      targeting this nongenomic pathway. It was showed that it can inhibit the growth of breast
      cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The investigators have completed the preclinical
      PK&amp;PD and toxicity studies in animals and now move on to test it in a FIM clinical trial.
