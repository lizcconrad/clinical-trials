      Purpose

      - Objective : Sensorimotor adaptation allows the modification of the motor command taking
      into account the errors detected during execution of prior movements. It involves a large
      cortico-subcortical network. Isolated lesions of this network do not systematically alter
      sensorimotor adaptation except for cerebellar lesions. The cerebellum is thus a key structure
      for sensorimotor adaptation. However, the link between cerebellar and the cortical plasticity
      underlying sensorimotor adaptation remain unknown. Alteration of sensorimotor adaptation is
      associated with dystonia but it is unclear whether it is a cause or consequence of dystonia.
      It has been hypothesized that the abnormal plasticity observed in dystonia could account for
      the associated alteration of sensorimotor adaptation.

      Classically, basal ganglia dysfunction is considered to be crucial for dystonia pathogenesis.
      However, recent studies suggest that the involvement of the cerebellum may also be important
      in this setting. In primary dystonia, imaging studies showed abnormal cerebellar activation
      during sensorimotor adaptation tasks and neurophysiological studies demonstrated a decrease
      of cerebellar output.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the cerebellum in the cortical plasticity
      underlying sensorimotor adaptation both in healthy subjects (normal plasticity) and in
      dystonic patients (abnormal plasticity).

      - Methods: Paired associative stimulation PAS consists in repetitive pairing of a peripheral
      nerve and a cortical stimulation. This kind of stimulation has been designed to induce
      artificial plasticity that can be easily measured. This PAS induced sensorimotor plasticity
      is exacerbated and has lost its topographical specificity in dystonic patients.TMS using
      trains of TMS pulses (rTMS) can be applied on the cerebellum to modulate its output. We will
      test the effect of rTMS induced modulation (cTBS- inhibitory, iTBS-excitatory, sham) of the
      cerebellar output on PAS induced plasticity in patients with dystonia and healthy control.

      We will also assess the acute effect of the rTMS induced modulation of the cerebellar output
      on the dystonic symptoms and on the performance at a validated sensorimotor adaptation task.
      This will be done by double blind post-hoc scoring of the dystonia (BFM or TWSTRS) on
      standardized videorecording and measurement of the performance at the task after each rTMS
      session (cTBS, iTBS, sham).

      Finally, we will assess the variation of PAS effect on other parameters reflecting cortical
      excitability after each rTMS session (cTBS, iTBS, sham).
