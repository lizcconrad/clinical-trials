    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the clinical, physiologic, and molecular
      profiles of healthy participants, participants with mild, moderate, and severe asthma; and
      participants with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, longitudinal (participants are followed over long period of time with
      continuous or repeated observations of health outcomes) exploratory study (biomarkers,
      clinical and physiological parameters for participants with asthma and COPD are observed for
      the first time). This study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will include healthy
      participants and participants with mild, moderate, and severe asthma. Part 2 will include
      healthy nonsmokers, healthy asymptomatic smokers, and participants with moderate and or
      severe COPD. Study participants will undergo medical tests that will include pulmonary
      function testing, assessment of airway reactivity, bronchoscopy procedure, blood samples for
      routine laboratory tests, biomarkers and DNA evaluation (for some study participants),
      induced sputum collection, and exhaled nitric oxide collection. Safety evaluations will
      includes assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram,
      vital signs, and physical examinations.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (5 to 14 days after screening), Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12 (for Part 1: participants with asthma)</time_frame>
    <description>AQLQ is used to measure the physical, emotional, social and occupational problems for participants with asthma. There are 32 questions in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli) to measure activity limitation and symptom frequency using a recall period of 2 weeks. Each 32 questions are on a 7-point scale (7 = not impaired at all and 1 = severely impaired). The overall AQLQ score is the mean of all 32 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12 (for Part 1: participants with asthma)</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ is used to evaluate asthma control, the full range of clinical impairment (well controlled to life threatening) for the participant with asthma. There are 7 questions (5 for symptoms [night-time awakenings, morning symptoms, limitation of activities, shortness of breath, and wheezing], use of daily rescue bronchodilator, and percent predicted forced expiratory volume value). All 7 items are scored on a 7-point scale (0 = good control, 6 = poor control), with the mean score as an overall summary score. The recall period is 7 days. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) value</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, 5 to 14 days after baseline (for Part 1: healthy participants); and Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12 (for Part 1: participants with asthma and for all Part 2 participants)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 will be measured by using spirometry test. Spirometry is used to measure lung function, specifically the volume and/or flow of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Lung volumes will be measured according to the body temperature, pressure, and saturated standard convention using the spirometer. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed in the absence of albuterol/salbutamol or at least 6 hours after the last dose of albuterol/salbutamol and post- bronchodilator spirometry will be performed after 15 to 30 minutes administration of albuterol/salbutamol via metered-dose inhaler.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) value</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, 5 to 14 days after baseline (for Part 1: healthy participants); and Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12 (for Part 1: participants with asthma and for all Part 2 participants)</time_frame>
    <description>FVC will be measured by using spirometry test. Spirometry is used to measure lung function, specifically the volume and/or flow of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Lung volumes will be measured according to the body temperature, pressure, and saturated standard convention using the spirometer. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed in the absence of albuterol/salbutamol or at least 6 hours after the last dose of albuterol/salbutamol and post- bronchodilator spirometry will be performed after 15 to 30 minutes administration of albuterol/salbutamol via metered-dose inhaler.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) 25-75 value</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, 5 to 14 days after baseline (for Part 1: healthy participants); and Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12 (for Part 1: participants with asthma and for all Part 2 participants)</time_frame>
    <description>FEF is the flow of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of a forced expiration. It is generally defined by what fraction remains of the forced vital capacity (FVC), usually 25-75 percent (FEF25-75%). Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed in the absence of albuterol/salbutamol or at least 6 hours after the last dose of albuterol/salbutamol and post- bronchodilator spirometry will be performed after 15 to 30 minutes administration of albuterol/salbutamol via metered-dose inhaler.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Baseline, 5 to 14 days after baseline (for Part 1: healthy participants); and Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12 (for Part 1: participants with asthma and for all Part 2 participants)</time_frame>
    <description>PEER will be measures by using spirometry test. Spirometry is used to measure lung function, specifically the volume and/or flow of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Lung volumes will be measured according to the body temperature, pressure, and saturated standard convention using the spirometer. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed in the absence of albuterol/salbutamol or at least 6 hours after the last dose of albuterol/salbutamol and post- bronchodilator spirometry will be performed after 15 to 30 minutes administration of albuterol/salbutamol via metered-dose inhaler.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Methacholine challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening or Baseline (for Part 1: participants with asthma)</time_frame>
    <description>Methacholine challenge test is used to assess airway reactivity in asthma. In this test, baseline spirometry for participant is measured by inhalation of increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine up to 16 mg/mL. The provocative dose (PC20) is defined as the dose of methacholine required to cause a greater than or equal to 20 percent decrease from the baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second value. A PC20 result of less than or equal to 16 mg/mL will be considered to reflect increase airway responsiveness for fulfilling eligibility criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FENO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, and Month 12 (for Part 1: participants with asthma); and 5 to 14 days after baseline (for Part 2: participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of FENO is a quantitative, noninvasive, simple, and safe method of measuring airway inflammation that provides a complementary tool to assessing airways disease. The participant can exhale directly into a measurement device, or into a reservoir that can afterwards be connected to the analyzer. With the former technique, the early and later nitric oxide in the breath sample can be analyzed separately. Two replicate FENO measurements will be obtained that agree at the 10% level and up to a total of 8 measurements will be performed to achieve this level of agreement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire score for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) participants (SGRQ-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (for Part 2: participants with COPD)</time_frame>
    <description>SGRQ-C is a 14-item questionnaire designed to measure health impairment in participants with COPD. The SGRQ-C has 2 parts. Part 1 generates the Symptoms score, and Part 2 generates the Activity and Impacts scores. Total score (0 to 100) is the sum of all scores. Higher scores indicate greater health impairment. Higher score indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>EXACT-Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (for Part 2: participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)</time_frame>
    <description>E-RS is a 11 respiratory system items scoring algorithm to assess the severity of respiratory symptoms in participants with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Each item has either 5 or 6 response options. Higher score indicate more severe COPD.</description>
