      Objectives. To study the short-term neurophysiological and clinical outcome of botulinum
      toxin type A(BoNT-A), injected at standard doses, and assess toxin spread to neighboring
      uninjected muscles in children with cerebral palsy.

      Subjects and methods. The investigators studied 18 ambulatory children with dynamic equinus
      foot deformity (mean age 6.1 years). The gastrocnemius muscle on the affected side was
      injected with BoNT-A (Dysport, range from 8.9-19.4 U/kg). As the primary neurophysiological
      outcome measure, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) areas were assessed in the lateral
      gastrocnemius (LG) and tibialis anterior(TA) muscles on the treated and untreated side before
      BoNT-A injections (T0), and on days 10 (T10), and 30 (T30) after injections. Clinical scales
      were assessed and video gait was analyzed at all three time points.

      Results. In all patients, CMAP areas recorded from the LG and TA muscles on the treated side
      decreased significantly from pre-injection values at T10 (p&lt;0.05) and T30 (p&lt;0.002).
      Assessment at both time points after injections also showed that ankle spasticity had
      diminished (p&lt;0.05), equinus foot excursion increased (p&lt;0.05), and functional gait improved
      (p&lt;0.05).

      Conclusion. Although BoNT-A injected at standard doses improves gait in children with spastic
      equinus foot the toxin spreads to uninjected leg muscles. BoNT-A treatment for cerebral palsy
      therefore needs individualizing according to the child's clinical features.

    <description>As the primary neurophysiological outcome measure of BoNT-A induced paresis and spread, we studied changes in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) areas recorded from the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle after injecting BoNT-A and from the ipsilateral tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in children with spastic hemiplegia. In line with others we considered a decreased CMAP area from LG muscle injected with BoNT-A as the neurophysiological index of BoNT-A-induced paresis</description>
