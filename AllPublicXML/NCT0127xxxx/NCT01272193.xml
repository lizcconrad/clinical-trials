    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Japan. The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of NN5401 (insulin degludec/insulin aspart) with insulin glargine in subjects with
      type 2 diabetes in Japan. Depending on pre-trial oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs), subjects
      continued at the same dose and dosing frequency.

    <description>Corresponds to rate of AEs per 100 patient years of exposure. Severity assessed by investigator. Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with subject's daily activities. Moderate: marked symptoms, moderate interference with subject's daily activities. Severe: considerable interference with subject's daily activities, unacceptable. Serious AE: AE that at any dose results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening experience, in-subject hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalisation, persistent/significant disability/incapacity/congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <description>Observed rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</description>
