    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least 50% Reduction in 24-hour Pad Weight From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (compared to baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint defined as at least a 50% reduction in 24-hour pad weight from baseline to 6 months (including dry as defined as a pad weight of less than 1.3 grams during the 6-month test), in which the percent of subjects with at least 50% reduction in 24-hour pad weight is compared to a performance goal of 50%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Negative Cough Stress Test at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Endpoint defined as a negative result at 6 months, as measured by the Cough Stress Test (CST), in which the percent of subjects with a negative CST is compared to a performance goal of 66%.
The cough stress test was completed with the subject in the lithotomy and standing positions, filling bladder to maximum capacity with normal saline. The subject was then asked to cough 10 times and any leakage from the urethra was considered a positive test.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With at Least 50% Improvement in Incontinence Via 3-Day Voiding Diary From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months (compared to baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Endpoint defined as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to 6-months, as measured by 3-Day Voiding Diary, in which the percent of subjects with at least a 50% improvement from baseline to 6 months is compared to a performance goal of 50%.
Subjects completed a 3-Day Voiding Diary of controlled urinations and the number and amount of leaks experienced.</description>
