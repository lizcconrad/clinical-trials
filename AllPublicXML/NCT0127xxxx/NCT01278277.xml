  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general area of research in which this project has been designed is that of retinal
      degeneration related to mutations in the ABCR gene, responsible of Stargardt disease/fundus
      flavimaculatus retinal dystrophy (STD/FF). STG/FF is one of the major causes of vision
      impairment in the young age. STG/FF originates typically from the dysfunction and loss of
      cone and rod photoreceptors, developing through a photo-oxidative mechanism. The major
      disease locus is the central retina, i.e. the macula, whose neurons have the highest density
      and underlie critical functions such as visual acuity, color vision and contrast sensitivity.
      There is currently no cure for STG/FF. Recent experimental findings indicate that Saffron,
      derived from the pistils of Crocus Sativus, may have a role as a retinal neuro-protectant
      against oxidative damage. The stigmata of Crocus sativus contain biologically high
      concentrations of chemical compounds including crocin, crocetin, whose multiple C=C bonds
      provide the antioxidant potential. In addition it is well known that this compound is safe
      and free of adverse side effects. The aim of this research is to investigate the influence of
      short-term Saffron supplementation on retinal function in STG/FF patients carrying ABCR
      mutations. The macular cone-mediated electroretinogram (ERG) in response to high-frequency
      flicker (focal flicker ERG) will be employed as the main outcome variable. Secondary outcome
      variable will be the psychophysical cone system recovery after bleaching.

      Research Plan Background Stargardt disease (STGD/FFM) is the most common hereditary recessive
      macular dystrophy (Blacharski, 1988) characterized by juvenile to young adult onset, central
      visual impairment, progressive bilateral atrophy of the macula and retinal pigment epithelium
      (RPE), with a frequent appearance of orange/yellow flecks distributed around the macula
      and/or the mid retinal periphery (Noble and Carr, 1971). A clinically similar retinal
      disorder, fundus flavimaculatus (FFM), often displays later ages of onset and slower
      progression. It has been suggested and demonstrated (Allikmets et al., 1997) that STGD and
      FFM represent allelic disorders. Mutations in the gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
      transporter (ABCR), mapping to chromosome 1p13-p21, have been found to be responsible of STGD
      (Allikmets et al., 1997). The ABCR gene is expressed exclusively and at high levels in the
      retina, in both rod and cone photoreceptors (Molday et al., 2000). A recent study by Weng et
      al. (1999) , investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration in
      ABCR knock-out mice, proposed that photoreceptors die as a consequence of 'poisoning' of the
      RPE by lipofuscin accumulation and loss of the RPE support role. Accumulation within the RPE
      cells of a compound, A2E, forming from condensation of phosphatydilethanlolamine and the
      all-trans-retinal released from photoactivated rhodopsin (Sparrow et al., 2000), probably
      leads in vivo to an increased absorption of blue lights and to phototoxic RPE cell damage.
      The mutation-induced disease may affect both rod and cone photoreceptors, at relatively early
      stages. In vitro studies (Sun and Nathans, 2001) also demonstrated that the ABCR itself is an
      efficient target of all-trans-retinal-mediated photooxidative damage.

      Clinically, many reports have documented an abnormal functioning of both macular and
      peripheral cones, as well as rods, in STGD/FFM (Moloney et al., 1983; Lachapelle et al.,
      1990). There is also evidence (Lois et al., 2001) that STGD/FFM may be associated with
      different patterns of retinal dysfunction, with a selective involvement of macular function,
      or more widespread dysfunction involving cone and/or rod function, showing intrafamilial
      consistency. Characteristic abnormalities of dark adaptation (Aleman et al., 1999), involving
      a delayed post-bleach recovery, to the baseline sensitivity, of the last branch of the
      adaptation curve have been also described. Similar abnormalities in rod dark adaptation have
      been recently found in a mice heterozygous for a null mutation in the ABCR gene (Mata et al.,
      2001). Clinical evidence (Parisi et al., 2002) indicates that also the recovery of cone
      sensitivity after bleaching is severely impaired in STG/FF, suggesting that profoundly
      altered retinoid recycling, leading to photoxidative damage, specifically occurs in cone
      photoreceptors.

      Recent experimental findings (Maccarone et al., 2008) indicate that Saffron, derived from the
      pistils of Crocus Sativus, may have a role as a retinal neuro-protectant against oxidative
      damage. Indeed, Saffron has been shown to be protective, for both morphology and function, in
      a rat model of light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. In this model, cell death is thought
      to result from oxidative stress induced by prolonged increase in oxygen tension and
      photooxidation. Saffron is an attractive candidate to be tested because the stigmata of
      Crocus sativus contain biologically high concentrations of interesting chemical compounds
      including crocin, crocetin (Giaccio, 2004), whose multiple C=C bonds give the antioxidant
      potential. Not to mention that its centuries-long use as spice, with no known ill effects
      increases the confidence in secure applicability. In addition it has been recently reported
      (Ochiai et al., 2007) that crocins are able to activate metabolic pathways to protect cells
      from apoptosis and to reduce light induced death in isolated photoreceptors (Laabich et al.,
      2006) , while crocetin (Giaccio, 2004) increases oxygen diffusivity through liquids, such as
      plasma. Considering the high metabolic rate of photoreceptors, the availability of oxygen may
      be a critical factor in protecting them from death. In addition, Kanakis et al. (Kanakis et
      al, 2007) showed that metabolites of antioxidant flavonoids bind directly to DNA and induce
      its partial conformation to beta-DNA, thereby protecting the cell from damage. Based on these
      observation it comes clear that Saffron extract does not act as a simple antioxidant. The
      peculiar characteristics of Saffron components support the hypothesis of an involvement of
      very different ways of action going from antioxidant activity to direct control of gene
      expression. These components may act in humans as protective agents against oxidative damage
      for the ageing retina, and may repair early photoreceptor damage associated with STG/FF,
      whose disease patho-physiology has been linked by experimental studies (Mata et al, 2001) to
      light-induced oxidative damage to the outer retina. In STG/FF eyes, at early disease stages,
      the normal number of cone photoreceptors is partially retained, although the cells might be
      dysfunctional. As a result of the rescuing effects of Saffron, the pool of damaged but viable
      photoreceptors could increase its response, resulting in improved retinal sensitivity.

      The objective of the present project is to evaluate whether Saffron supplementation has a
      beneficial neuro-protective effect for the damaged retinas as consequence of ABCR
      mutation-STD/FF.

      Clinical Protocol Patients A group of 30 STG/FF patients (14 males, 16 females, age range:
      15-68 years) will be included in this study. Patients will meet the following inclusion
      criteria: 1. Macular and peripheral retinal degeneration with typical funduscopic lesions
      (retinal flecks) and a cone-rod pattern of retinal dysfunction, as determined by standard
      Ganzfeld electroretinography and dark-adapted fundus perimetry, and classic fundus
      appearance, 2. Relatively preserved central retinal function (visual field by Goldmann V/4e &gt;
      30°, corrected EDTRS visual acuity &gt; 20/80) and stable central fixation as determined by a
      Visuskope, 3. Known genotype or genotype under study, 4. At least four follow-up clinical
      examination over the past three years, 5. No or minimal ocular media opacities, 6. No
      concomitant ocular (e.g. glaucoma, amblyopia) or systemic diseases. Informed consent for all
      patients and controls will be obtained after the aims and procedures of the study will be
      explained in detail.

      Treatment and Testing Schedule The patients will be divided into two groups: 15 will treated
      with oral supplementation of a daily dose of Saffron for 90 days, and 15 will undergo placebo
      treatment during the same period. At the end of a 90 days period the patients will be
      crossed-over and assigned respectively to placebo or Saffron supplementation. In all
      patients, clinical examination, including visual acuity testing with a calibrated standard
      Snellen chart and fundus examination by direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy, and FERG testing
      will be performed at the study entry (baseline) and after 180 days of treatment or placebo.
      In all cases, compliance will be judged by telephone interview and pill counts. Adverse side
      effects will be reported.

      Electrophysiological Methods FERG testing will be performed according to a previously
      published technique (Falsini et al., 2000). Briefly, ERGs will be elicited by the
      LED-generated sinusoidal luminance modulation of a circular uniform field (18° in diameter,
      80 cd/m2 mean luminance, dominant wavelength: 630 nm), presented at the frequency of 41 Hz on
      the rear of a ganzfeld bowl, illuminated at the same mean luminance as the stimulus. A series
      of FERG responses will be collected at different modulation depths [quantified by the
      Michelson luminance contrast formula: 100%*(Lmax -Lmin)/(Lmax +Lmin), where Lmax and Lmin are
      maximum and minimum luminance, respectively] between 16.5% and 93.8% in 0.1 to 0.3 log unit
      steps. FERG signals will be acquired in sequence for six values of modulation depth between
      16.5 to 93.5%, presented in an increasing order. For each patient FERG log amplitudes will be
      plotted as a function of log modulation depth. The resulting function's slope will be
      determined by a linear regression. From the same regression line, FERG threshold will be
      estimated from the value of log modulation depth yielding a criterion amplitude,
      corresponding to a S/N ratio of 3.

      Psychophysics An increment threshold technique will be used to evaluate the recovery of cone
      system sensitivity after bleaching exposure. Psychophysical threshold will be determined at
      the paracentral visual field locations with preserved visual sensitivity, by presenting a 0.5
      sec flashing light on a light adapting background of 20 cd/sqm. Following baseline
      assessment, the threshold intensity for the flashed light will be measured and plotted as a
      function of time, following 30 sec exposure to an adapting light (delivered in Maxwellian
      view by means of a calibrated indirect ophthalmoscope) whose intensity is estimated bleach
      approx 30% of the cone photopigment. The resulting dynamic recovery function, fitted by an
      exponential function, describes the sensitivity recovery of the photopic system following
      bleaching, and reflects either the rate of free opsin inactivation or photopigment synthesis.
      A computer-controlled system, employing a commercially available apparatus, has been
      developed (Fadda et al., 2001) for measuring bleaching adaptation of the cone system.

      Statistical Analysis Sample size estimates of patients for this study will be based on
      previous investigations (Parisi et al., 2001) where the between- and within-subjects
      variability (expressed as data SD) of FERG parameters was determined in STG/FF patients.
      Assuming between- and within-subjects SDs in FERG amplitude and phase of 0.1 logmicroV and 20
      degrees, respectively, the sample sizes of patients assigned to both Saffron and placebo
      provide a power of 80%, at an alpha = 0.05, for detecting in each group a test-retest
      difference (i.e. 90 days minus baseline test) of 0.1 logmicroV (SD: 0.1) and 30 degrees (SD:
      20) in amplitude and phase, respectively. Results will be analyzed by multivariate statistics
      (multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures, MANOVA). In all the analyses a p &lt;
      0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.
