    <measure>Number of Participants With Loss of Therapeutic Response.</measure>
    <time_frame>13 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Loss of Therapeutic Response (LTR) is defined as &lt;30% pain response relative to the single blind phase baseline or patient discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or adverse events in the double blind phase of the study. For the calculation of &lt;30% pain response relative to baseline, baseline will be defined as the mean of the last 7 observations prior to the start of SB treatment, which will be compared with the 7 days rolling average of pain response in DB phase. Participants may be discontinued due to lack of efficacy in this study at the discretion of the study physician.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a self administered questionnaire that was designed to screen for the presence of a mood disorder in medically ill patients. To distinguish psychiatric presentations from physical illness, the items focus on subjective disturbance of mood rather than physical signs. The HADS contains 14 items rated on 4 point Likert type scales. Two subscales assess depression and anxiety. Each subscale consists of 7 statements, rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = No anxiety or depression, to 3 = Severe feelings of anxiety or depression). Separate scores are calculated for each subscale ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores denote greater severity of depression or anxiety</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Benefit From Treatment, Satisfaction With Treatment and Willingness to Continue Treatement (BSW)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The BSW is administered by the study physician or designated site personnel and consists of three single item measures designed to capture the patient's perception of the effect of treatment in terms of the relative benefit, their satisfaction, and their intention or willingness to continue on therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); or Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect. The study physician used the adjective &quot;severe&quot; to those AEs that interfere significantly with participant's usual function.</description>

        <description>The MOS-SS is a validated self administered questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. The scale has been found reliable and valid with good overall measurement properties. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9 item overall sleep problems index assessing sleep over the past week. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range multiplied by 100); total score range = 0 to 100; higher score indicates greater intensity of attribute.</description>

        <title>Change in the MOS-SS-Quantity of Sleep.</title>
        <description>The MOS-SS is a validated self administered questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. The scale has been found reliable and valid with good overall measurement properties. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9 item overall sleep problems index assessing sleep over the past week.
The item &quot;Quantity of sleep&quot; of MOS-SS is presented here.</description>

          <title>Change in the MOS-SS-Quantity of Sleep.</title>
          <description>The MOS-SS is a validated self administered questionnaire consisting of 12 items that assess key constructs of sleep. The scale has been found reliable and valid with good overall measurement properties. Instrument scoring yields 7 subscales (sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath or with a headache, quantity of sleep, optimal sleep, sleep adequacy, and somnolence) as well as a 9 item overall sleep problems index assessing sleep over the past week.
The item &quot;Quantity of sleep&quot; of MOS-SS is presented here.</description>

        <description>The SF 36 is a self administered, validated questionnaire that measures each of the following 8 health aspects: Physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perception over the past week. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) where, higher scores indicate a better health related quality of life.</description>

        <description>The pain related sleep interference item rating scale is scored on an 11 point numeric rating scale (NRS Sleep). It is self administered by the subject in order to rate how pain has interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours, ranging from 0 (pain does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (completely interferes (unable to sleep due to pain)). Participants are to describe how their pain has interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number on the numeric rating scale.</description>

It is self administered by the subject in order to rate how pain has interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours, ranging from 0 (pain does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (completely interferes (unable to sleep due to pain)). Participants are to describe how their pain has interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours by choosing the appropriate number on the numeric rating scale.</description>

        <title>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS)</title>
        <description>The HADS is a self administered questionnaire that was designed to screen for the presence of a mood disorder in medically ill patients. To distinguish psychiatric presentations from physical illness, the items focus on subjective disturbance of mood rather than physical signs. The HADS contains 14 items rated on 4 point Likert type scales. Two subscales assess depression and anxiety. Each subscale consists of 7 statements, rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 = No anxiety or depression, to 3 = Severe feelings of anxiety or depression). Separate scores are calculated for each subscale ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores denote greater severity of depression or anxiety</description>
