  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study will be to assess and monitor the adherence to and
      effectiveness of the new prescribing guidelines for cabergoline.

      Specific objectives will be to assess: 1. The indication for use of cabergoline (Parkinson,
      hyperprolactinemia, other) 2. Prior treatment strategies in patients who start cabergoline
      treatment for Parkinson's Disease 3. The percentage of cabergoline users who are prescribed
      doses above 3 mg per day 4. Whether cabergoline users are monitored by echocardiography prior
      and during treatment. 5. The incidence and prevalence of valvular fibrosis

        Cohort of patients, who are treated with cabergoline during the study period. This cohort
        will be divided in new users and prevalent users based on when cabergoline was started. New
        (incident) users will be all persons who have a first prescription for cabergoline after
        the date that the change in SPC was made. Prevalent users will be all cohort members who
        received a cabergoline prescription during the study period but who had also been using
        cabergoline prior to the change in SPC.

          <description>The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that the prescribing information for cabergoline should be updated to include: a reduction of the maximum recommended dose to 3 mg per day. To evaluate compliance with the new prescription guidelines, it was assessed whether the dose exceeded 3 mg per day during the study period.</description>
