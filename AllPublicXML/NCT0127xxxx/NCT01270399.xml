  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. The major
      advances in treatment of lung cancer have brought only minor improvements in survival
      therefore novel systemic treatment methods are urgently needed.

      Protein levels are regulated by the protein homeostasis network that generates and protects
      the protein fold (ER and Golgi included).

      The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an essential molecular chaperon involved in the
      posttranslational folding and stability of proteins. Hsp90 inhibition leads to accumulation
      of unfolded proteins and ER stress. The therapeutic efficacy of such inhibition may be
      augmented by co-administering it with other drugs that disrupt ER-Golgi homeostasis like
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) or proteasome inhibitors. ER-Golgi homeostasis disruption affects
      a wide network of proteins and pathways as such affords a systemic target. Thus, the
      investigators aimed to examine the effect of combined treatment of Hsp90 antagonist with
      proteasome or HDAC inhibitors on human lung cancer cell lines and primary cells.
