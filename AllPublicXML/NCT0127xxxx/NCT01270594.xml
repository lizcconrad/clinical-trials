      Hypothesis: Can a counseling intervention, delivered by a pharmacist, increase inhaler
      adherence in veterans with COPD who have demonstrated poor inhaler adherence through pharmacy
      refill records?

      Veterans who receive who receive daily maintenance inhalers from the William S Middleton
      Memorial Veterans Hospital Pharmacy and who have a medication possession ratio less than 80%
      over the previous six months will be invited to participate in the study. This study will
      randomize 100 participants to a usual care arm or a pharmacist counseling intervention. Final
      data collection will be six months after randomization to determine if both self-reported and
      refill record adherence has changed.
