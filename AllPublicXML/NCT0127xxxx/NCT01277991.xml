  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a 5 mg dose of CP-690,550 will be given to study subjects on two separate
      occasions using one of two different strength tablets each time. The amount of CP-690,550
      available in the blood following administration of each tablet will be measured and compared.
      The overall aim of the study is to establish that a similar amount of CP-690,550 is absorbed
      into the blood following administration of the same dose of each different strength tablet .
