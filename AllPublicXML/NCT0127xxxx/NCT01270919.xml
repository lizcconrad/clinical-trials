      To demonstrate repair of the meniscus 6 months postimplantation of the BioDuct® Meniscal
      Repair Device, utilizing MRI.

      To evaluate clinical success by comparing the following qualitative criteria at 2 years
      postoperative to preoperative findings: effusion, swelling, pain, catching, locking, focal
      joint line pain and mechanical symptoms, if present preoperative. Clinical success is defined
      as no worsening for any of these criteria and improvement in at least one of these criteria.

    <description>The BioDuct® Meniscal Repair Device is a small, cannulated, arthroscopically implanted, bioabsorbable conduit that has length sizes of 5, 7 and 9 mm. Based on the concept of trephination for treating meniscal tears in the red-white zone, the BioDuct® Meniscal Repair Device is designed to create a vascular access channel between the vascular-rich and cell-rich synovium and the meniscal tear. This channel allows for the flow of blood from the vascular to the avascular tissue to promote repair of the meniscus.
The BioDuct® Meniscal Repair Device is not used across meniscal tears, like other fixation devices. The BioDuct® Meniscal Repair Device is used in conjunction with suturing and helps provide vascular access, while the sutures help provide fixation. Based on the Inclusion Criteria of this protocol, there can be a maximum of three BioDuct® Meniscal Repair Devices utilized for the meniscal tear.</description>
