  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study to be conducted
      in a cohort of consecutively selected participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who
      have been treated with sulphonylurea (SU) monotherapy or SU + metformin (MF) combination
      therapy by their cardiologist, nephrologist, or family practice doctor for at least 6 months
      prior to study enrollment.

      The purpose of the study is to assess treatment patterns, goal attainment rates, long-term
      diabetes complication rates, and frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes among T2DM
      participants treated in cardiology, nephrology and family practice settings.

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Hypoglycemic Episodes in the 6 Months Prior to Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 Months Prior to Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The participant experience of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) questionnaire was used to evaluate participants' experience of hypoglycemia during the previous 6 months. Participants were asked to record whether they experienced hypoglycemia symptoms (yes/no) and to record the severity of those symptoms as mild, moderate, severe, or very severe.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Very Severe Hypoglycemic Episodes in the 6 Months Prior to Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 Months Prior to Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>At the time of enrollment, participants were asked to rate their hypoglycemic episodes in the last 6 months as mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. Participants were able to select more than one category.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Hemoglobin A1c &lt;7.0% at the Time of Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Participant serum samples were collected after an overnight fast to determine the hemoglobin A1c level. Hemoglobin A1c is a measure of the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood and provides an indication of participant blood glucose control in the 2 to 3 months prior to the evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Participant Mean Score on the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire At the Time of Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a questionnaire that assesses participant quality of life in 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems for which participants are asked to self-rate their experience. The EQ-5D total score ranges from -0.171 (worst health state) to 1 (perfect health state) and 1 reflects the best outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Mean Score on the EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire At the Time of Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Participant health status was self-reported in 5 domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and was analyzed by using visual analog scale (VAS) which records participant responses on a scale of 0 (poor health) to 100 (excellent health).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Mean Score on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) At the Time of Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The TSQM is a treatment satisfaction questionnaire containing 14 items covering the following dimensions: side effects, effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction. Participants were asked to respond in a yes or no fashion, or by using a 5- or 7-point Likert scale. The score for each dimension ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score expressing a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Mean Score on the Self-Reported Adherence and Barriers Questionnaire At the Time of Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported adherence and barriers questionnaire to measure treatment compliance asked participants to rate their responses to 5 questions: How often do you take your diabetes medicines exactly as your healthcare provider prescribes them?; During the past 4 weeks, how often were you unsure about some of the things your doctor suggested you do for your diabetes?; During the past 4 weeks, how often were you unable to do what was necessary to follow your doctor's treatment plans for your diabetes?; During the past 4 weeks, how often were you bothered by side effects from your medicines?; and During the past 4 weeks, how often did you have problems getting your prescriptions filled? Participants responded using a scale of 1 to 5, where 1=always, 2=usually, 3=sometimes, 4=rarely, and 5=never.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Mean Score on the Worry Scale of Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS II) At the Time of Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Fear about hypoglycemia during 6 months prior to enrollment was evaluated using the Worry Scale of the HFS II. Responses to the 18-item questionnaire were recorded on a 0 to 4 scale, with 0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=almost always. The total score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating increasing fear of hypoglycemia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing a Change in Body Weight in the 12 Months Prior to Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months Prior to Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate their weight change experience in the 12 months prior to enrollment as: weight increased, weight decreased, or weight remained stable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting Body Weight Fears in the 12 Months Prior to Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months Prior to Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>On the day of enrollment, participants were asked to rate their fear of gaining weight in the 12 months prior to enrollment using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire elicited responses to 3 statements (I worry about gaining weight; I worry that my diabetic treatment makes me gain weight; and I worry about not being able to stabilize my weight) and relied on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=often, and 4=almost always.</description>

        <title>Participant Mean Score on the Worry Scale of Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS II) At the Time of Enrollment</title>
        <description>Fear about hypoglycemia during 6 months prior to enrollment was evaluated using the Worry Scale of the HFS II. Responses to the 18-item questionnaire were recorded on a 0 to 4 scale, with 0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=almost always. The total score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating increasing fear of hypoglycemia.</description>

        <description>On the day of enrollment, participants were asked to rate their fear of gaining weight in the 12 months prior to enrollment using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire elicited responses to 3 statements (I worry about gaining weight; I worry that my diabetic treatment makes me gain weight; and I worry about not being able to stabilize my weight) and relied on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=often, and 4=almost always.</description>
