      Brief Scientific Rationale:

      Decitabine has been shown to be effective for treatment of MDS and associated with very
      limited extramedullary toxicity at the lower doses. Furthermore, the hypomethylating effects
      of decitabine require an extended period of therapy and are likely to be more beneficial in
      the setting of a minimal residual disease after transplantation. The drug might exert a
      cytoreductive effect on the MDS clone, but ex vivo expansion strategy using decitabine and
      HDAC inhibitor provides a potential to expand the number of hematopoietic stem cells. There
      are lots of evidence which showed the the drug have immunostimulatory effects and can be used
      to enhance graft-versus leukemia effects. And also, some investigator suggested that
      decitabine could induce FOXP3 expression, promoting the conversion of naïve T cells to Tregs
      which are known to suppress GVHD while maintaining GVL effect in allo-SCT setting. As such,
      decitabine is an ideal agent to be investigated in the post-transplant setting.

      The investigators hypothesized that post-transplant maintenance therapy with decitabine may
      reduce relapse rate, which may maximize the beneficial effects from reduced TRM of
      ATG-containing FB4 or FB2 conditioning regimen in higher-risk MDS or AML evolving from MDS
      patients.

      1. Transplant course

             -  BMT from an HLA-matched sibling or a suitably matched (up to 2-allele mismatched)
                family or unrelated donor will be performed according to the policies of the
                institute.

             -  A preparative regimen will be started 6 days before the day of stem cell infusion

                  1. Myeloablative-intensity conditioning regimen: FB4+ATG

                  2. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen; FB2+ATG

                  3. Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis

             -  Sibling transplant: Cyclosporine and short-course Methotrexate

             -  Unrelated transplant: Tacrolimus and short-course Methotrexate

             -  The dose of calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) will be gradually
                tapered from day 60 (for all sibling transplants) or day 90 (for all unrelated
                transplants) and discontinued within 2 or 3 months after SCT in the absence of
                graft-versus-host disease.

        2. Decitabine maintenance course

             -  For the patients who finish the above transplant procedure and meet the enrollment
                criteria, decitabine will be given at a dose of 5mg/m2/day ~ 15mg/m2/day iv over 1
                hour for 5 consecutive days. The drug will be repeated every 4 weeks for up to 12
                cycles.

             -  Dose escalation strategy between cohorts and between cycles in the same cohort
                patients will be based upon the quantitatively measured hematological toxicity
                (e.g., ANC or platelet count at nadir). In other words, a mechanism-based
                pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic model developed using sparsely sampled patients'
                PK data and toxicity response will be used to titrate next cycle doses for the
                patients and initial doses for new cohort patients. In other words, a
                mechanism-based pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic model developed using sparsely
                sampled patients' PK data and toxicity response will be used to titrate next cycle
                doses for the patients and initial doses for new cohort patients.
