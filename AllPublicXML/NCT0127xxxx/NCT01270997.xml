      The objective is to prove the equivalence in efficacy and safety of HD203 and Enbrel® in
      combination with Methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

      Primary Objective:

      To prove the equivalence between two groups by comparing the ACR20 of W24 with the baseline
      after injecting HD203 25mg and (Enbrel®) 25mg into the patients with rheumatoid arthritis for
      24 weeks.

      Secondary Objective:

      To compare the efficacy of ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70, etc along with safety in adverse event,
      vital signs, Laboratory test, physical examination and immunogenicity, etc between two groups
      with baseline after injecting HD203 25mg and (Enbrel®) 25mg into patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis for 48 weeks.
