      The investigators hypothesize that the nanoburning is very challenging technique to demolish
      and reverse the plaque especially in combination with stem cell technologies promising
      functional restoration of the vessel wall.

      The completed (in July 2012) interventional three arms (n=180) first-in-man trial (the
      NANOM-FIM trial) assessed (NCT01270139) the safety and feasibility of two delivery techniques
      for nanoparticles (NP), and plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) of atherosclerotic lesions.
      Patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either (1) nano-intervention with delivery
      of silica-gold NP in mini-surgery implanted bioengineered on-artery patch (n=60), or (2)
      nano-intervention with delivery of silica-gold iron-bearing NP with targeted micro-bubbles or
      stem cells in hands of magnetic navigation system (n=60) versus (3) stent implantation
      (n=60). The primary outcome was TAV at 12 months.

      The observational prospective cohort analysis (an amendment to the protocol of August 29th
      2012 with a decision to extend a 1-year study for another 4 years with the assessment of the
      5-year clinical outcomes both retro- and prospectively) of the long-term clinical outcomes at
      the intention-to-treat population of 180 patients with CAD and angiographic SYNTAX score â‰¤22
      enrolled initially to NANOM-FIM trial will be performed at 5 years after the intervention.
      The primary outcome will be a MACE-free survival. The secondary outcomes will be MACE,
      cardiac death, TLR (target lesion revascularization) and TVR (target vessel
      revascularization). Imaging endpoints will be assessed pre-, post- procedure and at 12-month
      follow-up. Clinical endpoints will be analyzed at the baseline and at 12 and 60-month
      follow-up (the release of results is expected after October 2016). Parameters of nanotoxicity
      will be assessed.

      The subset post-hoc analysis will be conducted at 1- and 5-year follow-up (by the Amendment
      of August 29th 2012). At the first subset patients underwent stenting with XIENCE V stent
      proximal to the site of nano-intervention (n=13). Subjects in the second subset were
      undergone drug-coated balloon pre-dilation with further nano-technique (n=20). Lesions in
      patients of the third subset were not prepared for the nano-approach (n=147) (neither
      stenting nor balloon angioplasty). The analysis will be performed and results will be
      released in 2017 with the same clinical outcomes.

      This project and related manuscripts were not prepared or funded in any part by a commercial
      organization. Nanoparticles and biomedical equipment were supplied free for the study by the
      non-profit Agiko and De Haar Foundation (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). All rights of the
      authors are reserved. The access of the international academic or governmental organizations
      to the essential and primary data of the trial is restricted by the Russian governmental
      authorities due to interest of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the main cause of disability and death worldwide. The
      underlying cause generally is atherosclerosis and more in particular thrombotic rupture of an
      atherosclerotic plaque in a vital artery. The restoration of blood flow to ischemic
      myocardium is established as the preeminent objective for treatment of patients with CVD .
      Some modern angioplasty techniques generally just manipulate the form of the plaque and have
      some clinical and technical restrictions, relatively high complication rate and restenosis
      risk.

      The most common techniques in current practice are angioplasty with stenting, and CABG
      surgery (for patients with multivessel disease). Balloon angioplasty and stenting in fact
      manage the form of the plaque, and does not create a significant problem of plaque residue
      flowing from the site. Once a role for elective stent implantation was established, the next
      goal was to overcome the complications of subacute stent thrombosis (first of all, with the
      use of drug-eluting stents) and neointimal hyperplasia (bare-metal stents) through
      pharmacologic and physical means. Among unresolved issues the investigators can describe
      restrictions in patients with stenosis of an unprotected left main coronary artery,
      multivessel disease, diabetes mellitus, still rather high rate of in-stent restenosis, and as
      a solution of the problem with a foreign body in vessel, the development of biodegradable
      stents. Among physical obstacles for stenting the investigators may note that atherosclerotic
      plaque build-up can exist in a number of different forms. The plaque can be quite hard and
      scaly, or more fatty and pliable. Moreover, Dr. Peters D. with colleagues from Santa-Barbara
      (2009) published own data about new modular, multifunctional micelles that contain a
      targeting element, a fluorophore, and, when desired, a drug component in the same particle.
      Targeting atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE-KO mice fed a high-fat diet was accomplished with
      the pentapeptide cysteine-arginine-glutamic acid-lysine-alanine, which binds to clotted
      plasma proteins. The fluorescent micelles bind to the entire surface of the plaque, and
      notably, concentrate at the shoulders of the plaque, a location that is prone to rupture.
      They also show that the targeted micelles deliver an increased concentration of the
      anticoagulant drug hirulog to the plaque compared with untargeted micelles that may reduce
      bleeding complications and atherogenesis.

      Moreover, the ability of statin drugs to reduce the volume of atherosclerotic plaque in the
      coronary artery wall, termed plaque regression, has received much attention. The statins have
      a remarkable track record of lowering cholesterol and improving survival. Apart from lowering
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, they also have a multitude of other
      actions, often collectively described as pleiotropic effects. JUPITER (2003), REVERSAL
      (2004), PROVE IT (2004), ESTABLISH (2004), and ASTEROID (2006) trials have showed that low
      LDL levels after intensive statin therapy when accompanied by raised HDL, can regress, or
      partially reverse, the plaque buildup in the coronary arteries. The findings suggest that the
      various components of atheroma respond differently to treatment with medical therapies, and
      can be used to target plaques that are likely to respond. Thus, lipid pool, inflammatory
      reaction in the forms of cellular migration, humoral substance release, and edema are still
      the most likely to be targets of pharmacotherapy. But, for instance, fibrous tissue, mineral
      deposits, and ground substance would seem to be irreversible despite metabolic manipulation.

      Numerous devices recently have been described that utilize the application of heat to resolve
      atherosclerotic plaque (laser technique, electrosurgical removing of plaque, or with the use
      of radio frequency sparking, and others). Plasmonics is a novel invasive approach in
      medicine, and metal nanoparticles are a new type of optically active composite spherical one
      consisting of a dielectric core covered by a thin metallic shell which is typically gold.
      When nanoparticles are irradiated with near-infrared laser, they absorb energy, which is
      quickly transferred through nonradiative relaxation into heat and accompanied effects, and
      eventually leads to irreparable damage of tissue. In oncology, metal nanoparticles may
      provide a novel means of targeted plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) in tumor tissue,
      minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. However, this approach does not use in
      cardiology today possessing the great potential for angioplasty. The efficiency of
      nanotechnologies, however, is limited by gaps in the current understanding of the thermal
      interactions between nanoparticles and laser light pulses or continuous waves in the context
      of complex biological environments. Irradiation, even with moderate pulses of energy, can
      induce melting, evaporation, and fragmentation of nanoparticles. These events can drastically
      alter the intended therapeutic effects and lead to the formation of vapor bubbles as well as
      acoustic waves and shock waves . But the last disadvantages can become advantages depending
      on purposes of the treatment. Thus the study opens a new chapter in the history of
      plasmonics.

      The investigators designed this study to check potent clinical opportunities, efficacy and
      safety of such novel technique for angioplasty as plasmonic atherodestruction. The
      investigators have drawn the following research questions: 1) Is it possible to plasmonically
      entirely destruct a plaque with minimal complications? 2) What level of safety is typical for
      the different approaches if compare with stenting? 3) What are advantages and disadvantages
      of the different delivery techniques - stem cells or magnetic field? 4) What is the meaning
      of the transplanted mesenchymal CD73+CD105+ stem-progenitor cells for the atherosclerosis
      management? 5) Can plasmonic nanophotothermal therapy (PPTT) get an alternative to stenting?

      Plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) can potentially reduce a volume of plaque. PPTT melts
      an atherosclerotic plaque tissue with irreparable burning of targeted tissues, vapor bubbling
      of cellular cytoplasm and extracellular matrix with subsequent degradation of tissues, and
      destructive effects of acoustic and shock waves as the possible plaque-killing mechanisms.
      NPs are absolutely safe for an organism but entire kinetics is mostly unknown. The most
      dangerous approach with lowest level of efficacy and safety is a delivery of NPs with
      microbubbles if compare with stem cell-based one. Mesenchymal stem cells have appropriate
      effectiveness as a local delivery system with a lot of beneficial properties such as
      anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and multi-metabolic effects leading to the plaque
      degradation. Thus, PPTT can become an alternative to stenting.

      Among potential problems the investigators may name 1) technique of the delivery of these
      nanoparticles directly into the plaque (stem cells, aleuronic microbubbles with surfaced
      antibodies (as a local delivery system), direct injection or infusion into the coronary
      arteries and plaques during CABG or PCI); 2) high risk of acute fatal atherothrombosis at the
      heat site due to destruction of the fibrous cap of plaque (role of nanoparticles adhesion on
      the surface of endothelium); 3) long-term effects of the nanodestruction locally and in
      entire organism (distribution and effects of accumulation in different organs); 4) mechanism
      of this effect (plasmonic microexplosion and burning of tissue, lysis of cells due to vapor
      bubbling of cellular cytoplasm and extracellular tissues, destructive acoustic and shock
      waves); 5) optimal biophysical parameters and necessary energy levels of nanodetonation to
      prevent burning of surrounding tissues and perforation of the vessel; 6) plasmonic damage is
      irreparable, and it means the investigators have to combine it with another biotechnology for
      the restoration of vessel such as the use of stem cells; 7) optimal type of stem cells
      (source, origin, level of differentiation, potential, properties).

      So, disadvantages of current low-invasive approaches (stenting, statin drugs, and others,
      laser, electrosurgery devices):

        -  Foreign body in the heart

        -  Restenosis, including neointimal hyperplasia (adventitial and circulating
           stem-progenitor cells of different origin are involved)

        -  Risk of fatal acute or sub-acute atherothrombosis (including 'in-stent' sub-acute
           atherothrombosis)

        -  Non-pathogenetic - cannot reverse or significantly regress the plaque

        -  No effect for remodeling and calcification (restriction for necessary remodeling)

        -  Clinical restrictions for some group (multivessel disease, left main CAD, diabetes
           mellitus, severe CAD and etc), on the another hand, CABG is very traumatic procedure
           (solution - MICS, including achievements in endoscopic stereotaxic surgery), but CABG is
           still an approach in charge in severe or high-risk patients

      Disadvantages of the studied approach:

        -  Necessity of the special delivery technique

        -  Lost function of artery - irreparable pro-fibrotic damage - necessity of another
           clinical management for restoration of tissue - necessity of the restoration therapy
           with stem cells

        -  Threat of acute fatal atherothrombosis due to rupture of (vulnerable) plaque

        -  Cannot treat non-organic part of plaque - necessity of the special therapy - stem cells

        -  Harm of potent detrimental side-effects - vapor bubbling (boiling of cytoplasm and ECM
           with subsequent lysis of cells, and provocation of pro-apoptotic cascades), acoustic and
           shock waves due to plasma-generated laser-related detonation of nanoshells in tissue

        -  Erratic (uncontrollable) heating - surrounding tissue of the site of interest can
           achieve a temperature until 38-39Â°. But at the site of burning final temperature can be
           at about 50-180 C (cauterization/ searing/ melting effect) with following pro-fibrous
           effect of tissue.

After the admission, patients were examined with QCA, and allocated to the trial. The implantation of the patch onto the artery was undergone by the minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS CABG) with fixation of the graft to the epicardial myocardium. MICS CABG implies a beating-heart multi-vessel heart surgery performed through several small incisions under direct vision through an anterolateral mini-thoracotomy in the 4th-6th intercostal spaces. The patients can expect high quality of life resuming all everyday activities within a few weeks of their operation. NP were activated with NIR laser at 7 days after the intervention. Patients were treated with bolus of bivalirudin on the day of NP detonation.</description>

    <description>60 patients in Ferro group were managed with transplantation of iron-bearing nanoparticles (NP), particularly with intracoronary infusion of allogenous stem cells or CD68 targeted micro-bubbles pre-cultivated in the medium with iron-bearing NP. Cells and/ or micro-bubbles were infused with QCA- and IVUS-guidance to the target coronary artery via micro-catheter on the day of admission. The destruction of CD68 targeted micro-bubbles was obtained by using a Sonos 5500 machine with an S3 transducer operating in ultraharmonic mode (transmit, 1.3MHz/ receive, 3.6 MHz) with a mechanical index of 1.5 and a depth of 4 cm. The AXIOM Artis dBC (Siemens) magnetic navigation system was used for precise delivery of NP to the atheroma through two permanent computer-controlled external magnets generating a navigational magnetic field of 0.08 Tesla in any direction. NP were detonated with NIR laser under the protection of anti-platelet therapy.</description>

    <description>In case of control group (stenting control), XIENCE V stent was implanted to 60 patients. Patients with a single de novo native coronary stenosis of less than 12 mm lesion length, more than 50% stenosis and reference diameter of 3.0 mm as assessed by online QCA were stented by a single stent of 3.0 x 18 mm. The procedure of implantation had to be performed according to common interventional practices including the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine 0.2 mg of glycerol trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate and intra-arterial heparin (50-100 U/kg body weight). Predilation with a conventional balloon catheter was recommended before DES deployment according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The protocol recommended the study stent should cover 2 mm of non-diseased tissue on either side of the target lesion. Postdilatation was allowed with a balloon that was shorter than was the study device.</description>

After the admission, patients were examined with QCA, and allocated to the trial. The implantation of the patch onto the artery was undergone by the minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS CABG) with fixation of the graft to the epicardial myocardium. MICS CABG implies a beating-heart multi-vessel heart surgery performed through several small incisions under direct vision through an anterolateral mini-thoracotomy in the 4th-6th intercostal spaces. The approach considered as an alternative to PCI allowing quick recover without major complications. The patients can expect high quality of life resuming all everyday activities within a few weeks of their operation. NP were activated with NIR laser at 7 days after the intervention. Patients were treated with bolus of bivalirudin on the day of NP detonation.</description>

The protocol recommended the study stent should cover 2 mm of non-diseased tissue on either side of the target lesion. Postdilatation was allowed with a balloon that was shorter than was the study device.</description>

Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) were performed pre-, post-procedure and at 12-month follow-up after a bolus infusion of i.c. nitrate. QCA was undergone with the CAAS II analysis system (Pie Medical B.V., Maastricht, The Netherlands) with analysis of different QCA parameters such as minimal lumen diameter, maximum lumen diameter, reference diameter, diameter stenosis, lesion length, percent atheroma volume (PAV), total atheroma volume (TAV), and lumen volume.</description>

            <description>60 patients in Nano group were treated with bioengineered patch that was grown with allogenous stem cells pre-cultivated in the medium with NP. After the admission, patients were examined with QCA, and allocated to the trial. The implantation of the patch onto the artery was undergone by the minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS CABG) with fixation of the graft to the epicardial myocardium. MICS CABG implies a beating-heart multi-vessel heart surgery performed through several small incisions under direct vision through an anterolateral mini-thoracotomy in the 4th-6th intercostal spaces. The approach considered as an alternative to PCI allowing quick recover without major complications. The patients can expect high quality of life resuming all everyday activities within a few weeks of their operation. NP were activated with NIR laser at 7 days after the intervention. Patients were treated with bolus of bivalirudin on the day of NP detonation.</description>

            <description>60 patients in Ferro group were managed with intracoronary infusion of allogenous stem cells or CD68 targeted micro-bubbles pre-cultivated in the medium with iron-bearing NP. Cells and/ or micro-bubbles were infused with QCA- and IVUS-guidance to the target coronary artery via micro-catheter on the day of admission at the Acute Care Unit. The destruction of CD68 targeted micro-bubbles was obtained by using a Sonos 5500 machine with an S3 transducer operating in ultraharmonic mode (transmit, 1.3MHz/ receive, 3.6 MHz) with a mechanical index of 1.5 and a depth of 4 cm. The AXIOM Artis dBC (Siemens) magnetic navigation system was used for precise delivery of NP to the atheroma through two permanent computer-controlled external magnets generating a navigational magnetic field of 0.08 Tesla in any direction with opportunity to produce a spot at the area of target artery and lesion. NP were detonated with NIR laser at the end of the procedure under the protection of anti-platelet therapy.</description>

The procedure of implantation had to be performed according to common interventional practices including the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine 0.2 mg of glycerol trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate and intra-arterial heparin (50-100 U/kg body weight). Predilation with a conventional balloon catheter was recommended before DES deployment according to the manufacturer's recommendation.

            <description>60 patients in Nano group were treated with bioengineered patch that was grown with allogenous stem cells pre-cultivated in the medium with NP. After the admission, patients were examined with QCA, and allocated to the trial. The implantation of the patch onto the artery was undergone by the minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS CABG) with fixation of the graft to the epicardial myocardium. MICS CABG implies a beating-heart multi-vessel heart surgery performed through several small incisions under direct vision through an anterolateral mini-thoracotomy in the 4th-6th intercostal spaces. The approach considered as an alternative to PCI allowing quick recover without major complications. The patients can expect high quality of life resuming all everyday activities within a few weeks of their operation. NP were activated with NIR laser at 7 days after the intervention. Patients were treated with bolus of bivalirudin on the day of NP detonation.</description>

            <description>60 patients in Ferro group were managed with intracoronary infusion of allogenous stem cells or CD68 targeted micro-bubbles pre-cultivated in the medium with iron-bearing NP. Cells and/ or micro-bubbles were infused with QCA- and IVUS-guidance to the target coronary artery via micro-catheter on the day of admission at the Acute Care Unit. The destruction of CD68 targeted micro-bubbles was obtained by using a Sonos 5500 machine with an S3 transducer operating in ultraharmonic mode (transmit, 1.3MHz/ receive, 3.6 MHz) with a mechanical index of 1.5 and a depth of 4 cm. The AXIOM Artis dBC (Siemens) magnetic navigation system was used for precise delivery of NP to the atheroma through two permanent computer-controlled external magnets generating a navigational magnetic field of 0.08 Tesla in any direction with opportunity to produce a spot at the area of target artery and lesion. NP were detonated with NIR laser at the end of the procedure under the protection of anti-platelet therapy.</description>

            <description>In case of control group, XIENCE V stent was implanted to 60 patients. Patients with a single de novo native coronary stenosis of less than 12 mm lesion length, more than 50% stenosis and reference diameter of 3.0 mm as assessed by online QCA were stented by a single stent of 3.0 x 18 mm. The procedure of implantation had to be performed according to common interventional practices including the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine 0.2 mg of glycerol trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate and intra-arterial heparin (50-100 U/kg body weight). Predilation with a conventional balloon catheter was recommended before DES deployment according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The protocol recommended the study stent should cover 2 mm of non-diseased tissue on either side of the target lesion. Postdilatation was allowed with a balloon that was shorter than was the study device.</description>

          <title>Per Cent of Fibro-fatty Component</title>
          <description>IVUS (intravascular ultrasound) and IVUS-VH (virtual histology) images were acquired simultaneously with a phased array 20 MHz intravascular ultrasound catheter EagleEye (Volcano Co., Rancho Cordova, CA, USA) with motorized pull-back at a constant speed of 0.5 mm/s. Four tissue components (necrotic core - red; dense calcium - white; fibrous - green; and fibro-fatty - light green or yellow) were identified with autoregressive classification systems. For each cross section stent struts were detected as areas of apparent dense calcium and necrotic core. All IVUS analysis was performed offline by a CoreLab of the Ural Institute of Cardiology.</description>

        <description>The Kaplan-Meier analysis of the cardiac event-free survival (failure-free survival). The end point in this study was cardiac event-free survival during follow-up, starting at randomization. Cardiac events included cardiac death, myocardial infarction and unintended revascularization. Cardiac death was defined as sudden death, death after the onset of symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia and death due to heart failure. Noncardiac death was defined as death due to all other causes. Myocardial infarction was defined as an increase in cardiac enzymes or new pathologic Q-waves on the ECG, or both. Unintended revascularization was defined as PTCA or CABG performed due to worsening of the patientâ€™s clinical condition, rather than the PTCA or CABG assigned by the revascularization team when patient management was determined.</description>

        <title>Coronary Vasomotion - Mean Lumen Diameter After Infusion of Acetylcholine 10-6 M</title>
        <description>Coronary vasomotion was assessed with QCA. End-diastolic images of coronary arteries were evaluated at baseline, after intravascular infusion of acetylcholine (through a microcatheter at increasing doses up to 10-8, 10-7, 10-6 M with a washout period of at least five minutes between each dose), and after nitroglycerine application following acetylcholine (100 Âµg orally). In all patients, measurements were performed in two segments on site of intervention while 960 seconds. The artery diameter was calibrated against the contrast-filled tip of the catheter. Vasoconstriction to acetylcholine was defined as a 3% change of the mean lumen diameter after infusion of the maximal dose of acetylcholine. An investigator blinded to treatment group performed all measurements.</description>

            <description>60 patients in Nano group were treated with bioengineered patch that was grown with allogenous stem cells pre-cultivated in the medium with NP. After the admission, patients were examined with QCA, and allocated to the trial. The implantation of the patch onto the artery was undergone by the minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS CABG) with fixation of the graft to the epicardial myocardium. MICS CABG implies a beating-heart multi-vessel heart surgery performed through several small incisions under direct vision through an anterolateral mini-thoracotomy in the 4th-6th intercostal spaces. The approach considered as an alternative to PCI allowing quick recover without major complications. The patients can expect high quality of life resuming all everyday activities within a few weeks of their operation. NP were activated with NIR laser at 7 days after the intervention. Patients were treated with bolus of bivalirudin on the day of NP detonation.</description>

            <description>60 patients in Ferro group were managed with intracoronary infusion of allogenous stem cells or CD68 targeted micro-bubbles pre-cultivated in the medium with iron-bearing NP. Cells and/ or micro-bubbles were infused with QCA- and IVUS-guidance to the target coronary artery via micro-catheter on the day of admission at the Acute Care Unit. The destruction of CD68 targeted micro-bubbles was obtained by using a Sonos 5500 machine with an S3 transducer operating in ultraharmonic mode (transmit, 1.3MHz/ receive, 3.6 MHz) with a mechanical index of 1.5 and a depth of 4 cm. The AXIOM Artis dBC (Siemens) magnetic navigation system was used for precise delivery of NP to the atheroma through two permanent computer-controlled external magnets generating a navigational magnetic field of 0.08 Tesla in any direction with opportunity to produce a spot at the area of target artery and lesion. NP were detonated with NIR laser at the end of the procedure under the protection of anti-platelet therapy.</description>

            <description>In case of control group, XIENCE V stent was implanted to 60 patients. Patients with a single de novo native coronary stenosis of less than 12 mm lesion length, more than 50% stenosis and reference diameter of 3.0 mm as assessed by online QCA were stented by a single stent of 3.0 x 18 mm. The procedure of implantation had to be performed according to common interventional practices including the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine 0.2 mg of glycerol trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate and intra-arterial heparin (50-100 U/kg body weight). Predilation with a conventional balloon catheter was recommended before DES deployment according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The protocol recommended the study stent should cover 2 mm of non-diseased tissue on either side of the target lesion. Postdilatation was allowed with a balloon that was shorter than was the study device.</description>

            <description>60 patients in Ferro group were managed with intracoronary infusion of allogenous stem cells or CD68 targeted micro-bubbles pre-cultivated in the medium with iron-bearing NP. Cells and/ or micro-bubbles were infused with QCA- and IVUS-guidance to the target coronary artery via micro-catheter on the day of admission at the Acute Care Unit. The destruction of CD68 targeted micro-bubbles was obtained by using a Sonos 5500 machine with an S3 transducer operating in ultraharmonic mode (transmit, 1.3MHz/ receive, 3.6 MHz) with a mechanical index of 1.5 and a depth of 4 cm. The AXIOM Artis dBC (Siemens) magnetic navigation system was used for precise delivery of NP to the atheroma through two permanent computer-controlled external magnets generating a navigational magnetic field of 0.08 Tesla in any direction with opportunity to produce a spot at the area of target artery and lesion. NP were detonated with NIR laser at the end of the procedure under the protection of anti-platelet therapy.</description>

            <description>In case of control group, XIENCE V stent was implanted to 60 patients. Patients with a single de novo native coronary stenosis of less than 12 mm lesion length, more than 50% stenosis and reference diameter of 3.0 mm as assessed by online QCA were stented by a single stent of 3.0 x 18 mm. The procedure of implantation had to be performed according to common interventional practices including the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine 0.2 mg of glycerol trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate and intra-arterial heparin (50-100 U/kg body weight). Predilation with a conventional balloon catheter was recommended before DES deployment according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The protocol recommended the study stent should cover 2 mm of non-diseased tissue on either side of the target lesion. Postdilatation was allowed with a balloon that was shorter than was the study device.</description>

            <description>60 patients in Nano group were treated with transplantation of nanoparticles (NP), particularly with a bioengineered patch that was grown with allogenous stem cells pre-cultivated in the medium with NP. The implantation of the patch onto the artery was undergone by the minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS CABG) with fixation of the graft to the epicardial myocardium. MICS CABG implies a beating-heart multi-vessel heart surgery performed through several small incisions under direct vision through an anterolateral mini-thoracotomy in the 4th-6th intercostal spaces. NP were activated with NIR laser at 7 days after the intervention. Transplantation of nanoparticles: 60 patients into nanogroup with the use of 60/15-70/40 nm silica-gold nanoparticles (NPs) transplanted by endoscopic cardiac surgery in the composition of bioengineered on-artery patch grown on the basis of biopolymeric scaffold and host circulating CD45-CD34-CD73+CD105+ progenitor cells</description>

The destruction of CD68 targeted micro-bubbles was obtained by using a Sonos 5500 machine with an S3 transducer operating in ultraharmonic mode (transmit, 1.3MHz/ receive, 3.6 MHz) with a mechanical index of 1.5 and a depth of 4 cm. The AXIOM Artis dBC (Siemens) magnetic navigation system was used for precise delivery of NP to the atheroma through two permanent computer-controlled external magnets generating a navigational magnetic field of 0.08 Tesla in any direction. NP were detonated with NIR laser under the protection of anti-platelet therapy.

Patients with a single de novo native coronary stenosis of less than 12 mm lesion length, more than 50% stenosis and reference diameter of 3.0 mm as assessed by online QCA were stented by a single stent of 3.0 x 18 mm. The procedure of implantation had to be performed according to common interventional practices including the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine 0.2 mg of glycerol trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate and intra-arterial heparin (50-100 U/kg body weight). Predilation with a conventional balloon catheter was recommended before DES deployment according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The protocol recommended the study stent should cover 2 mm of non-diseased tissue on either side of the target lesion. Postdilatation was allowed with a balloon that was shorter than was the study device.

            <description>60 patients in Nano group were treated with transplantation of nanoparticles (NP), particularly with a bioengineered patch that was grown with allogenous stem cells pre-cultivated in the medium with NP. The implantation of the patch onto the artery was undergone by the minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS CABG) with fixation of the graft to the epicardial myocardium. MICS CABG implies a beating-heart multi-vessel heart surgery performed through several small incisions under direct vision through an anterolateral mini-thoracotomy in the 4th-6th intercostal spaces. NP were activated with NIR laser at 7 days after the intervention. Transplantation of nanoparticles: 60 patients into nanogroup with the use of 60/15-70/40 nm silica-gold nanoparticles (NPs) transplanted by endoscopic cardiac surgery in the composition of bioengineered on-artery patch grown on the basis of biopolymeric scaffold and host circulating CD45-CD34-CD73+CD105+ progenitor cells</description>

The destruction of CD68 targeted micro-bubbles was obtained by using a Sonos 5500 machine with an S3 transducer operating in ultraharmonic mode (transmit, 1.3MHz/ receive, 3.6 MHz) with a mechanical index of 1.5 and a depth of 4 cm. The AXIOM Artis dBC (Siemens) magnetic navigation system was used for precise delivery of NP to the atheroma through two permanent computer-controlled external magnets generating a navigational magnetic field of 0.08 Tesla in any direction. NP were detonated with NIR laser under the protection of anti-platelet therapy.

Patients with a single de novo native coronary stenosis of less than 12 mm lesion length, more than 50% stenosis and reference diameter of 3.0 mm as assessed by online QCA were stented by a single stent of 3.0 x 18 mm. The procedure of implantation had to be performed according to common interventional practices including the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine 0.2 mg of glycerol trinitrate or isosorbide dinitrate and intra-arterial heparin (50-100 U/kg body weight). Predilation with a conventional balloon catheter was recommended before DES deployment according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The protocol recommended the study stent should cover 2 mm of non-diseased tissue on either side of the target lesion. Postdilatation was allowed with a balloon that was shorter than was the study device.
