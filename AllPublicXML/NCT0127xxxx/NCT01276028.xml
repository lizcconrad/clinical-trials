    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture for
      treating vasomotor and other symptoms associated with menopause as acupuncture is generally
      practiced in the &quot;real world&quot; setting and to obtain a comprehensive assessment of use
      patterns and symptom relief over time. This study will allow us to determine treatment
      patterns recommended by practicing acupuncturists, adherence to these treatments, and the
      effectiveness of different treatment patterns for reducing hot flashes. Results of this study
      will provide meaningful information to women in terms of number and frequency of acupuncture
      treatments likely to be needed to reduce hot flashes.
