  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific objective of the project is to evaluate if the topical administration of
      Fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC)-Adalimumab during the endomicroscopic examination of the gut
      in Crohn's disease (CD) patients shows an acceptable safety profile. Another objective is to
      explore whether the use of FITC-Adalimumab as a predictive biomarker might reliably predict
      patient response to Adalimumab therapy and hence enable optimized utilization of this
      treatment option.

    <description>The study product FITC-Adalimumab will be topically applied via a spray catheter to the intestinal mucosa of Crohn's disease patients during endomicroscopy of the gut. One mL of the diluted study product will be applied each time to overall four selected intestinal areas at a concentration of 20 μg/mL respectively (equivalent to 20 μg of FITC-Adalimumab per area). Total amount applied will be 80 μg FITC-Adalimumab per patient.</description>
