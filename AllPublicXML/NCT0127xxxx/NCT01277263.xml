  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with Breast Cancer who do not respond to chemotherapy may undergo months of treatment
      with little or no change in tumor size or overall outcome.

      The Researchers have demonstrated a previously undescribed &quot;metabolic flare&quot; response
      observed very early in neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer patients. The research can
      determine that this flare is predictive of overall therapy response and is due to both an
      inflammatory reaction and cell death induced by cytotoxic therapy.

      The researcher can use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging device to measure and predict
      the markers of the response in the first weeks of chemo-therapy.

      The oxyhemoglobin flare response can predictive of overall pathological response to
      chemotherapy in human subjects. These vascular changes can indicate the rapid transient
      increase and then decrease in oxyhemoglobin concentration in the first hours and days after
      therapeutic administration. The magnitude and time course of the flare response in patients
      receiving cytotoxic therapy will differ between pathological responders and non-responders.
      This oxyhemoglobin &quot;flare response&quot; can be observed In tumors where vascular dynamics are
      intact.
