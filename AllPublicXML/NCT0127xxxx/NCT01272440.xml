    <textblock>
      Asparaginase is an important drug i the treatment of childhood leukaemia.

      The aim of this project is to study the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antibody
      development and hypersensitivity reactions during prolonged PEG-asparaginase treatment.

      Study part 1) Asparaginase pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during prolonged
      PEG-asparaginase treatment: A NOPHO ALL-2008 study

      Study part 2) Asparagine depletion in cerebrospinal fluid: A NOPHO ALL-2008 study

      Study part 3) A characterization of PEG-asparaginase hypersensitivity in children treated
      according to the NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol

      Perspectives: New knowledge about PEG-asparaginase treatment regarding dosing, dosing
      interval, adverse effects and EFS, which may lead to improved future therapy

      Patients: Children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the Nordic Countries

    <description>Blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid samples are collected at certain timepoints during 30 weeks of treatment with PEG-asparaginase. They are analyzed for asparagine, asparaginase-enzyme activity and asparaginase-antibodies.These measures tell about the effect of the drug, PEG-asparaginase.</description>
