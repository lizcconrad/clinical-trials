      PRO 140 2102 is a phase 2b, national, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PRO 140 (anti-CCR5
      monoclonal antibody) administered subcutaneously as an adjunct to a new, optimized, oral
      antiretroviral regimen in HIV-infected injection drug users with viral rebound and documented
      poor adherence to the previous antiretroviral regimen.
