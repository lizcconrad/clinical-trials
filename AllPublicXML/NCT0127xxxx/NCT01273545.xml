      This study will use electronic health services databases to describe the usage patterns of
      dapoxetine hydrochloride (PRILIGY) in Germany and Italy with a focus on describing the extent
      and proportion of patients with characteristics suggestive of the use of PRILIGY within,
      versus outside of the intended use population.

      This study will use anonymized (nameless) patient data from electronic health services
      databases in Germany and Italy to describe the proportion of PRILIGY (dapoxetine
      hydrochloride) usage among those patients with characteristics suggestive of the use of
      PRILIGY within versus outside (eg, those with contraindications) of the intended use (IU)
      population. This is an observational study; no investigational drug will be administered.
