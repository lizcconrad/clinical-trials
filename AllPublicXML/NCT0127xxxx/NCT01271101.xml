  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the EASY-CHINA Registry is to describe the clinical epidemiology of
      Chinese patients with NSTE-ACS, to evaluate their current anticoagulation management in
      China, and the resources used for it.

    <textblock>
      Non-ST-elevated acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS)are the leading cause of emergency medical
      care in the USA. In China, these syndromes have also become the major causes of morbidity and
      mortality and account for several thousands of death and hospitalizations annually.
      Anti-platelet drugs, anticoagulants and intervention therapy for high-risk NSTE-ACS patients
      may increase bleeding events while reducing ischemic coronary events. There are some
      evidences supporting the association between hemorrhagic complications and short- and
      long-term mortality. Therefore, future advances in antithrombotic therapy for NSTE-ACS need
      to focus on reducing ischemic event rates without increasing hemorrhagic complication rates.
      In this general framework, there is the need for an appropriate adoption of the available
      evidences concerning therapeutic strategies, specifically the use of the different
      antithrombotic strategies, in real world patients in order to further improve their
      outcomes.The primary objective of this study is to describe the clinical epidemiology of
      Chinese patients with NSTE-ACS, and to evaluate their current management in China. This study
      will be an observational survey, thus zero interference is emphasized throughout it. No
      randomization, blinding or special treatment will be assigned for the subjects. Issues
      concerning the care of subjects are completely left to the discretion of investigators in
      order to collect the real-world information about the pharmacological treatments for NSTE-ACS
      patients in china.
