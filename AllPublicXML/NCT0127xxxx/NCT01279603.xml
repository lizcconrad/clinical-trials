  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is about testing GO-203-2c, which is a newly discovered compound that
      binds to an oncoprotein (a cancer causing protein) called MUC1 (which is over-expressed in
      many cancers). By binding to MUC1, GO-203-2c eventually causes tumor cell death in laboratory
      studies.

      This study is being done to:

        -  Test the safety of GO-203-2c and see what effects (good and bad) it has on you and your
           cancer

        -  Find the highest dose of GO-203-2c that can be given without causing bad side effects

        -  Examine how much GO-203-2c is in the blood at certain times after it is given and how
           quickly the body gets rid of it

        -  Observe whether there is any effect of GO-203-2c on the size and activity of cancer in
           your body

    <description>GO-203-2c Injection is a non-preserved, sterile, ready-to-use liquid dosage form provided in a glass vial with rubber closure and crimp seal. Injection will be added to the contents of an intravenous bag (of 0.9% NS, D5W or sterile water) to a final concentration of between 0.03 - 0.3 mg/ml (preferable in 100 mls or greater) and administered as a single agent intravenously over 60 minutes. A treatment cycle will consist of a daily IV dose administered for 21 consecutive days followed by a 7 day rest.</description>
