    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two anticancer drugs,
      everolimus and pasireotide, in patients with thyroid cancer when the cancer is no longer
      responding to treatment with radioiodine or where it is deemed unsafe for the patient to
      receive additional radioiodine treatment. The investigators also want to establish the best
      manner of taking the two medications when used together to treat thyroid cancer. In
      particular, the investigators want to know if it is better to give both at the same time or
      add a second medication after the first one has stopped working.

      This study will also look at specific substances called biomarkers in your blood, and in the
      tumor tissue which are involved in the growth of tumor cells, and determine if the levels of
      these biomarkers are related to your response to treatment or development of side effects.

      Everolimus, also known by the brand name, Afinitor, is a biologic drug approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of kidney cancer. It works by preventing
      cancer cells from multiplying and it also makes them more likely to die from the treatment.

      Pasireotide also known by the name, SOM230 is a new medication that is not yet approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of cancer. It is a newer form of a drug called octreotide, which is
      approved for the treatment of cancer arising from endocrine organs. Pasireotide works by
      binding to a protein called somatostatin receptor, which is expressed in many tissues
      throughout the body including thyroid cancer cells. Pasireotide prevents the action of
      somatostatin by binding to these receptors.
