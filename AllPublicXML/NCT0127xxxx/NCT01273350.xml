      Prospective, non-randomized, single-center cohort study treating internal carotid artery
      stenosis using the Xact Carotid Artery Stent and emboshield distal protection system in
      conjunction with bivalirudin as the procedural anticoagulation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the XACT stent and emboshield
      with Angiomax as the procedural anticoagulant.

      Primary safety endpoint is the occurrence of Major Adverse Events, defined as death,
      myocardial infarction (Q or non Q wave), and from target revascularization at one year

               -  Stenosis &gt; or = to 60% in asymptomatic patients

          -  Target lesion may be in the common or internal carotid artery and is amenable to
             treatment with angioplasty and stenting

          -  Patients taking warfarin may be included if their dosage is reduced before the
             procedure to result in an INR of 1.5 or less and a Prothrombin time of 15 seconds.
             Warfarin may be started after the procedure.

             test during index hospitalization

          -  Patient or legally authorized representative must sign a written informed consent,

             bivalirudin, nickel, titanium, or a sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot
             adequately pre-medicated.

          -  The subject has a platlet count&lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or 700,000 cells/mm3 or a WBC of &lt;
             3,000 cells/mm3.
