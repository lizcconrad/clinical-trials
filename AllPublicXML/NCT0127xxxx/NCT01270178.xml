  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent replication of HBV (47-55%) is frequently found in patients with HCC, which in
      turn leads to deterioration of liver reserve. Moreover, a large proportion of HCC patients
      who underwent curative therapy died from progressive liver decompensation rather than
      recurrence of cancer. It had been proved that anti-viral therapy for hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-related HCC patients could reduce the rate of tumor recurrence after surgical
      resection.

      This is a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of ETV therapy in chronic hepatitis B
      patients after receiving RFA therapy for HCC.
