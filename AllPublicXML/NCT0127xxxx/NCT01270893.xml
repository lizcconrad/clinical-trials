    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if TasignaÂ® (nilotinib) can cause tumor
      cells to shrink and/or die in patients with GIST who are scheduled for surgery or may be
      eligible for surgery. The safety of this drug will be studied. Researchers also want to use
      imaging scans to study the changes in tumor size that may be caused by using nilotinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GIST is a rare cancer known as a soft-tissue sarcoma that forms in the gastrointestinal (GI)
      tract and may spread to other parts of the body. However, sometimes GIST stays in the GI
      tract where it may possibly be removed by surgery. While some chemotherapy drugs, such as
      imatinib mesylate, are effective in shrinking or controlling GIST, some types of GIST tumors
      do not respond to imatinib. Researchers want to find out if nilotinib (a drug similar to
      imatinib) causes GIST cells to die, so that the tumors shrink enough to be removed by
      surgery.

      The Study Drugs:

      Nilotinib is designed to prevent cells from multiplying by causing tumor cells to shrink
      and/or die. This may prevent the cancer from growing.

      Study Arms and Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, a surgeon from M. D. Anderson
      will check your imaging scans to decide if the tumor can be surgically removed.

      Participants in this research study will be assigned to either Arm 1 or Arm 2, based on
      whether the tumor is able to be removed by surgery at this point.

      Arm 1:

      If the surgeon thinks the tumor is able to be removed during surgery, you will be assigned to
      Arm 1. You will receive nilotinib pills by mouth 2 times a day for 7 days. You will receive a
      pill diary and will be shown how to record the date and time for each dose received.

      After the week of nilotinib therapy, you will be scheduled to have the GIST removed during
      surgery. Tumor tissue that is removed during surgery will be used for research testing. Some
      of these tests will help researchers learn how effectively nilotinib kills tumor cells. Your
      DNA and RNA (the genetic material in your cells) will also be collected from these tissue
      samples and used to help researchers understand how these tumor cells survive, divide, and
      die as a result of nilotinib.

      After 4-6 weeks of recovery time after surgery, you will receive standard of care treatment
      off-study.

      An assigned research nurse will see you at each clinic visit and will serve as the first
      contact for any questions or concerns. During the course of this study, you will be asked to
      report any serious problems or concerns at each study visit. If you have concerns or
      questions between each study visits, you may contact your study nurse through the Sarcoma
      Center at M. D. Anderson.

      Arm 1 Study Visits:

      Participants in Arm 1 will have the following tests and procedures performed:

      On Day -7, you will begin taking nilotinib.

      On Day -1:

        -  You will have a dynamic CT scan within 36 hours before surgery to check the status of
           the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an ECG.

      On Day 0, you will have surgery to remove the GIST.

      On Day 56:

        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects
           you may have experienced.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a chest x-ray.

        -  You will have a standard CT scan or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 3 months:

        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects
           you may have experienced.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a standard CT scan or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Arm 2:

      If the surgeon thinks the tumor is not able to be surgically removed at this time, or that
      the tumor needs to shrink before it can be removed during surgery, you will be assigned to
      Arm 2. You will receive nilotinib pills by mouth 2 times a day for 7 days. You will receive a
      pill diary and will be shown how to record the date and time for each dose received.

      After the week of nilotinib therapy, you will be scheduled to have a biopsy on what is
      counted as Day 0 on your pill diary. After 7 days of recovery from the biopsy, you will
      continue receiving nilotinib on the same schedule (2 times a day by mouth).

      After 8 weeks of nilotinib therapy, you will have more scans performed to measure the size of
      the tumor. These scans will include a CT scan of your abdomen or pelvis. You may have a
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan instead, if you have chronic kidney disease.

      If the scans show that the tumor has gotten smaller, you will meet with the surgeon to
      discuss surgery to remove the tumor. If you are scheduled to have surgery, you will stop
      taking nilotinib 1 day before your surgery date. If the tumor has gotten bigger, you will be
      taken off study treatment, and other treatment options will be discussed with you. If the
      scan shows that the tumor is unchanged, you will continue to receive nilotinib until the
      tumor either shrinks (and you are able to have surgery) or gets bigger (and you are taken off
      study treatment).

      Tumor tissue that is removed during your scheduled biopsy or during surgery will also be used
      for biological and genetic testing.

      After you have surgery, you will receive standard of care treatment off-study, depending on
      the results of the surgery.

      Your doctor may recommend that you begin taking imatinib mesylate after surgery (or if the
      disease has gotten worse and you are not able to have surgery). In many cases, imatinib
      mesylate is given on a daily basis for 1-2 years to lower the risk of the disease coming
      back. During the time after the surgery, information will be collected about your overall
      health.

      If the disease gets worse while you are on study, and you agree, you will be asked to have a
      tumor biopsy of an easily accessible area. If this happens, this procedure will be described
      to you in more detail, and you will sign a separate consent.

      An assigned research nurse will see you at each clinic visit and will serve as the first
      contact for any questions or concerns. During the course of this study, you will be asked to
      report any serious problems or concerns at each study visit. If you have concerns or
      questions between each study visits, you may contact your study nurse through the Sarcoma
      Center at M.D. Anderson.

      Arm 2 Study Visits:

      Participants in Arm 2 will have the following tests and procedures performed:

      On Day -7, you will begin taking nilotinib.

      On Day -1:

        -  You will have a a dynamic CT scan within 36 hours before your biopsy to check the status
           of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an ECG.

      On Day 0:

      -You will have a tumor tissue biopsy performed. To collect a tumor tissue biopsy, the skin
      above and around the tumor area is numbed with anesthetic, and a sample of tumor tissue is
      withdrawn through a large needle.

      On Day 56:

        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects
           you may have experienced.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a chest x-ray.

        -  You will have a standard CT scan or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Depending on the results of the tests at Day 56 you will either have surgery, continue
      nilotinib, or be taken off study and switched to another therapy.

      Every 3 months:

        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects
           you may have experienced.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.

        -  Your performance status will be measured.

        -  You will have a standard CT scan or an MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Additional Testing for Both Groups:

      You will have blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. These PK
      samples will be drawn after the first 6 days of nilotinib (Day -1) and either at the
      end-of-treatment visit or at any point that the disease gets worse.

      When/if your treatment is interrupted for any reason and/or your dose is changed in any way,
      you will also have ECGs performed. You will have an additional ECG 7 days after this.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      At this visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  You performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about your health, any drugs you may be taking, and any side effects
           you may have experienced.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an ECG.

        -  You will have a CT or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for 1 week (Arm 1) before you have surgery. You may
      continue taking the study drug for as long as your doctor thinks it is in your best interest,
      or until you are able to have surgery (Arm 2). You will no longer be able to take the study
      drug if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      Follow-up Testing:

      You will be asked to return to the clinic every 3 months for standard follow-up testing,
      including routine blood tests and CT scans.

      This is an investigational study. Nilotinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of certain types of chronic myeloid leukemia. Its use in patients with GIST is
      investigational.

      Up to 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
