  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is proposed to evaluate whether giving part of the chemotherapy prior to
      radiotherapy and surgery (as opposed to standard of care, which involves giving all the
      chemotherapy after radiotherapy and surgery) for patients with node positive operable rectal
      cancer will result in higher patient compliance to chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent randomized studies with preoperative combined chemotherapy and external beam
      radiation (EBRT/CT) with total mesorectal excision (TME surgery), the compliance to adjuvant
      chemotherapy ranged from 42.9% to 70%. This low compliance rate could influence the efficacy
      of chemotherapy. This is quite unique to patients with rectal cancer, since compliance is not
      a major issue in patients with colon cancer, belonging to the same age group. Therefore, it
      is reasonable to postulate that this difference might due to the additive toxicity burden of
      neoadjuvant EBRT/CT and TME.

      In this randomized phase II study, compliance to chemotherapy will be compared in the two
      groups: In the first group, patients will receive half of their chemotherapy regimen in
      neoadjuvant and half in adjuvant; and, in the second group, patients will be receiving all
      their chemotherapy in adjuvant. Furthermore, brachytherapy will be used to deliver
      radiotherapy.
