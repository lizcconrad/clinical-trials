  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safety and efficacy are key issues in antiretroviral therapy (ART) selection. Efavirenz (EFV)
      is an important component of combination ART in treatment naive individuals. Like many drugs,
      there are inter-individual differences in the efficacy and tolerability of EFV. The Encore1
      study provides an opportunity to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK)(processes by which a drug
      is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body) of EFV in blood samples
      collected over a 24-hour dosing interval in participants receiving either standard 600 mg or
      reduced 400 mg dose EFV once daily.

      This sub-study will investigate the relationships between dosage, EFV plasma concentrations,
      toxicity and virological efficacy. EFV concentrations in dried blood spots and matched plasma
      and will be evaluated to determine the utility of dried blood spot measurements in measuring
      EFV plasma concentrations. Measurements dried blood spots could potentially be a cheap and
      easy alternative to measurements in plasma. Dried blood spots can be easily collected from
      venous blood or fingerprick, do not need plasma separation and potentially need less
      stringent storage conditions during shipment.
