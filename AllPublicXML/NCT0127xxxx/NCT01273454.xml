  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to collect clinical information and to examine the usefulness and safety of
      ORal Osmotic System Hydromorphone in Korean cancer patients. The decision to treat patients
      with drug is as per physician discretion and that doses are determined based upon approved
      labeling recommendations and physician discretion.

    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this observational study is to collect clinical data on cancer pain
      control using OROS (ORal Osmotic Active System) hydromorphone and to investigate the clinical
      usefulness of OROS hydromorphone for Korean cancer patients. Information on the effectiveness
      of cancer pain control and any adverse events reported by those patients using OROS
      Hydromorphone will be reported. In addition, clinical usefulness of OROS hydromorphone will
      be evaluated through assessing sleep disturbance due to pain, breakthrough pain, and
      end-of-dose failure before and after the study drug administration and examining the
      patient's satisfaction with study drug and the investigator's global assessment. This is a
      multi-center, open-label, prospective, exploratory, and observational study with
      approximately 770 patients. Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed to examine the difference
      between before and after the treatment. Since this is an observational study under the
      condition of routine practice, OROS Hydromorphone dosage should be adjusted at the discretion
      of the investigator, based on patient response. It is recommended that the dosage be
      conservative at first and adjusted appropriately considering the adverse events and analgesic
      effect for all the patients.
