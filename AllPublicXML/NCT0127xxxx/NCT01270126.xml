  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive brain stimulation can increase cortical excitability in the visual system, but
      it is not known if this is of clinical value. The investigators now assessed if repetitive,
      transcranial alternating current stimulation (rtACS) can improve visual field size in
      patients with optic nerve damage. The investigators hypothesized that rtACS would improve
      visual functions within the defective visual field sectors of the visual field (primary
      outcome measure).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial 22 patients
      with optic nerve damage were randomly assigned to a rtACS- (n=12) or placebo-group (n=10).
      Visual field measures, visual acuity and EEG-recordings were collected before and after a
      daily 20-40min treatment for 10-days and at a 2-months-follow-up. Primary outcome measure was
      detection accuracy (DA) in defective visual field sectors of computer-based high resolution
      perimetry (HRP). Secondary outcome parameters included DA in static and kinetic perimetry,
      reaction time (RT) in HRP, visual acuity (VA), contrast vision, and EEG power spectra.

Based on such plots, areas of the visual field were characterized as intact, partially damaged or absolutely impaired (blind).

          <title>Detection Accuracy (DA) Change in Percent Over Baseline Within Defective Visual Field Sectors</title>
          <description>Central visual fields were assessed with computer-based high-resolution perimetry (HRP). Based on such plots, areas of the visual field were characterized as intact, partially damaged or absolutely impaired (blind). Detection accuracy (DA) change in percent above baseline within defective visual field sectors was defined as the primary outcome criterion.</description>

      <desc>Electrical stimulation has only minor side effects. During treatment some cutaneous sensations under the stimulation electrodes were reported by 5 patients and 4 patients had temporary sleeping difficulties. One patient had spontaneous phosphenes which were independent of stimulation during the 10-day treatment course.</desc>

          <description>Repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS)
Repetitive transorbital alternating current stimulation : Repetitive, transorbital alternating current stimulation (rtACS) was applied with a multi-channel device generating weak current pulses in predetermined firing bursts of 2 to 9 pulses. The amplitude of each current pulse was below 1000ÂµA. Current intensity was individually adjusted according to how well patients perceived phosphenes, i.e. any sensation of flickering light in response to the rtACS stimulation.</description>
