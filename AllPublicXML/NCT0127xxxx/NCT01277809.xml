  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a regular walking program (which
      inevitably involves human interaction) compared to a usual care condition and to a human
      interaction condition (without the extra walking program) in individuals residing in
      Long-Term Care (LTC). Outcomes of interest include: balance, strength, mobility, endurance,
      walking distance; rate and severity of falls; activities of daily living; mood and behaviour.

      It is hypothesized that participants taking part in the walking program will demonstrate
      maximal benefits compared to the no treatment control group (usual care) and the participants
      who will only receive social interaction. It is expected that benefits of the walking program
      will include decreased fall rates, and improved balance, endurance, strength, mood,
      behaviour, activities of daily living and quality of life indices. Given research findings
      that the addition of pleasant activities improves resident mood (Teri et al, 1997; 2003), it
      is expected that participants in the social interaction only group will demonstrate
      improvements in mood and other indices of quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Residents in LTC facilities in the Saskatoon Health Region and Regina Qu'Appelle Region will
      be recruited.

      Inclusion criteria: Male or female residents who are able to follow simple instructions, who
      can ambulate with or without a walking aid for at least 10 meters, and who are willing to
      participate in the study procedures will be eligible to participate in the study.

      Exclusion criteria: Residents who have experienced a recent cardiovascular event (within past
      6 months) or have severe arthritis, cardiac instability, a vestibular disorder, uncontrolled
      hypertension, uncontrolled epilepsy, a recent fracture (past 4 months), who have had a recent
      admission into an acute care facility (past 4 months), who are scheduled for surgery or
      hospitalization in next 6 months or who are participating in another regular exercise program
      (three or more times per week) aimed at improving balance or strength will be excluded from
      the study.

      Based on the sample size calculations, a sample size of 129 participants will provide ample
      power for the repeated measures analyses. Data will be collected from an additional 50
      participants in order to deal with the possibility of attrition. Thus, total sample size is
      179 participants.

      The investigators will meet with the LTC facilities' administrators and staff to inform them
      of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study procedures and interventions. They will
      be provided with copies of a one page information form which includes a space for residents
      (or substitute medical decision-maker, if appropriate) to indicate their signed consent to be
      approached by research staff with more detailed information (Appendix). Staff will provide
      this form to potential/eligible subjects, and will collect these forms when completed.
      Subjects who have consented to be contacted by research staff will be provided with more
      detailed information about the study by the research coordinator. If the resident is in
      agreement, he or she will then give written consent and will be entered into the study. The
      consent will include written permission for researchers to consult with the subject's family
      physician about the subject's health, and to ensure optimization of vitamin D intake prior to
      enrollment.

      Although some subjects may have cognitive problems, the majority of subjects will be clearly
      competent to provide their own consent. However, some subjects may have more advanced
      cognitive problems than others and may therefore not fully appreciate the consequences of
      participation. In this situation the person who normally provides consent for medical
      treatment will provide appropriate consent. When capacity to provide full, informed consent
      is not clear, both the subject and the substitute decision-maker will be asked to sign the
      consent forms.

      6. Procedures:

      Step 1: Baseline assessment. All participants regardless of group will undergo the following
      assessments. The assessment of the outcome measures will be conducted by trained study
      personnel who will be blinded to group allocation.

        1. The Senior Fitness Test (SFT). The SFT, a six-item battery that includes measures of
           dynamic upper and lower extremity strength and flexibility, aerobic endurance, and
           dynamic balance and agility will be completed ).

        2. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The BBS, a tool currently being used in the RRMC, is a
           14-item battery intended to objectively assess a person's ability to safely perform
           several common daily living tasks.

        3. Grip Strength. Grip strength of the dominant and non-dominant hand-held dynamometer will
           be measured. Strength will be tested 3 times with each hand and the maximum score will
           be recorded.

        4. Gait speed (6 metre walk test). Participants will be asked to walk a distance of 6
           metres over a portable, computerized walkway (the GAITRiteÂ® system. An additional two
           metres of walking will be added at the beginning and end of the walkway to accommodate
           for acceleration and deceleration. Subjects will be asked to walk along the walkway.
           Gait parameters, including gait speed, will be recorded.

        5. OARS Physical Activities of Daily Living (PADL) Sub-Scale. The OARS-PADL is a brief,
           valid, and reliable instrument that is used as a clinical assessment of functional
           status. The OARS-PADL will be completed by the research assistant with information
           provided by subjects' care provider.

        6. Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). Mood will be assessed using the CSDD, a
           well- validated, scale (based on caregiver reports) designed for the assessment of
           depression in individuals with dementia and individuals residing in long-term care. The
           CSDD will be completed by the research assistant with information provided by subjects'
           care provider.

        7. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) short form will be also used to assess
           self-identified depressive symptoms during the study.

        8. Revised Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist (RMBPC). Behavioral problems will be
           assessed with the use of the RMBPC, a 24-item report that measures observable behavioral
           and memory problems. The RMBPC will be completed by the research assistant with
           information provided by subjects' care provider.

        9. Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ).

       10. Coloured Analogue Pain Scale is being used to assess pain via patient self-report.

       11. Height, weight and other body measurements. We will measure height, knee-floor height,
           weight and waist, upper arm and calf circumference.

       12. Vital signs including blood pressure. We will measure lying and standing blood pressure
           as well as heart rate and respiratory rate.

      The participant's family physician will be asked to optimize vitamin D level of participants
      at baseline according to Canadian guidelines, as this can impact fall risk. This will involve
      measuring the Vitamin D level at baseline, and ordering Vitamin D 1,000 units daily if the
      participant is not already taking this.

      Step 2: Randomization into one of three groups:

        1. Participants will receive care as usual (Usual Care Group; UCG) that is provided by
           their long-term care unit.

        2. Participants will receive stationary 1:1 interaction time with the same research
           personnel who conduct the third group walking session at each individual care facility
           in order to control for the interpersonal interaction likely to be involved in the
           walking program (Interpersonal Interaction Group; IIG). This group will receive the
           equivalent interpersonal interaction time with research personnel as those participating
           in the WPG group. This interaction time will occur with the participant stationary,
           rather than walking with the researcher.

        3. Participants will participate in the Walking Program Group (WPG), in which a daily
           supervised walking program will be provided by study personnel. After randomization to
           the walking group, a licensed physiotherapist will first review test results and overall
           functioning, then develop a safe plan for a therapeutic walking program. This plan will
           include a protocol for termination and resumption of walking in case of physical
           symptoms such as shortness of breath, lightheadedness or chest pain. In situations of
           unexpected medical symptoms, the supervising staff nurse of the nursing unit will be
           consulted, who may suggest termination of the walking, or interim modification of the
           walking plan until reviewed by medical and physiotherapy staff. Subjects will in general
           gradually increase their daily supervised walking time as tolerated to a maximum of 30
           minutes once per day, Monday to Friday. The distance and number of minutes walked each
           time will be recorded. Interpersonal interaction will occur during the walking sessions,
           and will be similar in quality and quantity to that during the Interpersonal Interaction
           Group.

      Participants will wear a gait belt during all and with walking (if in the walking program
      group) and will be closely monitored by the research assistant who will be trained in safety
      issues.

      Step 3: Subjects will participate in a four month intervention, as outlined in Step 2 above.

      Step 4: After 2 months of the intervention (outlined in Step 2 above), all subjects will be
      re-tested as per baseline assessment (Step 1) with the exception of height and knee-floor
      height.

      Step 5: After 4 months of intervention (outlined in Step 2 above), all subjects will be
      re-tested as per baseline assessment (Step 1) with the exception of height and knee-floor
      height.

      Step 6: At 2 months and 4 months post-intervention, all subjects will be re-tested as per
      baseline assessment (Step 1) with the exception of height and knee-floor height.

      A. In order to control for confounding variables and to characterize the sample, the
      following data will be extracted from the chart, including the chart copy of admission, date
      of admission, personal health number and most recent quarterly Minimum Data Set (MDS), by
      research personnel. The MDS is a computerized long-term care assessment system designed to
      improve the care given to long-term care residents, and has been utilized province-wide since
      2001. Personal identifying information will only be extracted for the purpose of accurate
      linking to other study information, and will be removed prior to data analysis.

      Data to be collected: date of birth, race/ethnicity, gender, highest level of education,
      diagnoses on admittance, medications, health conditions (CHESS Scale: health instability);
      Cognitive Performance Scale; Depression Rating Scale; Index of Social Engagement; ADL
      Self-Performance Hierarchy Scale; Pain; Continence; Oral/Nutritional status; Communication;
      Mood and Behaviour Patterns; Physical Functioning and Structural problems; Activity Pursuit
      Patterns; Special Treatments and Procedures.

      B. Record of Falls: The incidence and nature of falls will be prospectively collected from
      the standard Saskatoon Health Region falls documentation for the period of the intervention
      (4 months) and for 4 months following intervention. Copies of falls documentation will be
      made from the clinical chart every week by study personnel.

      Any participants' health concerns (identified by the participant and/or nursing staff) will
      be reviewed by the research coordinator and discussed with the Medical Safety Committee as
      appropriate.

      7. Time Period (indicate the dates when the research project is expected to begin and to be
      completed. A final status report must be filed with the Ethics Office once data collection
      from the last subject is complete. The Ethics Office should be notified once the study site
      is closed.):

      Anticipated start date is December 2010. We anticipate the study will take about 2 years to
      complete. Expected completion date is December 31, 2016.

      8. Data Storage (In accordance with recommended guidelines provide a statement outlining the
      procedures you will use to store securely the research data. State how long and where the
      data will be stored and identify the person who will be assuming responsibility for data
      storage):

      Study participant information will be stored according to HIPA guidelines. All documents and
      data collection forms will be stored in the School of Physical Therapy, in a locked filing
      cabinet in the office of Vanina Dal Bello-Haas (P.I.) for the required 10-year period. Signed
      consent forms will be stored separately from the study data in locked files. Study subjects
      will be identified by research study number only. Only study numbers and aggregate
      information will be used for data analysis.
