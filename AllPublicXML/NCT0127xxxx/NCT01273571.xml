      The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential interaction between multiple oral
      doses of canagliflozin and a single oral dose of metformin in healthy adult volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned)
      single-center study of canagliflozin and metformin in healthy adult volunteers. Canagliflozin
      (a Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 inhibitor) is currently under development to lower blood
      sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metformin is an approved
      treatment for patients with T2DM. Canagliflozin will be administered orally (by mouth) as a
      single 300-mg tablet on Days 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and metformin will be administered orally as
      two 1,000 mg tablets on Days 1 and 8. Both canagliflozin and metformin tablets will be taken
      with 8 ounces (240 mL) of water.
