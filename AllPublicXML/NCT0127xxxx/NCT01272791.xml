    <description>Patients who qualify for enrollment into the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study treatment of gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine with weekly 3 mg/kg bavituximab. Treatment for each patient will begin on Study Day 1. Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) will be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle (4 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Patients randomized to receive bavituximab will be treated weekly beginning on Day 1 of each cycle. Study visits are scheduled to occur every 7 (± 2) days for bavituximab administration (for patients randomized to receive bavituximab); gemcitabine administration will occur every 7 (± 2) days for the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle</description>
