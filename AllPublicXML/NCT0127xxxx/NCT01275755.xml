  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morphine and related opioid analgesics are known to slow gastrointestinal (GI) motility and
      reduce intestinal secretion through their binding to μ opioid receptors (MORs) within the GI
      tract. The most common symptoms associated with the effects of opioids are constipation and
      nausea and/or vomiting. Moreover, constipation is a common and distressing side effect of
      long-term opioid therapy.

      The primary objective of this study was to compare ADL5945 once daily, a MOR antagonist, with
      placebo in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults taking long-term
      opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain.

    <description>An SBM was defined as a bowel movement (BM) with no laxative use in the previous 24 hours. Each weekly SBM average was calculated as follows: (7 × number of SBMs) / (number of days with nonmissing data). The overall SBM rate for the 4-week double-blind treatment period was calculated as follows: (the average of the first week + the average of the second week + the average of the third week + the average of the fourth week) / 4.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Average of Spontaneous Bowel Movements (SBMs) During Treatment</title>
        <description>An SBM was defined as a bowel movement (BM) with no laxative use in the previous 24 hours. Each weekly SBM average was calculated as follows: (7 × number of SBMs) / (number of days with nonmissing data). The overall SBM rate for the 4-week double-blind treatment period was calculated as follows: (the average of the first week + the average of the second week + the average of the third week + the average of the fourth week) / 4.</description>

        <population>All participants who were randomized to study treatment and had at least 1 evaluable SBM post-dose measurement during the Double-blind Treatment Period. Last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) was used to impute missing postbaseline values.</population>
