  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' human
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in adult female subjects aged 26-45 years. One group of subjects
      will receive the HPV vaccine and the other group will receive an active control (GSK
      Biologicals' hepatitis B vaccine). Immunogenicity data of the HPV group will be compared with
      those from the HPV group included in the NCT00779766 study (aged 18-25 years).

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Medically Significant Conditions (MSCs) Including Potential Immune Mediated Diseases (pIMDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study (from Month 0 up to Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>MSCs were AEs prompting emergency room or physician visits that were not related to common diseases (upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, pharyngitis, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual cycle abnormalities and injury), or not related to routine visits for physical examination or vaccination. It also included SAEs not related to common diseases. MSCs included pIMDs, a subset of MSCs that included autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurological disorders of interest which might or might not have had an autoimmune etiology.</description>
