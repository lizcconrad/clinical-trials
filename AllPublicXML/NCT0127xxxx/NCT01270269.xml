  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization saves lives but often does so at a high personal
      cost to ICU survivors who frequently experience significant cognitive impairment and an array
      of physical and functional disabilities that limit their recovery and quality of life. While
      the problems experienced by these patients are likely amenable to rehabilitation, few ICU
      survivors receive focused rehabilitation. Recently, early physical rehabilitation in ICU
      patients has shown to improve the chances a patient will regain their pre-hospital functional
      status. Early cognitive rehabilitation for these patients has not yet been explored. This
      pilot study will determine the feasibility of early cognitive rehabilitation in ICU patients.
      The investigators will perform cognitive and physical rehabilitation, beginning in the
      earliest phases of critical illness, to determine the effect of these therapies on cognitive
      and functional outcomes in ICU survivors. The investigators hypothesize that combined
      cognitive and physical rehabilitation, started in the ICU, will improve recovery of cognitive
      and physical function as well as improve quality of life of ICU survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term consequences of critical illness and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization
      in ICU survivors are profound and include cognitive, physical, and functional impairments.
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a multi-component, cognitive and physical
      rehabilitation program beginning in the ICU, combined with a 12-week home-based cognitive
      rehabilitation program following hospital discharge to determine whether participation in a
      rehabilitation program will result in improved outcomes among ICU survivors. The study will
      rely on a randomized controlled clinical trial design, with patients assigned to one of three
      groups: a &quot;usual care&quot; control group, an early physical activity group (without cognitive
      therapy), or an early cognitive therapy and physical activity group. All individuals in the
      intervention groups will receive protocolized physical therapy while hospitalized. In
      addition, individuals in the early cognitive therapy and physical activity group will receive
      cognitive therapy starting in the ICU and continuing for 12 weeks once a patient leaves the
      hospital. In-home visits will occur every other week during the 12-week intervention period.

      The study's primary outcome is executive functioning (e.g. ability to plan, organize,
      multi-task) at 3-months following hospital discharge as measured by the Tower Test, a
      psychometric tool evaluating executive abilities. This has been chosen due to the fact that
      available research points to the presence of significant deficits in executive functioning
      among ICU survivors. Secondary outcomes include global cognitive function, physical function
      and Health Related Quality of Life by assessing scores on the following measures: Katz's ADL,
      Functional Activities Questionnaire, AD8, Short-Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline
      in the Elderly, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (if performed), Timed Up &amp; Go test,
      Mini-Mental State Exam, Dysexecutive Questionnaire, Activities-Specific Balance Confidence
      Scale, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Behavior Pain Inventory, Trails A &amp; B
      test, Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, General Employment
      Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory II, Post-traumatic stress checklist, Short Form 36,
      Canadian Study of Health and Aging and patient weight, and Tower Test score at 12 month
      follow-up. We will also track readmission to the hospital and admission to a nursing home or
      skilled rehabilitation facility as secondary outcomes during the 12-month follow-up period.
      The study duration will include 1 year of enrollment and 1 year for study completion
      following enrollment of the final patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients admitted to the medical or surgical ICU who are receiving treatment for
             respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, hemorrhagic shock, and/or septic shock.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate to severe dementia on ICU admission based on a standardized surrogate
             assessment (as this would prohibit patients from functioning independently at home);

             activities of daily living based on a standardized surrogate assessment;

          -  Live greater than 120 miles from Nashville;

          -  Blind, deaf, or unable to speak English;
