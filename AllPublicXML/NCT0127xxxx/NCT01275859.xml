    <textblock>
      Cross-talk between epidermal growth factors and the ER occurs at multiple levels and seems to
      play a crucial role in breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance.Combined
      HER1/HER2-targeted therapy with aromatase inhibitors for ER-positive and HER-2 positive
      postmenopausal breast cancer might enhance response and block emergence of endocrine
      resistant tumor.

      1. To evaluate the efficacy of the neoadjuvant combination therapy with letrozole and
           lapatinib in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive and HER2-positive breast cancer.

        2. To assess markers predictive of treatment response and outcome in this setting.
