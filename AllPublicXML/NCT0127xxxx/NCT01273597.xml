  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the clinical benefit of Zemplar (paricalcitol
      injection) in daily routine practice in end-stage renal disease patients with severe
      over-reactivity of parathyroid glands. Participants will be followed for 6 months. Data will
      be collected from participants initiated on Zemplar therapy according to standard of care.
      The time to achieving the maintenance dose of Zemplar (paricalcitol injection), the
      proportion of participants achieving target parathyroid hormone levels, and prevalence of
      elevated serum calcium and phosphate levels will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective data collection started at initial dosing with Zemplar (paricalcitol injection)
      and ended up to 6 months later. If available, retrospective data on vitamin D treatment as
      well as on the incidence of hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia in the 6 months leading up
      to paricalcitol treatment were also collected. Eight visits were planned for documentation of
      prospective data. In accordance with the non-interventional character of the study, only
      diagnostic and monitoring procedures were applied which are part of the routine medical care
      of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

                  history, or

               -  higher than 800 pg/mL and parathyroidectomy is contraindicated.
