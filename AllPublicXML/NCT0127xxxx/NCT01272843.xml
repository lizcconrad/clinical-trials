      The carotid arteries are blood vessels in the neck that supply blood to the brain. Carotid
      stenosis disease is defined as a narrowing of these arteries due to the build up of plaque.
      The plaque material can also break off and move into the brain. The resulting blockage of
      blood supply to a portion of the brain is what causes 80% of all strokes. One treatment
      option is to have surgery on the carotid artery and remove the plaque. This procedure is
      called a carotid endarterectomy (CEA). There is evidence that proves CEA reduces the risk of
      stroke. The objective of this research project is to determine who is most likely to benefit
      from CEA surgery.

        Atherosclerosis is a major risk factor for ischemic cerebrovascular events such as stroke
        (Bots, Hoes et al. 1997). Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS) are
        common surgical procedures aimed at reducing stroke risk. For individuals with symptomatic
        stenosis &gt; 70%, CEA has a higher event-free survival compared to medical therapy (Barnett,
        Taylor et al. 1998) and is considered highly beneficial treatment (Rothwell, Eliasziw et
        al. 2003). To date, however, few studies have attempted to relate effects of the surgery to
        changes in brain physiology and function.
