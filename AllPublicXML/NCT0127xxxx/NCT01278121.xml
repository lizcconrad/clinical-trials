  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of today's major health problem in the western world is related to lifestyle. Lifestyle
      diseases include obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and different types of
      cancers. For many years, a low-fat diet has been recommended to reduce obesity and lifestyle
      diseases, but replacing fat with carbohydrates has lead to an increase of these diseases.
      Overweight is associated with a chronical low-degree inflammation, and later studies have
      shown that carbohydrates have an effect on the mechanisms of inflammation. Previous studies
      in the investigators group has shown that in healthy, but slightly overweight persons, a
      balanced diet of lower carbohydrate content regulates the gene expression in a manner that
      leads to less inflammation. In this study the investigators will look at morbid obese women
      (BMI&gt;35) to see if the same, balanced diet can improve the inflammatory profile of the women.

      The hypothesis of this proposal is that a carbohydrate-rich diet may cause a major
      deregulation of hormonal balance, causing both acute and chronic systemic inflammatory
      reactions mediated by white blood cells. We furthermore postulate that a carbohydrate-rich
      diet is a major risk factor in the development of obesity and life style diseases directly
      resulting from chronic systemic inflammation. We therefore want to use an integrated
      multidisciplinary systems biology approach to identify the hormones, genes and pathways
      specifically responding to a dietary carbohydrate reduction, to develop biomarkers that can
      be used for risk assessment, to identify molecular pathways and build mathematical models
      that describe the link between diet and inflammation, and use this knowledge to provide
      personalised dietary advice.
