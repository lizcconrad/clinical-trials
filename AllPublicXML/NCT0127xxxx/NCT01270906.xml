        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically documented, advanced-stage, primary or
             metastatic solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no
             curative standard therapy exists.

          -  Evidence of measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  All acute toxic affects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical
             procedures must have resolved to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 3.0) Grade â‰¤1; surgery must have occurred
             at least 28 days prior to study enrollement.

          -  Age must be at least 18 years.

          -  Last dose of antineoplastic therapy (except for hormonal therapy) must be more than 21
             days; subjects may continue to receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog
             therapy for prostate cancer.

          -  ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Patient must meet protocol-specified laboratory values.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent therapy with any other investigational agent.

          -  Intracranial edema, intracranial metastasis, or epidural disease.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeing women. Female subjects must agree to use effective
             contraception, must be surgically sterile, or must be postmenopausal. Male subjects
             must agree to use effective contraception or be surgically sterile. The definition of
             effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the investigator or a
             designated associate. All at-risk female subjects must have a netative pregnancy test
             (serum or urine) within 10 days prior to the start of study treatment.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart Association Class III or IV)
             including pre-existing arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or
             subjects with baseline mean QTc interval greater than 450 msec (males) and 470 msec
             (females) or grade 2 or higher compromised left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
             as determined by MUGA or ECHO.

          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent.

          -  Diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependent or -independent disease requiring chronic
             medication).

          -  Previous pericarditis; clinically significant pleural effusion in the previous 12
             months or current ascites requiring two or more interventions/month.

          -  Malabsorption syndrome or uncontrolled gastrointestinal toxicities (nausea, diarrhea,
             vomitting) with toxicity greater than NCI CTCAE grade 2.

          -  Prior acute or chonic pancreatitis of any etiology.

          -  Prior intra-or extra-hepatic biliary obstruction wtihin the previous 12 months or
             history of malignant obstruction requiring a bilary stent, unless stably treated with
             no prior obstruction or blockage of the stent.

          -  Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             study-drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, make the subject inappropriate for this
             study.
