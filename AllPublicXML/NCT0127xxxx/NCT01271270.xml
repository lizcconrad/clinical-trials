      Background:

        -  Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in
           the back of the eye, and leak blood and other fluids that damage the eye, produce
           scarring, and lead to blindness. People diagnosed with wet AMD have increased production
           of a body chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is important
           in the formation of blood vessels in the body, and decreasing the production of VEGF is
           believed to help wet AMD patients by preventing or slowing the growth of the abnormal
           blood vessels. Anti-VEGF drugs have been used to decrease the production of VEGF, but
           some people do not respond completely to these drugs.

        -  A protein in the body called mTOR also plays a critical role in regulating how cells
           divide and grow and obtain their blood supply. The experimental chemical Palomid 529
           inhibits the production of mTOR. Researchers are interested in determining whether
           Palomid 529 is safe and can help individuals with wet AMD who have not completely
           responded to anti-VEGF treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Palomid 529 as a treatment for wet age-related
      macular degeneration in individuals who have not responded to standard anti-VEGF treatments.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals with wet age-related macular degeneration in at least one eye that has not
      responded to standard anti-VEGF treatments.

      Design:

        -  Prior to the first visit, participants should have been seen at the National Eye
           Institute clinic under a screening or teaching protocol, or NIH protocol 08-EI-0103,
           High Speed Indocyanine Green Angiography Findings in Induction Regimen of Intravitreal
           Ranibizumab Injection for Neovascular Age Related Macular Degeneration. One eye will be
           designated as the study eye to receive the Palomid 529 treatment.

        -  Participants will have a full physical examination and medical history, a full eye
           examination to evaluate eye health and vision, angiography to examine the blood vessels
           in the eyes, and blood and urine tests during the study

        -  Participants will receive an injection of Palomid 529 into the study eye every 4 weeks
           during the study, for a total of three injections. Participants may also receive
           anti-VEGF injections such as ranibizumab (Lucentis ) or bevacizumab (Avastin ) in the
           study eye 12 days before and 12 days after the Palomid 529 injection.

        -  Participants may have standard-of-care treatments for the non-study eye if it has wet
           AMD as well, but may not receive experimental treatments in the non-study eye while they
           are in this study.

        -  Participants will return for long-term follow-up examinations as directed by the study
           researchers.

      Objective:

      Paloma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed a non-steroidal, wholly synthetic, small molecule
      drug for application to diseases of aberrant neovasculature, known as Palomid 529.1 Palomid
      529 exerts broad activity as an anti-angiogenic agent by inhibiting the mammalian target of
      rapamycin (Akt/mTor) signal transduction pathway via dissociation of both target of rapamycin
      complexes (TORC1 and TORC2) in the immune system.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Palomid 529 when
      administered as subconjunctival injections in participants with choroidal neovascularization
      (CNV) secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

      Study Population:

      This study will enroll participants with neovascular AMD who have not responded to
      conventional anti-VEGF treatments. Five participants will be initially accrued; however, up
      to seven participants who meet the eligibility criteria may be enrolled.

      Design:

      This is a 12-week, unmasked, non-randomized study of three serial 1.9 mg subconjunctival
      doses of Palomid 529 in neovascular AMD participants who have not responded to conventional
      anti-VEGF treatments.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome is to determine the safety of subconjunctival Palomid 529 for neovascular
      AMD. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of ocular and systemic adverse events.
      Secondary efficacy outcomes include changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), changes
      in fluid status, central retinal thickness and retinal volume as measured by optical
      coherence tomography (OCT), changes in leakage patterns as observed on fluorescein
      angiography (FA), changes in CNV patterns as observed on indocyanine green angiography (ICG),
      changes in autofluorescence patterns as observed on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging,
      and changes in fundus appearance as observed on color fundus photography. Additionally,
      Complement Factor H polymorphisms will be compared with treatment response and
      pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.

                    -  CNV in the setting of AMD resulting in fluid or blood within the macula as
                       determined by clinical examination, OCT or FA.

                    -  The study eye has not responded to conventional anti-VEGF treatment (defined
                       as the eye that has any persistent intraretinal cyst with a greatest linear
                       dimension of at least 100 microns and/or subretinal fluid pocket with a
                       height of at least 100 microns and/or the presence of any foveal fluid after
                       four serial anti-VEGF intravitreal injections). The fluid state will be
                       determined two weeks (plus or minus two days) after the last injection.

               2. Participant must have reasonably clear media and some fixation to allow for good
                  quality OCT and fundus photography.

             enrollment.

          -  Participant received or has been receiving intraocular steroids in the study eye
             within four months prior to enrollment.

          -  Participant received or has been receiving immunosuppressive treatments (i.e.,
             biologic or systemic steroids) within two months prior to enrollment. If the
             participant was on any systemic immunosuppressive treatment for at least two months
             prior to enrollment and meets the enrollment criteria of residual fluid after four
             serial anti-VEGF injections, then s/he is eligible to participate in the study as long
             as s/he will continue this specific systemic drug regimen for the entire study period.

          -  Participant is allergic to fluorescein dye or indocyanine green dye.

          -  Participant is allergic to shellfish or iodine.
