  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is considered important in prevention and treatment of obesity and
      metabolic syndrome. Genotype of genes involved in metabolism is also known to be associated
      with the development of metabolic syndrome. However, scarce evidence exists regarding the
      influence of physical activity intensity and genotype on metabolic syndrome in people with
      obesity. The investigators examine physical activity using an uniaxial accelerometer, as well
      as aerobic fitness using an electric bicycle ergometer, several genotypes of genes related to
      glucose and lipid metabolisms in middle-aged men with obesity and/or abdominal obesity who
      were employees in silicon wafer manufacture and participated in a health checkup.
