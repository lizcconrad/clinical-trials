  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well Akt inhibitor MK2206 works in treating patients with
      breast cancer cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured
      or controlled with treatment. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (Akt) inhibitor MK2206 achieves
      objective tumor responses (complete response [CR], partial response [PR]) in advanced breast
      cancer patients who have a phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA)
      or Akt mutation and/or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss or mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 6 month progression-free survival on MK2206. II. To determine baseline
      molecular markers that may predict clinical outcome. III. To determine pharmacodynamic
      markers in blood and tumor tissue that may predict a decrease in proliferation-related Ki-67
      antigen (Ki-67) and clinical outcome.

      IV. To determine safety and tolerability of MK2206 in previously treated patients with
      advanced breast cancer.

      V. To determine if decrease in Ki-67 at 2 weeks correlates with anti-tumor effect (CR, PR, or
      stable disease [SD] &gt; 6 months).

      VI. To determine concordance of PIK3CA and PTEN status between primary tumor and distant
      metastasis.

      VII. To determine concordance of PIK3CA status of circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) and distant metastasis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt Inhibitor MK-2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 weeks.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Response Defined Using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after completion of study treatment, for up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with response defined by RECIST version 1.1: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks following beginning treatment, repeat confirmation 4-6 weeks following response, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Only those participants who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least four doses of MK2206, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. Response classified according the RECIST definitions, and re-evaluated for response every 12 weeks. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective disease progression prior to receiving four doses of therapy will also be considered evaluable.) In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4-6 weeks following initial documentation of objective response, and then revert to scheduled repeat imaging.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Month Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment to time of progression or death or six months whichever occurs first, assessed at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants progression free at 6 months. PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment, or time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. The PFS for this outcome was assessed at 6 months post treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Response Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Response assessment 4 weeks from beginning of treatment, response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence, up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of the response is from the time response is achieved until disease progression is detected. The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.
Response re-evaluated every 12 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4-6 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer, with
             diagnosed or suspected metastatic, inoperable locally advanced breast cancer, or
             inoperable locally recurrent breast cancer

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan

          -  Patients who have failed to respond to at least one line of systemic therapy are
             eligible for MK2206 therapy; if the patient has a human epidermal growth factor
             receptor 2 (HER2) positive tumor, it is expected that they will have received at least
             one HER2-targeted therapy in the metastatic setting; if the patient has an estrogen
             receptor positive (ER+) tumor, it is expected that they will have received at least
             one ER-targeted therapy in the metastatic setting; patients can be enrolled for
             molecular screening while on another therapy if the patient is interested in MK2206
             therapy upon progression

          -  Archived primary tumor biopsies or surgical specimens, or biopsies of recurrence or
             metastasis, will be available for PIK3CA/Akt mutational analysis and PTEN analysis;
             patients with surgical samples, or core/punch biopsies available, will be eligible for
             testing for PIK3CA/Akt status as well as PTEN testing; the most recent sample will be
             preferred (i.e. in patients with metastatic disease, metastases samples are preferred
             over archival primary tumor and in patients with local recurrences a biopsy of the
             recurrence is preferred over archival primary tumor); NOTE: PIK3CA or Akt mutation
             status can be determined on fine needle aspirate (FNA) samples, but PTEN status cannot
             as stroma and endothelial cells are used as internal controls and PTEN testing has not
             been validated on FNA samples; thus patients with only FNA samples and no tissue
             blocks available will be considered to be eligible for screening for PIK3CA/Akt
             mutations and will be enrolled onto the study only if they are found to have PIK3CA
             mutations or Akt mutations; patients whose tumors have already been tested in the
             Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) environment and have been found to
             have a PIK3CA mutation or Akt mutation or PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or
             PTEN mutation will be eligible for treatment; patients whose tumors have been tested
             in the research environment and found to have a PIK3CA mutation or Akt mutation or
             PTEN loss or PTEN mutation will have their marker status confirmed in the CLIA
             environment

          -  Patients whose tumors have already been tested in the CLIA environment and have been
             found to have a PIK3CA mutation or Akt mutation or PTEN loss or mutation will be
             eligible for treatment; patients whose tumors have been tested in the research
             environment and found to have a PIK3CA mutation or Akt mutation or PTEN loss or
             mutation will have their marker status confirmed in the CLIA environment.

        <title>Number of Participants With Response Defined Using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)</title>
        <description>Number of participants with response defined by RECIST version 1.1: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after completion of study treatment, for up to 1 year</time_frame>
        <population>Two participants were not treated therefore excluded from study population analysis, another was inevaluable and six others were not analyzable for response.</population>

        <title>Median Response Duration</title>
        <description>The duration of the response is from the time response is achieved until disease progression is detected. The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.
Response re-evaluated every 12 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4-6 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.</description>
