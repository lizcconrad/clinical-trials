  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective, observational study is to investigate the clinical,
      psychosocial, and patient satisfaction outcomes of patients who undergo perforator flap
      reconstruction for breast reconstruction and/or vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNTx) for
      the treatment of lymphedema.

      The investigators hypothesize that (1) perforator flap breast reconstruction will result in
      excellent clinical, psychosocial, and patient satisfaction outcomes compared to
      non-perforator flap breast reconstruction; (2) perforator flap breast reconstruction is
      associated with less persistent postsurgical pain than other forms of breast reconstruction,
      even after controlling for major cofactors, such as the extent of auxiliary lymph node
      dissection and the use of radiation therapy; (3) perforator flap reconstruction for the
      treatment of Lymphedema (i.e., VLNTx ) will result in the reduction of symptoms and
      complications of lymphedema.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a serious health issue that affects 1 in 8 women. Although numerous
      treatments have arisen in recent years to aggressively combat this disease and increase
      survivorship, many survivors develop a crippling condition that can result in devastating
      physical and psychological impairments. Breast reconstruction by any method may help recovery
      psychologically. However, some individuals still report experiencing pain following their
      recovery from surgery. Additionally, secondary lymphedema is a common yet poorly understood
      complication of breast cancer patients. For those individuals who undergo axillary lymph node
      dissection the rates of incidence of lymphedema approach 47%. These rates tend to increase
      further for patients who receive irradiation treatment or mastectomies. Currently there is no
      known cure for lymphedema. Current treatments include non-invasive measures as well as
      surgical interventions. Vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNTx) is a fairly recent surgical
      procedure that has shown promising results.

      The goal of this research study is to analyze the clinical outcome of subjects who undergo
      breast reconstruction with perforator flaps and/or VLNTx using information collected as part
      of standard care.

      Clinical data will be collected prospectively. All subjects who undergo a surgical procedure
      will complete the online persistent postsurgical pain assessment questionnaire.

      The BreastQ questionnaire will be completed by patients prior to and after undergoing breast
      reconstruction and/or lymphedema treatment.
