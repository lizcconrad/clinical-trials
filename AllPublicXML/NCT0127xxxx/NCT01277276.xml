  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no methodology that can assign a risk of development of chemo brain and
      thus, studies to understand how and why only some patients develop chemo brain along with
      studies of potential treatments face major hurdles. This study will define
      hemodynamic/optical parameters in normal individuals and cancer patients undergoing
      chemotherapy potentially identifying optical parameters that are associated with the
      development of chemo brain, leading to new insights into the origin of the chemo brain
      condition, and importantly potentially identifying parameters that may predict who will
      develop &quot;chemo brain&quot; in order to directing investigations of therapies.

      The researcher can use Non-invasive optical imaging, diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging,
      measure various tissues and can determine chemo brain symptoms. Near infrared diffuse optical
      imaging is a real-time, non-invasive technique that measures hemodynamic variations based on
      changes in hemoglobin oxygenation. Tissue in general and the cerebral cortex surface in
      particular, are transparent to near infrared light.

      Direct optical measurement of cerebral hemodynamic parameters is superior to systemic
      approaches that infer brain levels of hemoglobin. Optical imaging in conjunction with
      physiologic maneuvers measures vascular tone and reactivity and may permit early detection of
      changes in physiology that precede the onset of chemo brain symptoms. Since chemo brain
      specifically impacts working memory and executive function the optical imaging can measure
      the frontal cortical areas behind the forehead.
