  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea results in decreased attentiveness and response times in patients.
      The objective of this study is to quantify these consequences in pediatric OSA patients using
      an already established tool for examining the results of sleep deprivation and fragmentation:
      psychomotor vigilance testing. PVT has been used in children, but has not been studied in
      pediatric OSA patients. This study aims to employ PVT along the normal course of diagnosis
      and treatment of pediatric OSA patients in our clinical practice at Arkansas Children's
      Hospital. The investigators hypothesize that pediatric OSA patients will exhibit decreased
      PVT scoring when compared to children without OSA, and that PVT can be used to diagnose and
      monitor treatment outcomes in these patients.

    <time_frame>10-20 minutes each session, 3 sessions total</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with obstructive sleep apnea will be asked to participate in 3 sessions. Your child will be asked to complete some noninvasive tests at each session. These tests consist of Psychomotor Vigilance Task testing. A Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) will measure your level of alertness and attentiveness. The PVT involves pressing a button after hearing a specific tone or seeing a flashing light. This test takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The PVT testing will be done at the first clinic visit, then before any treatments, and finally after treatments have taken place.</description>

    <measure>Control Subject PVT Session</measure>
    <time_frame>10-20 minute session, 1 session</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects in the control group without clinical signs and symptoms of sleep apnea will only undergo PVT for one session. Your child will be asked to complete some noninvasive tests at this session. These tests consist of Psychomotor Vigilance Task testing. A Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) will measure your level of alertness and attentiveness. The PVT involves pressing a button after hearing a specific tone or seeing a flashing light. This test takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this study is to examine the use of psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT) as a tool in the diagnosis and prediction of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea. PVT simply involves responding to a light by pressing a button on a small handheld device. It is a simple measure of reaction time.</description>
