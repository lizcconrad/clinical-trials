    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to see weather hyperbaric oxygen treatment is beneficial as adjuvant
      treatment for frost damage.

      The investigators hope to include at least 20 patients in a randomized manner. Half of the
      patients are randomized to hyperbaric oxygen, and half of the patients are randomized not to
      have hyperbaric oxygen treatment.

      Under hypotheses: The number og surgeries is reduced by hyperbaric oxygen treatment as
      adjuvant treatment for frost damage. The functional level of the frost damaged patient is
      better after 6 and 12 months when also treated with hyperbaric oxygen treatment for frost
      damage.
