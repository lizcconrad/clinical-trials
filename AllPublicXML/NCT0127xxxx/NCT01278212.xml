  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to explore the safety, effectiveness, quality of life, and cost
      effectiveness of accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy (AHF-RT) as treatment after
      lumpectomy in patients with early stage breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional radiation treatment schedule for patients who have had a lumpectomy for early
      stage breast cancer is 15 to 30 treatments delivered once a day for 3 to 6 weeks. This
      treatment schedule can be inconvenient and costly for elderly, rural, uninsured, and minority
      patients. This study will evaluate a new radiation treatment schedule called whole-breast
      accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy (AHF-RT). AHF-RT delivers higher doses of radiation
      in fewer treatments than traditional radiation therapy. The AHF-RT treatment course is
      completed with 5 radiation treatments delivered once a week for 5 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy
      (AHF-RT) is a safe, effective, more convenient, and less costly alternative to traditional
      radiation that will offer the same chance of cure with no additional side effects.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Only women who satisfy all of the following conditions will be eligible for this study.

          1. must consent to be in the study and must have signed an approved consent form
             conforming with federal and institutional guidelines

          2. must be at least 21 years old

          3. must have stage 0, I, or II breast cancer

          4. On histological examination, the tumor must be ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or
             invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast.

          5. Surgical treatment of the breast must have been breast conserving surgery (BCS). The
             margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of tumor (including DCIS
             component). Reexcision of surgical margins is permitted.

          6. Gross disease may be unifocal or multifocal with pathologic (invasive and/or DCIS)
             tumor size excised with negative margins.

          7. Patients with invasive breast cancer are required to have axillary staging which can
             include sentinel node biopsy alone (if sentinel node is negative), sentinel node
             biopsy followed by axillary dissection or sampling with a minimum total of 6 axillary
             nodes (if sentinel node is positive), or axillary dissection alone (with a minimum of
             6 axillary nodes). Axillary staging is not required for patients with DCIS.

          8. must begin adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) within 9 weeks following
             the last surgery for breast cancer (lumpectomy, re-excision of margins, or axillary
             staging procedure)

          9. Patients must have all usual and customary hormone receptor (ER/PR) and estrogen
             receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to enrollment. Patients
             with invasive disease must have HER2 receptor status determined (positive or negative)
             with immuno-histochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH).

         10. At the time of study enrollment, patients must have had a history &amp; physical exam
             within 4 months and a bilateral mammogram within 6 months.

         11. Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been
             disease-free for 5 or more years prior to enrollment and are deemed by their physician
             to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if
             diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix,
             carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin.

         12. Patients must live in a county that is designated as Appalachian and/or rural by
             Kentucky Cancer Registry Criteria (see list below) and/or must hold their primary
             residence at least 10 miles from the nearest radiation facility. Patients who do not
             fit these criteria may still be considered eligible if they are determined to suffer
             significant financial and/or transportation hardship during a typical course of CF-RT
             or HF-RT (in the judgment of any of their treating physicians). Patients who live
             outside the Commonwealth of Kentucky are eligible if they fit any of these
             aforementioned conditions.

               -  Appalachian counties in KY include: Adair, Bath, Bell, Boyd, Breathitt, Carter,
                  Casey, Clark, Clay, Clinton, Cumberland, Edmonson, Elliott, Estill, Fleming,
                  Floyd, Garrard, Green, Greenup, Harlan, Hart, Jackson, Johnson, Knott, Knox,
                  Laurel, Lawrence, Lee, Leslie, Letcher, Lewis, Lincoln, Madison, Magoffin,

          2. More than 3 histologically positive axillary nodes

          3. Axillary nodes with definite evidence of microscopic or macroscopic extracapsular
             extension

             staged as axillary nodes.)

          5. Palpable or radiographically suspicious ipsilateral or contralateral axillary,

             evaluation (If surgical margins are rendered free of disease by reexcision, the
             patient is eligible.)

         13. Treatment plan that includes regional nodal irradiation

         14. Current therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or
             other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or
             breast cancer prevention (Patients are eligible only if these medications are
             discontinued prior to enrollment.)

         15. Cosmetic breast implants (Patients who have had implants removed are eligible.)

         16. Prior breast or thoracic RT for any condition

         17. Collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a CPK level above normal
             or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosis, or scleroderma

         18. Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive
             potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during
             therapy.

         19. Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements
