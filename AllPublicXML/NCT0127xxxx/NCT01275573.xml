  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a frequent symptom in Parkinson's disease. Previous studies have shown that pain
      perception was altered in Parkinson's disease patients and could be related to nociceptive
      cortical area hyperactivation. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is an
      electrophysiological tool which can modify cortical excitability. Its efficacy was
      demonstrated in neuropathic pain. This is a randomized, double blind cross-over study. In
      this study, subjective pain threshold (using thermal stimulation (Thermotest)).will be
      evaluated in 3 groups of subjects: healthy volunteers, painful Parkinson's patients and pain
      free Parkinson's disease patients. Each group will receive a high frequency Repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and placebo stimulation in different order with a gap of
      one week.

      The investigators supposed that a 20 Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation session
      with an infraliminary intensity on the primary cortical motor, modulating nociceptive
      cortical areas activity, could modify the nociceptive threshold perception in Parkinson's
      patients.
