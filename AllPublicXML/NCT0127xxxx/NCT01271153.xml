  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that dobutamine is able to revert negative redistribution of
      flow by inducing a selective vasodilatory effect on hypoperfused territories, particularly at
      the sublingual and gastric mucosa, and at the peripheral tissues.

      The investigators designed a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study looking at the
      acute physiologic effects of 5 mcg/kg/min fixed-dose of dobutamine on cardiac function,
      microcirculation, gastric mucosal, hepatosplanchnic, and peripheral perfusion in septic shock
      patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that dobutamine is able to revert negative redistribution of
      flow by inducing a selective vasodilatory effect on hypoperfused territories, particularly at
      the sublingual and gastric mucosa, and at the peripheral tissues. Therefore, dobutamine
      improves microcirculatory alterations and regional perfusion in septic shock, independent of
      its effects on cardiac output.

      The relevance of this concept is that it would support a more rational use of dobutamine in
      septic shock patients, not only as an inotrope to increase cardiac output, but more
      important, as a selective vasodilator aimed at restoring perfusion.

      Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled study
      looking at the acute physiologic effects of 5 mcg/kg/min fixed-dose of dobutamine on cardiac
      function, microcirculation, gastric mucosal, hepatosplanchnic, and peripheral perfusion in
      septic shock patients.
