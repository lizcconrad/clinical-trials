      The purpose of the study is to develop and pilot-test a Recovery Management Intervention
      (RMI) program for heroin addicts released from compulsory rehabilitation in China.

      The project has the following specific aims:

      Primary aims:

      Aim 1. To engage key stakeholders in the local communities involved in supporting the
      transition of heroin addicts released from compulsory rehabilitation to the community; Aim 2.
      To identify potential barriers for participating in MMT in China; Aim 3. To develop and
      deliver educational/training materials on HIV risks, relapse prevention, and MMT; Aim 4. To
      adapt and develop the Recovery Management Intervention (RMI) program for heroin addicts
      released from compulsory rehabilitation in China; Aim 5. To conduct a pilot trial and obtain
      preliminary outcome data associated with RMI, relative to enhanced standard care.

      Secondary aim:

      Aim 6. To explore predictors of relapse and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors.

      It is hypothesized that the intervention will reduce drug use relapse and the negative
      consequences associated with relapse, including HIV risk behaviors
