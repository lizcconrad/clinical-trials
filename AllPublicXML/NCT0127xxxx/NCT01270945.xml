  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if CV-18C3 will reduce the rate of restenosis or
      the time to restenosis in patients undergoing repeat peripheral artery revascularization
      versus controls randomized to standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restenosis of peripheral artery lesions remains a challenging problem to overcome after
      percutaneous revascularization of atherosclerotic disease in the femoropopliteal arterial
      system. Rates of restenosis are as high as 60% after a year. Treatment options include
      medical therapy, angioplasty, arthrectomy and stent placement. The heterogeneity of disease
      between patients, variable length of target lesions and presence of unpredictable physical
      forces requires individualized treatment plans.

      Vascular response to injury appears to play an important role in the development of
      restenosis. IL-1α is a potent inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in vascular
      inflammation and vascular smooth muscle proliferation--both in acute and chronic injury.
      CV-18C3 antagonizes the biologic activity of IL-1α and is theorized to prevent the early
      IL-1α mediated inflammation that leads to vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy and restenosis,
      as well as the late IL-1α mediated atherosclerotic plaque formation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have suspected superficial femoro-popliteal artery occlusion due to lower extremity
             pain with exercise or at rest and are undergoing a planned arteriogram.

          -  Subjects will be randomized after angiographic evidence of qualifying lesion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute critical limb ischemia

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to humanized or murine monoclonal
             antibodies

          -  Any surgical or medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may place
             the patient at higher risk from his/her participation in the study, or is likely to
             prevent the patient from complying with the requirements of the study or completing
             the study.
