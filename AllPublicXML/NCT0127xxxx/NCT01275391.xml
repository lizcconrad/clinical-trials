  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project we will conduct a pilot study of a brief intervention to reduce teen tobacco,
      alcohol and drug use that primary care dental practitioners can provide in their offices.

      The goal of this project is to prepare for a large multi-site comparative effectiveness trial
      of a behavioral intervention, computer-facilitated Screening, Brief Intervention, and
      Referral to Treatment (cSBIRT) system that targets tobacco, alcohol, and drug use among
      adolescent dental patients. This enhanced computerized screening system includes: (1)
      screening, feedback, and provider talking points for tobacco and non-medical use of
      prescription drugs, (2) an interactive 2-part Motivational Enhancement Therapy module for
      adolescents at highest risk to complete from home, and (3) technological extenders (TEs),
      which are computer-generated messages that the provider sends to adolescents during the
      months following the clinic visit to reinforce the effect of the intervention over time.
