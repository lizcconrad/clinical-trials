  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) is a superior
      respiratory modality for neonates ≥36 weeks with transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN)
      when compared to the standard of care modality (NCPAP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn, fetal lung fluid retention causing poor lung compliance
      and atelectasis, is a common entity in neonates ≥ 36 weeks in our unit. Currently our
      standard of care includes using the respiratory modality of bubble nasal continuous positive
      airway pressure (BNCPAP) to support these neonates during this illness. BNCPAP provides
      positive distending pressure to recruit alveoli and prevent atelectasis, however, it is
      associated with air leak (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum), nasal irritation and necrosis,
      and intolerance. HFNC is another respiratory modality that uses high flow gas that also
      provides positive distending pressure and thus prevents atelectasis. This modality does not
      cause nasal irritation or necrosis and has a minimal risk of air leak. We postulate that HFNC
      is a superior modality to BNCPAP in treating neonates ≥ 36 weeks with TTN. This will be
      determined by comparing the duration of respiratory support (in hours) for newborns ≥ 36
      weeks gestation with a diagnosis to TTN randomized to receive either NCPAP or HFNC for
      respiratory care.

    <description>Unlike the nasal prongs for NCPAP (which fit tightly in the nares), the nasal cannula for HFNC have smaller, loose-fitting prong. With HFNC, positive airway pressure is achieved by high gas flow through the cannula into the external nares which provide resistance to expiration and facilitate inspiration. The distending pressure is determined by the size and structure of the nasal cannula, gas flow rate, and the neonate's airway anatomy 4,5,7. Newborns randomized to HFNC will be started on a flow rate of 4L/min and supplemental oxygen will be provided to maintain oxygen saturations between 88-93% (experimental group). Once initiated, the gas flow rate will be titrated as needed by the attending neonatologist to ameliorate signs of respiratory distress to a maximum flow rate of 6L/min. The nasal cannula size (0.2 cm or 0.3 mm outer diameter) will determined by the caliber of the subject's nares).</description>

    <description>NCPAP provides continuous distending airway pressure during inspiration and expiration via nasal prongs; this has been shown to increase lung volume by increasing alveolar size, recruiting collapsed alveoli, and preventing atelectasis. Improved lung volumes decrease V/Q mismatch and improve the clinical course of neonates with RDS, and as such, early NCPAP use often avoids the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Newborns receiving bubble NCPAP will be placed on a PEEP 5cm H2O, and supplemental oxygen will be provided to maintain oxygen saturation between 88-93% (standard of care group) as is standard practice. The size of the nasal prongs used will be based on the subject's weight as per the manufacturer instructions.</description>

    <description>Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has emerged as an alternative respiratory modality for late preterm newborns with respiratory distress. Like NCPAP, oxygen is delivered to the infant via nasal prongs and provides a continuous distending pressure. Unlike the nasal prongs for NCPAP (which fit tightly in the nares), the nasal cannula for HFNC have smaller, loose-fitting prong. With HFNC, positive airway pressure is achieved by high gas flow through the cannula into the external nares which provide resistance to expiration and facilitate inspiration.

            <description>Unlike the nasal prongs for NCPAP (which fit tightly in the nares), the nasal cannula for HFNC have smaller, loose-fitting prong. With HFNC, positive airway pressure is achieved by high gas flow through the cannula into the external nares which provide resistance to expiration and facilitate inspiration. The distending pressure is determined by the size and structure of the nasal cannula, gas flow rate, and the neonate's airway anatomy 4,5,7. Newborns randomized to HFNC will be started on a flow rate of 4L/min and supplemental oxygen will be provided to maintain oxygen saturations between 88-93% (experimental group). Once initiated, the gas flow rate will be titrated as needed by the attending neonatologist to ameliorate signs of respiratory distress to a maximum flow rate of 6L/min. The nasal cannula size (0.2 cm or 0.3 mm outer diameter) will determined by the caliber of the subject's nares).</description>

            <title>Control Group- Bubble Nasal CPAP</title>
            <description>NCPAP provides continuous distending airway pressure during inspiration and expiration via nasal prongs; this has been shown to increase lung volume by increasing alveolar size, recruiting collapsed alveoli, and preventing atelectasis. Improved lung volumes decrease V/Q mismatch and improve the clinical course of neonates with RDS, and as such, early NCPAP use often avoids the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Newborns receiving bubble NCPAP will be placed on a PEEP 5cm H2O, and supplemental oxygen will be provided to maintain oxygen saturation between 88-93% (standard of care group) as is standard practice. The size of the nasal prongs used will be based on the subject's weight as per the manufacturer instructions.</description>
