    <textblock>
      -  Pre-diabetes is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, as
           well as macrovascular and microvascular complication.

        -  Previous studies show that 50% or more loss in islet B-cell function even in
           Pre-diabetes phase. The early insulin therapy in pre-diabetes may be a strategy in
           preventing metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease.

        -  The objective of this study is to find if an initial insulin glargine intervention in
           pre-diabetes (IGT and /or IFG) could be a strategy in preventing type 2 Diabetes.

        -  Pre-diabetes subjects will receive a insulin glargine therapy with a dosage adjusted to
           get FBG ≤ 5.3mmol / L as the goal. Insulin glargine treatment will be maintained for
           three months thereafter to find if it can prevent diabetes.
