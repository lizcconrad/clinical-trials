    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two care models on ADHD
      outcomes: one, a model of basic care management and structured communication with
      specialists, consistent with conventional descriptions of a patient-centered Medical Home;
      and another, which combines the Medical Home with theory-based care management strategies to
      address common reasons for ADHD treatment failure.
