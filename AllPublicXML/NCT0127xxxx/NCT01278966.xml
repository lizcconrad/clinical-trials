      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of the Modified Atkins Diet in children
      and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy regarding seizure control, and to create a
      protocol for the use of the Modified Atkins Diet as a treatment for epilepsy in Norway.

      The study is a prospective trial on the Modified Atkins Diet for children and adolescents
      with drug-resistant epilepsy. The Modified Atkins Diet is a less restrictive diet than the
      classical ketogenic diet, which is usually offered to this group of patients. Twenty patients
      between 2 and 18 years are included in the study, and the study period is 6 months. The study
      will be conducted at the National Centre for Child Epilepsy in Norway.
