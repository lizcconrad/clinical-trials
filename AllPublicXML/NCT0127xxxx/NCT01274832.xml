  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of DBS not only no motor outcomes, but
      also on neuropsychological and psychiatric aspects and on quality of life in young patients
      with a short history of disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bilateral STN DBS is a powerful treatment for advanced Parkinson disease with Levodopa
      induced motor complications. The beneficial effects of STN stimulation on motor disability
      and quality of life have been proved. However, the mean delay before neurosurgery is
      currently 14 years after diagnosis, when medical treatment no longer controls PD symptoms and
      quality of life is already severely impaired.

      Aim of this study is to prospectively assess the effects of bilateral STN stimulation on
      motor signs, psychological and psychiatric aspects and quality of life in a group of 20
      patients with PD who underwent surgery after 5 years from the onset of the disease. These
      results will be compared with those of a group of 20 patients with a PD history from more
      than 10 years.

      The two groups of patients will be evaluated at baseline and after 3 and 12 months from DBS
      implant; at each visit neurological and motor examinations were assessed and dedicated
      neuropsychological and psychiatric tests will be performed.

      Neurosurgery may be considered superior to medical treatment alone even in mild to moderate
      PD of 10 years duration, rather than a last resort in very advanced stages of the disease.
      Thanks to this study we could compare motor outcomes and cognitive aspects between DBS
      patients with a short and with long history of disease

        This prospective clinical study will enroll 40 patients affected by PD. Patients enrolled
        will be divided into two groups based on the duration of disease. The first group will be
        composed by patients with PD duration of 5, while the second group will be composed by
        patients with a duration of disease longer than 10 years.
