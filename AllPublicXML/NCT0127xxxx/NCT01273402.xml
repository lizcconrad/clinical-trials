  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to select an appropriate TF2 bsMAb dose suitable for pretargeting
      the 111In/90Y-labeled hapten-peptide (IMP-288). Eligible patients will receive a fixed dose
      of 90Y-IMP-288 4 days after the TF2 antibody injection. Two different dose levels of TF2 will
      be studied in the first part.

      Once an appropriate TF2 dose is selected based on information learned from the first 2 dose
      levels, patients will be enrolled onto several different increasing dose levels of
      90Y-IMP-288.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients, &gt;18 years of age.

          -  documented histologic or cytologic diagnosis of metastatic (Stage IV) colorectal
             cancer.

          -  must have at least one confirmed and measurable tumor lesion (a confirmed tumor site
             is one in which either biopsy-proven evidence of disease or progressive growth has
             been radiographically observed).

          -  Patients must have failed standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 70% (or equivalent ECOG 0-1)
             and an expected survival of ≥ 3 months.

          -  Patients who previously received a chimeric, CDR-grafted (humanized), or human IgG
             will be eligible provided pre-study evaluations demonstrate no significant
             anti-antibody reactivity with TF2.

          -  Hematologic parameters: WBC counts must be ≥ 3000/mm3, granulocytes

               -  1500/mm3, and platelets ≥ 100,000/m3.

          -  Non-hematologic parameters: Patients without liver metastases must have bilirubin ≤
             1.5 institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), whereas bilirubin in patients with
             known liver metastases must be &lt;2.5-times the IULN. AST/ALT must not be &gt;2.5 times
             IULN.

          -  At least 2 weeks beyond corticosteroids, except low doses (i.e., 20 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent) to treat nausea or other illness such as rheumatoid
             arthritis.

          -  Patients able to understand and give written informed consent. Informed consent must
             be obtained prior to baseline studies for enrollment purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of childbearing potential and fertile men
             will be informed as to the potential risk of procreation while participating in this
             trial and will be advised that they must use effective contraception during and for a
             period of 3 months.

          -  Patients with plasma CEA &gt;1000 ng/mL or lesions exceeding 10 cm in diameter.

          -  Patients with severe anorexia or other gastrointestinal-related symptomatology (e.g.,
             nausea, vomiting).

          -  Patients with known HIV or hepatitis B or C.

          -  Patients with an active second primary malignancy at the time of study entry, with the
             exception of carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Patients with known metastatic disease to the central nervous system.

          -  Patients with evidence of bone marrow metastases. Screening only required for patients
             with suspicion of metastases. Patients with ≥ 25% bone marrow involvement are
             excluded.

          -  Patients who are, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to comply with the
             protocol requirements.

          -  Institutionalized subjects (e.g., prisons, psychiatric facilities).

          -  Known history of active coronary artery disease, unstable angina, myocardial
             infarction, or congestive heart failure present within 6 months or cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring anti-arrhythmia therapy.

          -  Known autoimmune disease or presence of autoimmune phenomena (except rheumatoid
             arthritis requiring only low dose maintenance corticosteroids); or infection requiring
             intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week.

          -  Known history of active COPD, or other moderate-to-severe respiratory illness present
             within 6 months.

          -  Patients who are diabetic and/or have high blood pressure are at a higher risk for
             developing late-stage renal failure. While these patients will not be specifically
             excluded, physician-investigators must carefully discuss the associated late risks to
             these patients.

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks beyond prior chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy to
             an index lesion, or experimental therapy (i.e., drugs, biologicals, procedures) and
             meet all eligibility criteria.

          -  Patients who received a treatment containing a nitrosourea compound will not be
             enrolled for at least 6 weeks after the end of that treatment.
