  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the drug-drug interaction potential between
      telaprevir and buprenorphine/naloxone. An understanding of the interaction potential will
      help to determine whether buprenorphine dose adjustments are necessary for patients who are
      concomitantly treated with telaprevir.

      Telaprevir, in combination with other antiviral agents, is being investigated for the
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Buprenorphine/naloxone is used for
      maintainance therapy in patients with opioid dependence.

    <description>Buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets or films contain buprenorphine HCl and naloxone HCl dihydrate at a ratio of 4:1 buprenorphine:naloxone (ratio of free bases). In this study buprenorphine/naloxone will be dosed from Day -14 through Day 38, inclusive. From Day -14 through Day -1 all subjects will receive a maximum of 24 mg/6 mg of buprenorphine/naloxone. Subjects will not be permitted to change their dose during the telaprevir co-administration period (Day 1 through Day 7) unless warranted by the investigator's clinical judgment of subject safety. After Day 8, the dose of buprenorphine/naloxone may be adjusted if deemed necessary by the investigator.</description>
