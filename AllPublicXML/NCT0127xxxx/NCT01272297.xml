  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low Intensity Shock Wave Therapy (LI-ESWT) was shown to have a beneficial effect on ED
      patients responding to PDE5i's. This study aimed to determine the capability of swt to
      convert PDE5 inhibitor non responders to sexually functioning males under PDE5i therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We included severe ED patients (60% diabetic, 85% with cardiovascular disease) that failed to
      respond to PDE5i therapy, who scored 0-2 on the rigidity scale (RS) during PDE5i
      therapy.Treatment included 2 sessions/week for 3 weeks, repeated after a 3-week no-treatment
      interval. At each session LI-ESWT was applied on the penile shaft and crus for 3 minutes in 5
      different penile anatomical sites (intensity of 0.09 mj/mm2, 300 shocks/site). One-month
      after end of treatment the same baseline assessment was repeated. An active PDE5i medication
      regime was then provided and final erectile function was reassessed. Main endpoints for
      success were changes in RS and in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-ED)
      Domain score. We found that LI-ESWT can effectively treat severe ED patients who failed PDE5i
      therapy. This study further emphasises the physiological effect that LI-ESWT can have on the
      erectile mechanism.
