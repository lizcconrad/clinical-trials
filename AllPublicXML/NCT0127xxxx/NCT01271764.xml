  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor invasion and metastasis are the major causes of cancer-related death. Some studies have
      found that histone methyltransferases, such as EZH2, specifically affect metastasis in
      breast, gastric and prostate cancer. The functional roles of other members of the HMT family
      such as G9a in cancer remain obscure. Therefore, the investigators will investigate whether
      G9a have a role in recurrence/metastasis of endometrial cancer.
