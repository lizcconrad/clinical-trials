  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, active-control Phase II pilot trial of bavituximab
      combined with ribavirin for initial treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. Eligible
      patients with normal coagulation, hematological, and renal function will undergo a
      screening/washout period of up to 28 days, followed by randomization to receive weekly
      bavituximab or PEG-IFN alpha-2a therapy for 12 weeks, both with twice-daily ribavirin.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of patients who show a greater than or
      equal to 2-log10 IU reduction in plasma HCV RNA level after 12 weeks of treatment (early
      virological response; EVR).

      Secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients with an undetectable HCV RNA level
      after 12 weeks of treatment; the proportion of patients who show a reduction in HCV RNA level
      of greater than or equal to 2 log10 IU after 4 weeks of treatment, viral kinetics for
      individual patients over time, and comprehensive evaluation of the safety and tolerability of
      bavituximab infusion.

      Primary Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of 12 weeks of
      initial treatment with bavituximab versus PEG-IFN, each combined with ribavirin, on plasma
      HCV RNA level in patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection.
