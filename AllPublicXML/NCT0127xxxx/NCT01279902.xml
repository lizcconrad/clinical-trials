      This study aims; to assess the efficacy of shortened systemic chemotherapy in patients with
      completely excised CD20 positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) with Ann Arbor Stage I
      or II.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unlike the limited stage diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with primary
      chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, patients with stage I or II DLBCL would be treated
      with surgical resection followed by chemotherapy in this trial. While chemotherapy is the
      main treatment modality and radiotherapy becomes adjuvant treatment in the former treatment
      scheme, surgical resection will remove all the gross lesions and chemotherapy aims to remove
      all microscopic disease whichever exists in the latter treatment scheme. Currently, six
      cycles of chemotherapy is usually performed after surgery even without any residual lesion
      compared with three cycles of chemotherapy in the former treatment scheme which plays primary
      role in the treatment scheme. The investigators will investigate whether abbreviated 3 cycles
      of Rituximab Plus Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, and Prednisolone (R-CHOP)
      immunochemotherapy following complete resection is an effective and safe treatment.
