        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria for the study were bladder cancer (Stage T1G3, T2-3N0-NxM0),
             female (age between 40 and 70 years old), no history of urethral trauma or urethral
             stricture; and a desire to obtain an orthotopic neobladder

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were male sex, posterior urethral margin confirmed as cancer
             invasive by pathology; and enteritis. The indications and contraindications for
             orthotopic reconstruction in this study conformed to the criteria set by the
             guidelines of the European Association of Urology on bladder cancer
