  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study have recently had or are scheduled for a (percutaneous coronary
      intervention) PCI as part of their normal, routine medical care. This procedure should
      restore the blood flow in the vessels of the heart.

      Recent studies have shown that stable patients who undergo PCI and are discharged home after
      4 hours of observation do not suffer any more complications compared to patients who stay in
      the hospital overnight. In addition, studies suggest that patients express increased
      satisfaction at being discharged after 4 hours.

      The University of Chicago is one of the first US medical centers to institute a formal
      program of same-day discharge after PCI. This study will seek, through a analysis of medical
      information and satisfaction questionnaires, to assess whether this particular same-day
      discharge program can improve patient satisfaction and preserve patient safety.

        Every patient who presents to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for coronary
        angiography will be given the opportunity to participate in this program. The determination
        on whether or not a patient is selected to undergo Same-Day PCI is based on the clinical
        decision of the practicing physician according to conventionally accepted inclusion and
        exclusion criteria. The decision on whether or not to participate in the questionnaire
        study will not affect any treatment decisions. The only exclusion criteria will be if the
        patient declines participation. The investigators would like to enroll 250 patients over a
        three year period.
