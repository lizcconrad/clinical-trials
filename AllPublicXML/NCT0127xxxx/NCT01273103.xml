  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, open-label, single dose, mass balance study in a cohort of 6 healthy
      adult male subjects. The study will consist of: Screening evaluations, a treatment phase, and
      follow-up evaluations. In the treatment phase, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours,
      each subject will receive a single oral suspension dose of GSK2248761 200mg containing [14C]
      - GSK2248761. Following dosing, serial whole blood, plasma, urine, and fecal samples will be
      collected. Subjects will be required to remain in the unit until the radiocarbon excreted
      falls to less than or equal to 1% of the administered dose for two consecutive 24-hour
      collections in both urine and feces, whichever occurs first. Safety will be assessed by vital
      signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests, AE monitoring, and
      physical examinations as indicated.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within the range

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof, or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

             limit of WHO category II) or exposure to significant radiation (e.g. serial x-ray or
             CT scans, barium meal etc) in the 12 months prior to this study. Any previous
             radiolabeled study drug must have been received more than 6 months prior to check-in.
             Also the total exposure from this current study and any previous studies must be
             within the recommended levels considered safe of 5 Rems whole body annual exposure, as
             per United States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 CFR 361.1.

          -  Any condition that could interfere with the accurate assessment and recovery of
             radiocarbon [14C].

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             45-100 bpm. A single repeat is allowed to determine eligibility.

          -  An abnormal ECG as specified in the protocol (a single repeat is allowed for
