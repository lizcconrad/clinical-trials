  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This placebo-controlled crossover study is intended to measure the effect of four doses of
      lorazepam on brain activity measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
      electroencephalography (EEG). This study will conduct MEG and EEG scans as well as simple
      cognition testing on 16 healthy male volunteers. On each of five study days subjects will be
      randomized to receive either 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg lorazepam or placebo. Brain activity
      will be measured by MEG and EEG in each subject a total of 4 times each study day: prior to
      medication administration and 2, 4, and 6 hours after medication administration. Blood
      samples to determine medication levels and cognition testing will be performed at
      pre-medication baseline and immediately after each post-medication scan time. Data will be
      analyzed to identify changes in brain activity compared to baseline and placebo
      administration using both standard approaches and the Orasi Synchronous Neural Interaction®
      (SNI) test. This study will test the hypothesis that dose-response changes in brain
      functional activity can be accurately measured by MEG/EEG in healthy volunteer subjects after
      single, acute doses of lorazepam.
