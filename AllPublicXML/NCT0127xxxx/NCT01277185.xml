    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify calcium metabolism characteristics in Mexican
      American adolescents. The investigators predict that calcium requirements to maximize bone
      health in this population will be lower than for white youth but higher than their current
      intakes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously significant racial and sex differences in calcium retention and kinetics in
      adolescents has been found. Other minority groups have increased calcium absorption
      efficiency at low calcium intakes in contrast to white adolescents. Since Hispanics and
      specifically Mexican Americans will soon comprise an increasing proportion of our population.
      We propose to identify calcium metabolism characteristics in this group. We predict that
      calcium requirements to maximize bone health in this population will be lower than for white
      youth but higher than their current intakes.

      Thus the specific aims of this project include:

        -  to establish calcium requirements

        -  to establish the relationship between calcium intake and calcium absorption

        -  to identify the major physiological parameters(kidney, intestine, bone) that contribute
           to calcium retention in Mexican-American adolescents

      During this two-phase metabolic camp participants will consume either a higher calcium
      diet(1100-2300mg/d) or a lower calcium diet (600-1200mg/d) during the first 3-week phase and
      switch to the opposite regime during the second 3-week phase, with a 2-week washout period in
      between. Subjects will collect all excreta during both phases. Calcium absorption, height,
      weight, and bone density will evaluated throughout the 6-week period of the study.

    <description>The basal diet will contain 600 mg of Ca per day and constant sufficient amounts of all other nutrients. Additional Ca will be given unfortified beverages served three times per day. Teens will be randomized to a lower (600-1200 mg/d)level of calcium in the first camp followed by the opposite (higher calcium diet)regime in the second camp.</description>
