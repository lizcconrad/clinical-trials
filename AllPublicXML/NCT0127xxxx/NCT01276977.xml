      The purpose of this study is to Compare the efficacy of zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray vs.
      eletriptan 40 mg tablet in the acute treatment of migraine.

      To develop and evaluate a set of importance weights for a predefined set of treatment
      attributes for migraine suffers using zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray vs. eletriptan 40 mg
      tablet.

      To contrast the efficacy of zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray vs. eletriptan 40 mg tablet at
      early time points.

      To analyze the patterns of self-reported tolerability of migraine sufferers using
      zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray vs. eletriptan 40 mg tablet.
