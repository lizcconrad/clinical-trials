    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to compare the effect on glycaemic
      control of biphasic insulin aspart 30 twice daily with two different dosage split regimens
      for Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes who did not achieve the treatment target of a
      glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) below 7% in trial BIASP-3756 (NCT01123980).
