  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients
      with chronic Hepatitis C compared to a matched control group of healthy individuals in the
      Sioux Falls area. It is the hypothesis of this study that vitamin D deficiency is more common
      in patients with chronic Hepatitis C compared to the healthy control group.

      In this study, we will measure vitamin D levels in patients with chronic Hepatitis C and
      healthy individuals. This study will be important to assess vitamin D inadequacy in patients
      with chronic Hepatitis C and healthy individuals in this area.

        This is a comparison study between two different populations: a study group and a control
        group. The study group will consist of fifty individuals with a diagnosis of chronic
        Hepatitis C. The control group will consist of fifty individuals who are considered to be
        generally healthy.
