      1.) To integrate discharge planning into an intervention provided by advanced practice nurses
      (APRNs)for patients with advanced cancer, 2.) To evaluate the effects of the intervention,
      and 3.) To explore the reach, adoption, and implementation of the intervention to facilitate
      the transition of patients from surgery/biopsy/chemotherapy to medical oncology in a
      comprehensive cancer center.
