  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) resolution in morbidly obese patients following bariatric
      surgery suggests the efficacy of metabolic surgery in non-morbidly obese patients (body mass
      index [BMI]&lt;35 kg/m2). Many researches have shown available evidence about the efficacy and
      safety of metabolic surgery for resolution of T2DM in the non-morbidly obese. One of the most
      effective metabolic surgeries is laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The
      investigators intend to run a 3 year prospective multicenter study to evaluate the remission
      efficacy of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in Type 2 Diabetes mellitus with low BMI
      (BMI:25-35) in Asia area.

    <textblock>
      The study is designed including 9 bariatric centers across Asia region( China, Korea,
      Phillipine, Singapore and Taiwan). Totally 500 patients with confirmed diagnosis of T2DM and
      BMI between 25-35 kg/m2 will be enrolled from January 2011 to December 2013. Preoperative
      surgical parameters, blood, biochemistry data, gastrointestinal hormones, upper
      gastrointestinal studies, abdominal ultrasound, peri-operative &amp; postoperative complications
      will all be recorded and analyzed. Patient inclusion criteria: 1.) T2DM diagnosed over 1
      year; 2.) age ranged 30-60 years; 3.) BMI 25-35 kg/m2; 4.) Patient consent and will to
      receive long-term follow up and periodic check up. Exclusion criteria: 1.) T1DM; 2.)
      Substance abuse; 3.) Planned pregnancy within 2 year after surgery; 3.) Uncontrolled
      psychiatric disease; 4.) Lost follow up. Institutions inclusion criteria: Professional
      experience over 30 LRYGB performed. Trial termination criteria: Surgical mortality over 0.5%
      in the first year, and Diabetes remission rate failure over 20% in one year.

      All data will be collected yearly in one center. The analysis of parameter, statistics and
      brief results will be informed to enrolled institutions periodically.

    <description>An observational, prospective and multi-center study will be carry out with IRB approval. A total of 500 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with low BMI (25-35 kg/m2) will be collected in different surgical institutions. Pre and post operative biochemical parameters will be collected at the 1st, 6th, 12th, 24th and 36th months. Comparative outcomes will support the relationship between diabetes improvement or remission and the surgical intervention.
