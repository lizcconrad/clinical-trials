      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of bariatric surgery on blood sugar
      control and underlying mechanisms that contribute to type 2 diabetes in men and women with a
      BMI between 27 and 42. Sixty subjects will be randomized to either undergo the roux-en-y
      gastric bypass operation or intensive medical, dietary and exercise management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two of the greatest public health problems of
      the 21st century. Lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy, which are mainstay treatments for
      T2DM have had limited success. More intensive lifestyle weight management such as in the Look
      AHEAD trial reported an 8.6% weight loss after 1 year, while the Diabetes Prevention Program
      reported a 7% weight loss after 2 years, and a 58% decrease in the risk of developing T2DM.
      In contrast,we have observed a 31% weight loss together with 83% remission of T2DM in
      severely obese patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. However, direct
      evidence of the glycemic benefits of bariatric surgery from randomized control trials is
      lacking; there is no clear consensus that RYGB surgery is a good treatment option for
      moderately obese T2DM patients; and the mechanisms responsible for reversing T2DM after
      surgery remain unclear but may involve pancreatic insulin secretion and skeletal muscle and
      hepatic insulin resistance.

      The objective of this application is to evaluate the effects of RYGB surgery on glycemic
      control and underlying mechanisms that contribute to T2DM in obese subjects (BMI: 30-40
      kg/m2). Our central hypothesis is that RYGB surgery will reduce hyperglycemia via reversal of
      beta-cell dysfunction and decrease hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance. The approach
      requires a 12-month randomized controlled trial. The rationale is based on data showing that
      RYGB lowers fasting and postprandial glucose, and increases the GLP-1 response to a meal.
      However, the therapeutic efficacy of RYGB surgery in obesity-related T2DM needs to be
      demonstrated in a randomized trial.

    <description>The working hypothesis for this aim is that significantly more obese T2DM patients who undergo RYGB surgery will achieve glycemic control based on a primary endpoint of an HbA1c â‰¤ 6.5% at 12 months, than patients managed by intensive medical therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The working hypothesis for this aim is that a primary physiological link between obesity and T2DM is specific to beta-cell dysfunction; RYGB will reverse beta-cell dysfunction by increasing postprandial incretin secretion.</description>
