      Describe the dose-proportionality and intra-individual variability of tenofovir diphosphate
      (TFV-DP) and emtricitabine triphosphate (FTC-TP) at steady-state in healthy human
      participants taking TruvadaÂ® (FTC 200mg/TDF 300 mg) under direct observation.

      This PK study is designed to establish the dose-proportionality of TFV and FTC (serum and
      intracellular forms) with daily to weekly dosing. This information is essential to (1) employ
      drug concentration as an adherence measure in future PrEP studies, and (2) to estimate the
      anticipated concentration of parent and active moieties of TFV and FTC in intermittent PrEP
      regimens associated with full adherence to a prescribed regimen. In addition,
      intra-individual variability will be assessed to improve sample size estimates in future PrEP
      studies that use drug concentration as an adherence measure or where PK-PD correlations are
      planned. The dose-proportionality of intra-cellular phosphates of the two components of the
      study product has not previously been established. Given the complexity of movement of these
      drugs between body compartments (central compartment, vaginal mucosal tissue, vaginal lumen,
      gastrointestinal mucosal tissue, gastrointestinal lumen), into cells within these
      compartments, and intra-cellular phosphorylation, it is possible that non-dose proportional
      kinetics, such as mixed or zero-order saturable processes may be operating.
