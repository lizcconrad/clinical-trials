    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive focal mononeuropathy seen in
      clinical practice. Patients commonly experience a constellation of symptom complex brought on
      by compression of the median nerve as it traverse through the carpal tunnel. When compression
      of the nerve occurs, ischemia and mechanical disruption of nerve function may result.
      Pathological analysis shows a constellation of nerve injuries. Until now, no satisfactory
      conservative treatment method. Local steroid injections or oral steroids may result in
      initial relief, but relapses are frequent and have much side effects, which preclude their
      routine use for CTS. Full time wrist splints are claimed effective, but compromise hand
      function and daily activities. There are reasonable studies showing relief of pain with
      acupuncture on diverse pain conditions. However the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture in
      CTS was less convincing in the past. Until recent decade, some case reports and few
      prospective studies reported the therapeutic effect of acupuncture in CTS. Other study also
      reported that low-level laser and microamperes transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
      (TENS) are effective in improvement of clinical outcome of patients with CTS. Another report
      suggested that TENS should be considered for the treatment of painful diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy. Therefore, the investigators perform this study to evaluate the effect of Aculife
      Magnetic Wave Therapist (a battery operated device with a probe electrode which contains
      magnetic elements that transform the oscillating current into an electromagnetic wave to
      stimulate the acupuncture points, simulate the effect of electroacupuncture ) on CTS and
      compared with that of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation(TENS). After at least 4
      weeks treatment ( at least 16 treatment sessions) the therapeutic effects will be evaluated
      by comparison of symptom severity score, electrophysiological study, sonographic morphology
      study or magnetic resonance imaging study, before and after treatment, and between the
      different groups.
