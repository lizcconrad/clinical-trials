  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbidly obesity (body mass index 40 kg/m²), the most serious, is more and more frequent.
      Cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of morbidity and mortality. An excess of TRL
      particles is one of the characteristics, represents a major cardiovascular risk factor. The
      overproduction of the intestinal TRL (which apoprotein B48 is the specific tracer) is
      recently recognized of insulin-resistance and the atherogenous role of these intestinal TRL
      has been shown. In front of this important overmortality, the bariatric surgery quickly
      developed. Three main procedures are performed: 2 based exclusively on the gastric
      restriction (the adjustable gastric banding and the sleeve gastrectomy) and one associating a
      malabsorption (the gastric bypass).

      It is a monocentric, prospective, comparative study. After identification of the eligible
      subjects, the kinetics (production and clearance rates) of the intestinal TRL will be
      performed in the hospital, using a stable isotope method (5,5,5-D3-L-Leucine), in 3 groups of
      obese patients (12 patients per surgery procedure), before and 6 months after the surgery
