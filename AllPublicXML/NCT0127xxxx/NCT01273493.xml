  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of
      trabectedin after administration to patients with advanced malignancies and hepatic (liver)
      dysfunction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (patients will know the names of study drugs they receive),
      single-dose, study that will examine the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and assess survival
      and safety of trabectedin in patients with advanced malignancies who either have hepatic
      (liver) dysfunction or do not have hepatic dysfunction (patients enrolled without hepatic
      dysfunction will be referred to as the control group). Trabectedin is a drug being developed
      to treat patients with cancer that will be administered intravenously (i.v.) through a
      catheter (tube) into a central vein. In addition, dexamethasone, a drug used to prevent
      nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients that may have protective effects on the liver,
      will be administered to patients before the administration of trabectedin. Patients who
      complete the treatment phase of the study who in the opinion of the investigator would derive
      an overall clinical benefit from further treatment with trabectedin will have the opportunity
      to continue treatment with trabectedin in the optional extension phase. The dose and schedule
      of trabectedin may be modified by the treating physician in the optional extension phase to
      be more appropriate for the type of malignancy being treated. A single dose of trabectedin
      (1.3 mg/m2 in patients in the control group and 0.58 mg/m2 in patients with hepatic
      dysfunction) will be administered by i.v.infusion over a 3-hour period. The dose of
      trabectedin may be adjusted if necessary for patients with hepatic dysfunction subsequently
      enrolled in the study. All patients will be administered dexamethasone 20 mg i.v. (or
      equivalent) approximately 30 minutes before the administration of trabectedin.
