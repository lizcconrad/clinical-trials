  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Good bone healing and bone build-up are necessary for the success of dental implants.
      Research in animals and humans has shown that a drug, called Forteo, can increase bone
      build-up and bone strength over time. Forteo has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in patients with a condition where bone is broken down and
      weakened, called osteoporosis. The investigators do not know, however, whether Forteo is
      effective for use in humans for improving bone healing after implant placement, and whether
      it will have the same bone-building and bone-strengthening effects as for patients with
      osteoporosis. This research study is being done to learn what effect 7 weeks of treatment
      with Forteo will have on bone build-up and strengthening of bone for patients receiving
      implants.

      A single center, placebo-controlled, double blind parallel study of teriparatide use in
      patients requiring dental implant therapy is planned. Subjects who qualify based on the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly placed into one of two treatment groups,
      teriparatide (20 μg/day) or placebo control. Both patients and investigators will be blinded.
      Serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, radiographs, and a tetracycline-labelled
      bone core will constitute the main data gathered for analysis. After implant surgery,
      patients will return at 2 weeks for post-operative care and then at 14 weeks for an implant
      impression and again at 16 weeks to receive the final restoration. Twelve months after
      implant placement, patients will be seen for a follow-up exam and standardized radiograph to
      ensure proper healing.

    <measure>Bone Formation Rate</measure>

    <description>To determine the impact of PTH on bone quality and bone turnover in the oral cavity. The primary outcome variable will be bone formation rate.</description>

    <measure>Bone Turnover (Mineral Apposition Rates)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bone turnover was assessed indirectly by bone histomorphometry using the following abbreviations: Mineral Apposition Rate (MAR): Distance between 2 fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label on the surfaces of cancellous bone measured at an average of 4 equally-spaced sites per double label. These measurements will be performed on 20 double fluorochrome labels per bone and the average divided by the time between the midpoints of the two labeling periods. MAR serves as an index of osteoblast activity. Reported for cancellous (Cn), endocortical (Ec) at baseline (pre-drug intervention, listed as &quot;first set&quot;) and at the end of drug intervention (&quot;second set&quot;). &quot;First set&quot; refers to baseline information (pre-drug), and &quot;second set&quot; refers to data evaluated at the end of the drug administration phase. Periosteal (Ps) data and Ec.Mar Endocortical MAR &quot;second set&quot; was reviewed but no analyzable labeling was noted and so this data is not reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bone Turnover: Cortical Tissue Area</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bone turnover was assessed indirectly by evaluating cellular parameters of PTH action (i.e. numbers of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, apoptotic osteoblasts). The methods used to obtain the outcomes described below were bone histomorphometry using the following abbreviation:
Ct.T.Ar: Ct Cort(ex)(ical) Tissue Area (2D)b &quot;First set&quot; refers to baseline pre-drug data and &quot;second set&quot; was taken at the end of the drug administration phase.</description>

    <measure>Bone Turnover: Bone Perimeter Length</measure>

        <title>Bone Turnover (Mineral Apposition Rates)</title>
        <description>Bone turnover was assessed indirectly by bone histomorphometry using the following abbreviations: Mineral Apposition Rate (MAR): Distance between 2 fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label on the surfaces of cancellous bone measured at an average of 4 equally-spaced sites per double label. These measurements will be performed on 20 double fluorochrome labels per bone and the average divided by the time between the midpoints of the two labeling periods. MAR serves as an index of osteoblast activity. Reported for cancellous (Cn), endocortical (Ec) at baseline (pre-drug intervention, listed as “first set”) and at the end of drug intervention (“second set”). “First set” refers to baseline information (pre-drug), and “second set” refers to data evaluated at the end of the drug administration phase. Periosteal (Ps) data and Ec.Mar Endocortical MAR &quot;second set&quot; was reviewed but no analyzable labeling was noted and so this data is not reported.</description>
