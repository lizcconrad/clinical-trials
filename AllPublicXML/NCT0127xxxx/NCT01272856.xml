  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug abatacept and see what
      effects (good and bad) it has in patients with relapsing polychondritis.

    <textblock>
      After a screening period of up to 4 weeks, patients who fulfill all inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will receive open-label subcutaneous abatacept consisting of 125 mg weekly,
      beginning 1 week thru Week 24.

      Throughout the study, blood will be collected for clinical laboratory safety,
      pharmacodynamics and biomarkers. Disease activity assessments will include laboratory
      evaluation of acute phase reactants, pulmonary function testing, computed tomography of the
      neck and chest, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, audiogram, physician assessment of
      chondritis activity, swollen and tender joint counts, and patient- and physican-reported
      outcomes. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded.
