      This study will look to see how well patients with relapsed or recurrent intracranial germ
      cell tumors respond to the new combination of chemotherapy (in induction)of Gemcitabine,
      Paclitaxel and Oxaliplatin (GemPOx) followed by consolidation chemotherapy and autologous
      stem cell rescue.
