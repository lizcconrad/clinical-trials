  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to safely determine if the investigators can identify the severity
      of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) early in the course of the disease. Once enrolled the
      investigators will draw blood and urine for novel and standard biomarkers. The investigators
      are attempting to determine if these biomarkers can forecast the course of AKI (need for
      dialysis, death and renal recovery). The investigators seek to determine how well physicians
      caring for those with AKI can predict the clinical course compared to these novel biomarkers
      of AKI and if there is an association between clinical course and 3 year patient outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AKI is a very common disease in the setting of critical illness and carries an extremely high
      morbidity and mortality rate (over 50%). Currently there are no FDA approved therapuetic
      agents for the treatment of AKI. There is limited prospective evidence to guide nephrologists
      in terms of which patients will progress to more severe AKI in the setting of early AKI.
      Similarly, there is no evidence to guide nephrologists in terms of which patients will
      completely recover their renal function after AKI. Thus we need to know very early in the
      course of AKI which patients will progress and go on to require RRT. Additonally we will
      investigating the long term patient outcomes, 2-3 years after the index AKI admission.
