    <textblock>
      Employees of Blue Shield of California (BSC) will be recruited to participate to regularly
      use Walkstations. Some participants will be randomly assigned to a &quot;hold out&quot; control
      condition and the remainder will be assigned to one of two experimental treatments: Personal
      Incentive vs. Charitable Incentive. In the Personal Incentive condition people will be paid
      $3 for every completed Walkstation session, whereas for participants in the Charitable
      Incentive condition $3 will be donated to a specific charity. The incentives will operate for
      approximately 45 days and then for an additional 45 days participants in the two experimental
      conditions will have access to the Walkstations. Participants in the hold out control
      condition will begin using the Walkstations after the initial 90 day period.

    <description>The investigators are testing the effect of two different incentive schemes on people's usage of walkstations at work: either a personal incentive (in which people receive personal financial benefit for using the walkstations) vs. a charitable incentive (in which others receive financial benefit if a given individual uses the walkstation).</description>
