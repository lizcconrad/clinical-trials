  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands approximately 2300 new patients are diagnosed with rectal cancer each
      year. Standard treatment for patients with a T2 or T3 rectal cancer consists of preoperative
      short course of radiotherapy followed by surgery. In advanced cases long course of
      radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is used instead of a short cause. In some of these
      advanced cases a complete remission is observed after a long course of radio-/chemotherapy.
      Patients who respond well to neo-adjuvant treatment carry a better prognosis.

      Objective of this research is to evaluate whether neo-adjuvant chemo-/radiotherapy in small
      non-advanced rectal cancers can be used to obtain a complete or near complete remission. In
      these patients could a complete resection of the rectum as an organ be avoided by treating
      them with a local excision with the TEM-technique (Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery) of the
      scar. The advantage for these patients is, that they do not need major abdominal surgery and
      in a substantial number of these patients the rectum can be preserved with a better function
      of continence.

    <intervention_name>TEM surgery</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients undergo a MRI of the pelvis and a rectoscopy and endorectal ultrasound 6 weeks after chemo radiation.Patients with a significant downsizing of the tumour (T0-T2) will be operated on by TEM surgery 8 -10 weeks after the last chemo radiation treatment.
After TEM surgery, pathological assessment will dictate further treatment. Conservative treatment with careful follow-up will be performed in patients with a complete resection of a ypT0-1 rectal tumour. Patients with lymphangio invasion, an incomplete resected ypT1 (&lt;2 mm margin), an ypT2 or ypT3 tumour after TEM will subsequently undergo TME surgery to remove the rectum within 4 weeks.</description>
