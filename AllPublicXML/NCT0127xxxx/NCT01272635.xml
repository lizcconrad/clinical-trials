    <textblock>
      This protocol is comprised of two separate, but linked, clinical trials for treating
      preschool-aged children with recurrent severe episodes of wheezing. The first study (APRIL)
      will try to prevent wheezing illness from developing using azithromycin. If a wheezing
      illness does occur, the second trial (OCELOT) will try to decrease the severity of symptoms
      using oral corticosteroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preschool aged children often have severe bouts of coughing and/or wheezing that lead to
      visits to the doctor's office, urgent care, emergency room and often hospitalization.
      APRIL-OCELOT is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study in 600 preschool
      children with a history of significant wheezing episodes in the year prior to enrollment. All
      children enter the APRIL portion of the study, which will compare azithromycin to placebo,
      given for 5 days during the early signs of an upper respiratory tract illness, for preventing
      the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms. APRIL is a 78 week study, but
      participation will end earlier if the child requires a fourth course of APRIL treatment or
      develops significant lower respiratory tract symptoms. Only those children who develop
      significant lower respiratory tract symptoms during APRIL will enter the OCELOT portion of
      the study, which will compare oral corticosteroid to placebo for treating lower respiratory
      tract symptoms as measured by the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM). OCELOT
      participation will be complete after 14 days. Children may not reenter APRIL after completing
      OCELOT.

    <description>The Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) is a composite outcome with scores ranging from 0-12 with higher numbers representing worse symptoms. The score is calculated as the sum total of the follow five elements: (1) scalene retractions, (2) suprasternal retractions, (3) wheezing, (4) air entry, (5) oxygen saturation. A complete description can be found in: Ducharme FM, Chalut D, Plotnick L, et al.

    <measure>Asthma Related Symptoms Among RTI Progressing to Severe LRTI</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days after initiation of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma related symptoms as measured by the parent-completed Pre-school Asthma Symptom Diary (PAD). The PAD was completed daily starting on the first day of an illness and continued until the participant was symptom-free for 2 days. It contains questions of frequency of respiratory symptoms, each scored on a scale of 1 through 7, with higher scores representing increasingly frequent symptoms, with daily scores ranging from 0 (asymptomatic) to a maximum of 102. The total PAD score is the sum of the daily individual symptom scores over the duration of the illness, with higher scores representing more frequent symptoms.</description>

          -  Gestation less than late preterm as defined as birth before 34 weeks gestational age.

          -  Presence of lung disease other than asthma, such as cystic fibrosis and BPD.
             Evaluation during the screening process will assure that an adequate evaluation of
             other lung diseases has been performed.

          -  Presence of other significant medical illnesses (cardiac, liver, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine) that would place the study subject at increased risk of participating in
             the study.

          -  Immunodeficiency disorders.

          -  History of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

          -  The child has significant developmental delay/failure to thrive, defined as crossing
             of two major percentile lines during the last year for age and gender. If a child
             plots less than the 10th percentile for age and gender, a growth chart for the
             previous year will be obtained from the child's primary care provider.

        <description>The Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) is a composite outcome with scores ranging from 0-12 with higher numbers representing worse symptoms. The score is calculated as the sum total of the follow five elements: (1) scalene retractions, (2) suprasternal retractions, (3) wheezing, (4) air entry, (5) oxygen saturation.

        <title>Asthma Related Symptoms Among RTI Progressing to Severe LRTI</title>
        <description>Asthma related symptoms as measured by the parent-completed Pre-school Asthma Symptom Diary (PAD). The PAD was completed daily starting on the first day of an illness and continued until the participant was symptom-free for 2 days. It contains questions of frequency of respiratory symptoms, each scored on a scale of 1 through 7, with higher scores representing increasingly frequent symptoms, with daily scores ranging from 0 (asymptomatic) to a maximum of 102. The total PAD score is the sum of the daily individual symptom scores over the duration of the illness, with higher scores representing more frequent symptoms.</description>
