  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To characterize the distribution and elimination of AZD9742 and total 14C radioactivity in healthy volunteers following a single 1000 mg intravenous (IV) dose of [14C]-AZD9742 administered as a 2-hour infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Range of 12 hours pre dose to 168 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>12 hours pre dose to 168 hours post dose of the treatment period if the patient meets discharge criteria. If the patient does not meet discharge criteria after 168 hours post dose, additional 24 hour collections up to 7 additional days or until discharge criteria are met, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the excretion of 14C (mass balance) in urine and feces after a single 1000 mg intravenous (IV) dose of [14C]-AZD9742 administered as a 2-hour infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Range of 12 hours pre dose to 168 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>12 hours pre dose to 168 hours post dose of the treatment period if the patient meets discharge criteria.

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of AZD9742 after a single intravenous 14C administration of AZD9742, by assessing a panel of measures: Adverse Events, vital sign evaluations, physical examination, electrocardiograms (ECG) and clinical laboratory parameters.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To explore and establish the metabolite profiles in plasma and excreta; where possible the identity of metabolites will be determined.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately prior to the end of the infusion, 4 hours after the end of the infusion and 24 hours after the start of the infusion.</time_frame>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male volunteers age 55 years or older on Day 1, body weight &gt;50 kg, body mass
             index (BMI) between 18 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2

          -  Regular bowel movements, at least once per day (self reported)

          -  Volunteers must be willing to have intravenous (IV) and blood sampling from either
             arm.

          -  Volunteers should ensure that their partners of child-bearing potential use a reliable
             method of contraception, as well as using a barrier method themselves.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or abnormalities, including history or
             presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal disease or any other condition known to
             interfere with metabolism, or excretion of drugs

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of investigational product

          -  Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous
             30 days

          -  History of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol

          -  Participation in more than 1 other radiolabeled investigational study drug trial
             within 1 year prior to check-in. The previous radiolabeled study drug had to be
             received more than 6 months prior to check-in and the total exposure from this study
             and the previous study must be within the CFR recommended levels considered safe (per
             21 CRF 362.1, less than 5,000 mrem whole body annual exposure).
