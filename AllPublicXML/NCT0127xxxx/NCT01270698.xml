  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to study the safety of IMMU-130. IMMU-130 is composed of a drug
      attached to an antibody. The drug is the active ingredient in irinotecan which is a common
      chemotherapy drug used for colorectal cancer. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the
      immune system. They bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm to the
      body. The antibody in this study was designed to bind to a marker located on colorectal
      cancer tumors. The antibody was originally made from mouse proteins, but was changed in the
      laboratory to be more like human antibodies. This study will investigate how IMMU-130 acts
      for the treatment of colorectal cancer. The study is mainly being done to see if IMMU-130 is
      safe.

             informed consent.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma.

          -  Stage IV (metastatic) disease.

          -  Failed at least one prior standard treatment regimen for colorectal cancer

          -  Adequate performance status (ECOG 0 or 1)

          -  Expected survival &gt; 6 months.

          -  CEA plasma levels &gt; 5 ng/mL

          -  Measurable disease by CT or MRI

          -  At least 4 weeks beyond major surgery and recovered from all acute toxicities

          -  At least 2 weeks beyond corticosteroids, except low doses (i.e., 20 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent) to treat nausea or other illness such as rheumatoid
             arthritis

          -  Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support (hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL, ANC &gt;
             1,500 per mm3, platelets &gt; 100,000 per mm3)

          -  Adequate renal and hepatic function (creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN, bilirubin ≤ IULN, AST
             and ALT ≤ 3.0 x IULN or 5 x IULN if know liver metastases).

          -  Otherwise, all toxicity at study entry &lt;Grade 1 by NCI CTC v4.0.

             period.

          -  Patient's with Gilbert's disease or known CNS Metastatic disease. However, patients
             with CNS metastases who are asymptomatic and have completed a course of therapy are
             eligible for the study provided they are clinically stable for 1 month prior to entry
             as defined as: (1) no evidence of new enlarging CNS metastasis (2) off steroids or on
             a stable dose of steroids

             may be included after the MTD is determined

          -  Patients with active grade 3 anorexia, nausea or vomiting, and/or signs of intestinal
             obstruction.
