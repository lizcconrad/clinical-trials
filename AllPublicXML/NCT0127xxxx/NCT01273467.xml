    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 42037788 (CNTO 0007)
      in patients who have suffered a stroke. The study is not designed to establish efficacy,
      although preliminary explorations will be conducted.

      This is a first-in-human (FIH) study of 42037788 (referred to as CNTO 0007), a cell therapy
      being tested to see if it may be useful in treating patients with ischemic cerebral
      infarction also known as stroke. Patients will be randomized (assigned by chance) to receive
      a single dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo (identical in appearance to CNTO 0007 but does not
      contain cells) by intravenous (IV) infusion (injection directly into a vein). Patients and
      study staff will not know if patients are assigned CNTO 0007 or the placebo. The study will
      be conducted in 2 stages (Stage A and Stage B). In Stage A, the highest dose of CNTO 0007
      that does not cause unacceptable side effects, referred to as the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) will be determined to and administered to patients in Stage B of the study. In Stage A,
      5 (up to 7) cohorts (groups) of 4-8 patients each will be administered a single IV infusion
      of CNTO 0007 or placebo 1-5 days (depending on cohort) after stroke (the first cohort of
      patients will receive the lowest dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo and each subsequent cohort will
      be administered a higher dose of CNTO 0007 or placebo until the MTD is determined). In Stage
      B, patients will be administered a single IV infusion of the MTD within a specified number of
      days after stroke.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke, as defined by the protocol (If a
             woman, must be postmenopausal, defined as having no menses for the 18 months before
             study start. Premenopausal, surgically-sterilized women must have a negative serum
             beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening before CNTO 0007 or
             placebo administration)

          -  Patients must be able to remain as inpatients for at least 3 days post-infusion for
             intensive safety monitoring

          -  Patients must receive standard post-stroke care before the infusion begins and after
             treatment with experimental product, including but not limited to appropriate
             secondary prevention measure such as blood pressure and cholesterol control and
             antiplatelet agents, unless contraindicated

          -  Patient must have no clinical evidence of worsening stroke in the last 24 hours prior
             to the start of the infusion of study treatment

          -  Patients must have general medical condition consistent with expected survival for at
             least 1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence or history of any clinically significant disease, medical condition, or
             treatment intervention as determined by the Investigator

          -  Need for supplementary oxygen for cardiorespiratory reasons or respirator dependency.
             If supplementary oxygen is not needed for cardiopulmonary reasons but given on a
             routine basis, it is not exclusionary

          -  Presence or history of alcohol or drug abuse as defined by the 4th edition of the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) within 1 year before
