      The main objective of the multi-centered collaborative study is to evaluate the accuracy,
      efficacy and clinical advantages of prenatal diagnosis using microarray analysis as compared
      with conventional karyotyping.

      Specifically, the aims are as follows:

        1. Demonstrate the performance of microarray analysis as a clinical method for prenatal
           cytogenetic diagnosis with regard to:

             1. Accuracy in the detection of the common autosomal and sex chromosomal aneuploid
                (trisomies, 13,18,21, 45,X, 47,XXY, etc.)

             2. Ability of microarray to diagnose less common, but clinically significant,
                cytogenetic aneusomies (e.g. DiGeorge, Williams, Smith- Magenis, Prader-Willi
                syndrome, etc.) currently not detected by conventional karyotype.

             3. Evaluation of the utility of microarray in specific clinical scenarios such as
                ultrasound detection of congenital anomalies and fetal growth disorders.

        2. Evaluate the appropriate construction of prenatal diagnostic microarray devices to allow
           maximal detection of clinically relevant information with minimal detection of
           unexpected and difficult to interpret findings which have no clinical significance but
           might provoke patient anxiety.

        3. Evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using microarrays as a primary
           prenatal diagnostic tool.

        4. Evaluate approaches to integrate microarray into clinical prenatal cytogenetic
           diagnostic practice.

        5. Develop a prenatal diagnostic tissue repository (TDR) to facilitate the further
           development of microarray technology. This will be used to investigate the molecular
           etiologies of specific fetal anomalies and to test newer technologies, such as higher
           resolution microarrays.

    <description>Microarray performed on prenatal specimen:
Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or other standardized tests such as qPCR or MLPA will be performed on the fetal sample to confirm abnormal MA findings of known and unknown clinical significance which are discordant with CC findings, including anomalies normally detected by karyotyping.
Microarray analysis of DNA from parental blood samples will be used to determine whether CNVs detected in a fetal sample are also present in a healthy parent, in which case no further evaluation will take place, moreover any finding in a fetus which is duplicated in a parental microarray is considered to be confirmed.</description>

      -  Additional 15 ml of amniotic fluid (minimum 10 ml) for amniocentesis

        -  Blood sample (10 ml) from each parent will be obtained in case of a need to test for
           suspected familial copy number variants (CNVs) or discrepant results, and also to
           evaluate for maternal cell contamination (patient's blood sample).

        A total of 4,400 prenatal diagnostic samples will be obtained from patients undergoing
        prenatal testing for standard indications. Patients will be recruited at participating
        prenatal diagnostic centers by designated study personnel; recruitment of patients will be
        initiated as a pilot study. These patients will not contribute to the final planned sample
        size of 4400 patients. Two sub-studies will then be initiated consisting of 250 (or more)
        patients enrolled with sufficient amniotic fluid sample and 250 (or more) patients with
        sufficient villus sample.
