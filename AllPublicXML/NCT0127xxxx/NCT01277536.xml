  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until now, no risk assessment model informing about the need of thromboprophylaxis in
      patients admitted for an acute medical event has been validated.

      The goal of this project is to indirectly validate a model developed in Geneva by a non
      -interventional study involving the collection of patient characteristics during the
      hospitalization and a 3-month follow-up. These data will allow for the determination of the
      patient's risk, according to the Geneva model, and its validity, according the actual
      thrombo-embolic events, corrected for the thromboprophylaxis received.

      The project is multicentric in Switzerland (5-10 centers) and should involve about 1000
      patients.

      First amendment (may 2011) : we have obtained the IRB approval for collecting data from
      patients who die during their hospital stay and for whom informed consent is not be possible
      to obtain.
