  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and the United States of America (USA).

      The aim of this trial is to investigate the potential of liraglutide to induce and maintain
      weight loss in overweight or obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Treatment will be added
      onto subject's pre-trial background diabetes treatment of either diet and exercise only or
      single compound oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) treatment (metformin, sulphonylurea [SU] or
      glitazone) or combination OAD treatment (metformin, sulphonylurea or glitazone). The duration
      of the trial will be 56 weeks followed by a 12 week observational follow-up period.
