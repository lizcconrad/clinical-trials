        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Accessible tumour tissue for vaccine production (extraction of tumour mRNA)
             i.e.subcutaneous or lymph node metastases.

          -  Must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Must have histologically confirmed advanced, metastatic cutaneous melanoma no longer
             amenable for surgery.

          -  Must have evidence of disease progression and measurable or evaluable metastases

          -  Must be ambulatory with a ECOG performance score of &lt;2

          -  Must have lab.values as following :

        ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L; platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L, Hb &gt; 9g/dL (&gt; 5.6 mmol/L). Creatinine &lt; 140
        Âµmol/L (1.6 mg/dL); if borderline, the creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min, Bilirubin &lt; 20%
        above the upper limit of normal, ASAT and ALAT &lt; 2.5 the upper limit of normal. Albumin &gt;
        2.5 g/L.

          -  Prior radiotherapy: A minimum of 4 weeks (8 weeks in case of extensive radiotherapy)
             must have elapsed between the end of the prior radiotherapy and entry into the
             protocol.

          -  Prior chemotherapy: A minimum 4 weeks must have elapsed between the end of the prior
             chemotherapy and entry into the protocol.

          -  Signed informed consent of the patients for the treatment and follow up must be
             obtained and documented according to the ICH-GCP Guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior malignancy other than melanoma, with the exception of curatively
             treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and ca. cervix stage 1B.

          -  Active infection requiring antibiotic therapy.

          -  Significant cardiac or other medical illness that would limit activity or survival,
             such as severe congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or serious cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          -  Autoimmune disease currently treated with steroids.

          -  Adverse reactions to vaccines such as anaphylaxis or other serious reactions.

          -  History of immunodeficiency or autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, juvenile
             onset insulin dependent diabetes, or a vasculitic syndrome.

          -  Chemotherapy or other potentially immune-suppressive therapy that has been
             administered within 4 weeks prior to vaccination.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Any reason why, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient should not
             participate.
