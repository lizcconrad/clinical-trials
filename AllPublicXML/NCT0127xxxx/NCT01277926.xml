      The purpose of this study is to characterize the current patterns of care for patients with
      hormone-receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer who have failed one prior endocrine therapy
      in Brazil. To investigate patient-related, disease-related and physician-related
      characteristics that correlate with the use of either endocrine treatment or chemotherapy in
      such patients. And to evaluate patients' understanding of the treatment options and their
      participation in the choice.
