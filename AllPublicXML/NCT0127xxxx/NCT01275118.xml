        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Status post bilateral cataract or refractive lens surgery (with or without LRI) and
             implantation of Tecnis™ Multifocal IOL or Crystalens™ AO Accommodating IOL

          -  Best-corrected ETDRS equivalent visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye

          -  Naturally dilated pupil size (in dim light) &gt; 3.5 mm (with no dilation medications)
             for both eyes

          -  Clear intraocular media (no posterior capsular opacification, or status post YAG
             capsulotomy)

          -  Availability, willingness, and sufficient cognitive awareness to comply with
             examination procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ocular disease which could potentially limit uncorrected visual acuity or visual
             performance.

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect visual outcomes

          -  Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase risk or confound study results
             (e.g. diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised, etc.)

          -  Uncontrolled systemic or ocular disease

          -  History of ocular trauma

          -  History of ocular surgery other than that required for inclusion in this study

          -  Amblyopia or strabismus

          -  Known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal changes that
             affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy, etc.)

          -  Diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or other retinal
             disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level of worse than
             20/30

          -  Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical
             intervention

          -  Capsule or zonular abnormalities that may affect postoperative centration or tilt of
             the lens (e.g. pseudoexfoliation syndrome)

          -  Pupil abnormalities (non-reactive, tonic pupils or abnormally shaped pupils)
