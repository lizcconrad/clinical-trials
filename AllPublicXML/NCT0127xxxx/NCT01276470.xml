      Background:

        -  Like other complex diseases, autoimmune diseases are the result of numerous causes,
           including genetic and environmental factors. Some researchers believe that people who
           are susceptible to autoimmune disorders develop them when the body reacts to
           environmental or other factors by creating white blood cells that attack the body s own
           tissues, which then progresses to autoimmune diseases. These immune-triggered disorders
           can overlap with one another to some extent, but most autoimmune diseases have certain
           distinct triggers.

        -  The autoimmune disorder myositis weakens the muscles and may cause other health
           problems. Environmental exposures associated with myositis include ultraviolet
           radiation, stressful life events and muscle overexertion, collagen implants, infections
           such as retroviruses and streptococci bacteria, and certain drugs and chemicals. Some
           individuals with myositis also produce proteins in the blood called autoantibodies that
           react with certain parts of the person s own cells, called synthetases, which are
           involved in making new proteins. A syndrome called the anti-synthetase syndrome, which
           includes myositis and lung disease, is associated with having the anti-synthetase
           autoantibodies. Researchers are interested in studying differences in environmental
           exposures in individuals with myositis. This study is being conducted to determine if
           persons with the anti-synthetase syndrome have had different environmental exposures
           before disease onset compared with other patients with myositis who do not have this
           syndrome and also compared with healthy volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether selected infectious and noninfectious environmental exposures are more
      common in individuals who have myositis with the anti-synthetase syndrome, compared with
      healthy volunteers.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals who have been diagnosed with myositis (with or without anti-synthetase
      autoantibodies), and healthy volunteers without autoimmune disorders.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, and
           will provide blood, urine and house dust samples.

        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their medical history and the types of
           exposures they have had at work, at home, and elsewhere. Participants who have myositis
           will also be asked about certain infections, heavy exercise or physical exertion, sun
           exposure, tobacco and alcohol use, and stressful events prior to being diagnosed with
           the disease. Healthy volunteers will be asked about the same exposures before the date
           of diagnosis of disease of the myositis subject to which they have been matched.

        -  Participants will receive a kit that contains instructions and a filter to be put onto
           their vacuum cleaner to collect house dust in the bedroom. This dust will be kept for
           possible future analyses of infectious or toxic agents based on the other results from
           the study.

        -  Individuals with myositis will have other tests as clinically indicated, including lung
           function tests and imaging studies.

      Most autoimmune diseases are thought to develop as a result of chronic immune activation and
      dysregulation after selected environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals.
      Based on prior studies suggesting roles for noninfectious and infectious agents in the
      development of myositis, as well as the known clinical, epidemiologic and genetic differences
      among phenotypes, we hypothesize that different myositis phenotypes are triggered by
      different environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals. One phenotype that
      is particularly well-defined clinically and genetically, and for which environmental triggers
      are likely, is myositis associated with anti-synthetase autoantibodies (defined as the
      anti-synthetase syndrome). These patients have an acute myositis onset in the spring of the
      year and also tend to develop fevers, elevated white blood cell counts, arthritis and
      interstitial lung disease. Although these features are consistent with an environmental
      trigger for the anti-synthetase syndrome, and although case reports and animal models suggest
      infectious or noninfectious agents may play a role, no study has systematically assessed
      environmental agents in this population.

      In collaboration with multiple centers, we plan to test the hypothesis that certain
      environmental exposures are associated with the anti-synthetase syndrome and differ from
      those seen in matched controls and in myositis patients without the anti-synthetase syndrome.
      The specific aims of this study are to: 1) determine whether selected noninfectious
      environmental exposures are more common preceding disease onset in 150 recent-onset (defined
      as within 24 months of meeting criteria for possible, probable or definite myositis) myositis
      patients with the anti-synthetase syndrome, compared with 150 control subjects without
      autoimmune disease (1:1 matched with the patients), and compared with 150 recent-onset
      myositis patients without the anti-synthetase syndrome; and 2) determine whether selected
      infectious agents can be detected more frequently in blood samples of recent-onset
      anti-synthetase syndrome patients compared with matched controls, and in blood or biopsy
      samples from recent-onset anti-synthetase myositis patients compared with recent-onset
      myositis patients without the anti-synthetase syndrome.

      Medical histories, concurrent conditions and environmental questionnaire information will be
      collected from all participants. Subjects will undergo a clinical, laboratory and immunologic
      assessment to document current diagnoses, disease manifestations and severity. A chest x-ray,
      high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, pulmonary function tests,
      bronchoalveolar lavage, and muscle and lung biopsies will be performed as clinically
      indicated. Blood DNA and RNA sera, biopsy and house dust repositories will be created for
      current and future investigations.

        The inclusion criteria for controls are:

          1. Friends or, if friends are not available, cousins of the anti-synthetase positive
             myositis patient, or, if friends or cousins are not available, volunteers from the
             general community (such as the NIH Normal volunteer program), gender- and age- (within
             5 years for minors and within 10 years for adults) matched, who is living as close as
             possible to the geographic area of the myositis patient.

          2. Controls should be without a recognized autoimmune disease or ILD.

          3. Able and willing to give informed consent, to complete the questionnaires and to
             donate blood samples (in case of children 2 years of age but &lt;18 years of age,
             parent/legal guardian must be willing and able to provide informed consent) and child
             must provide assent).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The exclusion criteria for myositis subjects are:

          1. Cancer-associated myositis (cancer diagnosed within 2 years of the diagnosis of
             myositis).

          2. Inclusion body myositis.

        HIV is not an exclusion for affected participants in this study for the two following
        reasons:

          -  It has no impact on study procedures or tests.

          -  It may be one of the viral risk factors we are investigating.
