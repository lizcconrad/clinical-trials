  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare two different types of breast surgery. In the first
      type, the doctor removes only the tumor. In the second type, the doctor removes the tumor and
      some of the tissue around the tumor called margins. The amount of breast tissue removed is
      similar. The removal of the tumor only has up to 40% chance of reoperation because the tumor
      is too close to the margin. The primary goal of this study is to see if the additional
      margins can decrease the need to return to the operating room. Both types of surgery are well
      accepted, and participating in the study would not give you a better chance to cure the
      cancer. At present, most breast surgeons remove the tumor without the additional margins. For
      all patients who have this operation, there is a high incidence of return to the operating
      room for margins re-excision: as many as 40% as patients can have a re-operation.

      At present, we do not know if taking the additional margins prevents the cancer from
      returning in the breast or not. If the cancer comes back in your breast, this is a recurrence
      and your breast will have to be removed (mastectomy).
