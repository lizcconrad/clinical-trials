    <textblock>
      Efavirenz, a commonly used HIV medication, may cause worsening vascular function and bone
      problems. The purpose of this study is to determine if switching efavirenz to raltegravir, a
      newer HIV medication, will improve vascular function and tests of bone health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an increasingly important comorbidity in HIV-infected
      patients. Our preliminary data suggests that efavirenz may worsen endothelial function, which
      in turn may increase the risk for future CVD events. Efavirenz has also been linked to lower
      vitamin D levels, which may in turn result in increased bone fragility. Raltegravir is not
      known to affect either endothelial function or vitamin D levels. Therefore, switching
      efavirenz to raltegravir in patients with suppressed HIV viremia may lead to improved
      outcomes.

             vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, aortic aneurysm, or otherwise known
             atherosclerotic disease).

          -  Diagnosed disease or process, besides HIV infection, associated with increased
             systemic inflammation (including, but not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosis,

             local reference range on most recent clinical assessment.

          -  History of hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism, even if treated.

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to nitroglycerin.

          -  Fever, defined as T ≥ 38.0C within 48 hours prior to screening.

        Note: Fever within 48 hours prior to each main study visit will require postponement of
        that study visit until the patient has defervesced (T &lt; 38.0C) for at least 48 hours;
        fevers continuing past the allowed study visit timeframe will result in study

            <groups_desc>We assumed that the declines in FMD seen with TDF/FTC/EFV in our previous study would fully reverse. Thus, the clinically relevant effect size to be detected for FMD change was +3.12% (SD 4%) in those switching from EFV to RAL. Using a two-sample, independent, two-tailed t-test with 5% type I error and 20% type II error, a sample size of 13 per group would be needed to find a difference in FMD between groups. Allowing for a 10% dropout rate, we planned to recruit 15 subjects per group.</groups_desc>
