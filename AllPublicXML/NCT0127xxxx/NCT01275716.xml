  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this research study have Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). This occurs when there is
      a build-up of fatty material in the wall of the heart arteries that causes narrowing of the
      arteries. This could lead to chest pain, a heart attack, weakening of the heart and/or
      permanent damage to the heart. As part of their normal routine care, subjects had or will
      have a Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) to restore the blood flow in the arteries of
      their heart. During a PCI procedure, pictures are taken of the arteries before and after the
      treatment of the narrowing in the arteries. These pictures are acquired through angiography
      which is a way to produce X-ray pictures of the inside of arteries.

      After a PCI procedure, there is a possibility for narrowing of the arteries to return. The
      likelihood of this happening can be greatly reduced by lifestyle changes and adhering to
      heart medication regimens. It is part of normal, routine care for CAD patients to be given
      written and verbal information on how to lead a heart healthy lifestyle and to take heart
      medications properly.

      In this research study, the investigators will show half of the patients their before and
      after images of their heart arteries where the narrowing occurred and was treated. The other
      half of the patients will not be shown these images. Both groups will still receive
      information about lifestyle and medications as part of their normal, routine care. At the end
      of this study, the investigators will compare both groups to see if there are any differences
      in making lifestyle changes and taking heart medications properly. Additionally, the
      investigators would also like to see if there are any resulting differences in the amount of
      hearts attacks or other heart related medical events.

    <description>Subjects will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to a study group. One group will be given before and after treatment pictures of their affected heart arteries. The other group will not be shown these pictures. Both groups will still receive written and verbal information about living a heart healthy lifestyle and taking heart medications properly as part of their normal routine care.</description>
