  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open controlled trial in which naïve HIV-1 patients will be randomized
      to receive atazanavir / ritonavir or darunavir / ritonavir in combination with tenofovir /
      emtricitabine. They will be followed up during 96 weeks to determinate the cholesterol
      levels.

      Randomization will be stratified according to the values of the ratio of total
      cholesterol/HDL cholesterol obtained during the screening visit (as they will be &lt;4.5 or ≥
      4.5).
