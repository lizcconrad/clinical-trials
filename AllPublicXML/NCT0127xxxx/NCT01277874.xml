    <textblock>
      This study will seek to enroll neonates requiring Nasal Continuous Airway Pressure (NCPAP)
      respiratory support and randomize them to either oscillatory (Osc-NCPAP, study group) or
      non-oscillatory (NCPAP, control group) mode. The goal of the research is to determine if
      Osc-NCPAP provides improved ventilation support compared to routine NCPAP, i.e. NCPAP without
      oscillations. This will be measured by need for change to ventilator support, improvement in
      pCO2 values, and reduction in respiratory rate and frequency of apnea during the period of
      NCPAP treatment. Other respiratory outcomes will also be compared, including time on NCPAP,
      time on High-Flow Nasal Cannula support following NCPAP, and time-averaged PiO2 from start of
      study to end of respiratory treatment.
