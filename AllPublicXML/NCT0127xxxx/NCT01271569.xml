    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of
      Fospropofol disodium up to a dose producing maximal hypnotic effect as defined by
      electroencephalogramderived assessment (Bispectral Index [BIS]) and to compare the dynamic
      properties of PropofolF to those of Propofol.

      After local ethics committee (West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China)
      approval and written informed consent were obtained, 80 healthy volunteers (40 males and 40
      females) aged between 18 and 45 yr were included. For 1 week before the study, subjects were
      to follow a diet with limited amounts of alcohol and caffeine. Ingestion of caffeine,
      alcohol, products containing aspartame (aspartame may increase formate concentrations), or
      use of paracetamol within 24 h before study drug administration resulted in ineligibility.
      Exclusion criteria included hypersensitivity to any anesthetic; known or suspected serious
      disorders and/or significant dysfunction; an abnormal, clinically significant ECG finding;
      participation in an investigational drug study within the previous month; known or suspected
      pregnancy; anatomical malformations expected to produce a difficult intubation and known or
      suspected history or family history of malignant hyperthermia.
