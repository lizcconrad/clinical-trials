    <textblock>
      The 3 Specific Aims are (1) To determine the prevalence, incidence and severity of oral
      conditions in postmenopausal early stage breast cancer survivors within the first 18 months
      of adjuvant Aromatase Inhibitor(AI) therapy, (2) To determine the oral health quality of life
      among postmenopausal early stage breast cancer survivors who are receiving AI therapy, (3) To
      determine the utilization of dental care among postmenopausal women receiving AIs with a
      history of early stage BCa over time. The hypothesis for this pilot study is that AIs
      negatively impact oral health and oral health quality of life in the setting of breast cancer
      survivors. Further, we hypothesize that dental visits are underutilized in women with BCa
      undergoing adjuvant AI therapy.

      This is a 2 arm prospective study. PM women receiving breast care, with and without breast
      cancer, at the University of Michigan are eligible. The study procedures include:
      survey/questionnaires, oral exam performed at Michigan Center for Oral Health Research
      (MCOHR) with specimen collection, and medical chart review. The goal of this study is to
      collect dental data and oral health quality of life data on women who are receiving AI
      therapy. This study does not administer any treatments or drugs to participants.

    <description>Diagnosis of BCa- Histologic confirmed diagnosis of BCa: Stage 0, I, II, or III with no evidence of metastatic disease.
Treatment- AI as clinically indicated (AI may be anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole). Subjects may have had prior tamoxifen or raloxifene. Subjects may have had chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Must be within the first year of consecutive AI therapy. If a subject started AI, discontinued, then restarted, they will be accepted into the study as long as the past therapy did not exceed 12 months and the current therapy has not exceeded 12 months.</description>

                  in the postmenopausal range

               -  If taking tamoxifen or toremifene and age less then 60y, then FSH and plasma
                  estradiol level in postmenopausal ranges71.

          -  Individuals capable of consenting and self administering the survey instrument.
