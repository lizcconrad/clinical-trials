  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to measure what percentage of women who suspect they have
      symptoms of ADHD will go on to be diagnosed with ADHD using accepted practice standards. The
      study will also evaluate the influence education on the genetics of ADHD has on a woman in
      her deciding to receive behavioral health treatment for ADHD.

    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 10-12% of school-aged
      children in the United States, making it one of the most common psychiatric disorders in
      children. It is characterized as inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, which has
      persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with
      developmental level (DSM-IV-TR). ADHD is a non-fluctuating illness unlike many other
      psychiatric co-morbid conditions.
