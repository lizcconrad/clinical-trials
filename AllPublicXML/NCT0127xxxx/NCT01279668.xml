  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent cough is a common symptom, accounting for about 20% of referrals to outpatient
      chest clinics. Most coughs are caused by self-limiting viral infections such as the common
      cold. However, 1 in 4 people with a viral infection develop a persistent cough, which can go
      on for several weeks. Whooping cough is a common cause of persistent cough in young people
      and adults. Although the whooping cough vaccine gives lifelong protection against severe
      infection, it does not appear to give such long-term protection against milder infections,
      which can make someone cough for many weeks. There are currently no proven efficacious
      treatments for persistent cough following either a viral infection or infection with whooping
      cough.

      Montelukast is a medication which is already licensed for the treatment of asthma. It works
      by blocking the action of chemicals called leukotrienes, which make the airways of people
      with asthma inflamed and sensitive. There is strong evidence to suggest that leukotrienes are
      also involved in causing persistent cough following viral or whooping cough infection.
      Montelukast may therefore also help settle persistent coughs in these settings.

      Over 18 months, we will recruit patients aged 16-49 years with a cough lasting 2-8 weeks from
      general practices in England. An oral fluid sample will be taken from each participant to be
      tested for whooping cough. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive a 28-day course
      of montelukast or placebo tablets and asked to complete a daily cough diary for two weeks.
      They will be assessed after two weeks by their GP (face-to-face) and after four weeks by
      another member of practice clinical staff (telephone). Some participants will be given a
      24-hour cough monitor to wear on study entry and at two-week follow-up. This study will be
      funded by the National Institute for Health Research's School of Primary Care.
