  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study have been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and their doctors have
      referred them for an exercise test as part of their normal, routine care. The exercise test
      will either be a treadmill test or a 6 minute walk test. During a treadmill test, a patient
      typically walks on a treadmill while their heart is monitored using an electrocardiogram,
      which records the electrical activity of the heart through 10 small electrode patches
      attached to the skin of the chest, arms and legs. Additionally, heart rate and blood pressure
      are monitored throughout the test. A 6-Minute Walk test requires patients to walk for up to 6
      minutes to determine how far they can go in order to measure the heart function related to
      exercise.

      The purpose of this study is to measure internal heart pressures using a device called
      Noninvasive Cardiac Output Monitoring (NICOM) during an exercise test. Normally heart
      pressures are measured during invasive (meaning that doctors have to go inside the body using
      a needle or surgery) heart procedures. The NICOM device is non-invasive which means the
      investigators do not have to go inside the body to obtain the heart pressure measurements. In
      this study, the investigators will evaluate the non-invasive measurements provided by the
      NICOM device during the exercise test and see how it relates to information from some of
      subjects' past heart procedures. This research is being done to devise better, less invasive
      ways to assess disease severity, track disease progression and evaluate response to therapy.

      The NICOM device is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to measure heart
      pressures. This device is usually used when a patient can't undergo a right heart
      catheterization. In this study, the investigators are using the device to gather heart
      pressure measurements for research during the exercise test that is scheduled as part of the
      subjects' normal, routine care. The research data is being used to devise better, less
      invasive ways to assess disease severity, track disease progression and evaluate response to
      therapy. The NICOM device is made by Cheetah Medical.
