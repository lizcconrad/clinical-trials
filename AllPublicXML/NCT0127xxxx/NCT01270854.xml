  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intravenous salt solution called
      &quot;Plasmalyte&quot; causes less abnormality of the body's acid levels than a solution called &quot;Normal
      Saline.&quot;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrolyte-containing intravenous fluids are routinely administered to patients in the first
      few hours after acute traumatic injury. Although Normal Saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is
      commonly used in this setting, it causes a hyperchloremic acidosis that may exacerbate
      metabolic derangements that occur after acute injury. Plasmalyte A is a solution that more
      closely matches physiologic electrolyte levels. In this study, we will evaluate whether
      Plasmalyte A results in less disturbance of the base deficit 24 hours following traumatic
      injury than does Normal Saline.
