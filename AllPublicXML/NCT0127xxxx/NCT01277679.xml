  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to establish a model for the evaluation of drug targets using
      postural measures to induce changes in lung water concentration as assessed by MRI. A
      reduction in the magnitude and rate of water transudation with postural changes in patients
      with congestive heart failure (CHF) could provide a model for the evaluation of various
      classes of molecules for target validation and for dose selection.
