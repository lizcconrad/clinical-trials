  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized and controlled study is proposed to establish whether an enteral
      nutrition support regimen based on pressurized whey protein and glucose improves the
      postoperative utilization of amino acid substrates compared to a drink based on glucose
      alone. The kinetics of protein metabolism (protein breakdown, protein synthesis and amino
      acid oxidation) will be investigated using stable isotope methodology before and after
      surgery in patients undergoing colon resection. Stable isotope infusions will be conducted
      one week before surgery and on the second postoperative day for two hours in the fasted state
      and for four hours while sipping the enteral nutrition support regimen. Patients will consume
      one of two enteral nutrition support regimens consisting of a drink containing either
      pressurized whey protein and glucose or glucose alone. It is hypothesized that an enteral
      nutrition support regimen based on pressurized whey protein and glucose promotes positive
      protein balance through increased protein synthesis or reduced protein breakdown compared to
      glucose alone.
