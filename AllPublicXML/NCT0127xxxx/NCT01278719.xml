  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal polyp is a significant health problem with a prevalence of 4%. It is increased in
      patients with asthma (7-15%), Cystic fibrosis (39-56%) or aspirin intolerance (36-96%).The
      quality of life (QOL) is worse than in patients suffering from hypertension, migraine, angina
      pectoris and head &amp; neck cancer as per a previous study by Videler WJM et al.QOL is in
      comparison to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The reason why it develops in some and
      not in others remains unknown despite the disease being present for centuries.A definite
      relationship exists in patients with 'Sampter triad': Asthma, non steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug sensitivity and nasal polyps. But not all patients with NSAID sensitivity have nasal
      polyps and vice verse.

      Etiology is largely unknown despite the disease being present for centuries. Although the
      factors like wood stove exposure, smoking, allergic rhinitis, rhino sinusitis have been
      strongly implicated in literature from various studies, most data available is on ethmoidal
      polyps.The present study is an attempt to study the association of important risk factors
      with both antrochoanal(AC) and ethmoidal nasal polyps(EP).One study found that a
      significantly smaller proportion of the population with polyps were smokers compared to the
      unselected population (15% v/s 35%). But this is not confirmed by other studies.

      Seven percent of asthma patients have nasal polyps and in non atopic asthma and late onset
      asthma, polyps are diagnosed more frequently (10-15%).Eosinophil numbers are significantly
      higher in nasal polyp tissue and further increased in patients with co-morbid asthma and
      aspirin sensitivity.

      Nasal colonization in increased amounts was found by Staphylococcus aureus and presence of
      specific Immunoglobulin E directed against S.aureus enterotoxins was found. Rates of
      colonization and IgE presence in nasal polyp tissue were increased in subjects with nasal
      polyp associated with co-morbid asthma and aspirin sensitivity.

      Nasal polyps are frequently found to run in families, suggesting a hereditary or with shared
      environmental factor. In the study by Rugina et al., more than half of 224 nasal polyp
      patients (52%) had a positive family history while the study by Greisener et.al, reported 14%
      of family history strongly suggesting hereditary factors in the pathogenesis of nasal polyps.

      Some studies have found environmental factors like smoking and those using wood stove as a
      primary source of heating with the development of nasal polyps. The studies are contrasting.

      There is presently a need of understanding the differences in the pathogenesis of
      antrochoanal polyp and ethmoidal nasal polyp clearly.There are hardly any concrete research
      performed on them to note the differences in the etiology and their pathogenesis. Hence the
      study is undertaken to extensively study the etiologies responsible for them and to note the
      differences.

      The present study involves two parts. A case control study wherein the association of nasal
      polyps with various risk factors like smoking, wood stove exposure, allergic rhinitis, non
      vegetarian diet intake, rhino sinusitis, deviated nasal septum, occupational dust exposure
      and eosinophilia.This will be studied individually for antrochoanal and ethmoidal nasal
      polyps.Again the same will be studied with respect to the recurrent and non recurrent polyps.

      A descriptive study focuses on the nasal polyp occurrence with respect to the age, sex,
      religion, socioeconomic status, urban or rural preponderance,overcrowding, aspirin
      intolerance, family history etc.

      The results will be studies after calculating the odds ratio and the chi square test for
      whatever data is available. Interpretation will be performed subsequently.

      Gene expression profiling would be performed to study the differences in gene expression
      levels between AC and EP s with respect to risk factors and morphological
      characteristics.Mutational analysis will be performed to identify mutations in selected
      genes.
