  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A crossover study to assess the effect of repeated doses of fostamatinib on the levels of
      oral contraceptive (Microgynon® 30) in the blood of healthy female subjects. The study will
      consist of a screening period of up to 35 days, followed by 2 treatment periods (28 days
      each) of an oral contraceptive (Microgynon® 30) in the absence and presence of fostamatinib.
      The study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of fostamatinib in combination with
      an oral contraceptive
