  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators know that treatment for prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction can impact
      sexual health and quality of life. They want to learn how the treatment affects one's
      emotional and social well-being.

      They have developed a new type of counseling. Cancer patients seek counseling for lots of
      reasons. It often helps them cope because they can express their feelings with a trained
      professional. They hope that this counseling will teach patients skills that they can use to
      comply with erectile treatment programs, improve their sexual health and quality of life.
      These skills may also improve physical and emotional well-being. As part of this study they
      will ask the patient to provide feedback on the proposed counseling.

    <description>Baseline Assessment which is 90-minute patient focus group interviews. SMRP, provided to all participating patients, consists of the following steps: 1) An introductory visit with SMRP Director, Dr. Mulhall, to orient the patient to post-surgery erectile rehabilitation and assess the patient‟s success with PDE-5 inhibitors; 2) Penile injection training provided by a NP over two visits, with follow-up calls as necessary until injection method and dose are deemed correct; 3) Follow-up visits with Dr. Mulhall every 4 months to monitor progress with rehabilitation. Study assessments will be administered at baseline, at 4-8 months post baseline (follow up 1) and 4-8- months post follow up 1 (follow up 2).</description>
