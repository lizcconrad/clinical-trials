    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long term use
      with Lyrica in medical practice. Also, occurrence of unknown and known adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs) in subjects treated with Lyrica will be monitored during the survey period, and
      whether an additional treatment outcome investigation and/or a post-marketing clinical study
      is required in the future will be determined.

    <description>The CGI-C scale measures a physician's global impression of a participant's clinical condition at final visit in terms of change relative to the start of treatment (CGI-C). At final visit, the participants CGI-C will be categorized into a three point scale as: improvement: CGI response of very much improved, much improved or minimally improved; no change: CGI response of no change; worsening: CGI response of very much worse, much worse or minimally worse</description>

Frequency and duration are according to Package Insert as follows. &quot;The usual adult dosage for oral use begins at 150 mg/day of pregabalin in twice daily, and should be gradually increased to 300 mg/day over 1 week or more and should be orally administered twice daily. Dosage should be adjusted, depending on age or symptoms. However, the daily maximum dose should not be beyond 600 mg, and should be orally administered twice daily&quot;.</description>
