  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label clinical trial to evaluate the safety of Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus GG (LGG) in elderly subjects. Lactobacilli are part of the normal flora of the
      intestine. LGG is one of several strains of Lactobacilli that is used as a probiotic or
      microorganism administered to confer &quot;health benefits&quot;. Our research is focused on studying
      the possible therapeutic effects of LGG. The study hypotheses are:

        -  LGG administered twice daily will be safe and well tolerated in elderly subjects

        -  LGG will colonize the stool of elderly subjects and will modify the diversity and
           richness of the microbiota in their nasopharyngeal and stool specimens
