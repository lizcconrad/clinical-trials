      The aim of the study is to assess current practice within PROP &amp; lung teams, for treating
      asymptomatic patients with centrally located non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to
      observe outcomes for those patients receiving immediate or deferred RT. This is a prospective
      cohort trial. Patients will be managed by immediate radiotherapy (RT) or a deferred approach
      according to physicians' individual current clinical practice. Baseline and follow-up data
      collection will be structured to focus on patient-reported measures to describe clinical
      outcomes in the two management groups. Indications for prescribing RT and dose fractionation
      schedules will also be collected. A new intervention will not be introduced during this
      trial. Instead, a follow-up regimen will be offered to both groups of patients, so that RT
      can be offered to the deferred group of patients if/when symptoms develop, and we can monitor
      symptoms/toxicities and QoL in both groups of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC

          -  Central disease, as defined by tumour (either primary or nodal disease) arising or
             extending within a 2cm circumferential expansion from the centre of the trachea or
             within the zone of the proximal bronchial tree

          -  Disease is visible on thoracic CT (diagnostic or simulation)

          -  Asymptomatic from intra-thoracic tumour (may have background chest symptoms related to
             underlying COAD etc, but these symptoms must not have worsened due to tumour)

          -  Patient (due to age or co-morbidities) or tumour (due to locally advanced or
             metastatic disease) is not suitable for radical treatment (defined as surgery or RT
             dose &gt;50Gy in 20 fractions or equivalent).

          -  Previous chemotherapy, thoracic RT or surgery is allowed

          -  RT to other metastases (e.g. brain, bone etc) is allowed

             •≥ 18 years of age

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intra-thoracic disease is peripheral only, not extending within 2cm of
             trachea/proximal bronchial tree

          -  Symptomatic from intra-thoracic NSCLC

          -  Histological diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, or malignant mediastinal
             lymphadenopathy from another malignancy (not NSCLC)
