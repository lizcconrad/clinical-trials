  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast for Success is a new direct service program focused on overcoming barriers to
      breastfeeding for low-income inner-city mothers by use of a culturally competent and
      home-based educational and support intervention. Key project components include a new
      Enhanced Breastfeeding Curriculum with brief engaging health literacy focused modules, and
      two innovative support plans, the Breastfeeding Doula and Father Support Programs. The
      objective is to increase breastfeeding rates for high-risk inner-city mothers.

      Research Questions to evaluate project feasibility and effectiveness are:

        1. Were all aspects of the Curriculum and Doula and Father Support Programs implemented?

        2. Is there an increase in the rate of any breastfeeding at 1 month postpartum for all
           mothers?

        3. Is there a difference in the rate of any breastfeeding at 1 month postpartum between
           interventions (Curriculum only, Curriculum+Doula Support, Curriculum+Father Support)?

        4. What are exclusive breastfeeding rates at 1, 3 and 6 months for all mothers?

      Low rates of breastfeeding among low-income inner-city mothers represent a challenging health
      disparity that adversely impacts child and maternal health. The overall objective of Breast
      for Success is to increase the rates of breastfeeding initiation, continuation and
      exclusivity among high-risk mothers in the City of Cleveland via home-based culturally
      appropriate interventions. Key project components include a new Curriculum with brief
      engaging modules utilizing games, teach-reteach strategies, and interactive learning to
      address specific barriers identified in focus groups (e.g. pain, low milk supply, breast
      &quot;myths&quot;), and two innovative support components, the Breastfeeding Doula and Father Support
      Programs. Breast for Success was developed in collaboration with and will be disseminated in
      partnership with the Cleveland Department of Public Health MomsFirst initiative (a Healthy
      Start Program), which delivers comprehensive services including twice-monthly Community
      Health Worker home visits prenatally through 2 years postpartum to 500 women annually. The
      investigators will measure program success via participation logs, satisfaction
      questionnaires and breastfeeding rates at 1, 3 and 6 months postpartum.
