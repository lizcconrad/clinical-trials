  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if behavioral health coaching for rural veterans
      with diabetes and depression will improve self-management behaviors and lead to improvement
      in diabetes care outcomes (e.g., HA1C) and improvement in reported depressive symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The co-occurence of diabetes and depression is highly prevalent and has dramatic consequences
      for quality of life and health. Due to the complex interrelation between diabetes and
      depression, patients often experience both psychological and physiological difficulties.
      These comorbid problems demand focused interventions that blend physical and emotional health
      treatments with self-management strategies.Rural-dwelling veterans with diabetes and
      depression are typically treated in community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). Patients with
      diabetes in rural areas tend to have more problems controlling their blood sugar, blood
      pressure and cholesterol compared to urban patients; thereby increasing their risk of
      diabetic complications. Similarly, rural patients with depression have similar barriers to
      care that increase their risk of poorer health outcomes as well. Using behavioral health
      coaches (BHCs)to deliver telephone-mediated therapies may enhance the reach of treatments for
      co-occurring diabetes and depression. The implementation of such treatments requires the
      development and testing of therapeutic manuals and BHC training protocols to ensure
      standardization and effectiveness. The BHC intervention has been labeled Health Outcomes
      through Patient Empowerment (HOPE) and will be offered to eligible patients receiving care
      through MEDVAMC and its CBOCs. Preliminary data obtained through this pilot grant is to
      support a larger VA grant.

    <description>The full name of the measure is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. This is a self-reported measure of depressive symptoms. This is a nine item measure with a response for each item between 0-3. Total scores on this measure range from 0-27, with 0 being a minimum indicating no depressive symptoms, and 27 being the maximum number and severity of depressive symptoms. The coaching sessions take place over approximately 3 months -- outcomes are measured at baseline, 3 months and again at 6 months. Change from baseline to 3 months was calculated. Then change from baseline to 6 months was calculated.</description>
