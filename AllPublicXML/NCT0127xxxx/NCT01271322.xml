      Prospective, single-center, nonrandomized, explorative imaging study evaluating the value of
      PET as a predictor of histopathological response in metabolic non-responders Patients with
      resectable AEG (adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction) type I and II (cT3/4 and/or
      cN+ and cM0)

      Metabolic non-responders, showing a &lt;35% decrease of SUV (standardized uptake value) two
      weeks after the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible for the study and are taken to
      intensified taxane-based RCT (radiochemotherapy) before surgery. 18FDG-PET scans will be
      performed before (=Baseline) and after 14 days of standard neoadjuvant therapy as well after
      the first cycle of Taxotere/Cisplatin chemotherapy (=PET1) and at the end of intensified
      radiochemotherapy (PET2).

      Tracer uptake will be assessed semiquantitatively using standardized uptake values (SUV). The
      percentage difference Delta SUV=100(SUVBaseline-SUVPET1)/ SUVBaseline will be calculated and
      assessed as an early predictor of histopathological response. In a secondary analysis, the
      association between the difference SUVPET1 - SUVPET2 and histopathological response will be
      evaluated.

      The HICON trial is a prospective, single-center, nonrandomized, explorative imaging study
      evaluating the value of PET (Positron emission tomography) as a predictor of
      histopathological response in metabolic non-responders Patients with resectable AEG
      (adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction) type I and II, staged cT3/4 and/or cN+ and
      cM0 by endoscopic ultrasound, spiral CT or MRI and FDG-PET are eligible. Tumors must be
      potentially R0 resectable and must have a sufficient FDG-baseline uptake. Only metabolic
      non-responders, showing a &lt;35% decrease of SUV (standardized uptake value) two weeks after
      the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are eligible for the study and are taken to intensified
      taxane-based RCT (chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy) before surgery. 18FDG-PET scans will be performed
      before (=Baseline) and after 14 days of standard neoadjuvant therapy as well after the first
      cycle of Taxotere/Cisplatin chemotherapy (=PET1) and at the end of intensified
      radiochemotherapy (PET2). Tracer uptake will be assessed semiquantitatively using
      standardized uptake values (SUV). The percentage difference Delta
      SUV=100(SUVBaseline-SUVPET1)/ SUVBaseline will be calculated and assessed as an early
      predictor of histopathological response. In a secondary analysis, the association between the
      difference SUVPET1 - SUVPET2 and histopathological response will be evaluated..
