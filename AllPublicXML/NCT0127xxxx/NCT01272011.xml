      Change to Reflect What Was Done and reason Changes Were Made.

      The purpose of this study is to determine (1) if a specific breathing treatment (intermittent
      hypoxia) can promote changes in breathing function and (2) if pairing breathing treatments
      (hypoxia) with locomotor training can enhance the benefits of walking recovery observed with
      locomotor training alone (without breathing treatments).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a very disabling health problem. Paralysis and paresis of limb
      and trunk muscles are major consequences of SCI and result in the inability to walk or
      difficulty walking. The most commonly stated goal by individuals with SCI during
      rehabilitation is the desire to walk again. Locomotor training (LT) that uses a body-weight
      support system and treadmill (BWST) is a task-specific rehabilitation intervention that
      allows practice of walking at normal speeds while loading the lower extremities, facilitating
      upright posture, and hip extension. Substantial improvement in ambulation can occur following
      locomotor training (LT) in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI).
      Despite these advances in activity-dependent rehabilitation, a need exists for defining
      complementary strategies that further amplify endogenous neuroplasticity. The proposed study
      will assess the therapeutic potential of (1) a respiratory training intervention (acute
      intermittent hypoxia, or AIH) on breathing function and (2) a combined locomotor (LT) and
      respiratory (AIH) training intervention for enhancing walking recovery.

    <measure>Minute Ventilation - Phase 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- versus Post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Minute ventilation (Ve) is the volume of gas inhaled or exhaled from a person's lungs per minute. Minute ventilation during the end-recovery (ER) period at initial (i.e., Days 1 and 2, initial ER period) and final (i.e., Days 9 and 10, final ER period) days of the IH protocol were normalized to values from baseline with elevated carbon dioxide (B2) within each individual session to characterize daily effects of exposure to IH at the beginning and end of treatment. Values from baseline with elevated carbon dioxide and the ER period during the final days of the protocol (final B2 and final ER period, respectively) also were normalized to elevated carbon dioxide baseline during initial days of the protocol (initial B2) to describe the cumulative effects of repeated exposure to IH. Outcomes are reported as % increases in minute ventilation during initial and final treatment sessions for daily/acute effects and cumulative/chronic effects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ventilatory Loading - Phase 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- versus Post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Ventilatory load compensation was assessed in two ways. Mean slopes for (1) pressure vs. resistance (P vs R) and (2) airflow vs. resistance (AF vs R) were calculated for pre- and post-IH treatment.</description>

        <title>Minute Ventilation - Phase 2</title>
        <description>Minute ventilation (Ve) is the volume of gas inhaled or exhaled from a person's lungs per minute. Minute ventilation during the end-recovery (ER) period at initial (i.e., Days 1 and 2, initial ER period) and final (i.e., Days 9 and 10, final ER period) days of the IH protocol were normalized to values from baseline with elevated carbon dioxide (B2) within each individual session to characterize daily effects of exposure to IH at the beginning and end of treatment. Values from baseline with elevated carbon dioxide and the ER period during the final days of the protocol (final B2 and final ER period, respectively) also were normalized to elevated carbon dioxide baseline during initial days of the protocol (initial B2) to describe the cumulative effects of repeated exposure to IH. Outcomes are reported as % increases in minute ventilation during initial and final treatment sessions for daily/acute effects and cumulative/chronic effects.</description>
