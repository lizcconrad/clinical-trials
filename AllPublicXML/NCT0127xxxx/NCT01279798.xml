  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol designed to make Lucanix® available to subjects with
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are not eligible for the Phase III Protocol,
      NR001-03. A total of 45 patients will be enrolled into the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to increase the overall survival of the study subjects
      by providing expanded access to Lucanix. Overall survival and progression-free survivals will
      be compared with historical controls.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  Evaluate the best overall tumor response.

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS).

        -  Evaluate treatment toxicity.

          -  All subjects who have received two (2) or more regimens of therapy must have received
             the last anti-cancer therapy at least one (1) month prior to enrollment.

          -  Performance status (ECOG) ≤ 2

          -  Absolute granulocyte count ≥ 1,500/mm3

             bacterial, viral, or fungal infections), or other conditions which, in the opinion of
             the investigator would compromise protocol objectives.
