  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a first-in-human pilot of a novel anti-cancer strategy: Metnase
      inhibition to potentiate DNA damaging chemotherapy. The investigators will conduct serial
      tumor biopsies in subjects with HNSCC at three timepoints: baseline, after cisplatin, and
      after cisplatin-raltegravir. The investigators will investigate immunohistochemical
      expression changes of Î³H2AX, Chk2, and Annexin V, three biomarkers of DNA damage and
      apoptosis. The study is designed to identify an intermediate signal of the potentiation of
      cisplatin chemotherapy by raltegravir in HNSCC, which will justify a future phase I/II study.

    <description>Preliminary clinical activity of the combination of raltegravir and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in HNSCC will be measured by RECIST criteria.

Response rate after 3 cycles will be reported as applicable.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. All
             primary sites are eligible, including keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (WHO grade
             1 or 2) and carcinoma of unknown primary.

          -  Either the primary site or a metastatic locoregional tumor deposit (eg. lymph node,
             parotid gland, subcutaneous nodule) must be amenable to repeat, in-office biopsy by a
             head and neck surgeon.

          -  The patient must be considered an appropriate candidate for cisplatin chemotherapy by
             a medical oncologist. Acceptable indications include induction chemotherapy prior to
             surgery or radiation for localized disease, or palliative chemotherapy for advanced
             disease.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function, defined as an absolute peripheral granulocyte count of
             greater than 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3 and absence
             of a regular red blood cell transfusion requirement.

          -  Adequate hepatic function with a total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dl; SGOT and SGPT less
             than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 times the
             upper limit of normal.

          -  Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 55 mL/min. Creatinine clearance will be
             estimated by the Cockraft-Gault formula, using actual body weight.

          -  During the first two weekly cycles of cisplatin and raltegravir, patients may receive
             no other concurrent antineoplastic therapy, including chemotherapy, biologic agents or
             radiotherapy. For subsequent induction or palliative chemotherapy cycles, patients may

             specified in this protocol.

          -  History of hypersensitivity reaction to cisplatin.

          -  Patient with known HIV disease.

          -  Any comorbid condition which would preclude full compliance with the protocol.

          -  Patient is less than 3 years free from another malignancy, except: a) if the other
             malignancy is non-melanomatous skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ or b) if the
             other primary malignancy is considered clinically insignificant and is requiring no
