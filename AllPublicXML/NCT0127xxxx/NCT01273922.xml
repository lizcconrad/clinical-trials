  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is a first-in-human Phase 1 study
      using two dose levels of an investigational vaccine directed against S. aureus and Candida.
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the
      investigational vaccine, NDV-3

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies in mice have established that several members of the Als family of
      proteins induce a protective immune response in mice and allow high survival rates following
      challenge with highly virulent doses of either Candida or S. aureus. Als3 (the antigen in the
      NDV-3 investigational vaccine) is the most effective member of the Als protein family in
      protecting mice from challenge with either Candida or S. aureus. This Phase I study will
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a two doses administered 6 months apart of NDV-3
      vaccine at two dose levels. At least 40 subjects will be enrolled in the study in two groups
      of approximately 20 subjects each. Each group will be randomized so that 15 will receive
      NDV-3 vaccine and 5 will receive placebo. All injections will be administered
      intramuscularly. One group will receive a low dose of NDV-3 and the other a ten-fold higher
      dose. Subjects will have follow-up visits to assess the safety, tolerability and immune
      responses at days 3, 7, 14, 28, 90 and 180 after the first vaccination to compare to baseline
      levels and at days 7, 14 and 90 after the second vaccination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed of the nature of the study and have agreed to and are able to read, review,
             and sign the informed consent document prior to screening. The informed consent
             document will be written in English, therefore the subject must have the ability to
             read and communicate in English.

          2. Completed the screening process within 30 days prior to dosing.

          3. Healthy male and female subjects 18-50 years of age, inclusive, at the time of dosing.

          4. No clinically significant deviation from normal as judged by the investigator(s) in
             the medical history, physical examination (including but may not be limited to an
             evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous
             systems), vital sign assessments, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory
             assessments, and by general observations.
