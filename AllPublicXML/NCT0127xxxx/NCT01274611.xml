    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two methods in the treatment of
      excessive underarm sweating (axillary hyperhidrosis): suction-curettage and Botox injections.
      Suction-curettage is a method in which the doctor will insert a suction tool into two small
      incisions in order to suction out the sweat-producing glands. It is similar to liposuction,
      but instead of suctioning out fat, the doctor suctions out the layer of the deep skin where
      the sweat glands are located. This method has been shown in some studies to effectively
      reduce underarm sweating for months at a time. Botox is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      approved drug that in small doses, paralyses muscles. It is most commonly and famously used
      in the treatment of facial wrinkles. However, it has also been approved to treat excessive
      sweating. When injected in areas that sweat excessively, sweating can be significantly
      reduced in that area for months at a time. This study is a pilot study designed to determine
      feasibility of these procedures.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change of Sweat Rate (mg/Min) at Baseline Compared to 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the treatment associated unilateral axillary percentage change of sweat rate in milligrams per minute in the exercise-induced state measured at baseline compared with the sweat rate measured 3 months after treatment.
This process entails placing filter paper on the area of concern for a specific amount of time, after which the paper is weighed and sweat production is quantified in units of weight per time. The amount of sweat produced was recorded in milligrams per minute by subtracting the initial weight of the paper segment before exercise from the final, post-application weight, after exercise and dividing by 5 minutes.
Percentage sweat rate was calculated as [(sweat rate at baseline - sweat rate at 3 months)/sweat rate at baseline]*100 with a positive percent change indicating sweat rate reduction if the baseline had a higher sweat rate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Change in Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scores From Baseline Compared to 3 Months After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean score on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) from baseline minus 3 months after treatment.
The HDSS iquestionnaire assigns a point value to the patient's view:
My sweating is...
never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities
tolerable but sometimes interferes with my daily activities
barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities
intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities
Lower point values are considered better and higher point values are considered worse.
A larger change in score between baseline and 3 months is considered a better outcome and a smaller change in score is considered a worse outcome for each treatment. Change scores were calculated (baseline minus 3 months). Positive change scores indicate that scores were better; negative change scores indicate their scores were worse after treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change of Sweat Rate (mg/Min) at Baseline Compared to 3 Months</title>
        <description>The primary outcome measure was the treatment associated unilateral axillary percentage change of sweat rate in milligrams per minute in the exercise-induced state measured at baseline compared with the sweat rate measured 3 months after treatment.
This process entails placing filter paper on the area of concern for a specific amount of time, after which the paper is weighed and sweat production is quantified in units of weight per time. The amount of sweat produced was recorded in milligrams per minute by subtracting the initial weight of the paper segment before exercise from the final, post-application weight, after exercise and dividing by 5 minutes.
Percentage sweat rate was calculated as [(sweat rate at baseline - sweat rate at 3 months)/sweat rate at baseline]*100 with a positive percent change indicating sweat rate reduction if the baseline had a higher sweat rate.</description>
