    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the delivery of ALD-401 by
      intracarotid infusion and to assess efficacy of treatment in subjects who have had
      unilateral, predominately cortical, ischemic strokes in the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
      ALD-401 is made from the stroke patient's bone marrow and infused 13-19 days after the
      stroke.

      This is a randomized, sham-controlled, multi-center, parallel-group, study in male and female
      subjects, designed to determine the safety and efficacy of ALD-401 in treating primary
      ischemic stroke. Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized 3:2 within a site to the
      treatment or sham control arm. Subjects experiencing an ischemic stroke will undergo either a
      bone marrow or a sham harvest on days 11-17 and be dosed with ALD-401 or a sham procedure
      13-19 days after the primary event. Bone marrow cells are processed, sorted and formulated
      into a 3 mL suspension of ALD-401. Two days after harvest, subjects in the ALD-401 group will
      have their processed bone marrow cells (ALD-401) injected via intracarotid/MCA infusion,
      while control subjects have a sham infusion. All subjects will be followed for 12 months to
      monitor safety and to assess mental and physical function.

      This study seeks to demonstrate safety of ALD-401 derived from autologous bone marrow and
      given via intracarotid delivery in a therapeutic window of 13-19 days post primary stroke
      event. This dosing window was selected to allow post-stroke inflammatory response to recede
      and therefore minimize the impact of resident inflammatory cells on the administration of
      ALD-401. This dosing window was consistent with information derived from pre-clinical models.
      Intracarotid/MCA delivery may offer minimal loss or dilution of therapeutic cells prior to
      localization in and around the ischemic area of the brain. ALD-401 will be manufactured from
      the patient's own bone marrow harvested 11-17 days after the primary stroke event.

          4. Is able to provide bone marrow sample from anterior or posterior iliac crest at the
             time required by targeted infusion date,

          5. Is able to return for dosing two days post bone marrow harvest (day 13-19 post stroke)
             and remain overnight for observation,

             included in the study if imaging prior to harvest demonstrates flow through collateral
             circulation to the area of the infarct. If the infarction is lacunar, the proximal MCA
             must be patent,

          8. Subjects who received tPA or underwent mechanical reperfusion may be included in the
             study as long as flow is established either in the proximal branches (M1 and M2) of
             the affected carotid or in the collateral circulation to the area of the infarct,
