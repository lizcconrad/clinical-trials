      Primary Outcomes:

        1. To study cross-sectional associations between diet, physical activity, T2DM and weight
           in subjects 2 yrs after surgery.

        2. To study if subjects receiving extra guidance in diet and physical activity experience
           less weight gain compared to a control group.

           Secondary Outcomes:

        3. To study the association between vit.D levels and T2DM.

        4. To study the association between weight change and QOL.

        5. To validate the new guidance strategy by recording food intake, energy expenditure and
           physical activity level.

        6. To study if subjects receiving extra guidance in diet and physical activity experience
           other health effects compared to a control group.

        7. To search for biomarkers that can identify people at risk of increasing weight post
           surgery

      Expected weight loss after GBP is 60-80% of the overweight. GBP is effective therapy against
      the obesity-related disorders, including T2DM. Some subjects start gaining weight within
      12-18 months after surgery. Weight gain may again increase the risk for developing
      obesity-related disorders. Previous studies have found a link between vitamin D deficiencies
      and T2DM. Vitamin D levels will be monitored during the intervention. Studies have shown that
      patients who underwent GBP experienced a dramatic improvement in quality of life(QOL). After
      reaching maximum weight loss, many will slowly gain weight. For some people that means a
      decrease in QOL. In order to prevent weight gain it may be useful to provide additional
      follow-ups. Participants are randomised into two groups: Group A will receive extra guidance
      and follow-up, while Group B will continue with the existing scheme. Participants in Group A
      will over the next 2 yrs take part in frequent meetings. To assess dietary habits, physical
      activity patterns and QOL, food diaries, physical activity questionnaires and QOL
      questionnaires are used. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements will be taken and
      blood samples will be collected at regular time intervals before and during the study. The
      results will be used to validate the effect of extra guidance, and to decide if this
      treatment shall be offered to all of our patients.
