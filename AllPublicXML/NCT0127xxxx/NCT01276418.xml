  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to collect data regarding treatment with a new flexible fiber used to
      transmit laser emitted from a Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser to the transoral region. This study
      will include a single treatment that is performed transorally (through the mouth) for oral or
      laryngeal indications in the field of Ear, Nose and Throate (ENT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. General good health allowing patient to undergo general anaesthesia or heavy sedation
             according to the specific procedure.

          2. Adult

          3. Able and willing to comply with all visit, treatment and evaluation schedule and
             requirements

          4. Able to understand and provide written Informed Consent

          5. Disease which requires tissue ablation for treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Having a bleeding disorder or taking anticoagulation medications, including heavy use
             of aspirin, in a manner which does not allow for a minimum 10 day washout period prior
             to each treatment (as per the patient's physician discretion);

          2. Significant concurrent illness, such as uncontrolled diabetes i.e. any disease state
             that in the opinion of the Physician would interfere with the anesthesia, treatment,
             or healing process

          3. Mentally incompetent, prisoner or evidence of active substance or alcohol abuse;

          4. Any condition which, in the Physician's opinion, would make it unsafe (for the subject
             or for the study personnel) to treat the subject as part of this research
