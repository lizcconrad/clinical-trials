  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was a Phase I/II, non-randomized, open label, multi-center study, following a
      sequential 2- part design. The first part, Phase I, was designed to assess whether there is a
      pharmacokinetic interaction between Glivec/Gleevec (imatinib) and RAD001(everolimus) as well
      as to collect safety data when these two drugs are co-administered. The second part, (Phase
      II), was designed to assess the potential efficacy of the combination in imatinib-resistant
      GIST patients in two strata of patients:

        -  Patients resistant to imatinib as first-line drug therapy and in whom the maximum
           tolerated dose was at least 600 mg/d (Stratum 1, first-line resistant/refractory)

        -  Patients resistant to imatinib as well as to post-imatinib drug therapy (Stratum 2, post
           second-line therapy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Phase l:

          -  Patients aged ≥ 18 years

          -  Patients with a histologically proven diagnosis of GIST and clinical evidence of
             resistance to imatinib despite at least 4 months continuous treatment with imatinib

          -  Patients with at least 2 months at a dosage of ≥ 600 mg/day (progression despite
             uninterrupted therapy for 2 months at ≥800 mg/d for patients entering the Phase I
             cohort investigating the 800 mg/d dose)

          -  Patients were to have at least one measurable lesion (longest diameter ≥20 mm on
             conventional CT or MRI scan

          -  patients were to have ≥10 mm on spiral CT) and were to have a WHO Performance Status
             Score ≤ 2.

          -  Patients also were to have adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function on imatinib
             treatment, as specified in the protocol

        Phase ll:

        • For Phase II (Stratum 2) patients must have progression on other 2nd line drug therapies
        following prior progression on imatinib (Stratum 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Patients presenting with known or symptomatic CNS metastases or leptomeningeal
             involvement

          -  Patients with any concurrent major medical condition liable to compromise the
             patient's participation in the study (e.g. known HIV infection, uncontrolled diabetes,
             serious cardiac dysrhythmia or condition, New York Heart Association classification of
             III or IV, congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction with 6 months, unstable
             angina, chronic or acute renal or liver disease, uncontrolled infections including
             abscess or fistulae, etc.)

          -  Patients with a history of another malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry,
             except curatively treated non-melanotic skin cancer or in-situ cervical cancer

          -  Patients who are receiving glucocorticoids (only if the p70s6 kinase1 assay is being
             performed), since these have been shown to inhibit p70s6 kinase1 activity.
