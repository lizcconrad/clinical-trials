  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a benign infectious agent in the normal host, but in
      immunocompromised individuals, such as recipients of stem cell transplants, this virus is a
      major cause of morbidity and mortality. While pharmacologic agents exist to treat CMV
      disease, these medications have numerous side effects, the most serious of which is
      myelosuppression. The frequency of neutropenia ranges from 41% to 58% in stem cell transplant
      (SCT) patients treated with ganciclovir. Withdrawal of anti-CMV therapy due to these
      complications may result in recurrent disease. The restoration of cellular immunity to CMV is
      necessary in order to prevent viral reactivation, and the generation of cytotoxic T cells
      against CMV early antigens is perhaps the most important part of the host immune response to
      CMV. At day 40 post-transplant, for example, at least 65% of SCT patients are deficient in
      CD8+ T-cell responses to CMV. Previous studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between
      CMV infection in these patients and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) function, with patients who
      have defects in cellular immunity being at high risk for invasive CMV disease. The median
      time post-transplant for the development of CMV disease is 50 to 60 days, and CMV
      re-activation occurs in 70 to 80% of CMV sero-positive SCT recipients. Without anti-viral
      therapy as many as 50% of these patients will develop CMV disease.

      This protocol will evaluate the safety of CMV specific T cell infusion following
      nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation from 3-6/6 HLA matched donors as well as evaluate
      the efficacy of antigen specific T cell infusions in preventing CMV activation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have undergone a non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant, using a 3-6/6
             Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched related donor.

          2. Subjects must be CMV seropositive prior to transplant by CMV immune screen or CMV IgG
             or develop detectable disease by PCR in the post-transplant setting.

          3. Performance status must be Karnofsky 50-100%.

          4. Donor cellular engraftment of at least 2.5% from the non-myeloablative procedure and
             prior to the first infusion.

          5. â‰¤ Grade 1 acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) at time of the CMV specific T cell
             infusion. Patients with treated acute GVHD must be on a stable dose of therapy (no
             increase in immunosuppressive therapy for the 2 weeks before planned donor cell
             infusion). The dosage level of immunosuppressive therapy at the time of infusion
             should be no greater than 20 mg of prednisone daily or mycophenolate 1000 mg tid daily
             or cyclosporine with a target level of 200 ng/ml or equivalent.

          6. At the time of the CMV specific T cell infusion, the recipient must have adequate
             organ function as indicated by &lt; Grade 3 across all organ systems except for
             hematologic toxicity.

          7. Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating women,

          2. Subjects with other major medical or psychiatric illnesses, which the treating
             physician feels, could seriously compromise compliance with this protocol.

          3. Subjects who had histopathologically confirmed overall Grade 4 GVHD lasting longer
             than 7 days, from the non-myeloablative therapy, are not eligible.

        Donor Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

          1. Adult donors must be the same donor used for the non-myeloablative allogeneic
             transplant and must be a related family member with a HLA 3-6/6 match with the subject
             and must be capable of providing informed consent; Potential donors under the age of
             18 must have a 'single patient exemption' approved by the Institutional Review Board
             (IRB) and the donor and a guardian must provide assent. The donor must be the same
             donor used for the original allogeneic transplantation. Selection of donors will be
             compliant with 21 CFR 1271.

          2. Adult donors must be CMV seropositive prior to transplant by CMV immune screen or CMV
             IgG positive.

          3. Donors will complete the Adult Donor History Questionnaire and have all laboratory
             studies included in the Donor Referral NTL Panel, CBC with auto or manual
             differential, and a Chemistry Panel within 7 days of scheduled collection procedure.
             Donors who were evaluated greater than 1 year prior for transplant collection will
             also have a history and Physical Exam, CXR, and EKG completed. Donors must not have
             any medical condition which would make apheresis more than a minimal risk, and should
             have normal range laboratory findings. All abnormal laboratory findings will be
             evaluated by the treating physician within the context of the entire donor assessment
             process.

          4. Females of childbearing potential should have a negative serum beta-HCG (human
             chorionic gonadotropin) test within 1 week of beginning apheresis.
