  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether interleukin-2, interferon-alpha in
      combination with bevacizumab are effective in the treatment of metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma (mRCC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab as monotherapy has effect in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Bevacizumab
      in combination with interferon-alfa (IFN-α) has significant efficacy in mRCC and has been
      approved by EMA and FDA.

      The present study will assess whether the combination of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IFN-α with
      bevacizumab may add efficacy in patients with mRCC with a tolerable safety profile.
