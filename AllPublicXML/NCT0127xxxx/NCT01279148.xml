    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-design trial will compare the use of
      electromagnetic tracking and image guidance during biopsy/ablation procedures verses the
      typical standard or conventional image guided procedure alone (control). &quot;US&quot;
      ultrasound-guided biopsies/ablations with or without &quot;CT&quot; computed tomography- imaging will
      be used to complete the procedures in either the CT suite or a procedure room, at the
      discretion of the physician, and according to normal local practice patterns.

      The study will consist of approximately 300 patients from 1 sites. Each site will have a
      study group, where the physician will use the electromagnetic tracking system along with &quot;US&quot;
      ultrasound or &quot;CT&quot; computed tomography to complete the procedure and a control group, where
      the electromagnetic tracking system will be used, but the physician will be blinded to it and
      use only the typical, standard, conventional protocol, using US or CT, to complete the
      procedure. The expected completion time for enrollment is 12 months, but will depend on the
      ability of each Clinic to enroll patients.

      Data and observations will be collected at a total of 2 scheduled appointments (screening and
      1 study visit) or based on the current hospital workflow, which may combine these into one
      patient encounter.

Successful ablation equals complete tumor ablation with a 5mm-1cm margin of normal tissue (if possible; quantified by the lack of enhancement of intravenous contrast material at 3 month follow up CT).</description>

    <description>The tracking device will be placed on the patient's skin at the desired point of entry. Without displaying the PercuNav screen to the physician, a screen capture will be taken to record the approach path. At the point of insertion, the time stamp will be recorded and the start button will be pressed. Once the physician states they are at the defined target a screen capture will be taken on the PercuNav and the distance to target and time stamp will be recorded by pushing the start button again.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Biopsy/Ablation - STUDY GROUP:</arm_group_label>
    <description>The tracking device will be placed on the patient's skin at the desired point of entry. Without displaying the PercuNav screen to the physician, a screen capture will be taken to record the approach path. The physician will then be un-blinded and shown the PercuNav screen and will correct the desired approach path and another screen capture will be taken. At the point of insertion, the time stamp will be recorded and the start button will be pressed. Once the physician states they are at the defined target a screen capture will be taken on the PercuNav and the distance to target and time stamp will be recorded. At the end of the procedure, and if clinically indicated, a verification &quot;CT&quot; computed tomography scan will be taken with the needle in place and, sent to the PercuNav. Radiation dosage, due to CT imaging, will also be recorded.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has had a pre-operative CT scan performed and will be undergoing a biopsy or ablation

          -  Is over the age of 18;

          -  Has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent

          -  Has the ability to follow procedural instructions, including, but not limited to,
             holding their breath and remaining reasonably motionless during the procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Was precluded from a biopsy/ablation procedure based on standard exclusions;
