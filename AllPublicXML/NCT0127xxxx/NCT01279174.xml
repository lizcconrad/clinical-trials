  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative arthropathy. Load-bearing joints such as
      knee and hip are more often affected than spine or hands. The prevalence of gonarthrosis is
      generally higher than that of coxarthrosis.

      Because no cure for OA exists, the main emphasis of therapy is analgesic treatment through
      either mobility or medication. Non-pharmacologic treatment is the first step, followed by the
      addition of analgesic medication, and ultimately by surgery.

      The goal of non-pharmacologic and non-invasive therapy is to improve neuromuscular function,
      which in turn both prevents formation of and delays progression of OA. A modification of
      conventional physiotherapy, whole body vibration has been successfully employed for several
      years. Since its introduction, this therapy is in wide use at our facility not only for
      gonarthrosis, but also coxarthrosis and other diseases leading to muscular imbalance.

      This study is a randomized, therapy-controlled trial in a primary care setting at a
      university hospital. Patients presenting to our outpatient clinic with initial symptoms of
      coxarthrosis will be assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. After patient
      consent, 6 weeks of treatment will ensue. During the six weeks of treatment, patients will
      receive one of two treatments, conventional physiotherapy or whole-body-vibration exercises
      of one hour three times a week. Follow-up examinations will be performed immediately after
      treatment and after another 6 and 20 weeks, for a total study duration of 6 months. 20
      patients will be included in each therapy group.

    <measure>Changes in Womac</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the patients' evaluation of improvement on the visual analogue scale of the WOMAC indices for pain and activities of daily life, comparing baseline and post-treatment. The secondary outcome measures summarized in the appendices will also be assessed at baseline and after 6, 12, and 26 weeks</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 score uses subjective patient responses to measure success of therapy and thereby evaluate quality of life. SF-12 is the abbreviated version of the SF-36 Health Survey and contains 12 items representing 8 dimensions of physical and mental fitness. In our study, the validated German translation will be used</description>

    <measure>Leonardo Mechanography</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional motion analysis, the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance, the Tandem Walk Test, and the Rhythmic Weight Shift Test will be performed using the Leonardo Mechanography Gangway (Novotec Inc., Pforzheim, Germany) and the Balance Master Analysis System (Neurocom Inc., Clackamas, USA). These will provide reliable data on essential parts of ambulation, e.g. stride length, speed of movement, shifting of balance point, force, power, and workload</description>

    <description>Patients in this study group will attend physiotherapeutic exercise sessions of one hour three times a week for six weeks. The sessions consist of aerobic and muscle strengthening as well as coordination exercises. Patients will practice activities of daily living. The goals of these exercises are to improve joint stability, optimize knee and ankle proprioception, and advance neuromuscular innervation of the lower extremity and thereby suppress pathologic motion patterns. This should lead to optimized mobility, increased stability, and thus more endogenous analgesia of the affected joint</description>

    <description>Patients in this study group will attend whole body vibration exercise sessions of one hour three times a week for six weeks, using the Galileo® Fitness device. Initial training sessions will focus on patient acclimatization, and afterwards improved on muscular capacity and body coordination. During exercise sessions, patients will do 6 training cycles of 3 minutes each. The goals of this treatment are improved proprioception of the ankle and knee joints, as well as optimization of neuronal reactivation of the muscles and thereby improved joint stability. This should also increase endogenous analgesia</description>
