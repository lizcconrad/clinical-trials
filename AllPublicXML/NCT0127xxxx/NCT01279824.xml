  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular Electrical stimulation (NMES) for swallowing has recently been proposed for the
      treatment of dysphagia post stroke and is clinically receiving favor as a treatment modality,
      in the absence of strong research support. This study aims to investigate the effect of NMES
      therapy for dysphagia upon recovery of swallowing function following stroke. The study will
      follow a pilot randomized controlled trial design. Fifty one patients admitted to a sub-acute
      rehabilitation facility will be clinically screened for dysphagia, and randomized into one of
      three groups, NMES, sham NMES or usual care -behavioral swallowing therapy arm. All patients
      will be treated for one hour per day for 3 weeks, and their progress and outcome will be
      monitored. The results will add to the preliminary data on the effectiveness of this form of
      swallowing treatment for patients following stroke, and has the potential to enable more
      efficient allocation of resources to post-acute rehabilitation and thus benefit afforded to
      stroke patients, and the community.

      This pilot randomized controlled trial (N=51) includes stroke patients admitted to a
      sub-acute rehabilitation facility. Subjects will be clinically screened for dysphagia, and
      randomized into three groups, NMES, sham NMES or usual care -behavioral swallowing therapy
      arm. Following randomization, all subjects will undergo a video-x-ray (modified barium
      swallow) of swallowing to confirm the presence of oropharyngeal dysphagia and provide
      objective data about the nature and degree of dysphagia. All patients will be treated for one
      hour per day for 3 weeks, and their progress and outcome will be recorded. Participants will
      be independently evaluated by a blinded assessor at baseline, post treatment and at 3 months
      following treatment. The primary outcome will be improvement in clinical swallowing ability,
      oral intake level, and body weight. The results will add to the preliminary data on the
      effectiveness of this form of swallowing treatment for patients following stroke.
