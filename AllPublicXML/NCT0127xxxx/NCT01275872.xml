  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Guided Imagery and Progressive Muscle
      Relaxation techniques are effective in the management of pain, fatigue, nausea-vomit, anxiety
      and depression in patients with either prostate or breast cancer.

      This study includes a total of 200 patients with prostate and breast cancer randomly assigned
      to either a control or intervention group.

      The intervention group received in total 4 sessions of Guided Imagery (protocol floating on a
      cloud) and Progressive Muscle Relaxation (breathing exercises and use of 11 groups of muscle
      progressively tensing and relaxing).

      Measurements included the assessment of pain, fatigue, nausea-vomit, depression, anxiety and
      quality of life. Additionally, saliva samples were collected prior and after the sessions as
      to assess saliva cortisol and saliva α-amylase.

      The same measurements were received by the patients of the control group as to allow
      comparisons.
