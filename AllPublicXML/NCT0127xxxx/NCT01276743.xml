  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene encodes a
      lymphoid-specific phosphatase (LYP) which is an important downregulatory factor of T cell
      activation. A PTPN22 polymorphism, C1858T, was found associated with T1DM in different
      Caucasian populations.

      In this observational case-control study, we aimed at confirming the role of PTPN22, C1858T
      polymorphism in T1DM predisposition in a Greek population.
