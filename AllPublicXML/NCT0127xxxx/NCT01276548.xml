  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of Genexol®-PM plus Carboplatin versus Genexol® plus Carboplatin in subjects with ovarian cancer based on Composite Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 cycles</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of subjects with CA125 and RECIST composite response rate was evaluated and compared between the groups. CA125 was evaluated among subjects without a measurable disease, while RECIST was evaluated among subjects with a measurable disease; discordance between the response rates by RECIST and CA125 were deemed as nonresponse.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who aged 18 years or older

          2. Subjects whose written informed consent was obtained complying with the local
             regulatory requirements prior to their participation in the trial

          3. Subjects who have histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic
             epithelial cancer of the exocrine pancreas. High-quality contrast-enhanced CT scanning
             is required to evaluate resectability. Measurable disease is not required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received prior radiation therapy (XRT) for pancreatic cancer unless
             progression was documented after XRT and 6 weeks have elapsed between completion of
             XRT and start of trial medication.

          2. Subjects who have had systemic treatment such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, for
             pancreatic cancer. However, prior use of chemotherapy, e.g. 5-FU or capecitabine, for
             radiation sensitization is allowed. If gemcitabine was given in the adjuvant setting,
             only subjects relapsed with cancer after 6 months of completing the last dose of
             gemcitabine can participate in the trial.

          3. Subjects who have had a major surgery within 2 weeks prior to the screening/baseline
             visit
