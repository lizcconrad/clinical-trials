  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies suggest a role for a low glycemic index (GI) diet in the management
      of obesity and associated metabolic risks including diabetes. However, evidence from
      long-term, randomized controlled trials exploring the relationship between low GI diet,
      weight reduction and glycemia, particularly in children and adolescents, is lacking. Modern
      food-processing technology has produced many food products with high GI which may contribute
      to the burgeoning epidemic of obesity worldwide. Since dietary habits are shaped in early
      life, adolescence is a critical period to educate our young people to acquire a healthy
      eating habit to prevent obesity.

      The investigators hypothesized that, in Chinese adolescents, low GI diet results in greater
      reduction in body mass index and body fat percentage, enhanced insulin sensitivity and
      favorable changes of cardiometabolic risk factors compared to conventional diet after 12
      months of intervention.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial of a low GI (&lt;55) versus conventional Chinese
      diet (GI&gt;/=70) in adolescents (12-month intervention followed by a 6-month observational
      period) to study; 1) the changes in body mass index and obesity associated changes in
      cardiometabolic profile; 2) the underlying hormonal factors associated with these changes.

      This is a 12-month randomized controlled dietary interventional trial followed by a 6-month
      observational period. The objectives of this study include:

        1. To study changes of body mass index, body fat percentage, insulin secretion, insulin
           resistance and obesity associated cardiometabolic factors;

        2. To explore underlying neurohormonal mechanisms associated with these changes in both
           short- and long-term.
