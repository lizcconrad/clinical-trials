  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a three Part, Phase 1, randomized, dose-escalation, fusion, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind study to determine the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      GSK2336805 in healthy subjects and the safety, tolerability, PK, and antiviral profile of
      GSK2336805 in subjects chronically infected with HCV: i. Single doses in healthy subjects and
      the effect of food on GSK2336805 PK (Part 1). ii. Repeat doses in healthy subjects (Part 2)
      iii. Single doses in chronically infected HCV positive subjects (Part 3).

             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new investigational entities within 12 months prior to the
             first dosing day.

          -  History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components
             or drugs of their class, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of
             the physician responsible, contraindicates their participation. In addition, if
             heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin
             or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Holter monitoring shows one or more of the following: Any symptomatic arrhythmia
             (except isolated extra systoles); Sustained cardiac arrhythmias (such as atrial
             fibrillation or flutter, sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) (&gt;10 consecutive
             beats)); Non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (defined as &gt;3 consecutive
             ventricular ectopic beats); Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to
             left or right complete bundle branch block, atrioventricular (AV) block [2nd degree or
             higher in an awake subject], Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) syndrome, other
             pre-excitation syndromes); Symptomatic sinus pause or sinus pause &gt;3 seconds - unless
             patient is straining, vomiting, or having some other type of hypervagal response; 300
             or more supraventricular ectopic beats in 24 hours; 250 or more ventricular ectopic
             beats in 24 hours; Ischemia, diagnosed by a sequence of EKG changes that include flat
             or down sloping ST-segment depression &gt;0.1 mV, with a gradual onset and offset that
             lasts for a minimum period of 1 minute. Each episode of ischemia must be separated by
             a minimum duration of at least 1 minute, during which the ST segment returns back to
             baseline (1x1x1 rule)
