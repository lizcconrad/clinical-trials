  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current organization of hospital care for older patients with complex healthcare needs is
      of insufficient quality, safety and efficiency. Frail older patients have a higher risk for
      development of complications and consequently a higher length of hospital stay, a higher risk
      of functional decline, and higher care needs after discharge. As nearly half of the patients
      admitted to Dutch hospitals is over 65 years, it is highly necessary to adapt the
      organization of hospital care to their needs. Besides having introduced the medical specialty
      geriatrics, hospital management has not started to provide hospital wide healthcare tailored
      to frail older patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop and examine the
      effectiveness of an intervention program for frail older patients admitted to hospital aimed
      at preventing functional decline and other hospital related negative outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of an
      intervention program for frail older patients admitted to hospital. The specific aims are:

        -  To develop a model of integrated hospital care, according to the principle of the
           Chronic Care Model, focusing both on optimizing care and wellbeing. Feasibility of such
           a model of care was first evaluated in a pilot study.

        -  To conduct a before-after study to evaluate the outcomes associated with the proposed
           model of hospital care in frail older inpatients. Information on outcome indicators,
           including autonomy, quality of life, physical and cognitive functioning, and service
           utilization will be collected and compared before and after implementation of the
           proposed model of hospital care.

      We expect that older patients who participate in the intervention program after one year of
      implementation, compared to patients who were admitted to hospital before implementation of
      the intervention program, will:

        -  have less functional decline during admission and after three months follow-up compared
           to two weeks before admission;

        -  have a lower incidence, severity and duration of delirium during admission;

        -  have less cognitive decline during admission;

        -  are more likely to be discharged directly to their own homes;

        -  have less weight loss between admission and discharge;

        -  experience less falls during admission;

        -  experience less readmissions within one month after discharge;

        -  have a shorter length of stay;

        -  have a significant different pattern of use of health care services after three months
           follow-up;

        -  experience more autonomy during hospital admission and better quality of life after
           three months follow-up.

      Additionally, we expect that the knowledge and attitudes toward care for older patients among
      nurses and physicians will change positively during implementation of the intervention
      program.

    <description>Every patient aged â‰¥70 years will be screened for frailty. (For) every frail patient:
will have a comprehensive (geriatric) assessment using an adapted version of the EasyCare instrument;
a geriatric consultation team will propose/recommend a tailored care and welfare plan, which will be updated at the moment of discharge;
will be discussed at least once in a multidisciplinary meeting;
a structured medication review will be carried out by a geriatrician;
is offered an activation programme by volunteers focusing on improvement of orientation, mobility, social activities or nutrition;
may receive a consult of a geriatrician, if judged necessary;
will receive extra attention on discharge arrangements.
Hospital staff will be educated, disease-specific guidelines will be adapted to frail older patients.</description>
