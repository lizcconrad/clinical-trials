  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind controlled study
      designed to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the safety of
      PBO-326 (Rituximab) and Mabthera (Rituximab) in combination with CHOP in previously untreated
      patients with diffuse B cells Non Hodgkin lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present R-CHOP (Rituximab plus Cyclofosfamide, Doxorrubicine, Vincristine and Prednisone)
      has became standard of care of patients with B cells Non Hodgkin Lymphoma CD20+.

      Study will perform pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) measurment of a novel
      Rituximab in comparison with Mabthera and evaluates safety both metabolic as well
      immunologic.

      Study protocolo is designed to provide data on impact of treatment interchange of both study
      drugs (PBO-326 and Mabthera).
