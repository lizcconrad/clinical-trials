  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether brief motivational interviews reduce
      problematic drinking behavior among individuals arrested for the first time for driving under
      the influence of alcohol (DUI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite extensive legislative, law enforcement, and public awareness efforts, driving under
      the influence of alcohol (DUI) remains a major cause of mortality and loss of years of
      productive life. A brief motivational interview (BI) is a non-confrontational,
      patient-centered discussion during which the individual's motivation and confidence to change
      health-related behaviors are explored. Previous studies of BIs in health care settings
      suggest that BIs administered after hospitalization for alcohol-related injury reduce the
      likelihood of repeat injury hospitalization and arrest for DUI. This study will evaluate
      whether brief motivational interviews reduce problematic drinking behavior among individuals
      arrested for the first time for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).
