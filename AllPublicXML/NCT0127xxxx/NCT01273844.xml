    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vel-Dex therapy (bortezomib and dexamethasone)
      followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as an initial treatment in
      patients with newly diagnosed AL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive two 21-day cycles of induction therapy with vel / dex regimen.
      Bortezomib 1.3mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 will be given by intravenous bolus injection while
      Dexamethasone 40 mg/d will be taken orally on days 1-4. After two cycles of vel / dex
      therapy, the collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) should be completed within 4
      weeks.Patients will receive ASCT therapy in 8 weeks after collection of PBSC (Recorded as day
      0), while melphalan (day -2) with a dose of 100,140 or 200 mg/m2 (choosing a dose according
      to the degree of risk for patients ) and Vel 1mg/m2 (days -6, -3, +1, +4) will be given. Four
      additional 21-day cycles of Vel treatment (with a dose of 1.6mg/m2 on day 1 and 8 of the
      cycle) will be conducted as consolidation therapy during the recommended 60-90 days after
      HSCT, or after resumption of hematopoietic function ( neutrophil count &gt; 1.5x109/L and
      platelet count&gt; 50x109/L). Later patients won't need maintenance therapy.

      The efficacy criteria are the international standards set with consensus of experts in the
      Tenth International Symposium on Amyloid and Amyloidosis.
