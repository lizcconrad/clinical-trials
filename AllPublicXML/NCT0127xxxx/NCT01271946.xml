          -  Patient has had prior vascular surgery or vascular grafts at the femoral artery access
             site.

          -  Patient presents with hemodynamic instability or is in need of emergent surgery.

          -  Patient has received femoral artery closure on the target access vessel with a
             collagen/PEG closure device within 90 days of the current procedure.

          -  Patient has a pre-existing severe non-cardiac systemic disease or illness that results
             in an expected life expectancy of&lt; 30 dys or for other reasons has a life expectancy
             of less than 1 yaer.

          -  Patient is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study
             that clinically interferes with the current study endpoints.

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients.

          <description>Successful bed elevation was defined as the ability to sit up at a 45 degree angle within 15 minutes (1-30 minutes window) following sheath removal and successful hemostasis, without re-bleeding. This outcome was evaluated in subjects in whom successful access with the Arstasis device was achieved. The outcome measurement is reported as percentage of subjects.</description>
