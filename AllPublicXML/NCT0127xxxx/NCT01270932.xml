      Primary:

      • To validate the initial dosing recommendations for newly diagnosed MM (Mutiple Myeloma)
      patients with various degrees of renal failure using pharmacokinetic studies

      STUDY DESIGN:

      This is a single institution open label, pharmacokinetic validation study of the combination
      of lenalidomide with dexamethasone for firstline induction therapy in transplant-eligible MM
      ( Multiple Myeloma ) patients with various degrees of renal failure. There will be 4 patient
      groups with various degrees of renal function (based on creatinine clearance calculated from
      a 24 hour urine collection and requirement for dialysis). Each group will receive
      lenalidomide dosing as per official recommended guidelines:

      Group 1 Normal {CrCl(creatinine clearance)&gt;60 mL/min}25 mg (full-dose)-Daily for 21 days of a
      28 Day cycle1 Group 2 Moderate renal impairment {30 ≤ CrCl (creatinine clearance) &lt;60
      mL/min}10 mg Daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle Group 3 Severe renal impairment {CrCl
      (creatinine clearance)&lt;30 mL/min, not requiring dialysis}15 mg Every 48 hours for 21 days of
      a 28 day cycle (11 PLANNED DOSES EACH 28 DAY CYCLE) Group 4 End-stage renal failure {CrCl
      (creatinine clearance)&lt;30 mL/min, requiring dialysis}5 mg Once daily for 21 days of a 28 day
      cycle On dialysis days the dose should be administered following dialysis.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies: We will be evaluating PK studies following single and multiple
      doses of lenalidomide during Cycle 1.Patients will receive their first dose of lenalidomide
      (Cycle 1, day 1) as per the above designated patient group. PK (pharmacokinetic)sampling for
      1st dose only will be drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours post-dose for group 1
      and at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72 hours for all other groups. The 2nd dose of
      lenalidomide will be administered on Day 4 for all patients (i.e. no doses on Days 2 and 3).
      On Day 17 (after 14 doses of lenalidomide administered), repeat PK sampling will be performed
      at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours for groups 1, 2 and 4 (before next hemodialysis
      for those in group 4). Repeat PK sampling for group 3 will be performed at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
      3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 hours.
