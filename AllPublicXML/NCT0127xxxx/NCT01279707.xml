  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has progressed considerably
      in the past 3 decades, particularly due to intensification of chemotherapies, improved
      supportive care and the incorporation of stem cell transplantation. However, the maximum
      tolerability of standard chemotherapeutics has been reached in ALL. Using conventional
      chemotherapy, 80-85% of adults with ALL will achieve a complete remission (CR). Unfortunately
      treatment at relapse is generally unsuccessful and rarely results, in long-term survival (7%
      survival at 5 years). Therefore, the investigators are exploring novel treatment strategies
      through the use of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed at surface antigens on leukaemic
      blasts. Using MoAbs directed against surface proteins on B cells has had excellent results in
      other B-cell diseases such as low and high grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas, without additional
      toxicity. There has also been limited evidence from small studies and case reports of the
      efficacy of MoAbs in ALL.

      This is a Phase I/II study to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of
      veltuzumab and epratuzumab with intensive chemotherapy in patients with relapsed B-cell ALL.
      A maximum of 51 patients will be treated with a combination of UKALL XII induction
      chemotherapy and the monoclonal antibodies veltuzumab and epratuzumab. Veltuzumab and
      epratuzumab are humanised monoclonal antibodies that target CD20 and CD22 surface proteins,
      respectively. Both of these proteins are expressed on ALL tumour B cells.

      One group of patients will receive modified UKALL XII chemotherapy + veltuzumab; a second,
      modified UKALL XII chemotherapy + epratuzumab and if limited toxicity is found in these first
      2 groups, a third group will receive, modified UKALL XII chemotherapy + both veltuzumab and
      epratuzumab. Patients will be assessed for safety, tolerability and disease response. Safety
      and tolerability will be measured by the number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in each
      group. Disease response will be measured by the microscopic appearance of patient bone marrow
      samples at day 29, and by molecular tests for tumour cells in bone marrow.
