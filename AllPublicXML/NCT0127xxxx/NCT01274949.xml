  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low Intensity Shock Wave Therapy (LI-ESWT) was shown to have a beneficial effect on ED
      patients responding to PDE5i's. This study aimed to determine the capability of LI-ESWT to
      affect patients who underwent radical prostatectomy who did not respond to PDE5 inhibitor
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We included severe ED patients that underwent radical prostatectomy at least one year
      previously and failed to respond to PDE5i therapy, who scored 0-2 on the rigidity scale (RS)
      during PDE5i therapy. Treatment included 2 sessions/week for 3 weeks, repeated after a 3-week
      no-treatment interval. At each session LI-ESWT was applied on the penile shaft and crus for 3
      minutes in 5 different penile anatomical sites (intensity of 0.09 mj/mm2, 300 shocks/site).
      One-month after end of treatment the same baseline assessment was repeated. An active PDE5i
      medication regime was then provided and final erectile function was reassessed. Main
      endpoints for success were changes in RS and in the International Index of Erectile Function
      (IIEF-ED) Domain score. This study further emphasises the need to study specific populations
      with unique etiologies causing ED.
