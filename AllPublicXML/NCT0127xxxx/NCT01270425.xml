  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a systemic disease that involves various organs such as the skin,
      kidneys, gastrointestinal tract and lungs. Dysfunction of the thyroid gland is prevalent in
      these patients and may be related to thyroid fibrosis or to thyroid autoimmune disease, i.e.
      hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid nodules are prevalent in the general population, although
      some reports suggest they might be more frequent in patients with SSc. Hashimoto's
      thyroiditis, by itself, carries a higher risk for thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer.

      The aim of the study:To characterize sonographycally the thyroid gland of patients with SSc
      with and without Hashimoto's disease

      The study protocol Fifty patients with SSc according to the current international
      classification will be included in the study. The patients, followed-up regularly in an
      out-patient clinic, will be tested for their thyroid function tests as well as the presence
      of thyroid auto antibodies. Clinical data will be collected from their medical records.
      Ultrasonographic examination of the thyroid gland will be performed by a single examiner. The
      gland will be characterized in detail with regards to its size and echotexture and cervical
      lymph nodes will be detected. The number and size of its nodules will be described as well as
      their echoic pattern (iso, hyperechoic or hypoechoic) calcifications (micro and macro), and
      borders status. Large nodules (â‰¥ 1 cm in diameter) or with malignancy- associated
      characteristics will be aspirated according to current clinical practice. Treatment will be
      given according to the cytology diagnosis. Thyroid hormone supplementation will be
      recommended when thyrotropin level &gt;8 mIU/L or according to clinical judgment of the
      investigators.
