  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first outbreak of a new H1N1 influenza pandemic originated in the North America in April
      2009. As of July 1, 2009, a total of 77,201 cases were accumulated in 103 countries around
      the world and the mortality rate of was about 0.43%. Alignment and analysis on gene sequences
      of the new H1N1 influenza virus found that it contains extremely homologous gene composition
      with that of the swine influenza viruses (swine flu) identified in Europe and North America
      in last century. Thus the virus strain was later renamed as a novel influenza H1N1. In
      general, the symptoms caused by the new influenza H1N1 infection was very similar to those
      resulted from seasonal influenza viral infection. Thus, it is difficult to distinguish the
      various influenza strains responsible for the infections only by clinical appearance. To
      compare the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity and speed in identifying the new influenza
      H1N1 in suspected cases, the investigators extracted RNA from influenza A-positive reactive
      specimens identified by a Influenza Rapid Test, for a Real-time PCR method to further detect
      the presence of swine H1 gene. In addition, the titer of H1N1 virus, the color development on
      the test stripe and clinical symptoms in patients were significantly associated. Finally,
      Real-time PCR products were subjected to sequence determination to explore potential new
      influenza pathogenicity, transmissibility and drug usage.
