      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a 50-mg tapentadol (CG5503)
      dose administered as two 25-mg ER, TRF tablets relative to one 50-mg ER TRF tablet in healthy
      Japanese male participants.

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-center,
      randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), 2-way crossover study (participants may
      receive different interventions sequentially during the trial). All participants will receive
      a single 50-mg dose of tapentadol (CG5503) during 2 periods, in randomized order, as two
      25-mg TRF tablets and one 50-mg TRF tablet. All participants will be randomly assigned to 1
      of 2 possible treatment sequences and receive both of the following treatments, 1 in each
      period:

      Treatment A: two tapentadol (CG5503) ER 25-mg TRF tablets, administered as a single oral dose
      under fasted condition Treatment B: one tapentadol (CG5503) ER 50-mg TRF tablet, administered
      as a single oral dose under fasted condition Each period will be separated by 7 - 14 days
