      The Study's Primary Objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety (acute effects
      associated with infusions, and inhibitor development) and efficacy (breakthrough bleeding and
      control of hemorrhaging during prophylaxis) of IB1001 in previously treated pediatric
      subjects with hemophilia B.

      Primary Objective(s):

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety (acute effects associated with infusions, and
      inhibitor development) and efficacy (breakthrough bleeding and control of hemorrhaging during
      prophylaxis) of IB1001 in previously treated pediatric subjects with hemophilia B. Acute
      effects are defined as adverse events (AEs) which occur within the first 72 hours after the
      administration of a study product.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To obtain tolerance and compliance information on pediatric subject response to an
           intravenously delivered recombinant factor IX product , IB1001

        2. To evaluate the safety of IB1001 during the 50 exposure days treatment course

      Investigators/Study Centers:

      This international study will be conducted at clinical sites located in the United States
      (USA), Europe, Mexico and India

      Phase of Development: Phase 3/4

      Planned Sample Size:

      Up to 22 pediatric subjects (&lt;12 years of age) will be enrolled in order to have 20 subjects
      complete the study.

      Study Duration:

      The study duration will be approximately 6 months per subject to include a minimum of 50
      exposures to IB1001.

      Study Design:

      The study is a non-randomized, open label design that includes an initial pharmacokinetics
      evaluation in all participants, followed by six months (50 exposure days) of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject's parent or legal guardian must give written Institutional Review Board
             (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved informed consent and be willing to
             make the required study visits and follow instructions while enrolled in the study.
             For subjects ≥7 years of age, assent will be obtained if required by the institution.
             For subjects &lt; 7 years of age, legal assent is not reasonable to obtain.

          2. Severe (factor IX activity ≤2 IU/dL) hemophilia B subjects currently on-demand therapy
             with a minimum of 2 bleeding episodes requiring factor IX therapy over the preceding 6
             months or 4 bleeding episodes over the preceding 12 months; subjects on prophylaxis
             with a bleeding pattern similar to that above demonstrated prior to starting
             prophylaxis

          3. Immunocompetent (CD4 count &gt;400/mm3) and not receiving immune modulating or
             chemotherapeutic agents
