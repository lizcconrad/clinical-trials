  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Near 85% of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma are diagnosed with a locally advanced
      and/or metastatic unresectable tumor. In these patients chemotherapy (such as gemcitabine) is
      given as a palliative therapy. Aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility,
      tolerance and antitumor effect of repeated intratumoral injection of a gene therapy product
      (with antitumor and chemo sensitizing effects) combined with gemcitabine in patients with
      unresectable pancreatic carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a gene therapy open non randomized phase I trial for advanced and/or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer patients. The protocol is based on the administration of increasing doses
      of a plasmid DNA pre-complexed to PEI (polyethylenimine - non-viral vector) that encodes two
      genes (somatostatin receptor subtype 2 named sst2 and deoxycitidine kinase ::
      uridylmonophosphate kinase named dck::umk) which exhibit complementary therapeutic effects.
      Both transgenes induce an antitumor bystander effect and render gemcitabine treatment more
      efficient. Intratumor injections of the gene therapy product (CYL-02) will be performed by
      transgastric or transduodenal route under endoscopic ultrasound guidance. Each injection will
      be followed standard gemcitabine IV administration every week (1000 mg/m2). Two intratumor
      injections of a same dose of CYL-02 will be administered at one month interval. Four
      increasing doses (125 µg, 250 µg, 500 µg and 1 mg) will be tested by group of 6 patients. The
      primary objectives are: evaluation of local pancreatic and general tolerance; the secondary
      objectives are: possible tumor volume regression, secondary respectability, evaluation of
      transgene biodistribution.

The intratumor injection of CYL-02 is followed by three IV infusions of Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) at 48 hours and then every two weeks. A second Intratumoral injection of the gene therapy product CYL-02 is performed at a same dosage and volume 30 days after the first administration followed by Three infusions of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) according the same rhythm (48 hours and every week) and dose.</description>
