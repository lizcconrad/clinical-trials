  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Authors want to investigate the usefulness of flexible cystoscopy in performing laparoscopic
      pyelolithotomies and ureterolithotomies by comparing operative results of a single surgeon's
      experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous trials to increase stone clearance rates have been recently reached using flexible
      equipment in laparoscopic surgery, however, it is not clear whether using flexible equipment
      is really helpful in performing pyelolithotomies and the clearance rates using flexible
      equipment varies 71% to 100%. Therefore, authors plan to investigate the usefulness of
      flexible cystoscopy in performing laparoscopic pyelolithotomies and ureterolithotomies by
      comparing operative results of a single surgeon's experience.

    <description>Preoperative evaluation included a complete history, physical examination, and imaging work-up such as X-ray or computed tomography (CT). Mean preoperative stone numbers and sizes were evaluated and we also evaluated operative information such as surgical approach, insertion of a DJ ureteral catheter, and use of a flexible cystoscopy</description>
