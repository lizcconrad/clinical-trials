    <textblock>
      This is a research study for subjects who have been diagnosed with Adult T cell
      Leukemia/Lymphoma, a rare and aggressive peripheral T cell neoplasm caused by the virus
      HTLV1. Currently, there is no accepted standard therapy for this disease. The purpose of this
      research study is to evaluate the use of the investigational drug lenalidomide in the
      treatment of Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma.

      Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune system and it may also interfere with the
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it
      may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.

      Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      specific types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. MDS and MM
      are cancers of the blood. It is currently being tested in a variety of cancer conditions. In
      this case it is considered experimental.

      The Primary Objective is to determine the efficacy of lenalidomide monotherapy in relapsed or
      refractory HTLV 1 associated Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma. Efficacy will be assessed by
      measuring the response rate, tumor control rate, duration of response, time to progression
      and progression free survival.

      The Secondary Objective is to evaluate the safety of lenalidomide monotherapy as treatment
      for subjects with relapsed or refractory HTLV 1 associated Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          -  Relapsed or refractory HTLV-1 associated Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (Acute and
             lymphoma subtypes)

          -  All previous cancer therapy, including radiation, hormonal therapy and surgery, must
             have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment in this study.

          -  ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 at study entry (see Appendix C).

          -  Laboratory test results within these ranges:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm³

               -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000 /mm³

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault formula
                  (Appendix J). Patients with calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min and &lt; 60
                  mL/min will have a reduced starting dose of lenalidomide (see Section 5.4.2).
