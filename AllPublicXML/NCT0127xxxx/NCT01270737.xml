      The investigators hypothesize that whole soy or purified daidzein alone could reduce blood
      pressure and CVD risks in equol-producing menopausal Chinese women.

    <textblock>
      Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Substantial evidence
      has also shown that prehypertension [systolic blood pressure (BP) 120-139 mm Hg or diastolic
      BP 80-89 mm Hg] is the strongest predictor of incident hypertension and is associated with
      elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases. Thus, prehypertension and its progression to
      hypertension have enormous public health implications. Soybean contains many beneficial
      components, among which isoflavones have received most research attention. Recently
      researchers have investigated their influences on vascular functions but only a handful of
      studies have focused on BP reduction as the primary outcome.The role of whole soy or daidzein
      on BP is yet unclear.

      The investigators hypothesize that whole soy (soy flour) or purified daidzein alone could
      reduce BP,and decrease CVD risks in menopausal women with prehypertension or initial
      untreated hypertension. The investigators propose to perform a 24-week double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial in postmenopausal women with prehypertension or stage 1
      hypertension. The primary objective is to verify if whole soy (soy flour) or purified
      daidzein alone has anti-hypertensive effects at a dosage of habitual high soy intake.
