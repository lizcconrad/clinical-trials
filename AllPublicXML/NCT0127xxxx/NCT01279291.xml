    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study of KHK2866 as
      monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors, and in combination with chemotherapy in
      subjects platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Phase 1a, groups of eligible patients with advanced solid tumors will receive KHK2866
      as monotherapy in escalating doses. The Phase 1b portion will enroll patients with ovarian
      cancer who will receive KHK2866 in combination with one of three chemotherapy regimens
      (Arms): gemcitabine+carboplatin (platinum-sensitive, weekly paclitaxel (platinum-resistant),
      or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (platinum-resistant). Escalating doses of the combination
      of KHK2866 and the chemotherapy regimen will given to two groups of subjects per Arm. The
      goal of the study is to learn about the side effects of KHK2866 alone or given in combination
      with chemotherapy. All subjects will receive study therapy for up to 6 cycles (up to 12
      cycles for subjects assigned to PLD [Arm 3 of Phase 1b]), or until disease progression, the
      development of severe side effects, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or
      other removal criteria whichever comes first.
