  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if persons randomized to receive adapted
      Personalized Cognitive Risk-reduction Counseling (PCC) will report greater reductions in
      unprotected anal sex behavior compared with persons who do not receive Personalized Cognitive
      Risk-reduction Counseling (PCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the U.S., men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to constitute the greatest number of
      HIV/AIDS cases compared with other risk groups. Furthermore, many episodic substance using
      men who have sex with men (SUMSM) report that sex and substance use &quot;always&quot; or &quot;often&quot; go
      together. Studies have shown that substance use just before or during sex substantially
      increases HIV risk.

      The formative phase of this research enrolled 59 HIV-negative episodic substance using MSM to
      participate in interviews to inform the adaptation of the Self-Justification Elicitation
      Instrument (SJEI) used during Personalized Cognitive Counseling (PCC) and to subsequently,
      pilot the adapted SJEI.

      The randomized controlled trial (RCT) phase of this study enrolled 326 ethnically-diverse,
      HIV-negative episodic SUMSM to receive standard HIV rapid testing plus adapted Personalized
      Cognitive Risk-reduction Counseling intervention (PCC) or standard HIV counseling and rapid
      testing only.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To conduct formative research through individual interviews and pilot testing among a
           sample (n=59) of episodic substance-using men who have sex with men (SUMSM) to develop
           and adapt the key elements of the Personal Risk-Reduction Cognitive Counseling
           intervention, with a focus on eliciting and intervening on the thoughts, attitudes, and
           behaviors that episodic SUMSM employ when using substances and engaging in concurrent
           sexual risk.

        2. To determine the efficacy of the adapted intervention in reducing unprotected anal sex,
           as compared to routine HIV testing control condition, in a randomized trial of 326
           episodic SUMSM.

      We will also determine the efficacy of the intervention in reducing substance use.

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment involved outreach at community venues in San Francisco, including bars, clubs, grocery stores, gyms, and other venues frequented by MSM. To recruit a racially and ethnically diverse sample of episodic SUMSM, recruitment also occurred at community-based organizations serving African American, Latino, and Asian and Pacific Islander MSM.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Potential participants completed brief telephone screening to assess initial eligibility and, if eligible, were scheduled for in-person re-screening visits. If potential participants were ineligible at the re-screening visit, they were thanked for their time and did not continue with study activities, such as randomization in the RCT.</pre_assignment_details>
