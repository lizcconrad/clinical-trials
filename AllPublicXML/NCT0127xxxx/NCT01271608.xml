      Comparing the pain intensity on a numeric scale (0-10) with intramuscular and subcutaneous
      injection between a retractable fixed syringe needle and the technique involving needle
      exchange; Comparing bruise formation following administration of insulin subcutaneous
      injections between RFS and the conventional technique.

      Method Study site A clinical trial was conducted in two medical-surgical units in a hospital
      in the period from June 15th to November 30th, 2009, after approval by the Ethics and
      Research Committee.

      Intervention In a group of patients the investigators used syringes with retractable fixed
      needle to administer subcutaneous and intramuscular injections. In the group of control, the
      investigators used the standard technique to administer medications.

      Population of study Patients were sequentially enrolled through a lottery system of exposure
      using random numbers kept in sealed, opaque envelopes.

      Sampling design and sample size Subcutaneous injection The sample size was based on the
      expected proportion of bruising following the injection. It was expected that 40% of patients
      would show bruising with the conventional technique and 20% with the technique under study
      for subcutaneous applications. With an alpha error of 5% (p = 0.05) and power of study of 80%
      (beta error of 20% or 0.2) 240 patients were included, 120 in each group.

      Intramuscular injection The sample size was based on the proportion of patients with moderate
      to severe pain. It was considered normal the incidence of moderate to severe pain in 30% with
      a needle exchange, whereas it was considered an increase of up to 40% with the retractable
      fixed needle. The investigators included 500 patients in each group.
