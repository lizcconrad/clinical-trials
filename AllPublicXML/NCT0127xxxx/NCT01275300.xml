      We would like to see if aspirin could block niacin-induced flushing by analyzing blood and
      urine after taking aspirin.

      Phase I: 5 days of 81 mg aspirin/placebo followed by 600 mg Niacin, 2 week washout and 5 days
      taking the alternate. The order in which this is given will be randomized or assigned by
      chance.

      Phase II: One study week consisting of 5 days of taking 81 mg Aspirin, taken once daily,
      followed by a single dose of 600 mg Niacin on day 6.

      Phase III: 5 days taking 81 mg Aspirin/placebo, 10 day washout in between.

      Phase IV: Use of extended release niacin instead of instant release.

      Phase V: A Celebrex study is necessary to explore the contribution of Cox-2 to niacin induced
      flushing.

      The purpose of this study is to look at the roles of various blood cells and their
      contributions of different prostaglandins. The intention is that by better understanding
      these prostaglandins and various metabolites, it will provide insights into their roles in
      the cardiovascular system.

      Prostaglandins and metabolites are naturally occurring substances found in the blood and
      urine which can act as markers which can be quantified and studied as we will be doing in
      this study. Flushing response to niacin will also be assessed by laser doppler measuring
      blood flow of the facial skin.

      Untransformed and transformed data will be subjected to exploratory analysis of variance
      appropriated for a three factor design with one two period crossover factor and two
      non-repeated factors. Additionally, volunteer's test(s) for paired observations will
      characterize the magnitude of the niacin effect on the response variables within selected
      time points.
