  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to develop an integrative intervention for schizophrenia taking
      into account previous efficacious therapies. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of
      our cognitive remediation group training: Problem Solving and Cognitive Flexibility training
      (REPYFLEC), focused to improve neurocognition and functioning in schizophrenia patients. We
      hypothesized that training executive function and metacognition would allow us to achieve
      improvements in neurocognition, functioning and psychiatric symptoms of patients with
      schizophrenia.

    <description>Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS). This scale evaluates cognitive flexibility, inhibition of impulsive responses, planning and organization, working memory and time-estimation capacity. All subscales (Rule shift cards, Action Program, Key search, Temporal judgment, Zoo map and Six elements) were administered. We used subscales raw scores which run from 0 to 4. The subscales' raw score is summarized and converted to standardized total score which run (min.
12-max. 129). A higher score indicates better performance.</description>

    <description>Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) (Wilson et al., 1996).

    <measure>Psychosocial Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in social functioning scales at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Spanish validation of the Life Skills Profile (LSP)was used. This scale measures functionality in daily life activities such as self-care, social behavior and autonomy. Raw scoring was used for the various subscales which are summarized for the total (min. 39-max. 156) with a higher score indicating a better result.
The 5 subscales are: Self-care, Non-turbulence, Social contact, Communication and Responsibility. We used the Spanish validation of the Social Functioning Scale (SFS)for measuring social behavior and relationships, autonomy, employment-occupation and leisure. Raw scoring was used for each subscale and for total score (min. 0-max. 223) with a higher score indicating a better result. All 7 subscales were administered: social engagement/ withdrawal, interpersonal behavior, independence-competence, independence-performance, pro-social activities, recreation and employment/ occupation.</description>

          <title>Experimental Group (Repyflec Cognitive Remediation)</title>
          <description>Cognitive remediation (CR) group training (Repyflec)
REPYFLEC CR is a strategy-based training that targets executive function and metacognition. It is carried out using paper and pencil and a blackboard (required to develop some of the tasks, explanations,examples, etc.); in a group format (4-6 participants), over 4 months twice a week and consisting of 32 sessions lasting 1 h. We developed a Spanish manual where training is described session by session; incorporating the materials for developing sessions, some theoretical points and bibliography for therapists. Working contents are divided into two main areas: Problem Solving (PS) and Cognitive Flexibility (CF).</description>

Parallel to the experimental group, a leisure control group was established which participated in 32 stimulating and socializing activities (e.g., card games, board games, &quot;coffee &amp; talk&quot;, etc.) over 4 months twice a week and lasting 1 h.</description>

This scale evaluates cognitive flexibility, inhibition of impulsive responses, planning and organization, working memory and time-estimation capacity. All subscales (Rule shift cards, Action Program, Key search, Temporal judgment, Zoo map and Six elements) were administered. We used subscales raw scores which run from 0 to 4. The subscales' raw score is summarized and converted to standardized total score which run (min.

            <description>REPYFLEC CR is a strategy-based training that targets executive function and metacognition. It is carried out using paper and pencil and a blackboard (required to develop some of the tasks, explanations, examples, etc.); in a group format (4-6 participants), over 4 months twice a week and consisting of 32 sessions lasting 1 h. We developed a Spanish manual where training is described session by session; incorporating the materials for developing sessions, some theoretical points and bibliography for therapists. Working contents are divided into two main areas: Problem Solving (PS) and Cognitive Flexibility (CF). In the PS module (16 sessions), training in executive function,thinking processes and self-monitoring was emphasized.In the CF module (16 sessions), all the tasks require practice of cognitive flexibility combined with other executive abilities such as planning or self-monitoring.</description>

            <description>REPYFLEC is a strategy-based training, explicitly described from session to session, which is carried out using pencil and paper with a blackboard as visual support. This format allows results to be replicated with rigour. The working content is divided into two principal areas: Problem solving (PS) and Cognitive Flexibility (CF). In the PS block, training in executive function, the thinking process and self-monitoring was emphasized. In the CF block, the tasks require the use of cognitive flexibility for successful completion. Some activities seek to promote training of other functions such as memory, working memory, sustained attention and language. Development of training was performed taking into account the contextual bases of learning, mainly using techniques as &quot;modelling&quot; to foster coping abilities, &quot;molding&quot;, &quot;self-monitoring&quot;, &quot;errorless learning&quot; and &quot;Socratic questioning&quot;. REPYFLEC is carried out in a group format (4-6), consisting of 32 sessions lasting 1 hour.</description>

          <title>Psychosocial Functioning</title>
          <description>The Spanish validation of the Life Skills Profile (LSP)was used. This scale measures functionality in daily life activities such as self-care, social behavior and autonomy. Raw scoring was used for the various subscales which are summarized for the total (min. 39–max. 156) with a higher score indicating a better result.
The 5 subscales are: Self-care, Non-turbulence, Social contact, Communication and Responsibility. We used the Spanish validation of the Social Functioning Scale (SFS)for measuring social behavior and relationships, autonomy, employment-occupation and leisure. Raw scoring was used for each subscale and for total score (min. 0–max. 223) with a higher score indicating a better result. All 7 subscales were administered: social engagement/ withdrawal, interpersonal behavior, independence-competence, independence-performance, pro-social activities, recreation and employment/ occupation.</description>
          <population>The sample size required was calculated according to the main study objective which consisted of achieving an improvement in social functioning according to the Living Skills Profile (LSP) scale. It was estimated that a sample of 27 patients per group would have a power of 80% at a significance level of 5% to detect these differences.</population>
