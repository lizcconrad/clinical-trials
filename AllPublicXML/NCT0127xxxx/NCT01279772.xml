    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose that the addition of rituximab will lower the risk
      of systemic and local relapses in patients with localized PBL. Patients will be treated with
      6 cycles of RCHOP-14 or RCHOP-21. The administration of radiotherapy following chemotherapy
      is strongly recommended, based on the findings of the retrospective IELSG study, but will be
      at the discretion of the treating center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously untreated patients with DLBCL of the breast.

          -  Patients must have CD20 positive tumors.

          -  Stage IE or IIE.

          -  Must have at least one objective measurable or evaluable disease. Baseline
             measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 4 weeks of registration to the
             study.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as evidenced by the following laboratory
             studies ( within 2 weeks prior to registration):

               -  Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 ml/min

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl and AST &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal. If documented
                  hepatic involvement with lymphoma, total bilirubin can be &lt; 3 x ULN, and AST &lt; 5
                  x ULN.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3 and platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3. If
                  documented bone marrow involvement with lymphoma, absolute neutrophil count &gt;
                  500/mm3 and platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3.

          -  Patients must be age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Patients must have a normal left ventricular ejection fraction to be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  historical or radiographic evidence of CNS metastasis including previously treated,
             resected or asymptomatic brain lesions or leptomeningeal involvement.

          -  pregnant or breast feeding patients. Women of childbearing potential and sexually
             active males are strongly advised to use an accepted and effective method of

          -  known HIV infection
