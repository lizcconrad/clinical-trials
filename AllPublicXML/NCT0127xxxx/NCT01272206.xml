    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics (the rate at which the body eliminates the trial drug) of NNC 0128-0000-2011
      compared to NNC 0128-0000-2021 when given for the first time to healthy human subjects.
