  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an integrated, cognitive-behavioral model of
      psychotherapy is effective in the treatment of individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD) compared to a known evidence-based model for
      PTSD/SUD.

      This project is designed to evaluate a new model of psychotherapy that was developed for
      individuals with PTSD and SUD. The new model helps them to explore the past as a step in
      their recovery process. It has major public health relevance in that it is a low-cost,
      flexible model designed for all trauma and substance abuse types, both genders, and all
      clinical settings. It has particular relevance for VA in that many veterans suffer from PTSD
      and SUD. The new model has demonstrated positive results in two pilot studies. If the results
      of the current study are positive, a larger study could be done for the next stage of
      scientific testing.

    <description>Creating Change is a past-focused, integrated, cognitive-behavioral therapy for PTSD/SUD. It has 17 topics, which in this study are conducted once per week in hour-long sessions. The treatment focuses on exploring how PTSD and SUD arose and interacted across the patient's life, including, constructing a narrative of its meaning, processing associated emotions and memories, and exploring themes related to these.</description>

    <description>Seeking Safety is a present-focused, evidence-based cognitive-behavioral therapy specifically designed for integrated treatment of patients with current PTSD and SUD. It consists of 25 topics evenly divided among cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal topics. Each topic provides a new theme relevant to both disorders; for this study we will offer 17 of the 25 topics and conduct one topic per session.</description>
