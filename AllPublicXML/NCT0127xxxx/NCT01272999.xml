  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevnar (7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [7vPnC]) has been shown to be effective
      against ear infections in children. Prevnar 13 is a new vaccine that is similar to Prevnar.
      It is expected that the effectiveness of Prevnar 13 against ear infections in children will
      be similar to that observed following Prevnar. Pfizer has committed to conduct a
      postmarketing study of the impact of Prevnar 13 in reducing ear infections among children.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Case eligibility should be based on microbiologic data and should be reviewed and
             documented by an appropriately qualified member of the investigator's study team
             before cases are included in the study database.

          -  S pneumoniae identified from middle ear fluid or mastoiditis sample.

          -  Specimen obtained from children aged up to 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As this is an observational, laboratory based database study, there are no exclusion
