    <textblock>
      Breast cancer treatment is for many patients followed by sequelae, such as persistent pain,
      sensory disturbances, lymphedema and reduced physical function. These undesired consequences
      of the treatment are a major clinical problem, with persistent pain affecting 25-60%, sensory
      disturbances 20-80%, lymphedema 2-86% and reduced physical function 13-28% of patients.
      Development of persistent pain after breast cancer treatment, involves a complex
      pathophysiology that involves pre-, intra- and postoperative factors. Several risk factors
      for the development of persistent pain after breast cancer treatment have been identified;
      young age, psychosocial factors, surgical procedure and radiation therapy. Neurotoxicity is a
      well know attribute of many chemotherapeutic agents, such as taxanes. The purpose of this
      nationwide study is to retrospectively examine a cohort of breast cancer patients treated
      with docetaxel, to clarify if docetaxel may influence the prevalence and intensity of
      persistent pain and other sequelae.
