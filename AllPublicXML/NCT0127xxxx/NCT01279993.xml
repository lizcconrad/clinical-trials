      Purpose: To detect orthoptic changes in patients undergoing photorefractive keratectomy
      (PRK). Method: This interventional case series was performed on 297 eyes of 150 patients who
      were candidates for PRK. Complete ophthalmic evaluations focusing on orthoptic examinations
      were performed before and 3 months after PRK. Results: Before PRK, two (1.3%) patients had
      esotropia that remained unchanged postoperatively. However, 3 (2%) patients had distance
      exotropia preoperatively which improved after PRK. Of 12 cases (8%) with preoperative
      exotropia at near, 3 (2%) cases became orthophoric. Six patients (4%) developed postoperative
      near exotropia. A significant reduction in means of convergence and divergence amplitudes
      (P&lt;0.001) and a meaningful increase in mean of near point of convergence (NPC) (P&lt;0.006) were
      noticed after PRK. A reduction of ≥10 PD in convergence amplitude and ≥5 PD in divergence
      amplitude were detected in 10 and 5 patients, respectively. Four patients had an preoperative
      NPC&gt;10 cm which was not changed by the surgery. Out of 9 (6%) patients with baseline
      stereopsis &gt;60 seconds of arc, 2 (1.33%) cases showed an improvement in stereopsis following
      PRK. None of the patients complained of postoperative diplopia. Conclusion: Eye deviation in
      patients undergoing PRK may improve or remain unchanged after operation and postoperative
      deviations can develop following this surgery. Diminishing of fusional amplitude and
      increasing of NPC as well as improving of stereopsis may also happen after PRK. Therefore, a
      preoperative orthoptic examination in patients with any concerning histories and/or motility
      issues on routine exam is recommended before performing PRK.
