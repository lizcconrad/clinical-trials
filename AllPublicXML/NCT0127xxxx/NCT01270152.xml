  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is to evaluate whether ascorbic acid is able to clear totally
      implanted central venous catheter
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Totally implanted catheter is often occluded and thrombolytic drugs are usually used to
      restore permeability. In Brazil, the ascorbic acid has been used successfully by a service
      specialist in cancer treatment. However, no literature on international research that
      evaluates the efficacy and safety of this procedure. That was why it was decided to develop
      this research.
