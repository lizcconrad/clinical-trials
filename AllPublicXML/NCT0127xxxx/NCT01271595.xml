  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is inconclusive evidence whether acupuncture treatment is effective in the treatment of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of acupuncture in
      SAR are only poorly understood. It was hypothesised that the therapeutic mechanism of
      acupuncture is related to changes in autonomic function. AUTO-ACUSAR is a sub-study of the
      DFG-funded three-arm randomized controlled trial ACUSAR trial investigating the efficacy of
      acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture vs. rescue medication in SAR. The aim of AUTO-ACUSAR was to
      investigate short and long-term effects of acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture on autonomic
      function in a sub-group of ACUSAR patients. Baseline values were compared to data from
      matched healthy controls.

      In AUTO-ACUSAR a subsample of ACUSAR patients from acupuncture or sham acupuncture groups
      were included. Tests of autonomic functions included measurement of heart rate variability
      during paced breathing, blood pressure, heart rate and salivary alpha amylase response to a
      cold pressure test (CPT) and cortisol awakening response before the first and the last of
      twelve treatment sessions. Healthy matched controls underwent the same measurement once only
