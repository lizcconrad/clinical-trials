      Study aim is to compare Lava Computer Aided Design / Computer Aided Milling Computer Aided
      Machining (CAD/CAM)crowns that are veneered (covered) with porcelain that has been milled
      using CAD/CAM, with similar CAD/CAM Lava crowns that have been veneered with a hand
      fabricated porcelain covering.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veneers will be randomly allocated to study crowns. Study crowns will be evaluated over three
      years. The test porcelain veneer is CAD/CAM milled as a veneer shell that is then fused to
      the CAD/CAM milled Lava crown to make the final crown to be cemented in the patient's mouth.
      This may be a more predictable technique in the fabrication of Lava crowns than current
      conventional methods.
