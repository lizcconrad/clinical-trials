  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previously established that there was a high burden of disease among all
      categories of staff at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine and in many ways,
      this group is typical of the working class of the Caribbean population. Many had poor
      lifestyle behaviors, 23.8% had Metabolic Syndrome (MS) with many having one or more MS
      components. Since most time is spent at work, the workplace is understandably the most
      logical location to address issues pertaining to health, disease prevention and wellness and
      on-site programs have yielded many health and other benefits to employees and employers
      alike. Onwards of the 1980s, numerous studies have been done on work-site intervention
      programs and these have shown that if a company is able to identify employees at risk for
      developing health problems and then intervene, health risks and the resulting medical
      problems are reduced. Such a program, if tailored to meet the needs of participants, may
      yield similar benefits among the staff of the University of the West Indies.

      To conduct a randomized controlled intervention of lifestyle modifications among individuals
      with a high burden of metabolic syndrome components such as high body mass index, high
      fasting blood glucose and abnormal lipid profile.

      A 6-month intervention is designed for implementation to detect a 20% reduction in MS
      components with 90% confidence. Participants (n=148) had 2 or more MS components and will be
      randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Intervention will comprise individual
      diet counseling, an exercise plan and monthly lifestyle workshops. Controls will receive
      printed material on healthy eating and lifestyle modification.
