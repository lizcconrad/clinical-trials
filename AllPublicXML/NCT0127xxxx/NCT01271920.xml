  <brief_title>Combination of AUY922 With Trastuzumab in HER2+ Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Previously Treated With Trastuzumab</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase Ib/II, Multi-center, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of AUY922 in Combination With Trastuzumab in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic HER2-positive Breast Cancer, That Has Progressed After or During at Least One Trastuzumab-containing Regimen</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase Ib part of the trial will assess the MTD of AUY922 in combination with Trastuzumab
      in patients with Trastuzumab-refractory locally advanced or metastatic HER2+. The MTD is
      defined as the highest drug dosage not causing in the first cycle of treatment (28 days)
      medically unacceptable dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

      The phase II part of the trial will assess any potential effect on efficacy of adding AUY922
      to Trastuzumab in patients with Trastuzumab-refractory locally advanced or metastatic HER2+
      breast cancer.

      Both AUY922 and Trastuzumab will be administered as a weekly IV infusion. Treatment should be
      continued as long as the patient does not have disease progression and tolerates the
      treatment. The following reasons are examples of acceptable reasons for discontinuing the
      study; tumor progression (by RECIST, as assessed by the investigator), unacceptable toxicity,
      death, or discontinuation from the study for any other reason, such as patient refusal,
      withdrawn consent, lost to follow-up or investigator decision.
