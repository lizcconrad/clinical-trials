        Summary Criteria for Inclusion:

          1. Males and females aged 50-60 or ≥ 75 years.

          2. Subjects with clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis in knee and/or hip including
             fulfilment of ACR-criteria and radiographic evidence not older than one year.

          3. Subjects with a moderate to severe pain, confirmed by a BS-11 score ≥ 4 for their pain
             on average during the last seven days of the Screening Phase in their primary OA-site
             at the Baseline Visit.

        Summary Criteria for Exclusion:

          1. Subjects recording &lt; 4 on average during the Screening Phase on the BS-11 scale.

          2. Subjects treated with high-potent opioid analgesics (e.g. morphine, fentanyl,
             oxycodone, methadone, hydromorphone, ketobemidone, buprenorphine) for their
             osteoarthritis pain.

          3. Subjects treated with a regular dose for &gt; 1 week of tramadol, codeine or
             dextropropoxyphene within 1 month before screening visit.

          4. Subjects who require NSAID treatment (except aspirin for cardiovascular indications)
             or cox-2-inhibitors during the study period.

          5. Subjects with history of, or ongoing, chronic condition(s), in addition to
             osteoarthritis, requiring frequent analgesic therapy (e.g. frequent headaches,
             frequent migraine, gout, rheumatoid arthritis).

          6. Subjects scheduled for surgery that would fall within the study period.

          7. Subjects who currently abused substance or alcohol, or subjects who, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, have demonstrated addictive or substance abuse behaviours.

          8. Subjects with cancer (except basal cell carcinoma) or history of cancer in the last 5
             years (except treated basal cell carcinoma).

          9. Untreated depression or other psychiatric disorder in such way that participation in
             the study may, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the
             subject.

         10. Subjects who are currently taking hypnotics, anxiolytics or other central nervous
             system depressants that, in the Investigator's opinion, may pose a risk of additional
             CNS depression with study medication.

         11. Subjects who are currently taking adjuvant analgesics such as antidepressants and
             anti-convulsants.

         12. Dermatological disorder or non-intact skin at any relevant patch application site that
             precludes proper placement and/or rotation of patch placement.

         13. Subjects who had received an intra-articular steroid injection within 6 weeks prior
             Screening Visit or subjects who require steroid treatment (oral, intra-muscular,
             intra-venous, intra-articular, epidural or other corticosteroid injections) during the
             study period.

         14. Subjects with joint evacuation 6 weeks prior Screening Visit and during the study.

         15. Subjects who are currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI's) or have taken
             MAOI's within 2 weeks before Screening Visit.
