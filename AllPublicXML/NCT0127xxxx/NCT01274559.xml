  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in participants
      with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia, and elevated low density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) to assess the efficacy and safety of extended release (ER)
      niacin/laropiprant [ERN/LRPT (MK-0524A)] when added to the following ongoing lipid-modifying
      therapy (LMT): simvastatin,

      atorvastatin, rosuvastatin monotherapy, ezetimibe/simvastatin fixed dose combination (FDC),
      or any statin co-administered with ezetimibe. The study is based on the hypothesis that
      ERN/LRPT 2 g daily will be superior to placebo at lowering LDL-C at Week 12 of treatment.

    In HPS2-THRIVE, MK-0524A did not meet the primary efficacy objective and there was a
