  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The extent of thyroid resection in benign goiter is controversial. Potential advantages of TT
      over BST may include: one-stage removal of incidental thyroid cancer reported in up to 10% of
      operatively treated benign thyroid diseases, and lower risk for goiter recurrence. However,
      these potential advantages should outweigh the risk of morbidity associated with more radical
      thyroid resection.

      The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of bilateral subtotal (BST) vs. total
      thyroidectomy (TT) for benign bilateral thyroid disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The extent of thyroid resection in bilateral multinodular non-toxic goiter remains
      controversial. Surgeons still continue to debate whether the potential benefits of total
      thyroidectomy outweigh the potential complications. Most low-volume surgeons avoid to perform
      total thyroidectomy owing to the possible complications such as permanent recurrent laryngeal
      nerve palsy and permanent hypoparathyroidism. On the other hand, the increasing number of
      total thyroidectomies are currently performed in high-volume endocrine surgery units, and the
      indication for this procedure include thyroid cancer, Graves disease and multinodular goiter.
      Recently there has been increasing acceptance for performing total thyroidectomy for
      bilateral multinodular non-toxic goiter as it removes the disease process completely, lowers
      local recurrence rate and avoids the substantial risk of reoperative surgery, and involves
      only a minimal risk of morbidity. This common perception is based largely on
      single-institution retrospective data, a few multi-institutional retrospective experiences,
      and only a few small prospective studies comparing the outcomes of total vs. subtotal
      thyroidectomy.
