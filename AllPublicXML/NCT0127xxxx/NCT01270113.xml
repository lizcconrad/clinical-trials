    <textblock>
      China faces the challenge of dual epidemics of drug use and HIV/AIDS. In responding to
      concerns of high rates of HIV/AIDS and other medical consequences among heroin users, China
      has recently implemented methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programs nationwide. One
      problem noted with this rapid expansion is that the dropout rates from MMT have been high.
      The proposed study will adapt a motivational incentives (MI) intervention developed in the
      United States for use in Chinese MMT settings and will pilot test its effectiveness in
      improving treatment compliance and outcomes. The study's primary aims are: 1. to adapt a
      motivational incentives intervention in MMT in China, and 2. to experimentally pilot test the
      motivational incentives intervention. A secondary aim is to explore factors that may
      influence the outcomes of MMT that incorporates a motivational incentives intervention. It is
      hypothesized that the MI intervention can be adapted to Chinese settings and that it will
      optimize the positive outcomes of MMT in reducing HIV risks among heroin abusers. The
      collaborative team includes researchers in American and Chinese institutes (UCLA/Johns
      Hopkins/Washington, Shanghai Mental Health Center, Yunnan Institute for Drug Abuse),
      officials from national and local Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
      providers in local MMT clinics in Shanghai and Yunnan.
