  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Last thirty years, many research was performed concerning pain in the newborn. These
      investigations showed us the negative effects of pain in the neonatal period. Our research
      concerns the choice of analgesics for the premature newborn during a heel lance. Newborns
      with a gestational age of 32-37 weeks are randomly assigned over three groups. They can
      receive breastfeeding, during the heel lance, a bottle with supplemental breast milk or
      sucrose.

      The primary objective of the Amphia Premature Infant Pain study, is to investigate whether
      there is a difference in PIPP-scores in premature newborns who undergo a heel lance,
      receiving breast milk or sucrose. Our hypothesis is that the PIPP-score will be lower in
      newborns receiving breast milk compared to sucrose. And the investigators presume that breast
      feeding has the same analgesic effect as giving supplemental breast milk.

    <measure>Pain scores assessed by the PIPP score</measure>
    <time_frame>The PIPP score will be assessed during a heellance. This heellance will be performed after one day of life and before two months.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome in this trial is the PIPP-score.The PIPP-score is a multidimensional pain assessment measure developed in 1995 . The PIPP-score is validated for procedural and post-operative pain in premature and term newborns.</description>

    <measure>Pain score assessed by the COMFORTneo score</measure>
    <time_frame>The COMFORTneo score will be assessed during a heellance. This heellance will be performed after one day of life and before two months.</time_frame>
    <description>The COMFORTneo is a secondary outcome.The COMFORTneo is a pain assessment measure modified from the COMFORT behaviour scale. In 2009 the COMFORTneo is validated for prolonged pain. The COMFORTneo is not validated for procedural pain yet .</description>

    <measure>partial correlation between the two pain assessment tools.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome is the partial correlation between the PIPP-score and the COMFORTneo score for a heellance in babies born with a postconceptional age between 32 and 37 weeks. When all films are observed, the COMFORTneo scores and PIPP scores are evaluated. We measure a partial correlation coefficient between these scores, to compare these two scores.</description>

    <description>This secondary outcome measure gives us information about the uniformity of the assessment of the films between the three investigators.</description>
