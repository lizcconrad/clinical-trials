  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hospital where this study will be conducted is responsible for the one-year contingency
      management treatment for methamphetamine drug offenders referred from the Yunlin District
      Prosecutors Office. Completing the one-year treatment is prerequisite for offenders to get
      slow prosecutions.

      It is an open-label, parallel-group trial comparing the combination of psychosocial
      intervention and slow prosecutions with psychosocial intervention alone in treating subjects
      with methamphetamine dependence

      Study Hypothesis

        1. Psychosocial interventions in combination with slow prosecutions is more effective than
           psychosocial interventions alone to achieve abstinence for subjects with methamphetamine
           abuse/dependance.

        2. Inclusion of telephone reminding before each visit will enhance the retention rate and
           abstinence rate.

    <description>TSTSU-N stands for Treatment for Schedule Two Substance Use, No Telephone Reminding. Subjects will be referred by the Yunlin District Prosecutors Office for one-year psychosocial interventions to get slow prosecutions. After the referral, they will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either TSTSU-N group or TSTSU-T group. During the intervention, subjects of TSTSU-N will not receive telephone reminding before each visit.</description>

    <description>OPD stands for Outpatient Department.

    <description>The treatment is one-year long and composed of 3 stages of psychosocial intervention. Subjects of TSTSU arms receive urine methamphetamine examinations at each visit, while subjects in OPD arm being tested at first/last visits and during stage changes.
-Stage 1, early intensive monitoring stage: The visit interval is 1 week. If the urine tests and self-report on methamphetamine use are negative for consecutive 4 visits, subjects can proceed to stage 2. (In OPD arm, the visit interval can be 2 weeks according to subjects' requirements.)
-Sage 2, late intensive monitoring stage: The visit interval is 2 week. If the urine tests and self-reports are straightly negative for 4 visits, subjects can proceed to stage 3. Whenever recent methamphetamine is detected, subjects should move back to stage 1.
-Stage 3, usual monitoring stage: The visit interval is 1 month until the end of treatment. Whenever recent methamphetamine is detected, subjects should move back to stage 1.</description>
