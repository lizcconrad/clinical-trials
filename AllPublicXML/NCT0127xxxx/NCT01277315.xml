  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an adult neurodegenerative disease that is caused by a
      selective degeneration of the motor nerve cells in the cortex and myelon. As a result of
      motor neurodegeneration, a progredient paralysis of the extremities and of the speaking,
      swallowing, and breathing musculature develops. ALS leads to death by respiratory
      insufficiency in a mean course of 3-5 years. So far, Riluzole is the only approved
      neuroprotective medication which effects a slight lifespan prolongation of 1.5 - 2.5 months.
      Riluzole inhibits the presynaptic glutamate release and lowers the level of glutamate
      liberated by activated microglia.

      The researchers propose an investigational therapy of ALS with subcutaneous administration of
      100 mg of Anakinra. The neuronal inflammation is a crucial pathogenetic factor of the motor
      neuron degeneration. Inflammatory processes are detectable in sporadic ALS, in the
      autosomal-dominant form of ALS and in transgenic mouse model. The rationale of this clinical
      trial is based on the anti-inflammatory effect of Anakinra. One of the key mediators of
      inflammatory response is Interleukin-1. Anakinra is a recombinant produced Interleukin-1
      receptor antagonist. This gives Anakinra anti-inflammatory attributes that presumably reduce
      motor neuron degeneration and disease progression.
