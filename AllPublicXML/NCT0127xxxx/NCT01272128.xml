      The primary objective is to assess the quality of life of intramuscular (IM) Interferon
      Beta-1a in participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or Clinically
      Isolated Syndrome (CIS) in a clinical practice setting.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed on a visual analog scale from 0 = worst imaginable health status to 100 = best imaginable health status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in EQ-5D VAS at 6, 18 and 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 6, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed on a visual analog scale from 0 = worst imaginable health status to 100 = best imaginable health status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a patient-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a patient's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. The scores are generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate worse health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in EQ-5D Summary Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 5 questions pertaining to specific health states (i.e., mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort, usual activities and anxiety/depression), with three possible answers for each item (1=no problem, 2=moderate problem, 3=severe problem). A summary index with a maximum score of 1 is derived from these five dimensions where a score of 1 indicates the best health state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Convenience</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Convenience will be assessed by a self-administered convenience questionnaire that asks participants about their treatment satisfaction over the past 2 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between VAS and MSIS29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 6, 12, 18 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation between the EQ-5D visual analog scale and Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale 29 scores will be assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient.</description>
