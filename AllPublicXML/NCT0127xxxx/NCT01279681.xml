    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab
      with or without oxaliplatin works in treating older patients with colorectal cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting
      certain cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus bevacizumab is more
      effective with or without oxaliplatin in treating colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of elderly patients with metastatic
      colorectal carcinoma who are randomized to receive fluoropyrimidine (fluorouracil)-based
      therapy plus bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In a prospectively planned pooled analysis with a similar trial to be conducted by the
      Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG), evaluate and compare the overall survival (OS) of
      elderly patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who are randomized to receive
      fluoropyrimidine-based therapy plus bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin.

      II. To assess and compare response rates and adverse events of elderly patients with
      metastatic colorectal carcinoma randomized to receive fluoropyrimidine-based therapy plus
      bevacizumab, with or without oxaliplatin.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and assigned to treatment groups
      based on physician decision for fluoropyrimidine.

      ARM A: Patients receive either 5FU/LV or Capecitabine, plus BEV. 5FU/LV + BEV is comprised of
      5FU IV over 46-48 hours, LV calcium IV over 2 hours, and BEV IV over 10-90 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Capecitabine + BEV is comprised of capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14 and BEV IV over 30-90
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive either mFOLFOX7 plus BEV, or Capecitabine + OXAL (XELOX) plus BEV.
      mFOLFOX7 + BEV is comprised of OXAL IV over 2 hours, LV calcium IV over 2 hours, and 5FU IV
      over 46-48 hours on day 1. Patients also receive BEV IV over 10-90 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. XELOX +
      BEV is comprised of OXAL IV over 2 hours on day 1 and capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14.
      Patients also receive BEV IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Progression free survival was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients were followed until progression (and progression was declared) regardless of whether the patient was on the first line treatment or not. Patients who progress following a missed scan will have their date of progression back-dated to the date of missing scan. Patients without a progression who are still alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Thirty-two participants were enrolled between January 2011 and December 2012. The trial was terminated prematurely due to poor accrual and limited cooperative group resources. All follow-up was discontinued November 1, 2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to randomization, physician chose fluoropyrimidine type [ie, oral Capecitabine (Xeloda) or infusional 5FU]. Patient was randomly assigned to arm A [fluoropyrimidine + bevacizumab (BEV)] or arm B [fluoropyrimidine/oxaliplatin (OXAL) + BEV] using chosen fluoropyrimidine. LV=Leucovorin, mFOLFOX7=5FU+LV+OXAL.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Progression free survival was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients were followed until progression (and progression was declared) regardless of whether the patient was on the first line treatment or not. Patients who progress following a missed scan will have their date of progression back-dated to the date of missing scan. Patients without a progression who are still alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up.</description>

        <description>The various measures of geriatric/frailty (Canadian Geriatric Society [CGSA], Rockwood, and NCCTG measures) will be compared head to head using Bland-Altman methods to assess the differences between clinician and patient reported frailty and the relative information obtained from the various assessments. This will be the first head to head comparison of its type to assess geriatric/frailty measures.</description>

        <description>WIWI will be summarized descriptively to identify the number of patients who were satisfied with each treatment and indications for improvements therein. Proportion of patients' satisfaction will be compared between treatments by a Fisher’s exact test. The impact of the clinical trial on patient QOL will be summarized via means and standard deviations and compared between treatment arms via a Wilcoxon rank sum test.</description>
