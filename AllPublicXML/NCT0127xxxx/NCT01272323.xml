  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma.

      The purpose of this optional observational follow-on study is to further evaluate
      rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on exposure to cat dander in the EEC among subjects who
      completed all dosing visits in study CP005 approximately one year after the start of
      treatment.

      Subjects who completed all dosing visits and the post treatment challenge (PTC) in study
      CP005 will be invited to attend the Screening Visit for CP005A. Subjects will attend for 4
      visits to the EEC on successive days. Following the last EEC visit a follow-up visit will be
      performed 3-10 days later.
