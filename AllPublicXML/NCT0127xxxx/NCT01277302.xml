  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase IV multicenter, randomized, open-label study, with masking of the vision
      examiner, of the efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg in subjects with
      macular edema following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) or Central Retinal Vein
      Occlusion (CRVO).

      This study consisted of 2 study periods, a 7-month fixed treatment period, followed by an
      8-month alternate dose regimen period. Subjects could receive up to a maximum of 15 monthly
      injections of ranibizumab 0.5 mg during the study, 7 injections (Day 0 and at 6 monthly
      visits) in the fixed treatment period and a maximum of 8 injections in the alternate dose
      regimen period. During the fixed treatment period, subjects received 7 monthly intravitreal
      ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections. During the alternate dose regimen period, from Month 7 through
      Month 14, subjects were evaluated monthly to determine whether they achieved the
      study-specific visual acuity and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (VA-OCT)
      stability criteria. Subjects continued to receive monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg monthly
      injections until the VA-OCT stability criteria were first met. Upon meeting the VA-OCT
      stability criteria for the first time during the alternate dose regimen period, subjects were
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 dose regimens, the PRN (pro re nata,
      &quot;as-needed&quot;) or the Monthly regimen.

      PRN randomized subjects: Subjects received no injection at the randomization visit and at
      future monthly visits where the VA-OCT stability criteria were met and received a ranibizumab
      0.5 mg injection at future monthly visits if the VA-OCT stability criteria were not met.

      Monthly randomized subjects: Subjects continued to receive ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections at
      each monthly visit.

      Monthly non-randomized subjects: Subjects who did not meet the VA-OCT stability criteria at
      any month from Month 7 through Month 14 were not randomized and received 8 monthly
      intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections.

    <measure>Trend of Change From Baseline in the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Scores From Month 7 to Month 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 15</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA was measured in the study eye using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity (VA) chart starting at a test distance of 4 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the patient. An increase in the BCVA score indicates an improvement of vision. A positive change score indicates improvement. The reported data are the observed changes from Baseline in BCVA at Months 7 and 15. For the statistical analysis, the interaction term of treatment by time in a longitudinal model was used to assess whether there was a difference in the trend of change from Baseline in the visual acuity scores from Month 7 to Month 15 between the 2 randomized treatment groups, Monthly and PRN.</description>

    <description>BCVA was measured in the study eye using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity (VA) chart starting at a test distance of 4 meters.

    <description>Central foveal thickness was assessed monthly in the study eye using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Central foveal thickness was computed using the automated Cirrus Review software (DOCTR CZM Cirrus OCT Grader Reading Manual, Version 1.02).

    <description>Central foveal thickness was assessed monthly in the study eye using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Central foveal thickness was computed using the automated Cirrus Review software (DOCTR CZM Cirrus OCT Grader Reading Manual, Version 1.02). All participants in the Monthly and PRN groups had a baseline central foveal thickness &gt; 300 µm at baseline. A decrease in foveal thickness suggests a reduction in macular edema. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Trend of Change From Baseline in the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Scores From Month 7 to Month 15</title>
        <description>BCVA was measured in the study eye using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity (VA) chart starting at a test distance of 4 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the patient. An increase in the BCVA score indicates an improvement of vision. A positive change score indicates improvement. The reported data are the observed changes from Baseline in BCVA at Months 7 and 15. For the statistical analysis, the interaction term of treatment by time in a longitudinal model was used to assess whether there was a difference in the trend of change from Baseline in the visual acuity scores from Month 7 to Month 15 between the 2 randomized treatment groups, Monthly and PRN.</description>
