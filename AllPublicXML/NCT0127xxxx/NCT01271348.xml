        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated informed consent prior to participation

          -  Subjects in good health as determined by the Investigator

          -  Age 18-40 or 50-70

          -  BMI &gt; 20 and &lt; 30

          -  Pain in the target muscle (thigh) during muscle contraction of at least 5 on an 11
             point categorical pain rating scale

          -  Willing to abstain from any physical therapy, hard physical work, exercise or sauna
             during the study treatment periods (Screening to Final Visit)

          -  For females, subjects of childbearing potential (including peri-menopausal women who
             have had a menstrual period within 1 year) must be using appropriate birth control
             (defined as a method which results in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year
             when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, some intrauterine
             contraceptive devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner). Oral
             contraceptive medications are not allowed in this study. Female subjects, who are
             surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)
             are allowed for participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another clinical study within the last 30 days and during the study

          -  Subjects who are inmates of psychiatric wards, prisons, or other state institutions

          -  Investigator or any other team member involved directly or indirectly in the conduct
             of the clinical study

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Malignancy within the past 2 years with the exception of in situ removal of basal cell
             carcinoma

          -  Known hypersensitivity to etoricoxib or other NSAIDÂ´s including Cox-2, or any of their
             excipients

          -  Bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal congestion, angioneurotic edema, urticaria or
             allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs including Cox-2 inhibitors

          -  Major traumatic lesions (e.g. fracture, tendon or muscle ruptures) of the
             musculo-sceletal system of the lower limbs

          -  Pain conditions which might interfere with pain rating during the study, e.g.
             neuropathic pain

          -  Significant neurological or psychiatric symptoms resulting in disorientation, memory
             impairment, or inability to report accurately (e.g. depressive disorders, Alzheimer's
             disease, schizophrenia or other psychosis), that in the investigator's opinion may
             affect efficacy or safety assessments or may compromise subject safety during the
             study

          -  Heart failure (NYHA II-IV)

          -  Long term blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mm Hg without adequate treatment

          -  Peripheral arterial disease, coronary heart disease and/or cerebrovascular disease

          -  History of stroke or myocardial infarction

          -  Clinically relevant ECG changes

          -  Estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min

          -  Liver dysfunction (e.g. defined by ALT and/or AST levels above upper limit of normal
             range)

          -  Coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis, or concomitant use of anticoagulants including low
             dose aspirin

          -  History of pancreatitis, peptic ulcers or gastrointestinal bleedings

          -  Inflammatory GI disease (e.g. M. Crohn, colitis ulcerosa)

          -  Any other analgesic therapy including cough and cold drugs containing analgesic
             properties as well as any other substance used for the treatment of pain during the
             study observation period (Screening to final Visit)

          -  Any other drug that might alter pain perception like CNS active drugs

          -  Statins within 3 months of screening and throughout the study

          -  Oral anticonceptives
