      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of taste on swallowing efficiency, to
      evaluate the effect of temperature on swallowing efficiency, and to evaluate the effect of
      viscosity on swallowing efficiency.

      Swallowing problems (dysphagia) are encountered frequently in primary practice and in the
      hospital setting. The list of possible causes is large, ranging from strokes and neurological
      disease to complications of cancer treatment, acid reflux, and surgery. Many patients have a
      reduced ability to feel food and fluid (reduced sensation) within the throat (pharynx) and
      this leads to an inability to manipulate food and fluids in the correct manner. This can
      produce a variety of swallowing problems such as choking on foods and fluids, regurgitation,
      aspiration, weight loss, malnutrition and poor quality of life.

      Treatment of dysphagia is largely directed at rehabilitation of muscle power and education
      about safe swallowing techniques or positioning that limits food and fluid from entering the
      airway. One of the most widely accepted treatments of dysphagia is to alter the texture of
      food. Most patients with dysphagia will have more difficulty swallowing thin liquids. By
      adding a thickener to the liquid, a food bolus becomes more cohesive, and is less likely to
      become aspirated. Various types of thickening products are available over-the-counter without
      a prescription. These thickening products are bland and currently have no flavor. We
      hypothesize that alterations in food taste (sweet, salty, etcâ€¦), viscosity, and temperature,
      will improve swallowing efficiency. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the
      effects of food taste, texture, and temperature on swallowing efficiency. The goal is to
      develop safer, better tasting food products and improve the quality of life in patients with
      disabling swallowing disorders.

    <description>Digital accelerometry is a non-invasive method of measuring swallowing efficiency. A surface sensor is taped to the skin over the region of the thyroid prominence. When the patient swallows, the sensors measures upward acceleration of the thyroid cartilage and a measurement of swallowing amplitude, a surrogate measure for swallowing efficiency, is obtained.</description>
