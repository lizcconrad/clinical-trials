    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility of assessing sleep and circadian rhythmicity in
      critically ill patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Secondarily, it will examine the
      feasibility of reducing subject exposure to environmental light and noise and of delivering
      routine care according to classical day/night routines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 million patients develop respiratory failure annually in the United States; yet, the
      sleep of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation has received little attention. This
      protocol enrolls acutely ill medical patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. The
      feasibility of assessing sleep and circadian rhythmicity through the use of continuous
      bedside polysomnography and the measurement of core body temperature and urinary hormonal
      levels at frequent intervals will be explored. As a secondary goal, the feasibility of
      delivering routine care according to classical day/night routines, and of employing various
      noise and light reduction strategies at night, will be explored in a subset of subjects.

The normal timing of peak melatonin excretion was considered to be between midnight and 05:00.

      <pre_assignment_details>Two subjects were withdrawn by the PI after consent but prior to randomization, when they acutely developed exclusion criteria. One additional subject was withdrawn by the surrogate decision-maker prior to the initiation of the study.

Usual Care was provided outside of this interval. Environmental modification consisted of nursing-related efforts to optimize daytime light exposure, to minimize nighttime light and noise exposure, and to batch nursing care at night.</description>

          <description>This study assesses the feasibility of studying sleep and circadian rhythmicity in acutely ill, mechanically ventilated patients through the application of continuous bedside polysomnography. Feasibility will be assessed by determining the percentage of enrolled subjects who undergo at least 24 hours of continuous bedside polysomnography.</description>
