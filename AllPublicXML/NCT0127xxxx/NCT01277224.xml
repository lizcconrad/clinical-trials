  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a recreational physical
      activity intervention (RPAI) for reducing the prevalence of overweight/obesity and other
      cardiovascular risk factors

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight in Spanish children in the puberty age is among the highest in
      the world and increasing quickly. The investigators recently evaluated an after-school
      program of recreational physical activity to control obesity and other cardiovascular risk
      factors in primary school children in Cuenca. This program, known as the Movi program,
      reduced adiposity, increased serum apolipoprotein (apo) A-I concentration and reduced apo B
      concentration over one-year period.

      Though the intervention MOVI had great acceptance between the children and his families, and
      it demonstrated to be effective opposite to the obesity, his results were relatively modest.
      For it, our hypothesis of work, which justifies this new project, is that a major intensity
      of the intervention, and a major weekly duration extending this one to the weekend, it might
      improve the efficiency on the obesity.

    <description>In the Movi2 program we will perform a recreational physical activity intervention during one year that include standardized recreative and non competitive activities conducted by sports instructors. It consisted of two 90-min after school sessions per week on school days and one 150-minute session on Saturday morning.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The Boards of Governors (community participatory organ in each school) and the children's
        parents will inform of the study's aims and methods, and give their written consent to the
        children's participation. Similarly, the study will present classroom-by-classroom to the
        children, and their oral consent will obtain. Participant children will be free of serious
        learning difficulties, or physical or mental disorders, that could impede participation in
        the scheduled physical activities.
