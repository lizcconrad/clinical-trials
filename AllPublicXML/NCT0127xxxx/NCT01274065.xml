  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no common rule as to how a drug will affect patients. This is due to the effect
      specific DNA sequences of genes have on drug response, by the effect they have on how
      medications are metabolized. The primary objective of this research is to optimize medication
      therapy and to reduce the number of medications used, specifically medications for people
      with developmental disabilities and co-occuring psychiatric illnesses.

      The primary goal of this study is to develop a process for utilizing pharmacogenomic analysis
      as a strategy to improve the quality of life, safety, decrease medication burden, and enhance
      the effectiveness of medications in people with psychiatric illnesses and developmental
      disabilities. Ultimately, this inter-disciplinary service could be developed into a standard
      screening and consultation tool for healthcare providers to utilize when determining the most
      appropriate medication for their patients.
