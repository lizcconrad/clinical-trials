  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) are known to have an increased risk of developing late
      treatment sequelae such as cardiovascular events due to coronary artery disease. At present
      no active screening is performed in these patients since it is not known whether screening
      and subsequent treatment by means of revascularization is effective in reducing the risk of
      cardiovascular events in symptomatic individuals. In the trial the efficacy and therapeutic
      consequences of screening for coronary artery diasease by multi-slice CT (MSCT) among
      asymptomatic HL survivors will be evaluated.

      Objectives:

        1. to determine whether MSCT as a screening method of HL survivors treated with mediastinal
           irradiation accurately identifies asymptomatic significant coronary artery disease.

        2. to establish the prevelance of coronary abnormalities in HL survivors treated with
           mediastinal irradiation

        3. to determine the frequency and type of intervention

        4. to evaluate the acceptance of screening and asses quality of life among Hl survivors.

      Study polulation:

      50 long term survivors of HL, previously treatef with mediastinal irradiation without present
      evidence of cardiovascular disease

      Intervention:

      CT-coronary angiography and calcium score, to be performed as a screening method (to indicate
      further diagnostic treatent procedures)
