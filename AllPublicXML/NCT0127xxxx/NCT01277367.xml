      physical activity behaviour, in a cohort of newly-enrolled, adult members of the Vitality
      health promotion programme based in South Africa.

      Newly enrolled adult members of the Discovery Health medical plan who have, themselves,
      prospectively registered for the Vitality health promotion programme will be eligible for the
      study, and will be invited to participate by Discovery Vitality. A final sample of 9000 adult
      members, who are recruited and have agreed to participate, will be randomly allocated by
      Discovery Vitality (with replacement) to one of six study (incentive) groups (n=1500 per
      group) and followed for six months.
