      (IHBG-10) on weight change and changes in body composition in subjects who have just started
      taking (for less than three months) certain anti-psychotic medications (Risperdal, Seroquel,

      A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled in this study. They will be randomized in to one of
      two groups. One group (of 20 subjects) will take 500 mg of the investigational product
      (IHBG-10) 15 minutes prior to the three main meals of the day; subjects will continue to take
      their prescribed anti-psychotic medications. The other group (of 10 subjects) will take a
      placebo 15 minutes prior to the three main meals of the day; subjects will continue to take
      their prescribed anti-psychotic medications. Subjects will take the investigational product
      or placebo for 12 weeks. Participation in this study involves 4 study visits.
