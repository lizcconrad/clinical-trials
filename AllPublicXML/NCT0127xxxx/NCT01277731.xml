  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexamethasone is a potent synthetic member of the corticosteroid. It is given to cancer
      patients undergoing chemotherapy to counteract emetic side effect and essential drug for the
      chemotherapy-treated patients. Hiccup is common adverse effect of corticosteroid especially
      on dexamethasone varying from 3% to 60% of given patients. Discontinuance of dexamethasone
      relieves most hiccupping cases, but vomiting/nausea rates increase. It is not clear whether
      hiccup side effect is limited to the dexamethasone only or other corticosteroid group.

      Methylprednisolone, synthetic corticosteroid as similar as dexamethasone, could be considered
      as antiemetic agent for the patients with receiving chemotherapy. The investigators perform
      this pilot study under hypothesis that replacing dexamethasone with methylprednisolone could
      maintain antiemetic role and prevent hiccup.

    <description>This study will enroll the patients who were previously experienced dexamethasone-induced hiccup. Patients who experienced dexamethasone-induced hiccup during chemotherapy will enroll to study arm.
Run-in period * Dexamethasone 10mg-20mg q day iv during chemotherapy
▶ measure hiccup and nausea/vomiting severity
Treatment period * Methylprednisolone 60mg-125mg iv during chemotherapy
▶ measure hiccup and nausea/vomiting severity
Response will be evaluated by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE) and NRS to hiccup at 24hrs after start methylprednisolone.
Nausea and vomiting will be assessed as CTCAE 4.0</description>
