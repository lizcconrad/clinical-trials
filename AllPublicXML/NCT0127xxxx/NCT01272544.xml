      The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess the oral health of individuals attending a
      mother-child dental care program (PPPWB). The mean DMFT and GBI in the second phase and the
      control group were 0.75 and 6.75, 1.47 and 10.74, respectively. It was concluded that the
      individuals who attended the PPPWB had better oral health status than the control group. When
      the two phases of the study were compared, it was noted that the individuals in the second
      phase had better oral health, although they had a higher score for gingival bleeding.

      The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess the oral health of individuals attending a
      mother-child dental care program (PPPWB). Letters were sent to the 343 children who were
      examined in phase 1. One hundred and thirty nine individuals returned for the oral
      examination - experimental group (40.5%). The control group consisted of 139 individuals who
      did not receive dental care from the PPPWB. These individuals were paired to the experimental
      group according to their age and socio-demographic characteristics. Gingival bleeding (GBI)
      and DMFT indices were used in order to determine the children's oral health status. The mean
      DMFT and GBI in the second phase and the control group were 0.75 and 6.75, 1.47 and 10.74,
      respectively. It was concluded that the individuals who attended the PPPWB had better oral
      health status than the control group. When the two phases of the study were compared, it was
      noted that the individuals in the second phase had better oral health, although they had a
      higher score for gingival bleeding.

        Letters were sent to 343 of the examined children, inviting the guardians to take their
        children for an oral health assessment at the children's dental clinic at UFPI. The number
        of children that returned for an examination was 139, and these individuals comprised the
        experimental group.

        Control Group After assessing the characteristics of the experimental group, the control
        group was determined and consisted of 139 individuals (93 females and 46 males) who were
        paired to the experimental group according to their socio-demographic characteristics and
        age but who had not attended the PPPWB.

        The study hypothesis is that individuals who attended the PPPWB have better oral health
        than those who did not attend it.
