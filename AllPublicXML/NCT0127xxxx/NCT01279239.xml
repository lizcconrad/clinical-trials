      Metabonomics is a set of measurements of the dynamic metabolic responses of living systems to
      stimuli or modifications. This field of study developed from the application of nuclear
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry as tools for the study of complex
      biofluids. Metabonomics is one of the emerging fields of systemic biology researches
      concerned with the high-throughput identification, quantification and characterization of
      small molecule metabolites. A metabonomics fingerprinting can be defined as the complete
      complement of all small molecule (&lt;1500 Da) metabolites found in a specific cell, body fluid,
      organ or organism.

      Severe poly trauma involves complex injuries that consist of multiple pathological mechanisms
      involving cytotoxic, oxidation stress and immune-endocrine. The complexity of the
      pathological physiology and biochemistry process are determined not only by the initial
      mechanical assault, but also by secondary processes including abnormality of inflammation
      regulation, ischemia, anoxia, free-radical formation, and immune dysfunction that occur over
      hours and days following the injury. For the clinical perspective, one of the key
      difficulties is to identify the most at-risk patients who could develop multiple organ
      failures and consequently death.

      This study aims to establish the dynamics of NMR-based metabonomics fingerprinting of severe
      multi-trauma patients in order to provide a possible multiple organs failure (MOF) or death
      event prediction.
