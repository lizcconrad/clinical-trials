      This study seeks to establish evidence:

        1. that physiologic changes, unrelated to effect on the PAH enzyme, occur in PKU patients
           who are treated with Kuvan® therapy,

        2. that these changes may be caused by enhanced neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain or
           an upregulation of gene expression (increasing the ability of genes to produce
           functional enzymes),

        3. and that beneficial changes in behavior and cognition, especially executive functioning
           skills may result.

      The objective of this study is to correlate any change in behavior and executive function
      skills of PKU patients who are non-responsive to sapropterin effect on the PAH enzyme, as
      defined by lowered blood PHE levels, with urine neurotransmitter levels and broad gene
      expression prior to and after sapropterin administration.

      Expected outcomes would include evidence of sapropterin effects on upregulation of enzymes
      other than PAH that control neurotransmitter synthesis, and any resulting correlation with
      behavioral and cognitive changes.

      The investigators hope this study will inform further detailed investigations into the
      biochemical and molecular actions of sapropterin (Kuvan®) that lead to increased
      understanding of possible treatment effects beyond a lowered blood PHE response.

      The study participant population will include approximately 30 established PKU patients
      receiving care from Hayward Genetics Center, who were found previously to exhibit no decrease
      in blood PHE levels (nonresponders) with administration of sapropterin. Subjects will act as
      their own controls. Primary endpoints will be measurement of behavioral and cognitive
      function, neurotransmitter levels, and gene expression of enzyme activity after 4 weeks on
      treatment compared to baseline levels.

      At study baseline each patient will attend an approximately 1 hour clinic visit at their
      usual genetics clinic location. Study purpose, design, and requirements will be discussed,
      and consents/assents reviewed and signed.

      Rating inventories of executive function performance and behavior (BASC-2 and BRIEF tools)
      will be administered to patients and parents by the PI and/or the Study Coordinator.

      Urine samples will be collected non-invasively for measurement of neurotransmitter levels.
      Blood will be collected by venipuncture (3-5 ml) for microarray expression analysis and
      analysis of plasma amino acids. 3-day food records previously provided to participants for
      completion will be collected.

      Participants will be provided with a 4 week supply of Kuvan® and instructions on how to take
      the medication during the study period. The importance of maintaining usual dietary intake
      (food choices and metabolic formula) to minimize any research effect not attributable to
      sapropterin administration will be emphasized. Sapropterin will be discontinued at the end of
      the 4 week study period.

      All of these measures will be repeated at the same sites with study participants at the end
      of week 4 of the study period.

      At the ends of weeks 1 and 2 additional blood samples will be sent to Hayward Genetics Center
      for measurement of PHE and TYR levels to ascertain no significant changes have occurred in a
      patient's usuual dietary intake. These samples will be drawn at each patient's local state
      health unit, as is done for usual monitoring. Nutrient analysis of the 3-day food diaries
      will be conducted at Hayward Genetics Center.

        1. Behavior and executive function will be assessed using published validated inventories
           for ages 2-21 years, completed as patient self-reports and as parent (or guardian)
           reports when appropriate. Instruments used will be the Behavioral Assessment System for
           Children (BASC-2) parental Rating Scale and Self-Reporting Personality Rating Scale, and
           the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) Parent Form Instruments of
           Executive Function. Completed inventories will be scored using electronic evaluation
           instruments by the Study Coordinator and PI, with consultation from Harvard Medical
           Center experts as needed.

        2. Urine samples will be non-invasively collected and sent for analysis of catechols and
           neurotransmitters to an NIH laboratory specializing in this technique. Samples will be
           blinded to prevent bias.

        3. Microarray analysis of blood samples will be conducted at Hayward Genetics Molecular
           Laboratory to determine any effect on gene expression, and thus enzyme activity, as a
           result of sapropterin administration.

        4. Plasma amino acids will be analyzed at Hayward Genetics Biochemical Laboratory to
           document that patients are &quot;nonresponsive&quot; to sapropterin (no resultant lowering of
           blood PHE); and to monitor any changes in plasma amino acids that could indicate a
           patient's failure to maintain usual dietary restrictions

        5. 3-day food diaries completed by patients (or parent/guardians) at home will document any
           substantive changes in usual dietary intake during the study period. These will be
           analyzed at Hayward Genetics Center using the MetabolicPro web-based analysis program.
