  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by progressive
      deterioration in the function of the pancreatic beta-cells, which are the cells that produce
      and secrete insulin (the hormone primarily responsible for the handling of glucose in the
      body). We propose a double-blind, randomized controlled study comparing the effect of
      liraglutide (a novel anti-diabetic drug with beta-cell protective potential) versus placebo,
      on the preservation of beta-cell function over one year in patients with T2DM. This study may
      demonstrate an important beta-cell protective capacity of liraglutide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with type 2 diabetes who meet randomization criteria will be
      randomized to either liraglutide or placebo, with serial assessment of beta-cell function
      over 48 weeks follow-up. The hypothesis under study is whether liraglutide can preserve
      beta-cell function.

    <measure>Preservation of beta-cell function measured by Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>48-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ISSI-2 is a validated OGTT-derived measure of beta-cell function analogous to the disposition index obtained from the intravenous glucose tolerance test. ISSI-2 is defined as the product of (i) insulin secretion measured by the ratio of the area-under-the-insulin-curve (AUCins) to the area-under-the-glucose curve (AUCgluc) and (ii) insulin sensitivity measured by the Matsuda index.</description>
