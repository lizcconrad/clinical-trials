  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, prospective, observational study will assess the correlation between the
      time from start of chemotherapy to the start of Avastin (bevacizumab) treatment with
      progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer.
      Patients will be followed for up to 12 months after progressive disease occurs.
