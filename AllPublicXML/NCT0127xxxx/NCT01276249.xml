      The Aptus Endosystems STAPLE International Post-Market Registry is intended to expand the
      clinical knowledge base by including 'real world' subjects.

      All subjects diagnosed with a qualifying AAA suitable for elective endovascular repair, who
      meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the registry, are eligible for enrollment and
      should be offered informed consent to participate.

    <description>The second primary endpoint is associated with the safety profile of the device, and is defined as the percent of patients experiencing one or more of major adverse events (MAE) within one month of implantation. MAE are defined as any one of the following events:
Death
Myocardial Infarction
Stroke (excludes TIA)
Renal failure (excludes renal insufficiency)
Respiratory Failure (excludes COPD or pulmonary complications)
Paralysis (excludes paraparesis)</description>

    <time_frame>1-Month, 6-Months and 12-Months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Success is defined as Successful Deployment of the Fortevo Endograft at the intended location and the absence of:
Death as a result of aneurysm-related treatment
Type I or III endoleak
Fortevo Endograft infection
Fortevo Endograft thrombosis
Fortevo Endograft dilatation by 20% or more in diameter
Fortevo Endograft migration by 10mm or more at the proximal neck at 6-M and 12-M
Loss of Fortevo Endograft or Heli-FX EndoAnchor System integrity
Aneurysm expansion by 5mm (or more) in maximal diameter at 6-M and 12-M
Aneurysm rupture
