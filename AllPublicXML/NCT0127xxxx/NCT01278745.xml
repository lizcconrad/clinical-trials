  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All people who have a heart transplant are at risk for developing cardiac allograft
      vasculopathy (CAV). CAV means narrowing of the heart transplant vessels, which is associated
      with poor heart transplant function. People who develop antibodies after transplant have a
      higher risk of developing CAV. Infections, high cholesterol, and rejection also increase the
      risk of developing CAV. People who develop CAV usually have to receive another transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if a study drug called rituximab (Rituxan®)
      prevents CAV. Rituximab destroys certain types of white blood cells called B cells. B cells
      are important cells in the immune system that help the body fight infection by producing
      substances called antibodies. B cells and the antibodies they produce are also involved in
      some kinds of rejection after organ transplantation. Rituximab decreases the number of B
      cells in the blood and other tissues. The goal of this study is to determine if decreasing B
      cells with Rituximab can prevent injury to the transplanted heart.

    <measure>Number of Episodes of Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (BPAR) of Any Grade Per Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of times a participant experienced biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR). Biopsy proven acute rejection is when an examination of tissue removed from the transplanted organ indicates that the subject's immune system is trying to reject the graft. BPAR was defined as a biopsy that met the International Society for Heart &amp; Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria to be graded as 1R or greater rejection and was determined by a single, central pathology laboratory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of BPAR (Any Grade)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects who experienced any grade of biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR) within the clinical trial. Biopsy proven acute rejection is when an examination of tissue removed from the transplanted organ indicates that the subject's immune system is trying to reject the graft. BPAR was defined as a biopsy which met The International Society for Heart &amp; Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria to be graded as 1R or greater rejection and was determined by a single, central pathology laboratory.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of AMR</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who experienced antibody- mediated rejection (AMR). Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) occurs when the subject develops antibodies directed against the transplanted heart. This was assessed based on local pathology biopsy reads.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Cellular Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cellular Rejection refers to the organ recipient's immune system recognizing a transplanted organ as foreign and mounting a response to it via cellular mechanisms. Cellular rejection was defined as a biopsy which met The International Society for Heart &amp; Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria to be graded as 1R or greater rejection and was determined by a single, central pathology laboratory</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Any Treated Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who were treated by their local physician for any type of rejection including, but not limited to cellular rejection and antibody- mediated rejection (AMR) of the transplanted heart regardless of the presence of a biopsy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Episodes of Rejection Associated With Hemodynamic Compromise (HDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants that experienced at least one episode of rejection associated with hemodynamic compromise (HDC). Rejection associated with HDC is when there is insufficient blood flow to the transplanted heart in association with acute rejection found in a biopsy. Local biopsies were used for this outcome measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Development of Angiographically Evident Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is an aggressive form of atherosclerosis that is characterized by the development of fibrosis affecting cardiac arteries that result in concentric narrowing of the arteries and, ultimately allograft failure. Development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy can be diagnosed via an angiograph which is an X-ray of the cardiac arteries by injecting a radiopaque substance such as iodine.</description>

          <title>Rituximab</title>
          <description>Induction: Rituximab was administered in 2 1000 mg doses on Day 0 and Day 12 (+/- 2 days). Maintenance: Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) was given at a starting dose of 2-3 g by mouth or intravenously per day in 2 or 3 divided doses. Investigator could choose an alternative treatment if needed. Methylprednisolone/Prednisone dosing was administered according to the local center standard. After 6 months, prednisone was withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator. The suggested oral prednisone taper was Day 14: 20 mg/day by mouth, Day 30: 15 mg/day by mouth, Day 90: 10 mg/day by mouth, Day 180: 5 mg/day by mouth, and greater than Day 180: 0-5 mg/day by mouth. Tacrolimus, was administered per site standards to attain target trough levels. The target whole blood tacrolimus concentrations were as follows: Day 1-30 post transplant 10-20 ng/mL and Day 31-Month 12 5-15 ng/mL.</description>

        <title>Incidence of BPAR (Any Grade)</title>
        <description>The number of subjects who experienced any grade of biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR) within the clinical trial. Biopsy proven acute rejection is when an examination of tissue removed from the transplanted organ indicates that the subject’s immune system is trying to reject the graft. BPAR was defined as a biopsy which met The International Society for Heart &amp; Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria to be graded as 1R or greater rejection and was determined by a single, central pathology laboratory.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Development of Angiographically Evident Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy</title>
        <description>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is an aggressive form of atherosclerosis that is characterized by the development of fibrosis affecting cardiac arteries that result in concentric narrowing of the arteries and, ultimately allograft failure. Development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy can be diagnosed via an angiograph which is an X-ray of the cardiac arteries by injecting a radiopaque substance such as iodine.</description>
