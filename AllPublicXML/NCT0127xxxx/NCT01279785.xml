  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label study of up to 20 patients with prostate cancer scheduled
      for prostatectomy at the NIH Clinical Center. 123I-MIP-1072 image data will be evaluated for
      visible uptake and compared with histopathology.

      This is an exploratory, single arm, open label pilot study evaluation of 123I-MIP-1072
      intraprostatic uptake determination by SPECT/CT imaging (and optional CGCP imaging), with
      histological confirmation of disease localization and staging. Methodical evaluation of
      123I-MIP-1072 in intraprostatic tumorous and non-tumours regions will provide important
      preliminary data upon which further clinical studies can be based. The optional additional
      CGCP imaging was added, because of its inherent potential for higher resolution scintigraphic
      detection of 123I-MIP-1072 localization. This imaging feasibility data will provide important
      preliminary information for the use of CGCP imaging in prostate cancer.

        Up to twenty adult men with biopsy confirmed prostate cancer scheduled for prostatectomy at
        the NIH Clinical Center will undergo 123I-MIP-1072 SPECT/CT and optional CGCP imaging prior
        to prostatectomy. These patients will also have undergone/will undergo multi-parametric 3T
        MR imaging at NIH which is considered standard of care at NIH clinical center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be scheduled to undergo standard of care prostatectomy for presumed
             localized prostate cancer at the NIH Clinical Center.

          -  Have had or will undergo multiparametric endorectal coil 3T MR at the NIH clinical
             center

          -  Recent (within 12 months of study entry) trans-rectal biopsy indicating the presence
             of adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland

          -  Participant must be 18 years or older.

          -  ECOG Performance grade of 0 to 2. (see Appendix 1)

          -  Ability to understand and provide informed consent. All subjects must sign a document
             of informed consent indicating their understanding of the investigational nature and
             risks of the study before any protocol related studies are performed.

          -  Participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an acceptable form of birth
             control, defined as abstinence, barrier or other acceptable, effective contraceptive
             method until 7 days after the infusion of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants for whom participating would significantly delay the scheduled standard
             of care therapy.

          -  Subjects must not have prostate biopsies performed within 12 weeks before imaging; or
             within 8 weeks before imaging providing that the absence of hemorrhage is confirmed by
             MR imaging.

          -  SGOT and SGPT ≥ 2 x of the upper limits of normal; total bilirubin, of ≥ 1.5 x the

          -  Subjects weighing ≥350 lbs or are unable to fit within the imaging gantry

             objectives or completing the study.
