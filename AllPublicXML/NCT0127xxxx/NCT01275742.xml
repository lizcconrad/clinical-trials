  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) affects 5 million people in the US and is the most common cause of
      hospitalization in elderly adults. One-third of patients who are hospitalized with HF have
      major depression. Depressed HF patients have double the rates of morbidity and/or mortality
      and worse health-related quality of life than non-depressed HF patients. The investigators
      previous pilot research suggests that a brief Cognitive Therapy (CT) intervention may improve
      short-term cardiac survival among depressed hospitalized HF patients compared to
      non-depressed HF patients who received usual care. Therefore, the investigators will conduct
      a larger study to evaluate the effects of the intervention on longer cardiac event-free
      survival, symptoms of depression, health-related quality of life, and stress levels in
      patients with HF. The investigators hypothesize that patients in the intervention group will
      experience longer cardiac event-free survival, lower levels of depressive symptom, better
      health-related quality of life, and lower salivary cortisol levels at follow-up than patients
      who receive usual care.

    <description>The intervention group will receive an individual, 30 minute, scripted cognitive therapy session. This intervention will be delivered by an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse or a trained research nurse. An iPad will guide the outline of the intervention. The nurse will discuss depression in heart disease and the connection between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. The nurse will ask the patient to describe a recent stressful experience and discuss thoughts that the patient has been experiencing. Two techniques for challenging negative thinking will be introduced to the patient: thought stopping and affirmations. The nurse will ask the patient to practice these techniques at home. After the patient has practiced both techniques, the nurse will leave the patient with a booklet with the intervention. At 1-2 weeks, the nurse will administer a booster session over the phone. This session will last 10-15 minutes and will reinforce the techniques learned during the brief CT intervention.</description>
