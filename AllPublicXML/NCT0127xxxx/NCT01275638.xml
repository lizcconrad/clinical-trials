    <textblock>
      Despite the new developments in sepsis treatment, mortality rate is still high. Discussions
      on steroid treatment in sepsis are going on. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
      effects of moderate dosage steroid treatment and endocrinologic changes occurring in sepsis
      on prognosis in patients with sepsis.

      This prospective, randomized, single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was
      conducted between April 2005 and May 2008 in the department of Medical ICU and the Department
      of Infectious Diseases of Erciyes University Medical School. The study was approved by our
      Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from the patients' relatives.
      The study did not alter therapy, and each patient's clinical care was determined by their own
      physician.

    <description>Soon after the presumptive diagnosis of severe sepsis, initial laboratory specimens were obtained within 2 hours, and the patients were randomized to treatment with prednisolone or placebo groups. The treatment groups were determined by a computer-generated randomization procedure (in a 1:1 ratio). The steroid group received prednisolone at a moderate-dose (20 mg/day). Prednisolone was given intravenously at 06.00 (10 mg) 14.00 (5 mg) and 22.00 (5 mg) for 10 days. The standard therapy group received a placebo infusion containing physiological saline solution in an identical manner. Patients and their primary physicians were blinded as to which therapy was administered.</description>
