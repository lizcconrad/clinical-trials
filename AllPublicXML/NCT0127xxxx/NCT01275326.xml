  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outbreaks of emerging and re-remerging infectious diseases are frequently reported
      internationally in recent years, mainly due to global climate change, close human-livestock
      contact in developing countries, and globalization. Thus prevention, monitoring and control
      of infectious diseases are in urgent need to protect public health. High exposure risk to
      various infectious agents in health care facilities is of special concern, especially to
      airborne and droplet-borne respiratory diseases. To protect the health of public and health
      care workers the investigators will conduct a study to monitor indoor air quality and
      essential infectious aerosols in hospital(s).

      A questionnaire survey will be used to evaluate the relationships between employees' health
      and measured indoor environmental factors. The investigators will also examine whether the
      current indoor air quality recommendation of their country can reasonably reduce the risk of
      hospital infection. In addition, simple infectious aerosol indices will be established for
      future environmental management and monitoring in health care facilities.
