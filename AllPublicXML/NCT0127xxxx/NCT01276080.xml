      This open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose
      crossover study was conducted to compare the relative bioavailability of equal doses of the
      test and reference products under non-fasted conditions. The study was conducted with 36 (31
      completing) healthy adults in accordance with Protocol No. 10940308 (Revision 0). In each
      study period, a single 10 mg tablet of donepezil hydrochloride was administered to all
      subjects following a standardized high fat, high calorie breakfast, preceded by an overnight
      fast of at least 10 hours. The test formulation was donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg tablet (OHM
      Laboratories, Inc., USA a subsidiary of Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. USA) and the reference
      formulation was ARICEPT® (donepezil hydrochloride) 10 mg Tablets (Eisai Inc.). The subjects
      received the test product in one study period and the reference product in the other period;
      the order of administration was according to the dosing randomization schedule. Subjects were
      confined at the clinical facility from at least 10.5 hours prior to dosing until after the 24
      hour blood collection. Subjects returned to the clinical facility for the 36, 48, and 72 hour
      blood sample collection. There was a 28-day interval between treatments.

      Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at intervals over 72 hours after dosing in each
      period. The plasma samples from all subjects were shipped to Warnex Bioanalytical Services
      for determination of donepezil concentrations.

      Statistical analysis was performed by Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited to compare the
      bioequivalence of the test formulation to the reference product. Bioequivalence was
      determined based on the confidence intervals for the major pharmacokinetic parameters,
      AUC0-72 and Cmax, for donepezil.

             study. The use of any type of hormonal contraception is not allowed.

          3. Good health as determined by lack of clinically significant abnormalities in health
             assessments performed at screening.
