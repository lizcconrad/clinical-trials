  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will first increase the accessibility and acceptability of rapid HIV testing in
      health clinics located in or near four low-income communities in San Salvador, El Salvador.
      The investigators will use crack users' social networks and small incentives, as recommended
      by the CDC, in collaboration with the Salvadoran Ministry of Public Health and Social
      Assistance (MSPAS) to encourage crack users to receive HIV testing. The second part of the
      intervention consists of training 8 Peer Leaders to recruit and lead a Peer Network
      Intervention among 400 crack users to change norms supporting HIV protective behaviors. The
      intervention will include monthly meetings open to crack using and non-crack using community
      residents to reinforce HIV risk reduction skills, and discussion of other topics related to
      HIV such as illicit drug use and interpersonal violence and community-wide HIV awareness
      events. Our hypothesis is that these two intervention features will singly, and in
      combination, reduce HIV risk behaviors among Salvadoran crack users.
