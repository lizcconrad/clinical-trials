  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MabThera (rituximab) in patients
      with active rheumatoid arthritis who are receiving methotrexate, and who have a previous or
      current inadequate response to one prior anti-TNF therapy. All patients will receive MabThera
      1000 mg as an intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15. After the initial study phase of 24
      weeks, eligible patients may receive one re-treatment with MabThera. The anticipated time on
      study treatment is 48 weeks.

    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 of Initial treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The EULAR response criteria were based on the assessment of disease activity using the DAS28. The EULAR response criteria included not only change in disease activity but current disease activity. To be classified as responders, participants had to have a significant change in DAS28 and a low current disease activity. There were 4 categories of EULAR response rates: good, moderate, good/moderate, and none. The DAS28 scoring used 4 core components: SJC, TJC, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, and ESR. The DAS28 has a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 9.4. The level of disease activity was interpreted as low (DAS28 score less than or equal to [≤]3.2), moderate (DAS28 score greater than [&gt;]3.2 but ≤5.1), or high (DAS28 score &gt;5.1). A DAS28 score &lt;2.6 corresponded to a state of remission according to American Rheumatism Association criteria.</description>

Difficulty score is from 0 to 3 (0 = without any difficulty; 1 = with some difficulty; 2 = with much difficulty; and 3 = unable to do). The highest component score in each of the 8 categories determined the score for that category, unless aids, devices, and/or help from another person were required which = a score of 2 (unless already 2 or 3). The 8 category scores were averaged into overall HAQ-DI score ranging from 0 to 3 (0 to 1 = mild to moderate difficulty; 1 to 2 = moderate to severe disability; and 2 to 3 = severe to very severe disability).

          <description>Participants received rituximab 1000 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) and methylprednisolone 100 mg IV on Days 1 and 15. Participants should have been receiving a stable dose (for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening) of MTX 10-25 mg per week (mg/week) and a stable dose of folate (greater than or equal to [≥]5 mg/week) given as either a single weekly dose or as divided daily doses (per investigator discretion). Participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, achieved a clinically relevant response (Disease Activity Score based on 28-Joint Count [DAS28] score of greater than or equal to [≥]2.6) to the first course of treatment received one additional course of re-treatment with rituximab (2 IV infusions of rituximab 1000 mg [and methylprednisolone 100 mg], given 14 days apart), at any time between Week 24 and 48.</description>

        <description>The EULAR response criteria were based on the assessment of disease activity using the DAS28. The EULAR response criteria included not only change in disease activity but current disease activity. To be classified as responders, participants had to have a significant change in DAS28 and a low current disease activity. There were 4 categories of EULAR response rates: good, moderate, good/moderate, and none. The DAS28 scoring used 4 core components: SJC, TJC, Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity, and ESR. The DAS28 has a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 9.4. The level of disease activity was interpreted as low (DAS28 score less than or equal to [≤]3.2), moderate (DAS28 score greater than [&gt;]3.2 but ≤5.1), or high (DAS28 score &gt;5.1). A DAS28 score &lt;2.6 corresponded to a state of remission according to American Rheumatism Association criteria.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Meeting EULAR Response Criteria During the Re-Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The EULAR response criteria were based on the assessment of disease activity using the DAS28. The EULAR response criteria included not only change in disease activity but current disease activity. To be classified as responders, participants had to have a significant change in DAS28 and a low current disease activity. There were 4 categories of EULAR response rates: good, moderate, good/moderate, and none. The DAS28 scoring used 4 core components: SJC, TJC, Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity, and ESR. The DAS28 has a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 9.4. The level of disease activity was interpreted as low (DAS28 score ≤3.2), moderate (DAS28 score &gt;3.2 but ≤5.1), or high (DAS28 score &gt;5.1). A DAS28 score &lt;2.6 corresponded to a state of remission according to American Rheumatism Association criteria.</description>

            <description>Participants received rituximab 1000 mg IV and methylprednisolone 100 mg IV on Days 1 and 15. Participants should have been receiving a stable dose (for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening) of MTX 10-25 mg/week and a stable dose of folate (≥5 mg/week) given as either a single weekly dose or as divided daily doses (per investigator discretion). Participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, achieved a clinically relevant response (DAS28 score of ≥2.6) to the first course of treatment received one additional course of re-treatment with rituximab (2 IV infusions of rituximab 1000 mg [and methylprednisolone 100 mg] given 14 days apart), at any time between Week 24 and 48.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in DAS28 During the Initial Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The DAS28 scoring used 4 core components: SJC, TJC, Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity, and ESR. The DAS28 has a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 9.4. The level of disease activity was interpreted as low (DAS28 score ≤3.2), moderate (DAS28 score &gt;3.2 but ≤5.1), or high (DAS28 score &gt;5.1). A DAS28 score &lt;2.6 corresponded to a state of remission according to American Rheumatism Association criteria. A change of 1.2 units in DAS28 in an individual participant was considered a significant change.</description>

        <description>Patient Global Assessment of Pain was measured using a 100-mm VAS where the extreme left end of the line was 0 = no pain and the extreme right end of the line was 100 = unbearable pain.

        <description>HAQ-DI: 20 questions, 8 categories of functioning: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common usual activities. Participants report amount of difficulty in performing 2-3 specific subcategory items. Difficulty score is from 0 to 3 (0 = without any difficulty; 1 = with some difficulty; 2 = with much difficulty; and 3 = unable to do). The highest component score in each of the 8 categories determined the score for that category, unless aids, devices, and/or help from another person were required which = a score of 2 (unless already 2 or 3). The 8 category scores were averaged into overall HAQ-DI score ranging from 0 to 3 (0 to 1 = mild to moderate difficulty; 1 to 2 = moderate to severe disability; and 2 to 3 = severe to very severe disability).

        <description>The DAS28 scoring used 4 core components: SJC, TJC, Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity, and ESR. The DAS28 has a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 9.4. The level of disease activity was interpreted as low (DAS28 score ≤3.2), moderate (DAS28 score &gt;3.2 but ≤5.1), or high (DAS28 score &gt;5.1). A DAS28 score ≤2.6 corresponded to a state of remission according to American Rheumatism Association criteria.</description>

        <description>Participant fatigue was evaluated using the FACIT-F scale, a 13-item questionnaire in which the participants were requested to score each item on a 5-point scale. The FACIT-F scores ranged from 0 to 52, with higher scores representing less fatigue. Score changes of 4 points or more were considered clinically meaningful. The total score was a summation of all 13 items, where 2 of the positive items (I have energy; I am able to do my usual activities) were reversed for scoring.</description>
