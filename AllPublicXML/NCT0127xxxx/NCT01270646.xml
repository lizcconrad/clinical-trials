      Impact of intraventricular electrical activation in resynchronization therapy. We seek to
      evaluate the impact of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) on electrical activation of
      the Left Ventricle (LV). The first goal of the study is to evaluate if CRT is able to
      decrease the heterogeneity of LV activation in heart failure patients. A second goal is to
      evaluate the electrical determinant of clinical response to CRT using invasive and
      non-invasive mapping technology.

      Comprehensive study, prospective, monocentric and cohort study.

      Biventricular pacing is an effective therapy to improve end stage heart failure patients,
      however up to 30% of patients are unresponsive to this therapy. Among others, optimization of
      Left Ventricle (LV) pacing site location is critical to optimize response to Cardiac
      Resynchronization Therapy (CRT). Whether a better comprehension of baseline LV electrical
      activation can help to determine optimal LV lead location remains to be investigated.

      After informed consent patients are included in the sudy. Day 1: CRT device is implanted
      under general anesthesia in a conventional fashion. The coronary sinus leads will be
      implanted guided by the acute hemodynamic response (+(dP/dt)max) using a RADI guide wire.
      After device implantation, a steerable mapping catheter will be inserted in the LV cavity to
      build a tridimensional activation map of the LV. This map will be obtained with and without
      CRT. From these maps different parameters describing LV activation will be measured and
      compared between patients with and without CRT. Quantitative parameters: Global LV activation
      time (LVATG) (primary outcome); septal activation time (LVTAS); Global intra-LV dispersion
      time and Qualitative parameters: presence of intraLV line of block, area of late activation.
      Day 5±2: A non-invasive map of the LV will be recorded with the CardioInsight ® system with
      and without CRT. The same parameters will be measured and compared with those obtained with
      invasive mapping. A 3 and 6 months follow-up visit including clinical, biological evaluation
      (NYHA status, 6-min walking test, BNP) of the patients will be performed with an additional
      transthoracic echocardiography at 6 months.
