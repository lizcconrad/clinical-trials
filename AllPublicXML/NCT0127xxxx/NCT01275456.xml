    <textblock>
      This clinical validation study is aimed at testing the efficacy of a new environmental
      challenge chamber (ECC) to induce symptoms of allergic rhinitis in patients allergic to house
      dust mite. The symptoms will be recorded on a validated symptom score as Total Nasal Symptom
      Score (TNSS), allowing for determine whether the challenge is dose dependent and
      reproducible.

      At Fraunhofer ITEM, a novel technique to create an atmosphere loaded with allergenic
      particles was recently developed. In brief, particles are produced in a combined process of
      nebulization and drying of a solution containing soluble allergenic extracts and lactose. The
      particle size distribution is regulated by the droplet size distribution and the lactose
      concentration in the solution, while the allergen content can be chosen independently. Thus,
      the Fraunhofer scientists have created a universal tool which provides them with the
      possibility to create atmospheres containing allergenic particles of arbitrary sizes
      containing a variety of different allergens. By choosing particle sizes preferentially
      depositing in the nose (above 10 µm) or the lungs (5 to 10 µm), and selecting allergen
      concentrations commonly found in the environment, it is possible to build up challenge
      atmospheres for a large variety of indications.

      The first clinical application of this new method will be to create an atmosphere simulating
      the natural exposure to house dust mite allergens. The challenge aerosol will be composed of
      lactose as carrier material and the two major allergens Der p1 and Der p2 of house dust mites
      originating from a licenced allergen extract for inhaled challenge.

             nonsmokers for at least the last 12 months.

          -  History of allergic rhinitis to house dust mite. Subjects with mild intermittent
             asthma that is controlled with occasional use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists
             may be included.
