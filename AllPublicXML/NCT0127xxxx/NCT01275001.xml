      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the effects a musical intervention
      has on typical brain development in preschool-aged children.

      This study will advance the science on brain research in young children by determining the
      effects of a musical intervention or training on children's brain development. The study will
      investigate how regular instruction in the Suzuki-like method of violin affects brain
      structure and function over the course of approximately five (5) months in preschool-aged
      children participating in an Early Childhood/Headstart preschool program when compared to a
      control group of their peers.

        Participants in this research project will be involved with a different research project
        (Avera Family Wellness Program) investigating the effects of a family-based wellness
        approach to addressing emotional-behavioral needs of preschool-age children and their
        families. The Avera Family Wellness Program (AFWP) consists of a group of children who
        receive the family-based intervention and a group of control preschool-age children.
