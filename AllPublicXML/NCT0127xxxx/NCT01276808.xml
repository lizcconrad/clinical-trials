      Rationale: Magnetic navigation in complex lesions/vessels may result in reduced contrast and
      irradiation for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The investigators aim
      to compare the use of the 2 techniques.

      Objective: To compare the use of contrast and irradiation used in magnetically navigated PCI
      (MPCI) with conventional guidewire PCI (CPCI) in patients with complex anatomy (as defined by
      a clinical prediction rule).

      Study design: Prospective randomised controlled, single-blind trial Study population: Healthy
      human volunteers aged 18 to 80 years of age Intervention (if applicable): One group has the
      placement of the angioplasty wire with magnetic navigation and the other has the angioplasty
      wire placed by conventional technique. All other interventions will be performed as per
      routine practice.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is the amount of contrast used.

      Secondary endpoints

        1. Contrast needed to cross a lesion

        2. procedural time

        3. radiation exposure

        4. Clinical complications at 1 and 12 months

        5. procedural success

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      The index procedure is performed as per normal routine and includes history and examination.
      A blood test will be taken once vascular access has been obtained. After the procedure a
      questionnaire will be filled in. The patient will have a blood test 2 to 3 days after the
      procedure, telephone follow-up will occur at 1 and 6 months and a further outpatient visit
      with ECG will be planned for a year after the index procedure. No additional significant
      physical or psychological discomfort is expected with participation in the study.

      The Stereotaxis Niobe® magnetic navigation system received regulatory approval for human
      clinical use for interventional cardiology in 2003.

      Magnetic navigation gives 3 dimensional (3D) directional control over the guide-wire tip
      during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.

      Magnetic navigation has been shown to be feasible and effective (1-3), case reports suggest
      that it enables the performance of procedures that could not be successfully finished
      conventionally (4-6), and that the use of the system may lead to reductions in contrast use
      and procedure time (7-11) that can be expected to result in better patient outcomes, and an
      economical advantage (less consumables per procedure, more procedures per session). There are
      only a few centers that perform magnetic navigation for percutaneous coronary intervention
      The OLVG has performed the most procedures of any of these centers and has included all the
      patients in a registry.

      The registry at the OLVG suggests that different subgroups derive different benefit.

      Distal lesions (10) defined as lesions more distal than the first 2 coronary segments from
      the aorta (thus RCA segment, mid LAD or distal Cx).

      Technical success did not differ significantly between magnetic and conventional PCI (88.5 vs
      96.2%; p=0.14). Significantly shorter procedural and fluoroscopy time were observed for
      magnetic compared to conventional PCI (29.9±17.1 vs 42.9±21.1 min, p&lt;0.001; 8.2±7.7 vs
      16.7±22.4 min, p=0.01 respectively). More contrast was used in de conventional PCI group (54
      ml/patient; P=0.02). These advantages resulted in a mean saving of 1652 euro per patient
      (P&lt;0.0001).

      Primary PCI (11) The technical success rate was high in both the MPCI and CPCI groups (95.4%
      vs 98%; P = NS). There was significantly less contrast usage in the MPCI compared to the CPCI
      group (167±80/patient vs 220±87/patient; P&lt;0.001). Procedural times were not significantly
      different for MPCI compared to CPCI (30.8±16.5 min vs 33.6±15.8 min, p=0.2) while fluoroscopy
      times were significantly better (8.1±5.0 min vs 14.6±26.5 min, p&lt;0.05).

      Simple lesions (8) as defined by the elective treatment of a single discrete stenosis that
      would require a maximum of two stents and excluding multiple lesions in the target vessel,
      multi-vessel PCI, bifurcation lesions, acute and chronic total occlusions, or a previous
      failed conventional attempt for the same target lesion.

      Procedural and fluoroscopy times were not significantly different for MPCI compared to CPCI
      (21.0±14.5 min vs 24.7±14.0 min; 4.9±4.8 min vs 7.3±10.3 min, p=NS). There was a significant
      reduction in median contrast use (60 ml/patient [41-100] vs 100 ml/patient [64-130];
      P=0.006).

      Summary Benefit appears to increase depending on the complexity of the vessel/lesion with
      distal lesions showing a significant benefit in terms of contrast use, procedure time and
      fluoroscopy time.

      Simple lesions show that procedures are not negatively influenced in terms of time, or
      irradiation and there may be benefit in terms of contrast use.

      Acute procedures where time is at a premium (primary PCI for a heart attack) are not slowed
      by the use of the system.

      Furthermore, the investigators have published a clinical prediction rule for selection of
      patients that will most benefit from this technology. (12)

      The use of this system may have a number of benefits

        1. Reduction in the procedure time, irradiation and contrast use in the patient

        2. Better procedures with wire passage that maintains the tip coaxial in the vessel to
           avoid inadvertent sidebranch cannulation or more accurate bend/sidebranch entry to
           produce less complications

      The hypothesis that MPCI is better than CPCI should be investigated by a randomized
      controlled trial (Magnetic navigation wire placement vs conventional wire placement).

      The investigators plan to randomize patients into magnetic and conventional groups.

      Endpoints:

        1. Primary endpoint Contrast use

        2. Secondary:

           Short-term procedural Procedure Fluoroscopy Procedure time Procedure success Short term
           contrast nephropathy

        3. Long-term MACCE at 1 month and 12 months.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age&gt;18 years

          -  Elective presentation for PCI, This implies that the coronary anatomy is known and can
             be analysed according to the clinical prediction rule.(13)

          -  The included patients must have a calculated formula with a result equal or greater
             than 6.

        Pct=1*Vb+1*(Vl=1)+2*(Vl=2)+2*Vc+1*Lbb)+1*(Ll=1)+2*(Ll=2)

        Pct - Predicted crossing time (prolonged if integer ≥ 6). Vb - Number of bends before the
        lesion. Each bend causes deformation of the wire resulting in friction. A greater number of
        bends leads to increased friction resulting in more difficultly in manipulating the wire.

        Vl - End-to-end length from the ostium to the lesion. The more distal the lesion is from
        the ostium, then the greater the chance of encountering problematic bends that impair
        manipulation, and also the longer the time required to physically pass the wire. This is
        divided into shorter than 50 mm (=0), between 50 and 100 mm (=1) and greater then 100 mm
        (=2).

        Vc - Vessel calcification. Calcium may increase friction as the vessel becomes more rigid
        and less deformable and does not conform to the wire. The frictive effect of a specific
        angle will be accentuated if deformation cannot occur.

        Lbb - Side-branches within 10 mm. Side-branches within 10 mm of the lesion increase
        difficultly because, on the approach to a lesion finer control is necessary, the fixed
        wire-tip angle needed for bends now may have more of a predisposition for side-branches.

        Ll - Lesion length. Longer lesions produce more friction on the wire. The detailed analysis
        of 3D reconstruction by the Paeion system has been described earlier.(12) This rule was
        tested on a validation group taken from a second cohort of 415 lesions. The c-statistic
        derived from this group was 0.82 showing good discrimination.

          -  Patients can be admitted from the lounge, the ward or the CCU

          -  Diagnostic coronary angiography films suitable for 3D reconstruction Informed consent
             obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active bleeding

          -  Cardiogenic shock

          -  Resuscitation / intubation

          -  Cerebrovascular accident within 30 days

          -  Major bleeding within 30 days according to the TIMI definitions

          -  Severe hypertension (&gt;180/110) after medical treatment

          -  Relevant trauma or surgery within 6 weeks

          -  Active peptic ulcer within 3 months

          -  Hemorrhagic retinopathy

          -  Thrombocytopenia (&lt;150)

          -  Severe renal dysfunction (Creatinine &gt;140)

          -  Ongoing or desired use of GpIIb/IIIa blockers

          -  Participation in another clinical study

          -  Women who are pregnant or women who are breast-feeding. Inability to follow the
             patient (e.g. foreign or long-distance patients on holiday)
