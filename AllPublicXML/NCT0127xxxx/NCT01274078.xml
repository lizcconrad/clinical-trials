  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 32 healthy subjects are subjected to 4 weeks of exercise, 4 weeks of washout and 4
      weeks of sedentary life style, randomization decides whether they start with exercise or with
      being &quot;couch potatoes&quot;. All participants are also randomized to also consume 150 g of
      blueberries on exercise days or not. The exercise is constituted of 5 km running 5 days a
      week during the 4 week period. The exercise period and the &quot;couch&quot; period are started and
      ended with a 5 km run at maximal speed and the fasting blood samples for cardiovascular risk
      factors are measured before and after this run, ie 8 times in total.
