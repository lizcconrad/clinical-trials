      We, the investigators, propose to look at the bacteria on and in tonsils using gene
      microarrays. We expect to find previously reported bacteria but also the possibility of
      previously undetected organisms. We think that the bacterial pathogens present on the
      tonsillar surface are different from the tonsil core. And we also think that the bacteria of
      the tonsil surface will differ between patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy and normal
      controls with no adenotonsillar problems.
