  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valvular repair and repair surgery is rapidly progressing yet rather challenging aspect of
      current cardiosurgical practice.

      Several approaches were introduced into the clinical practice to alleviate systemic
      inflammatory response induced by cardiopulmonary bypass and organ-specific injury including
      meticulous haemodynamic monitoring, pharmacological heart preconditioning, systemic use of
      anti-inflammatory agents, prevention of coagulopathy, and induced topical and systemic
      hypothermia. An in-depth monitoring of haemodynamics, oxygen transport, and vascular
      permeability is of a great clinical value to control the efficacy of these approaches.

      Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare two algorithms of goal-directed therapy aimed
      to achieve a postoperative haemodynamic optimization in combined valve repair surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-three adult patients scheduled for elective two valve replacement/repair were enrolled
      into randomised single-centre study. All interventions were performed in cardiosurgical
      department of City hospital #1 (Arkhangelsk, Russian Federation) by the same surgical team.
      Three patients were excluded from the analysis; two — due to protocol violation and one — due
      to inadequate surgical correction diagnosed by intraoperative transoesophageal
      echocardiography.

      Day before surgery patients were asked for informed consent and randomized in two groups. In
      the first group postoperative haemodynamic optimization was targeted on parameters provided
      by pulmonary artery catheter (the PAC-group, n = 20): pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure,
      cardiac index (LifeScope monitor, Nihon Kohden, Japan) and hemoglobin blood level. In the
      second group haemodynamics was managed using parameters given by transpulmonary
      thermodilution (the COMPLEX-group), that included cardiac index, global end-diastolic volume
      index, extravascular lung water index, continuous central venous oxygen saturation, and
      oxygen delivery index as measured with PiCCO2 monitor (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich,
      Germany. In addition, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and hemoglobin concentration were
      included into both PAC- and PiCCO2-driven protocols.
