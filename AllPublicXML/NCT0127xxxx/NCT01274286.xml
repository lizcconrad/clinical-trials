  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the first hospital accreditation was implemented in our country in 1978, we have become
      the fifth in the world, the first in Asia that applied the system of hospital accreditation.
      While discussing the development of the hospital accreditation history of Taiwan, different
      concerns have been raised over time.

      The main objective of this study is to scrutinize if there have been any quality improvement
      of healthcare that hospitals delivered since the renewal of hospital accreditation standards.
      Also, in order to provide suggestions to make the hospital accreditation a better one, this
      study firstly endeavors to locate the differences which were brought out by both the old and
      the new hospital accreditation.

      Second, this study will analyze and survey the impacts of accreditation on hospitals'
      performance and healthcare. After finishing the first two steps, this study will then state
      updated improvement suggestions.

      Documentary analysis and meta analysis will be the two major scientific research methods in
      this study. Data will be collected from various resources, such as government agencies,
      private research institution and hospitals around the nation. By collecting raw data broadly
      and deeply, the accountability, therefore, can be ensured.

      Throughout the efforts of identifying differences between the new and old accreditation
      standards, comparing hospitals' scores on performance index and finding evidence of
      performance improvement, we hope this study would provide the most comprehensive and solid
      suggestions to improve our hospital accreditation system.
