      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of experiencing a previous pregnancy loss
      or complication on current physiological and emotional aspects of a current pregnancy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) among women who are experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) and/or anxiety relating to a previous pregnancy loss or complication. Lastly,
      this study includes an option to participate in a procedure whereas startle response will be
      measured using the eyeblink reflex twice during pregnancy and once in the postpartum period.
      Startle response is examined using a standard acoustic startle procedure whereby heart rate,
      skin temperature and eye blinking reflex are measured.

    <description>The CAPS will be used in the diagnosis of PTSD, assessment of the impact of symptoms on function, assessment of the severity of symptoms at baseline, and weekly throughout the study.

    <description>CPT utilizes a combination of a) exposure therapy aimed at extinguishing fear and distress induced by memories and external cues associated with the trauma, and b) cognitive behavioral techniques that address faulty thinking patterns developed to promote a sense of control over possible future traumas, but that instead perpetuate PTSD symptoms. In CPT, exposure to the traumatic memory occurs through writing and reading for periods of time determined by the client and is confined to the week of the 4th and 5th sessions. These sessions are otherwise used to identify &quot;stuck-points&quot;, i.e., distorted interpretations regarding the trauma and unrealistic beliefs regarding self and others.</description>
