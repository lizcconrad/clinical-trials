  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of cilengitide when given
      together with paclitaxel weekly in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread
      nearby or to other areas of the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Cilengitide may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to the stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving cilengitide together with
      paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cilengitide and paclitaxel at weekly
      dose schedule. (Cohort I) II. To describe the toxicities associated with cilengitide and
      paclitaxel. III. To describe any antitumor activity of cilengitide and paclitaxel at weekly
      dose schedule.

      IV. To characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) of cilengitide and paclitaxel with the proposed
      schedule and correlate PK parameters to clinical outcome. (Cohort I) V. To examine the effect
      of cilengitide and paclitaxel on circulating cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (Cyr61)
      using a novel &quot;sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&quot; and to correlate this
      effect with clinical response. (Cohort II) VI. To evaluate the information obtained through
      use of items from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) in Phase I studies.

      VII. To determine if tumor tissue expression of alpha v beta 3 (αvβ3) and CYR61 correlate
      with therapeutic response to cilengitide with paclitaxel. (Cohort II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cilengitide.

      Patients receive cilengitide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days* 1, 8, and 15 and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Some patients receive cilengitide IV over 1 hour on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
