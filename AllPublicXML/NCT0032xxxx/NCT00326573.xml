  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of diabetes in adolescence presents significant difficulties due to
      psychological and physiological factors. Blood glucose control deteriorates in this age group
      and poor management threatens long-term health. Motivational Interviewing, a psychological
      intervention designed to facilitate behaviour change, has recently been used with a small
      group of teenagers, producing improved blood glucose control. To establish the impact of this
      intervention and its key components, we plan to compare the outcome in several clinics over a
      longer period of time in a larger number of adolescents selected at random to undergo
      motivational interviewing or to act as a control group. If successful this approach has
      potential to be incorporated into the routine clinical care of adolescents with diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes in adolescence is associated with deterioration in glycaemic control and self-care,
      resulting in increased risk of long-term complications. Although psychosocial factors are
      recognized as playing an important part in these changes and therefore in clinical
      management, there are few indicators from research studies of practical, effective
      interventions. Motivational interviewing is a counselling approach designed to facilitate
      decision-making about behaviour change. It has been shown to be effective in a variety of
      clinical settings, including diabetes care in an adult population. In a BDA-funded pilot
      study of motivational interviewing with adolescents, our group has shown that the
      intervention improves glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin), at least in the
      short-term. This study aims to replicate and extend the findings of the pilot study in a
      multicentre, randomised, controlled trial over a longer intervention period with a larger
      sample. The intervention will be monitored to facilitate analysis and description of key
      components. Other psychological variables thought to be of significance in the self-care of
      adolescents with diabetes will be measured. If the results indicate that this is a successful
      intervention, the method has potential to be disseminated and applied within routine clinical
      practice.
