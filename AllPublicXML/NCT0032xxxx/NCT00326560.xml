  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium excision surgery involves excising the abnormal growth from the cornea and filling
      the defect with a conjunctival (white of the eye) graft from the superior part of the eye.
      This is the best method of pterygium excision but it is recognised that in 10-15% of cases it
      will grow back (recurrence). Currently the investigators use small sutures to sew the graft
      in place. Recently it has been described that glue can be used instead of the sutures. It has
      been shown in one study that the patient discomfort is less and so is the surgical time. The
      investigators want to confirm these findings and also compare the recurrence rate between the
      two types of surgery. They plan to complete a prospective, randomised, control trial of 40
      participants. Twenty will have traditional pterygium surgery with the conjunctival autograft
      sutured. Twenty will have cut and paste surgery with Tisseel glue. The two groups of
      participants will be compared for pain and discomfort, surgery time, and recurrence rate of
      the pterygia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, control trial of 40 participants. Twenty patients in each
      arm. Twenty patients undergo standard pterygium excision with the conjunctival autograft
      sutured. Twenty patients undergo pterygium surgery with Tisseel glue replacing sutures as a
      method of attaching the conjunctival autograft. Participants will be reviewed, selected, and
      consented on a pre-assessment day. Surgery will be performed 10 at a time on an all day
      surgery operating list. Randomisation of the surgery type will be done at the time of surgery
      after the pterygium has been excised and the autograft taken. One surgeon (R. Hall) will
      perform all of the procedures. Follow-up will occur at week 1, 2, 4, 26, 52. A questionnaire
      answered by participants will indicate their pain, foreign body sensation, tearing, and
      discomfort. There will be observation of any complications such as graft failure and
      recurrence rate. Photographs will be taken pre-op and post-op.
