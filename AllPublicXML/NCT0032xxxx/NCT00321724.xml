  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well AZD2171 works in treating patients with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. AZD2171 may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the
      cancer cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) treated with AZD2171.

      II. Evaluate the toxicity of AZD2171 in patients with relapsed or refractory B-CLL.

      III. Evaluate the complete response rate, progression-free and overall survival
      distributions, and duration of response in patients with relapsed or refractory B-CLL treated
      with AZD2171.

      IV. Assess vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) protein and
      phosphorylation levels in B-CLL cells using pretreatment samples and evaluate the association
      between Rai stage at study entry and clinical response to AZD2171.

      V. Perform preclinical testing of AZD2171 in the induction of B-CLL cell apoptosis/cell death
      using pretreatment samples, and evaluate the ability to downregulate the phosphorylation
      status of VEGFR-2 of B-CLL cells by comparing in vitro samples with and without AZD2171.

      VI. Study the differences in in vitro levels of B-CLL cell apoptosis/cell death and
      alteration of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation using pretreatment samples with and without AZD2171 and
      how these differences correlate with clinical outcomes.

      VII. Assess if the clinical responses are associated with changes in bone marrow vascularity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sampling and biopsies at baseline and periodically throughout study
      for biomarker and correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years from
      study entry.
