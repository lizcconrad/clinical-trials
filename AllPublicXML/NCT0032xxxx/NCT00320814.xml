      To assess the ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal injection
      of VEGF Trap in patients with diabetic macular edema.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label study. Initially, 5 patients with DME will receive an ITV injection of
      VEGF Trap into the study eye. Additional patients may be enrolled at the same or additional
      dose levels. Patients will be observed for six weeks following the injection for assessments
      of ocular and systemic safety.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2).

          -  Best corrected E-ETDRS visual acuity score of ≥ 24 letters (i.e., 20/320 or better)
             and ≤ 73 letters (i.e., 20/40 or worse).

          -  On clinical exam, definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema involving
             the center of the macula.

          -  Retinal Thickness at the center point ≥ 250 microns.

          -  Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and patient cooperation sufficient for adequate
             fundus photographs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any vitreous hemorrhage within 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 (Day 1).

          -  Macular edema due to causes other than diabetic macular edema. An eye should be
             considered ineligible: (1) if the macular edema is considered to be related to
             cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or OCT suggests that vitreoretinal
             interface disease (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the
             primary cause of the macular edema.

          -  An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition).

          -  An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, age-related macular degeneration, uveitis or other
             ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).

          -  Presence of any other condition or laboratory abnormality, which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would interfere with the assessment of disease status/progression or
             jeopardize the patient's appropriate participation in this Phase 1 study.
