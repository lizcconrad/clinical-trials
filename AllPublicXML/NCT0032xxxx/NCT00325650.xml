  <official_title>A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, Multicenter Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Long-term Administration of Rimonabant in the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Patients With Prediabetic Status (i.e., Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG), Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) or Both)</official_title>

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the effect of long-term administration of Rimonabant on the time of progression
      to type 2 diabetes in patients with prediabetes (i.e. Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) or
      Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) or both at baseline).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the effect on weight loss and weight maintenance; sustained effect following a
           washout period, effect on other markers of glycemic control (fasting glucose,
           fasting-insulin and HbA1c), glucose tolerance and insulin responses during oral glucose
           tolerance tests (OGTTs), and on other risk factors (HDL-Cholesterol, TG),

        -  To assess the effect on quality of life

        -  To evaluate long term safety and tolerability.
