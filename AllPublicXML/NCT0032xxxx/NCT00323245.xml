  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conservative management for urinary incontinence has been shown to improve bladder control.
      We are conducting a study of the effectiveness of conservative management for urinary
      incontinence in women who also have osteoporosis. We hope to find that treatment for
      incontinence improves bladder control and thereby allows women to be more active and reduces
      their risk of falling and breaking bones.
