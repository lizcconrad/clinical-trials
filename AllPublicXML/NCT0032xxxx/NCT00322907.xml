  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of Cotrifazid to treat
      uncomplicated resistant malaria and to compare the outcome with mefloquine or
      quinine+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP)

      Design: Open-label, block-randomised, comparative, multicentric trial. Setting: Four primary
      care health facilities, two in urban and two in rural areas of Madang and East Sepik
      Province, Papua New Guinea.

      Participants: Patients of all ages with recurrent uncomplicated malaria Intervention: Random
      assignment to receive either Cotrifazid, mefloquine or the standard treatment of
      quinine+sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP).

      Outcome measures: Incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events; rate of clinical
      and/or parasitological failure at day 14

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects &gt; 6 months of age who presented at the centres and who were diagnosed with
        malaria (history of fever, OptiMAL® test positive, no other major symptom) and who had
        already been treated for malaria in the 28 days before, could be included in the study, if
        the subject or legal guardian (for children) gave informed consent and if the clinician in
        charge would have given the standard treatment for resistant malaria independent of the
        study -

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject was not to be included if the clinician preferred to use quinine for whatever
        reason, if the patient had one of the symptoms or signs of complicated or severe malaria
        (i.e. history of recent convulsion, any neurological sign or impairment of consciousness,
        heavy vomiting, haemoglobinuria, respiratory distress, bleeding, circulatory collapse,
        shock, jaundice, haemoglobin &lt; 5 g/dl), had contra-indications for mefloquine (history of
        psychiatric disorder, epilepsy), or was pregnant.
