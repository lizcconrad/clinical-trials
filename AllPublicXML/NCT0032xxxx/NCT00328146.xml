      Re-operative surgery in children is extremely challenging and injury to the underlying
      cardiac structures can occur during sternal re-entry. When institution of cardiopulmonary
      bypass is required in an emergency, there are often limited sites for peripheral cannulation.
      Injury to the heart can easily result in catastrophic complications and death.

      Background Re-operative surgery in children is extremely challenging and injury to the
      underlying cardiac structures can occur during sternal re-entry. When institution of
      cardiopulmonary bypass is required in an emergency, there are often limited sites for
      peripheral cannulation. Injury to the heart can easily result in catastrophic complications
      and death.

      Methods This will be primarily a technique paper. The only clinical data points I am
      interested in are how many re-operative sternotomies we performed and on how many patients. I
      will also need to confirm that we did not have any complications due to cardiac injury while
      opening the sternum. I estimate about 450 patients.

      Primary Aim: Present an effective technique for sternal re-entry in children

      Secondary Aim: Present a zero incidence of complicated sternal re-entry over the past 5 years
      (February 1, 2001 through February 28, 2006) at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Egleston
      Hospital.

      Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria Any child undergoing re-operative cardiac surgery through a
      midline sternotomy incision
