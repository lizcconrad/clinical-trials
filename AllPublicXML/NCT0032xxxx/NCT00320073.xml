      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinflunine, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Erlotinib and pemetrexed may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving vinflunine together with erlotinib or pemetrexed may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vinflunine when
      given together with erlotinib or pemetrexed in treating patients with unresectable or
      metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vinflunine and pemetrexed disodium in
           patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

        -  Define the MTD of vinflunine and erlotinib hydrochloride in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the preliminary safety and efficacy (reported descriptively per patient
           response; tumor specific response rate reported if applicable) of these regimens.

        -  Correlate CYP3A4 activity, as measured by midazolam clearance, with vinflunine plasma
           clearance.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to
      1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group 1: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and vinflunine IV over
           20 minutes on day 1.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pemetrexed disodium and vinflunine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients may
      be treated at the MTD.

        -  Group 2: Patients receive vinflunine IV over 20 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib
           hydrochloride once daily on days 2-21 of course 1 and on days 1-21 of all subsequent
           courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride and vinflunine
      until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or
      2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients may be treated at the
      MTD.

      In both groups, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected on day 1 of course 1 for pharmacodynamic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30-40 days.
