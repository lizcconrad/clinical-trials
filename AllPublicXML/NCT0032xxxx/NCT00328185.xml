    <textblock>
      Transplantation is the preferred method of treating many forms of end-stage organ failure.
      While short-term results have improved, long-term outcomes remain inadequate. Myocardial
      fibrosis could potentially have an adverse effect on long-term cardiac function. We wish to
      study the degree of fibrosis to see if we can predict survival following pediatric heart
      transplantation.

    <textblock>
      There has been recent evidence that demonstrates a significant racial disparity in outcomes
      following pediatric heart transplantation.Differences in fibrosis or its regulation may offer
      an explanation to these differences.Just as the pathologic alterations of cardiac connective
      tissue in the ischemic heart and in cardiomyopathies support the view that the matrix plays a
      fundamental role in ventricular function,it is likely that other forms of cardiac
      dysfunction,such as that following heart transplantation,may also be related to changes in
      the extracellular matrix.Fibrosis has been identified in allografts following
      transplant,although the degree and significance relative to cardiac function remains
      unclear.Many of the regulatory substances have also been identified in the microenvironment
      of the allograft following transplant,but their role in collagen deposition and
      protease:anti-protease balance is unclear as well.It has been speculated that
      individual,racial,and regional disparities in outcome following pediatric heart
      transplantation may be the result of an underlying difference in fibrosis.This in turn
      influences the tolerance of the recipient to the graft,and ultimately,the time for graft
      failure to ensue.Of the 4227 pediatric heart transplants performed in the US 1987-2004,717
      were African-American.The 1-year graft survival did not differ among groups;5-year graft
      survival was significantly lower among African-Americans compared to other racial groups.The
      median graft survival for African-American recipients was 5.3 years compared to 11.0 years
      for other recipients.African-American recipients had an increased likelihood of more HLA
      mismatches,lower median household income.After adjusting for disparities in a multivariate
      analysis, African-American race remained significantly associated with graft failure.While
      the cellular component of the myocardium has been extensively studied, the extracellular
      matrix is less well examined or understood.Processes of synthesis,degradation,and turnover
      are important for the understanding of the physiology of development and remodeling of
      tissues and the pathology of hypertrophy and fibrosis.Collagen Fibroblasts are responsible
      for the biosynthesis,assembly,and maintenance of the extracellular matrix. Collagen is one of
      the components of the extracellular matrix.While collagen proteins serve primarily as an
      inert structural support of connective tissue,they also control multiple cellular parameters
      such as adhesion,migration,cell shape,cytoskeletal architecture,and gene
      expression.Fibronectin is a protein of the extracellular matrix.Fibronectin primarily serves
      as an adhesive protein,facilitating cell adhesion to fibrin,collagens,heparin,and
      proteoglycans.Fibronectin is important in contact inhibition,cell movement,cell-substrate
      adhesion,inflammation,and wound healing.Another function of fibronectin may be in the homing
      of lymphocytic cells.Allograft rejection has been associated with infiltration of
      inflammatory cells and local deposition of fibronectin.Performing immunohistochemical
      analysis for collagen and fibronectin will determine the degree of fibrosis in serial
      endomyocardial biopsies over the duration of graft survival.This data will determine the
      correlation between allograft fibrosis and clinical parameters of cardiac function,and will
      uncover differences in the degree of fibrosis that may exist between racial groups.The
      interactions between cells,immune mediators,growth factors,and proteins that regulate
      fibrosis have been well documented in some clinical areas.Throughout the transplant
      literature,several points in the fibrosis cascade have been identified as potential important
      regulatory components. These include transforming growth factor-β,tumor necrosis
      factor-α,plasminogen activator inhibitor, matrix metalloproteinase-2,and matrix
      metalloproteinase-9.All have the possibility of affecting the production of collagen and
      fibronectin,and the degree of allograft fibrosis.Transforming growth factor-β has many
      properties.TGF-β has potential value as an immunosuppressant in tissue.It can serve as an
      anti-inflammatory agent based on its ability to inhibit the growth of both T and B
      cells.TGF-β has the ability to regulate growth depending on the surrounding cell type and
      whether or not other growth factors are present.TGF-β stimulates fibroblast chemotaxis and
      proliferation.As the most potent stimulator of collagen synthesis,it regulates deposition of
      extracellular matrix and cell attachment to it.It induces fibronectin,chondroitin/dermatin
      sulfate proteoglycans,collagen,and glycoaminoglycans.TGF-β promotes the formation and
      secretion of protease inhibitors,further contributing to collagen accumulation.TGF-β
      decreases collagenase,increases tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases,and increases PAI-1
      production.Studies have been done implicating TGF-β in the pathogenesis of small-airway
      fibrosis characteristic of obliterative bronchiolitis following lung transplant.TGF-β
      expression was higher in OB patients in comparison to patients without OB,and positive TGF-β
      staining preceded the histologic confirmation of OB by 6 months.TGF-β has been implicated as
      a contributing factor to the overproduction of collagen characteristic of dilated
      cardiomyopathy.Administration of neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β has been shown to limit
      collagen accumulation in wounds.Tumor necrosis factor-α is a cytotoxic monokine produced by
      macrophages. TNF-α is associated with the inflammatory response present following exposure to
      bacterial endotoxin.TNF-α is produced within the first three days of wound healing.It
      facilitates leukocyte recruitment,induces angiogenesis,and promotes fibroblast
      proliferation.In animal models,a prominent feature of acute allograft rejection is the dense
      deposition of fibronectin at the graft site.Administration of anti-TNF-α serum into the hosts
      abrogated acute rejection and prolonged allograft survival.It was accompanied by a decrease
      in intragraft TNF-α levels and down-regulated fibronectin mRNA expression.Certain serine
      proteases are thought to be key regulators of connective tissue turnover.Plasminogen
      activators generate plasmin,a serine protease,which has activity against a number of
      connective tissue macromolecules,including fibronectin,proteoglycan core proteins,other
      glycoproteins,collagen,as well as fibrin.Plasmin has been shown to initiate the
      autoactivation of other proteinases.The activity of plasminogen activators is closely
      regulated by specific inhibitors.The plasminogen activator inhibitors are potentially one of
      the most important regulators of connective tissue degradation because of their control of
      the rate of plasmin generation in local environments.PAI-1 is deposited pericellularly where
      its function is to regulate pericellular proteolysis.The connective tissue matrix
      metalloproteinase family consists of enzymes derived from mesenchymal cells and hematopoietic
      cells.They are metal-binding proteinases secreted in proenzyme forms requiring extracellular
      activation.The MMPs can be divided into subgroups,one of which is the interstitial
      collagenases.This group is responsible for regulating the extracellular collagen.Their
      activity is further regulated by a secreted inhibitor,tissue inhibitor of
      metalloproteinases,which forms a high-affinity irreversible complex with the active form of
      the MMP.Whether or not matrix production and degradation occur depends on the relative
      amounts of the metalloproteinases and inhibitors and also on the complex interplay with serum
      inhibitors.In disease states where the control mechanisms become uncoordinated,the uaction
      and nature of MMP activities may be one of the factors leading to an imbalance of the
      extracellular matrix.Studies have shown an increased expression of several MMPs during
      cardiac,renal,and pulmonary allograft rejection.In animals,allografts in the presence of
      MMP-9 showed lower cellular infiltration and fibrosis than allografts harvested from MMP-9
      deficient recipients.The reverse was true with MMP-2,suggesting that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may play
      different roles in the process of allograft fibrosis and rejection.By performing
      immunohistochemical analysis,we will determine the various amounts of these potential
      regulatory substances in serial endomyocardial biopsies over the duration of graft
      survival.This data will allow us to compare the changes in regulatory factors with the degree
      of fibrosis over time.It will enable us to uncover differences in regulation that may exist
      between racial groups.During the isovolumetric contraction phase of systole,ventricular wall
      pressure develops rapidly.During the ejection phase,pressure is transmitted to the
      ventricular cavity.Associated with ejection,geometric changes occur in the
      ventricle.Transmission of force to the ventricle must involve the myocardial matrix.Of the
      structural proteins in the heart,collagen has the physical properties necessary for force
      transmission to the ventricle.One can conclude that a complex system composed primarily of
      collagen is necessary for at least systolic stress distribution and tethering of myocytes one
      to another during the spatial translocations that accompany systole.For proper ventricular
      function,contiguous myocytes must be stretched to near the same amount.This implies a
      mechanism for distribution of stress throughout the entire ventricular wall.It appears that
      not only the total amount or collagen present,but also the distribution may be
      important.Increases and decreases in collagen have been noted in various disease states and
      affect cardiac function.The pathologic alterations of the intrinsic cardiac connective tissue
      in the ischemic heart and in cardiomyopathies support the view that the extracellular matrix
      plays a fundamental role in ventricular function.Ischemic damage of the myocardium is a blood
      flow-mediated,time-dependent process.Even in the absence of tissue necrosis,there is
      reversible loss of contractile function.Although myocytes are not morphologically damaged
      when stunned,they may lose their interconnections through damage to collagen and the
      extracellular matrix.The individual cells then move relative to each other without generating
      coordinated,forceful contractions.In animals,studies have shown systolic bulging,mural
      thinning,and regions of absent connective tissue.With congestive cardiomyopathy,there is
      ventricular dilation,global wall thinning and diffuse contractile dysfunction.Although a
      significant component of ventricular dysfunction may relate to loss of contractile mass,there
      are regions of connective tissue absence within the normal myocardium in animal models.The
      untethering of myocytes again leads to defective,uncoordinated contractile
      activity.Similarly,the loss or damage of intrinsic connective tissue may account for the
      characteristic global wall thinning.This may lead to a spiral of progressive damage;as the
      ventricular cavity enlarges,end-diastolic pressure increases,thereby causing further injury
      to the connective tissue.In contrast to congestive cardiomyopathy,some forms of heart disease
      are associated with decreased compliance and diminished diastolic filling.Increased collagen
      has been demonstrated in hypertrophied hearts.Rather than a thin-walled dilated heart,animal
      models demonstrate mural hypertrophy with a small ventricular cavity.In patients with
      hypertrophic,obstructive cardiomyopathy,biopsies of the septum revealed severe myocellular
      hypertrophy,myocyte disorganization,and pronounced interstitial collagen deposition.There is
      an increase in all components and disorganization in the arrangement.After quantifying the
      degree of fibrosis and the various amounts of regulatory substances,we will correlate this
      data to clinical parameters.We will compare changes in fibrosis over time with measurements
      of cardiac function,and with graft survival.
