    <textblock>
      This single center, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Panzem
      (2-methoxyestradiol, 2ME2) Nanocrystal Dispersion (NCD) administered orally with recombinant
      human monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab)
      administered intravenously, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic carcinoid tumors.
