  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death due to any cause or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to death or 30 days after last dose for the last participant (up to 216 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause. For participants who did not die, OS was censored at the time of last contact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Tumor Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death or discontinuation from study or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>OR was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing either a confirmed complete response (CR) or a confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.0. CR was defined as the disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non-target). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD, with non-target lesions not increased or absent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Response (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death or discontinuation from study or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR: percentage of participants with confirmed CR or PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks according to RECIST criteria. CR: disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non-target). PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum LD, with non-target lesions not increased or absent. SD: neither had sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) in target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since treatment started; persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until first documented evidence of CR or PR or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>TTR was defined as the time from randomization until the first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first). TTR could not be analyzed because too few participants experienced a confirmed CR or PR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>DR was defined for the subset of participants who showed a confirmed CR or PR, as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death. Because of the low number of participants experiencing a confirmed response in both treatment arms, analysis for this outcome measure was not performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death or 30 days after last dose (up to 216 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>TTP was defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or death due to breast cancer. Because this outcome measure was confounded by death due to other causes and was similar to PFS, it was not analyzed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) Scores at Week 4, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, and Conclusion or Withdrawal From Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, and conclusion or withdrawal from study (up to Week 108)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life (QOL) was assessed using the FACT-B questionnaire, which was a 37-item (27 general and 10 breast cancer-specific questions) self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 dimensions: physical-, social/family-, emotional-, functional-well being, and a breast cancer subscale. Higher scores on the FACT-B scales indicate a higher QOL; each ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The score is transformed for FACT-B and results in a total score ranging from 0 to 144.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Female ≥18 years. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             test at screening and must use an approved contraceptive method, if appropriate (for
             example, intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) beginning
             2 weeks before the first dose of investigational product and for 28 days after the
             final dose of investigational product.

          -  Metastatic breast cancer, histologically/cytologically confirmed. If the disease is
             restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature must be confirmed by cytology
             or histology.

          -  Subjects must have stage IV breast cancer whereby their disease has progressed in
             either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Prior therapies must include, but are not
             limited to:

          -  Taxane-containing regimen for at least 4 cycles, or 2 cycles provided disease
             progression occurred while on taxane.

          -  Anthracycline-containing regimen for at least 4 cycles, or 2 cycles provided disease
             progression occurred while on anthracycline.

          -  Subjects must have documented progression following at least ONE trastuzumab plus
             cytotoxic chemotherapy or anti-hormonal regimen in the metastatic setting.

          -  Note: The most recent treatment must have contained trastuzumab, either alone or in
             combination with other therapy in the metastatic setting, and subjects must have
             progressed while on this regimen. Progression is defined as either new lesions or a
             ≥20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) on the progression radiologic scan.

          -  Subjects must have archived tumor tissue available for testing.

             (FISH) or documented overexpression of the ErbB2 protein by IHC in primary or
             metastatic tumor tissue. The IHC or FISH amplification may be documented by a local or
             central laboratory for randomization into the study. Subjects may be randomized on the
             basis of ErbB2 positivity by IHC 3+ overexpression or FISH amplification.

          -  Lesion eligibility is as follows:

          -  at least one measurable lesion(s) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors [RECIST; Therasse, 2000], or

          -  Note: Tumor lesions which are situated in a previously irradiated field, and have
             well-defined margins which are located in soft tissue will be defined as measurable
             disease.

          -  Subjects with stable CNS metastases defined as asymptomatic and off systemic steroids
             and anticonvulsants for at least 1 month. Treatment with prophylactic anticonvulsants
             is permitted, unless listed within the Prohibited Medications (Section 8.2).

          -  Radiotherapy if received within 2 weeks prior to initiation of investigational product
             to a limited area (e.g., palliative treatment for painful disease) other than the sole
             site of measurable disease is allowed; however, subject must have completed treatment
             and recovered from all treatment-related toxicities prior to administration of the
             first dose of investigational product.

          -  With the single exception of prior trastuzumab treatment, all prior chemotherapy,
             immunotherapy, biologic therapy, or surgery (except for minor surgical procedures)
             must be discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to the first dose of investigational
             product. Subjects must have recovered or stabilized sufficiently from
             treatment-related toxicities prior to administration of the first dose of
             investigational product.

          -  Bisphosphonate therapy for bone metastases is allowed; however, treatment must be
             initiated prior to the first dose of investigational product. Prophylactic use of
             bisphosphonates is permitted only for the treatment of osteoporosis.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 to 2.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range of normal as measured by
             echocardiogram. MUGA scans will be accepted in cases where an echocardiogram cannot be
             performed or is inconclusive. Same modality used at baseline must be used for repeat
             assessments throughout study.

          -  Subject must have adequate organ function as defined in Table 1 :

          <title>Time to Progression (TTP)</title>
          <description>TTP was defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or death due to breast cancer. Because this outcome measure was confounded by death due to other causes and was similar to PFS, it was not analyzed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) Scores at Week 4, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, and Conclusion or Withdrawal From Study</title>
        <description>Quality of Life (QOL) was assessed using the FACT-B questionnaire, which was a 37-item (27 general and 10 breast cancer-specific questions) self-reporting instrument consisting of 5 dimensions: physical-, social/family-, emotional-, functional-well being, and a breast cancer subscale. Higher scores on the FACT-B scales indicate a higher QOL; each ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The score is transformed for FACT-B and results in a total score ranging from 0 to 144.</description>
