      The aim of this study was to evalute three different acupuncture techniques, including one
      sham control, in its effect on osteoarthitis of the knee

      Background: Acupuncture is one of the most frequently used complementary therapeutic
      approaches in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Due to methodological shortcomings
      of previous randomized controlled studies, controversy persists whether the observed effects
      are specific to acupuncture or non-specific consequences of needling.

      Objective: To compare classical Chinese acupuncture, semi-standardized modern acupuncture and
      non-specific needling by means of a double-blinded repeated measures cross-over design.

      Intervention: Within three weeks all patients receive three treatment modalities in a random
      order in a double-blind study design.

      Main outcome measures: Improvement in knee flexibility according to the neutral-zero method,
      defining a success as improvement by 10 degrees or more.

      Secondary parameter: improvement in pain according to the reduced WOMAC score by 50 percent
      or more.
