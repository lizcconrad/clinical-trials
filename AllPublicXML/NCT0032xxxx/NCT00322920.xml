  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan when
      given weekly with cisplatin in patients with persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage
      cervical cancer. Secondary purposes are to describe the toxicity profile in patients with
      persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage cervical cancer treated with the combination of
      topotecan when given weekly with cisplatin and to determine the response rate and time to
      progression in patients with persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage cervical cancer treated
      with the combination of topotecan when given weekly with cisplatin.

    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with recurrent cervical cancer generally have limited options for cure.
      Occasionally, radiation therapy may be utilized in localized recurrent disease with curative
      intent; however, most patients are not candidates for curative therapy secondary to
      disseminated disease, and thus are frequently treated with palliative chemotherapy. Initial
      experiences with chemotherapy in this clinical setting demonstrated cisplatin to be an active
      agent. Subsequent trials using combinations of cisplatin and ifosfamide or paclitaxel
      demonstrated higher response rates compared to cisplatin alone but did not demonstrate an
      improvement in overall survival. Topotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that has been used
      in the management of cervical and ovarian cancer. Several phase II studies have demonstrated
      topotecan to be an active agent in cervical cancer. In an effort to ameliorate toxicity noted
      with 3-5 day dosing regimens of topotecan, investigators have evaluated weekly dosing of
      topotecan. Thus far, the toxicity of weekly topotecan dosing in cervical cancer has not been
      evaluated. In this study, topotecan will be given weekly at escalating dose levels starting
      at 2.0 mb/m2 with standard cisplatin at 50 mg/m2 every 21 days. This study will help to
      determine acceptable dosing for the combination of weekly topotecan and cisplatin in patients
      with persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage cervical cancer which can then be utilized in a
      cohort of patients with cervical cancer in a phase II study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have persistent, recurrent, or primary Stage IVB carcinoma of the cervix
             not amenable to curative therapy with either surgery and/or radiation.

          -  Patients must have biopsy proven squamous cell, adenosquamous, or adenocarcinoma
             histology.

             0 or 1.

          -  Patients must have recovered from any effects attributable to surgery, radiation, or
             chemoradiotherapy. A minimum of six weeks shall have passed since the last
             administration of chemoradiotherapy or three weeks for radiation therapy alone.

          -  Patients must be free of clinically significant infections.

             the last 5 years are ineligible.

          -  Patients with non-squamous, adenosquamous, or adenocarcinoma histology.

             percutaneous drainage.

          -  Patients currently receiving any or having received other investigational agents
             within the last 30 days are ineligible.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to topotecan or cisplatin.

          -  Patients with craniospinal metastases.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, serious peripheral
             neuropathy, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit or preclude
             compliance with study requirements are ineligible.
