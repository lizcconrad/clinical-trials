      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the incidence of surgical site wound
      infection will be reduced in open appendectomy patients through the use of the Alexis速 wound
      retractor.

      Aim: This is a randomized comparison of open appendectomy using metal retractors and open
      appendectomy using the Alexis速 wound retractor in patients with simple and complicated
      appendicitis. The study is designed in order to minimize bias by standardizing the two
      procedures and blinding patients and nurses during the preoperative and postoperative period.

      After obtaining informed consent, or informed assent of minors, subjects will be randomized
      to either of two groups: one groups will undergo a standard open appendectomy using
      traditional metal retractors. The second group will undergo an open appendectomy with the use
      of the Alexis速 wound retractor.

      Pre-operative antibiotic Zosyn will be given prior to skin incision. Skin prep will be
      betadine, duraprep or gel prep. After entering the peritoneal cavity, the Alexis速 retractor
      will be introduced and used to maintain retraction for the duration of surgery.

      In simple appendicitis, the patient will receive one dose of antibiotics six hours after
      surgery. The patient will not receive oral antibiotics at discharge. In complicated
      appendicitis, the patient will be given Zosyn until afebrile for 24 hours and a normal white
      blood cell count. The patient will be discharged on oral antibiotics.

      Follow up will occur between the 14th and 21st post operative day. At the test of cure visit,
      the wound will be checked for erythema, drainage, or opening. It will be assessed whether the
      subject received any further medical attention or received medications since discharge.
