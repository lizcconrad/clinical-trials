      To evaluate and compare the expression and change in expression of key severe asthma targets
      at baseline in mile to moderate asthmatics vs. severe asthmatic subjects.

      To evaluate and compare the airway pathology at baseline and changes in airway pathology in
      relation to asthma severity.
