  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the dose-related safety, immunogenicity, and
      protective efficacy of a trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine in healthy
      adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All currently licensed influenza vaccines in the United States are produced in embryonated
      hen's eggs. There are several well-recognized disadvantages to the use of eggs as the
      substrate for influenza vaccine. Eggs require specialized manufacturing facilities and could
      be difficult to scale up rapidly in response to an emerging need such as a pandemic. It is
      usually necessary to adapt candidate vaccine viruses for high-yield growth in eggs, a process
      that can be time consuming, is not always successful, and can select receptor variants that
      may have suboptimal immunogenicity. In addition, agricultural diseases that affect chicken
      flocks, and that might be an important issue in a pandemic due to an avian influenza virus
      strain, could easily disrupt the supply of eggs for vaccine manufacturing. Therefore,
      development of alternative substrates for influenza vaccine production has been identified as
      a high-priority objective.

      One potential alternative method for production of influenza vaccine is expression of the
      influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) using recombinant DNA techniques. This alternative avoids
      dependence on eggs and is very efficient because of the high levels of protein expression
      under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically stable adults, aged 18-49 years.

          -  Provided informed consent prior to any study procedures.

          -  Able to comply with all study procedures.

          -  Available for follow-up for the duration of the influenza season.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential had a negative urine pregnancy test at the time of
             randomization and were willing to use an adequate form of contraception during the
             course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of immunodeficiency or treatment with immunosuppressive medications. (Use
             of inhaled steroids or of topical steroids was not considered immunosuppressive;
             receipt of systemic glucocorticosteroids was not allowed if daily intake was &gt;10 mg of
             prednisone or equivalent).

          -  Presence of high-risk conditions or other characteristics considered to be indications
             for influenza vaccination, as defined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization
             Practices (ACIP).

          -  Acute febrile illness (defined as having a temperature ≥100degreesF) or upper
             respiratory tract illness within 72 hours of vaccination.

          -  Use of experimental vaccines or any influenza vaccine after May 31st 2004 for the 2005
             Southern Hemisphere or 2004 to 2005 Northern hemisphere epidemic seasons.
