  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effects of a 16-week individualized, intensive strength training program in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Primary and secondary outcomes include: strength and body
      composition, function, disease activity, pain, quality of life.

      We hypothesized that improvements would be seen in all of the above outcomes.
