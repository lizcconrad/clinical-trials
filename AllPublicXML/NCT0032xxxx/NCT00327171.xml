    <textblock>
      This study evaluated outcomes in participants with advanced ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma
      receiving aflibercept.

      The primary objective was to compare the objective response rate of Aflibercept
      (ziv-aflibercept, AVE0005, VEGF trap, ZALTRAPÂ®) 4.0 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg, administered
      intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks with historical control in participants with advanced
      ovarian epithelial (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal) adenocarcinoma resistant
      to platinum and topotecan and/or liposomal doxorubicin.

      The secondary objectives was to further assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, potential
      biological and pharmacogenomic markers of study drug activity, and health-related quality of
      life.

      This study employed an Independent Review Committee (IRC) for radiological tumor assessments.
      For all tumor assessment-related efficacy variables, two analyses were performed: the primary
      analysis was based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) reviewed data and the secondary
      analysis was based on Investigator evaluation. If an endpoint was evaluated by the IRC, the
      IRC reviewed data is reported for this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included:

        -  A screening period for 21 days

        -  Randomization at baseline (Treatment was initiated with 5 days of randomization)

        -  A treatment period with 14-day study treatment cycles until a study withdrawal criterion
           was met

        -  A follow-up period up to 60 days after the end of treatment

      Withdrawal criteria that led to treatment discontinuation were:

        -  The participant or their legally authorized representative requested to withdraw

        -  In the investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be detrimental to the
           participant's well being, due to reasons such as disease progression, unacceptable
           toxicity, noncompliance, or logistical considerations.

        -  A specific request by the Sponsor

        -  Participant had intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of study
           treatment

        -  Participant had more than 2 aflibercept dose reductions

        -  Participant had arterial thromboembolic events, including cerebrovascular accidents,
           myocardial infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, new onset or worsening of
           pre-existing angina

        -  Participant had radiographic evidence of intestinal obstruction (e.g., dilated loops of
           bowel accompanied by air-fluid levels) or gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., presence
           of extraluminal gas) requiring surgical intervention

        -  Participant was lost to follow-up

      After discontinuing treatment, participants remained on the study until the last
      post-treatment visit or until recovery of drug related toxicities, whichever was later.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response (OR) as Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Based on the Analysis by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) - Simon's Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to efficacy cut-off date, 18 January 2008 (approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>OR included Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR). Per RECIST, CR was disappearance of all target or non-target lesions, or normalization of tumor marker levels (for non-target lesions) and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with baseline sum LD as reference.
Tumors were assessed by an independent third-party core imaging laboratory evaluating the chest, abdomen, and pelvis by Computerized Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans; and responses were confirmed by repeat tumor imaging 4-6 weeks later.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Clinical Benefit Response (CBR) as Per RECIST Based on the Analysis by the IRC</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to efficacy cut-off date, 18 January 2008 (approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR was defined as having a Stable disease (SD) for &gt;= 6 months or a confirmed OR (PR or CR). Based on RECIST:
SD was neither a sufficient shrinkage of the target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive disease (PD), the persistence of non-target lesions or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits (for non-target lesions)
CR was the disappearance of all target or non-target lesions; and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with reference to the baseline sum LD.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DR) Based on the Analysis by an Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to efficacy cut-off date, 18 January 2008 (approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DR was defined as the time interval from the first documentation of CR or PR to the date of tumor progression (or disease progression) as determined by RECIST, or death from any cause, whichever was earlier.
Based on RECIST, progressive disease was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, the appearance of one or more new target or non-target lesions, or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Time to Tumor Progression (TTP) as Per RECIST Based on the Analysis by the IRC</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to efficacy cut-off date, 18 January 2008 (approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTP was defined as the time interval measured from the date of randomization to the date of tumor progression as determined by RECIST. TTP was estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves.
For a participant who did not reach tumor progression during study, the censoring date was the date of the last valid tumor burden assessment or the date of study cut-off, whichever was earlier. If the participant had no valid post-baseline tumor burden assessment due to early termination, the censoring date was the date of randomization.</description>

    <measure>Time to Tumor Marker (CA-125) Progression (TTMP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From enrollment to efficacy cut-off date, 18 January 2008 (approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTMP was the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of tumor marker progression as was defined by GCIG for the evaluable participants. TTMP was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves.
For a participant who did not reach tumor marker progression (TMP) during study, the censoring date was the date of the last valid tumor burden assessment or the date of study cut-off, whichever was earlier. If the participant had no valid post-baseline tumor burden assessment due to early termination, the censoring date was the date of randomization.</description>

        <description>OR included Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR). Per RECIST, CR was disappearance of all target or non-target lesions, or normalization of tumor marker levels (for non-target lesions) and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with baseline sum LD as reference.
Tumors were assessed by an independent third-party core imaging laboratory evaluating the chest, abdomen, and pelvis by Computerized Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans; and responses were confirmed by repeat tumor imaging 4-6 weeks later.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Clinical Benefit Response (CBR) as Per RECIST Based on the Analysis by the IRC</title>
        <description>CBR was defined as having a Stable disease (SD) for &gt;= 6 months or a confirmed OR (PR or CR). Based on RECIST:
SD was neither a sufficient shrinkage of the target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive disease (PD), the persistence of non-target lesions or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits (for non-target lesions)
CR was the disappearance of all target or non-target lesions; and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with reference to the baseline sum LD.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With a Clinical Benefit Response (CBR) as Per RECIST Based on the Analysis by the IRC</title>
          <description>CBR was defined as having a Stable disease (SD) for &gt;= 6 months or a confirmed OR (PR or CR). Based on RECIST:
SD was neither a sufficient shrinkage of the target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive disease (PD), the persistence of non-target lesions or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits (for non-target lesions)
CR was the disappearance of all target or non-target lesions; and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with reference to the baseline sum LD.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time Based on Analysis by the IRC</title>
        <description>PFS was as the time interval measured from the date of randomization to the date of tumor progression as determined by RECIST or death from any cause, whichever was earlier. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves.
For a participant who did not reach tumor progression during study, the censoring date was the date of the last valid tumor burden assessment or the date of study cut-off, whichever was earlier. If the participant had no valid post-baseline tumor burden assessment due to early termination, the censoring date was the date of randomization.</description>

        <description>OR included Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR). Per RECIST, CR was disappearance of all target or non-target lesions, or normalization of tumor marker levels (for non-target lesions) and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with baseline sum LD as reference.
Tumors were assessed by an independent third-party core imaging laboratory evaluating the chest, abdomen, and pelvis by Computerized Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans; and responses were confirmed by repeat tumor imaging 4-6 weeks later.</description>

        <title>Participant's Assessment of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) Using a by Using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The FACT-O questionnaire consists of 38 scored questions (scored from 0-4) that address physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and some additional concerns which relate specifically to ovarian cancer symptoms. For each question, higher scores reflect a better quality of life. The total FACT-O score ranges from 0-152, with 152 indicating the best outcome.</description>
