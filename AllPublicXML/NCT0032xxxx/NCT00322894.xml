      The Expanded Breast Cancer Registry and Tissue Repository Research Team (EBCR-RT) is
      comprised of University of Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty and staff whose goals
      are to improve the outcomes and quality of life of patients with breast cancer, and
      ultimately to eradicate and cure breast cancer. One focus of the EBCR-RT is the creation an
      infrastructure that can potentially be adopted as a model for a statewide registry and tissue
      repository for the discovery of biomarkers for this disease.

      The goals of the EBCR are:

        1. To register patients diagnosed with breast cancer and information relevant to their
           diagnosis (such as stage, grade, hormone receptor status, etc), treatment (surgery,
           radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, etc), and survivorship (Quallity of Life,
           etc).

        2. To collect relevant demographics including age, menopausal status, race/ethnicity, body
           mass index (BMI), place of residence, behaviors (smoking, alcohol intake, etc)

        3. To establish a paired tumor tissue and blood sample for each relevant time-point (as
           defined in the protocol), which will be stored in the Tissue Bank Shared Resource
           Facility for future hypothesis-driven research.

      Institutions and/or physicians are required to report each new diagnosis of breast cancer to
      the New Mexico Tumor Registry (NMTR). The NMTR is a valuable database that provides
      information on breast cancer, including trends in incidence and survival. However, relevant
      information on breast cancer prognosis and treatment is either not routinely collected or not
      readily available to the NMTR. We propose to establish an Expanded Breast Cancer Registry and
      Tissue Repository (EBCR) at this institution that could serve as an infrastructure for
      collection of this information. Furthermore, a tissue bank will be established for collection
      of paired tissue (tumor, buccal cells and blood sample) from patients diagnosed with breast
      cancer who consent to providing excess/extra tissue and additional blood for the Tissue
      Repository. This tissue bank will serve as a repository from which researchers can access
      tissue samples to conduct laboratory-based studies of genetic determinants of breast cancer
      risks, prognosis and survival in women with breast cancer seen in this institution.
