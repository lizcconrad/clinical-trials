  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, open-label, randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      Lilly/Alkermes inhaled insulin system compared to injected pre-meal insulin in non-smoking
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients will be treated for 24 months with a 2-month
      follow-up period.
