  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the most severe form of liver injury in the spectrum of
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has emerged as the major cause of chronic liver
      disease in developed countries. Among adults in the United States, the prevalence is between
      5.7% and 17%. These rates are expected to increase concurrent with the epidemics of obesity
      and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are the major risk factors for NAFLD and NASH. In
      addition to its high prevalence, NASH is also a progressive fibrotic disease that advances to
      cirrhosis and liver related death in 20% and 12% of patients, respectively. Among NASH
      patients with cirrhosis, 40% have liver related death. Diabetics are particularly prone to
      experience these poor outcomes. No therapy has been proven effective for patients with NASH.

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids
      (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] combined with docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] called Opti-EPA)
      improves NASH compared to treatment with placebo pills. The placebo pills will contain corn
      oil and will be contained in a capsule, but have no medical effect on the body. The
      investigators will determine improvement in NASH from microscopic changes in the subject's
      liver tissue during 48 weeks of treatment. This means that the subject will need to have a
      liver biopsy before and after the treatment.

      Omega-3 fatty acids are a form of polyunsaturated fats, one of the four basic types of fat
      that the body gets from food. (Cholesterol, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat are the
      others.) One's body does not make this type of fat; it comes from food sources. These fats
      are found in foods like cold water fish (tuna, salmon, and mackerel), and vegetable products
      like flaxseed oil and walnuts.

      Research shows that polyunsaturated fats are good for people. Studies have shown that it is
      good for heart health by playing a role in keeping blood cholesterol levels low, keeping
      irregular heart rhythms stable, and reducing blood pressure.

      The drug being studied, Opti-EPA, is a nutritional supplement. They do not have to be
      reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) like medicines do. Opti-EPA is considered
      experimental in this study. This means that the United States Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has not approved it for use in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

    <textblock>
      Although there is no proven effective treatment of NASH, dietary supplementation with long
      chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA's) may be beneficial. This suggestion is
      based on three previously reported observations: first, patients with NASH consume less PUFAs
      and more saturated fats than subjects without NASH. Second, PUFAs are beneficial in patients
      with hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia. Third, PUFAs decrease lipid peroxidation and
      ameliorate hepatic steatosis in animal models of NAFLD.

      We therefore hypothesize that the administration of these PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
      and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) will reduce hepatic fat content, inflammation and hepatic
      injury in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have NASH.

      Aims

      To determine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have NASH if dietary
      supplementation with purified omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) will:

        1. Decrease the histologic severity of NASH.

        2. Alter the expression of genes important in the pathways of hepatic lipid synthesis and
           oxidation.

      Study design:

      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive omega-3 fatty acids or
      placebo. Stratified randomization will be done based on the NASH Clinical Research Network
      pathology score of 5.
