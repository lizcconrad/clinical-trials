      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a 24 hour infusion with
      levosimendan in patients with acute myocardial infarction and heart failure after acute
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) treatment.

      Double blind placebo-controlled study with parallel groups in patients with acute PCI treated
      myocardial infarction complicated with decompensated heart failure. The study include a
      prospectively defined subgroup of patients in cardiogenic shock. Treating acute myocardial
      infarction with PCI restores blood flow, but decreased contractility remains for hours and
      days due to stunned myocardium. Levosimendan has both inotropic and vasodilatory effects
      which could support the failing heart after treating the acute myocardial infarction with PCI
      and may improve myocardial stunning and decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines. Levosimendan
      could improve myocardial contractility, symptoms and outcome without adverse effects. The
      aims of the study are to investigate whether a 24 hour infusion with levosimendan could
      improve regional contractility measured by echocardiography, improve BNP levels, reduce the
      levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improve symptoms in patients with acute
      decompensated heart failure during the first 24 hours after acute PCI.
