      Myocardial perfusion SPECT is recognized as an effective clinical diagnostic imaging
      technique in the assessment of myocardial perfusion and coronary artery diseases. It is the
      most important clinical application of SPECT imaging techniques.

      The goal is to conduct a clinical pilot study to evaluate the use of rotating multi-segment
      slant-hole (RMSSH) SPECT in the detection of myocardial defects especially in very sick
      patients in the nuclear medicine clinics, emergence room, and intensive care units.
      Comparison of the clinical utilities of the cardiac RMSSH SPECT technique with conventional
      cardiac planar and SPECT with parallel-hole collimation will also allow us to evaluate the
      potential application of the technique to a wider patient population.

      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that quantitative 99mTc myocardial
      perfusion RMSSH SPECT provides similar diagnostic accuracy in patients with cardiac diseases
      as conventional SPECT imaging techniques.
