  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study all ICU patients with an independent baseline functional status, who experience a
      critical illness requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, evaluating the role of
      protocol-directed, early physical and occupational therapy on the incidence of critical
      illness associated functional debilitation. Our goal is to hasten the recovery of independent
      physical functioning as well as to reduce ICU delirium in the group of patients who begin
      this intervention from the earliest hours of ventilator dependence.

    <description>Passive range of motion exercises for all limbs in patients who remain unresponsive despite sedative interruption (ten repetitions in all cardinal directions).
Sessions began with active assisted and active range of motion exercises in the supine position.
If tolerated, treatment is advanced to bed mobility activities, including transferring to upright sitting.
Sitting balance activities are followed by participation in activities of daily living (ADLs) and exercises that encourage increased independence with functional tasks.
The session progresses to transfer training, and finally pre-gait exercises and ambulation.
Progression of activities is dependent on patient tolerance and stability.
Therapy intervention continues on a daily basis throughout the patient's hospital stay until he/she returns to prior level of function or is discharged.</description>
