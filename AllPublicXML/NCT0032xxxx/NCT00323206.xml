  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study a type of gene therapy treatment called
      plasmid electroporation. This type of treatment involves the injection of a gene into some
      melanoma tumors located near the surface of the skin, followed by a burst of electricity into
      the tumor to cause the tumor to take up the gene. This study is a Phase I study to determine
      the side effects and the correct dose of this type of treatment and also its effectiveness in
      treating melanoma. While the electroporation technique has been used in people, the
      combination of plasmid injection and electroporation is being tried in human beings for the
      first time.

    <description>MTD of intralesionally electroporated IL-12 plasmid (pIL-12) as well as a recommended dose for Phase II study. Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT): will be defined as hematologic toxicities or diarrhea greater than grade 3, and nonhematologic toxicities greater than grade 2 as defined in the NCI common toxicity criteria, Version 3.0. Significant local skin breakdown, cellulitis, bleeding or ulceration will preclude treatment of particular tumor nodules although treatment of other nodules can continue.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have cytologically/histologically documented metastatic malignant
             melanoma with lesions near the skin that would be accessible to electroporation and
             Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) and biopsy.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  Patients must have ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Patients may have had prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy (with vaccines or Interferon
             or IL-2) with progression or persistent disease. All chemotherapy or immunotherapy
             must be stopped for 4 weeks prior to electroporation. Patients may have had radiation
             therapy, but must have progressive disease after radiation therapy if the lesions to
             be electroporated are within the radiation field. In addition, it must be at least 2
             weeks since administration of radiation therapy and all signs of toxicity must have
             abated.

          -  Patients must be able to give informed consent and able to follow guidelines given in
             the study

          -  Patients must have a minimum of two eligible tumors and may have up to four eligible
             tumors treated with electroporation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have had prior therapy with IL-12 or prior genetic therapy

          -  Patients must not have evidence of significant active infection (e.g., pneumonia,
             cellulitis, wound abscess, etc.) at time of study entry.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal and normal hepatic function (creatinine &lt; 1.5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin and SGOT (AST) within institutional normal
             limits) obtained within 4 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500/mm^3 and platelet count &gt;
             100,000 /mm^3 within 4 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Pregnant and breast feeding women are excluded from the study because effects on the
             fetus are unknown and there may be a risk of increased fetal wastage.

          -  Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test and be willing to use a
             highly effective method of contraception. Men who are sexually active must also be
             willing to use an accepted and effective method of contraception.

          -  Patients with electronic pacemakers or defibrillators are excluded from this study as
             the effect of electroporation on these devices is unknown. Patients with significant
             cardiac arrhythmia's (including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or
             WPW syndrome) are also excluded.

          -  Patients with a history of epilepsy are excluded unless they have been seizure free
             over the last 5 years and are thought to be at low risk for seizure by their
             neurologist.

          -  Tumors that invade the bone, major blood vessels or nerves are ineligible because
             those tumors are contraindications to the use of electroporation.
