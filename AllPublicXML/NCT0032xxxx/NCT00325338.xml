  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ragweed MATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for
      patients with hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen (hay fever). This novel formulation is
      designed to provide a vaccine that will be efficacious with only four escalating dose
      injections administered before the start of the pollen season. In this Follow-up Study the
      Efficacy will be assessed by exposing allergic subjects to Ragweed pollen in an environmental
      exposure chamber EEC. Patient symptomatic response to pollen and patient quality of life in
      the EEC will be determined. Patients who previously completed two EEC portions of study
      Ragweed MATAMPL 204 and who had been treated with either Ragweed MATA MPL or Placebo before
      the 2005 ragweed season will be enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have completed both EEC periods of study P2DP5001; have had received
             either placebo or the top dose if they had been treated with Ragweed MATA MPL; and
             have had no major changes in medical history or health status since completing the
             study.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to give written informed consent and provide this
             consent prior to initiation of any study procedures, including initiation of washout
             of any concomitant medications.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to attend all study visits.

          -  Patients must observe the drug washout times listed in Table 3.2.3 prior to Screening
             (Visit 1). The use of other concomitant medications will be permitted if they are not
             expected to interfere with the ability of the patient to participate in the study and
             provided that they have been on a stable regimen (i.e. the same dose and schedule of
             administration) for eight weeks prior to screening).
