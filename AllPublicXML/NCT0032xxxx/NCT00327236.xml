      The investigators believe that T cells, cells that are a part of the immune system, are what
      are causing the neurological problems while also attacking tumor cells. This protocol studies
      the clinical status of patients with paraneoplastic neurological disorder (PND) as well as
      their blood to understand the relationship between their neurological disease, their cancer,
      and their immune system.

      Patients with paraneoplastic neurological disorders (PNDs) provide a unique model for
      studying tumor immunity and neuronal autoimmunity. We hypothesize that T lymphocyte
      autoimmune dysfunction is involved in the pathogenesis of the paraneoplastic neurological
      syndromes, and that killer T cells are involved in the targeting and successful killing of
      tumor cells in these cancer patients. Furthermore, we postulate that this activity may
      provide a model for autoimmune brain disease. We will assess the immune responses in PND
      patients, correlate these with the clinical data (time course of disease, symptoms and signs,
      disability), and collect and archive clinical data, serum and cells from PND patients for
      current and future studies into the basic immune system phenomenon present in PND patients.
