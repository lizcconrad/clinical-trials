  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac perfusion changes have been seen after whole breast / chest wall irradiation for
      breast cancer. The Active Breathing Coordinator (ABC) device theoretically decreases
      radiation exposure to the heart during radiation for breast cancer. In this trial cardiac
      perfusion changes or lack thereof will be quantified in women treated with radiation for
      breast cancer while using the ABC device. The control group of the study will consist of
      patients randomized to radiation therapy without the ABC device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 left sided breast cancer patients will be randomized to receive breast/chest wall
      irradiation with or without ABC. Patients will receive radiation therapy at a dose of 180-200
      cGy per fraction for 23-27 fractions to a total dose of 4600 - 4860 cGy. Additional radiation
      to the lumpectomy bed or mastectomy scar is at the discretion of the treating physician. The
      total dose to the tumor bed or mastectomy scar cannot exceed 6600cGy. Treatments will be
      given Monday through Friday.

      After the completion of radiation therapy, patients will be seen on the following schedule:

      A follow up examination will take place every 3-6 months for the first two years, then every
      4-6 months for years for the next 3 years. After 5 years follow-up evaluations will occur
      annually. A SPECT scan will be obtained at 6 months post therapy.

      Patients must be 18 and older and must have histologically confirmed (by routine H&amp;E
      staining) invasive adenocarcinoma or Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the left breast.

      Patients must have also undergone a segmental mastectomy (SM) or Mastectomy.

      Patients must not have received prior radiation therapy to the breast at any time for any
      reason.

      Patients must not be pregnant due to the potential for fetal harm as a result of this
      treatment regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be 18 and older

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed (by routine H&amp;E staining) invasive
             adenocarcinoma or Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the left breast.

          -  Patients must have undergone a segmental mastectomy (SM) or Mastectomy

          -  Patients must not have received prior radiation therapy to the breast at any time for
             any reason.

          -  Any patient with active local-regional disease prior to registration is not eligible.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant due to the potential for fetal harm as a result of this
             treatment regimen. Women of child-bearing age will be given a serum pregnancy test
             prior to study entry to ensure they are not pregnant. Women of child-bearing potential
             must use effective non-hormonal contraception while undergoing radiation therapy.

          -  Patients must not have a serious medical or psychiatric illness which prevents
             informed consent or compliance with treatment.

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients requiring oxygen

          -  Sarcoma or Squamous Cell pathology

          -  Right-sided breast cancers

          -  Metastatic disease to the breast
