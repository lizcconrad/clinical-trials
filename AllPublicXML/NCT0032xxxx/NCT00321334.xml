    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to determine whether 3 cycles of TP (docetaxel plus cisplatin)
      after complete operation will improve survival when compared with 3 cycles of TP prior to
      complete resection for NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancers diagnosed
      worldwide. Surgical resection offers the best chance for cure for those patients diagnosed
      with early-stage disease, however, the vast majority of patients experience eventually
      relapse or metastasis. The rationale of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage
      NSCLC lies in the possibility of eradicating micro-metastasis disease, so it appears to
      improve survival by reducing the occurrence of distant metastases. Meta analysis, CALGB 9633,
      JBR 10 and ANITA trials have shown postoperative (adjuvant) CT after complete resection will
      prolong survival. On the other hand, Depierre et al had conducted a trial to demonstrate
      preoperative (neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC appears to improve survival. We
      need a head to head trial to comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant chemotherapy to answer which
      treatment model is better to early stager NSCLC. Based on proven activity and survival
      benefit in advance NSCLC, docetaxel has been introduced into neoadjuvant therapy, even as a
      potential option in adjuvant setting.

      Comparison: 3 cycles of TP after complete operation compared to 3 cycles of TP prior to
      complete resection for NSCLC.
