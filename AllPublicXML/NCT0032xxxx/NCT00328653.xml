      The primary objective of this study is:

        -  To assess the efficacy of Nova22007, a cyclosporine A (CsA), 0.05% and 0.1% versus
           vehicle in patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) after a 4-week treatment
           period.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To compare the safety and ocular tolerance of Nova22007 0.05% and 0.1%;

        -  To assess the long term safety and ocular tolerance of Nova22007 0.05% and 0.1%; and

        -  To assess the decrease in frequency of concomitant artificial tears use.
