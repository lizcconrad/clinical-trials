  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the tetanic noxious stimuli and the measured skin
      conductance response can be used as a test in patients before surgery to have an indication
      about what amount of analgesics the patient will need during surgery.

      Skin Conductance (SC) shows the emotional state as reflected in changes in the sympathetic
      nervous system. During sleep or other states of low basic sympathetic activity, activation of
      the sympathetic nervous system results in filling of the palmar and plantar sweat glands, and
      the SC increases transiently before the sweat is removed and the SC decreases again. When a
      short lasting outgoing sympathetic nervous burst occurs, fluctuations of SC will follow. An
      increase in the number of SC fluctuations (NSCF) can therefore be interpreted as increased
      activity in this part of the sympathetic nervous system. When remifentanil, an opioid
      analgetic is given, NSCF is reduced.

      Genetic variation influences the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of analgesics like
      morphine derivates and remifentanil. 50 female patients will therefore be blood tested to
      study if they are Val/Val or Met/Met for the COMT gene, or if they are homozygous or
      heterozygous for the 118G allele and the 118A allele.

      This study will show if skin conductance can be used to measure noxious stimulation response
      before surgery (by giving a tetanic stimuli), and then predict what level of analgesic a
      patient will need during surgery.
