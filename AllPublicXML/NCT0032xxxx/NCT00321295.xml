  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a medical condition that is due to left ventricular
      systolic dysfunction (LVSD). LVSD is a decreased ability of the heart to pump blood forward.
      There are 5 million people in the United States that have CHF and 52,828 new cases are
      diagnosed annually. There are 995,000 hospital visits and 52,828 deaths annually due to CHF.
      Previous studies have shown that people with this condition are at a higher risk for
      complications immediately after any type of heart surgery than are normal individuals. This
      includes increased dependence on medications and devices to improve the pumping function of
      the heart and blood pressure. Additionally, they also have longer lengths of hospital stay
      and higher rates of death compared to normal individuals.

      Some patients with LVSD not only have a decreased pumping ability of the heart, they also
      have an inefficient pumping function. These patients have been shown to benefit from a device
      therapy known as biventricular pacing. Biventricular pacing involves simultaneously
      electrically stimulating the two major pumping chambers of the heart known as ventricles
      using a pacemaker and wires. This causes a more coordinated contraction of the heart chambers
      resulting in improvement in the pumping ability of the heart and blood pressure. Studies have
      confirmed that in these patients, implantation of a biventricular pacemaker improves
      patients' symptoms and quality of life as well as decreasing a need for future
      hospitalizations. Whether biventricular pacing in patients with LVSD improves patient
      outcomes after heart surgery has not been investigated.

      Some patients temporarily develop slow heart rates after cardiovascular surgery. These slow
      heart rates can cause a decrease in the blood pumped from the heart and result in low blood
      pressures. Therefore, all patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, regardless of left
      ventricular function, receive temporary pacing wires that are placed on one of the ventricles
      during the surgery. Temporary pacing will result in an increase in heart rate and improvement
      in the amount of blood pumped by the heart and in blood pressure. The placement of these
      wires is precautionary as only a few patients need to be paced for slow heart rates. Once
      patients are felt to no longer require them, the wires are easily removed. The purpose of
      this study is to determine whether biventricular pacing immediately after heart surgery in
      patients with LVSD will improve in-hospital outcomes.

      Patients that are scheduled for heart surgery and meet the inclusion criteria will be
      approached for consent to participate in this study. Once consented, they will be randomized
      to one of three treatment arms: usual care, RV pacing (single ventricle pacing), or
      biventricular pacing. Randomization is a process similar to picking numbers out of a hat. The
      patients will then undergo surgery as scheduled. During the surgery, the patients will
      receive the temporary pacing wires on both ventricles instead of one. Immediately after
      surgery, the patients will receive either usual care, RV pacing, or biventricular pacing
      depending upon the treatment arm that they were randomized to. The pacing wires will be
      removed as soon as the patients become stable as per routine. The clinical, operative, and
      in-hospital characteristics of these patients will be recorded on specialized forms. The
      characteristics of those that received biventricular pacing will be compared to those that
      had RV or no pacing to see whether there was any benefit to this mode of therapy.

      1. Basis for the study/study rationale Patients with congestive heart failure have high
           rates of mortality and morbidity (1). There are 5 million people in the United States
           that have congestive heart failure (CHF) and 52,828 new cases are diagnosed annually.
           There are 995,000 hospital visits with 52,828 deaths annually due to this condition.
           Although there have been numerous medical advances in drug therapy, there was a 164%
           increase in the number of hospital admissions for CHF since 1979 (1, 2).

           Biventricular (BiV) pacing has been shown to have acute and chronic benefits in a subset
           of patients with CHF (3-6). Those that have been shown to benefit from this mode of
           therapy have left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a widened QRS duration on the
           electrocardiogram. Acute hemodynamic studies comparing patients at baseline with either
           right ventricular (RV) or BiV pacing show significant improvements in the systolic blood
           pressure and cardiac output in patients with BiV pacing compared to either RV pacing or
           baseline measurements (3, 4). Furthermore, BiV pacing was associated with decrease in
           the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and diastolic mitral regurgitation. These
           acute hemodynamic benefits are sustained and manifest as improvements in clinical
           symptoms. The Multisite Stimulation in Cardiomyopathies (MUSTIC) study showed that BiV
           pacing was associated with a 23% increase in the distance walked in six minutes
           (P&lt;0.001), a 32% increase in the quality-of-life score (P&lt;0.001), an 8% increase in the
           peak oxygen uptake (P&lt;0.03), and a 66% decrease in the need for hospitalization (P&lt;0.05)
           compared to no pacing (5). Patients also preferred BiV pacing compared to no pacing
           (P&lt;0.001). The Multicenter InSync Randomized Clinical Evaluation (MIRACLE) study not
           only confirmed many of the findings of the MUSTIC trial, but also showed improvement in
           the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with BiV pacing (+4.6% vs. -0.2%,
           P&lt;0.001), compared to non-paced controls (6). Such data has led to the classification of
           BiV pacing in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy as a class IIa recommendation by
           ACC/AHA/NASPE guidelines (7).

           Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with left ventricular dysfunction
           carries a high mortality (8). Furthermore, patients with a low LVEF have a greater need
           for intraaortic balloon pump (P&lt;0.0001) and inotropic support (P&lt;0.001) with a longer
           length of hospital stay (P&lt;0.002) compared with those with normal LVEF (9, 10).

           Conduction system abnormalities following CABG are common (11, 12). The majority of
           these abnormalities are transient and are often managed using temporary epicardial
           pacing. Hence, all patients that undergo CABG receive epicardial leads as a
           precautionary measure. These leads are placed on the right or left ventricle and the
           right atrium. When patients are felt to no longer require these, they are removed
           easily. The role of BiV pacing in this setting is unknown. Whether patients that have
           left ventricular dysfunction would have improved post-operative mortality, less need for
           intraaortic balloon pump and inotropic support, and shorter length of hospital stay is
           unknown.

        2. Objectives Our hypothesis is that BiV pacing immediately following CABG will improve
           in-hospital outcomes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

           Endpoints:

           Primary: -Length of ICU stay

           Secondary: -In-hospital mortality

             -  Length of hospital stay

             -  Duration of inotropic support

             -  Duration of intraaortic ballon pump support

             -  Duration of mechanical ventillation

             -  Change in stroke volume with biventricular pacing

             -  Change in ventricular synchrony with biventricular pacing

        3. Methodology All patients that are scheduled for CABG or valve surgery and meet the
           inclusion criteria will be approached for consent pre-operatively. Once consent is
           obtained the patient will be randomized into one of three treatment arms: usual care, RV
           pacing, or BiV pacing. The patients will then undergo surgery as per routine. During
           cardiovascular surgery patients routinely receive epicardial pacing leads that are
           placed on the right or left ventricle and the right atrium. For the purposes of this
           study, epicardial pacing leads will be placed on both the right and left ventricles as
           well as the right atrium.

           After surgery is completed, the patients will receive either usual care, RV pacing, or
           BiV pacing depending upon their treatment arms. Intraoperative transesophageal
           echocardiography (TEE) is routinely performed during cardiac surgery. If TEE is being
           used in the subject images will be recorded with biventricular pacing, right ventricular
           pacing and no pacing in the first 30 patients studied to quantify changes in vetricular
           synchrony with biventricular pacing. Once the patient arrives in the SICU hemodynmic
           monitoring will be performed as usual. All patients return from the operating room with
           a pulmonary artery catheter. In the first 50 patients the stroke volume will be obtained
           by thermodilution method using the pulmonary artery catheter in their assigned treatment
           arm as well as following 2 minutes of right ventricular pacing and again following 2
           minutes of biventricular pacing. Pacing will be continued in the assigned treatment arm
           until all inotropic and intraortic ballon pump support has been weaned off. Crossover in
           treatment arms is discouraged, but will be at the discretion of the treating physicians.
           The epicardial pacing leads will be removed as per routine.
