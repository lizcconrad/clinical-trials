        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed as essential hypertension or not treated in the past 2 weeks(If the
             subject took medication in the past 2 weeks, a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks
             will be completed prior to performing screening (week -2) assessments)

          -  Mean seated SBP at screen visit = 130mmHg (as measured by a mercury sphygmomanometer)

          -  Type 2 diabetes (American Diabetes Association criteria 2004) and HbA1C &lt;11%

          -  Agree to practice acceptable contraceptive measures during the study, and for 30 days
             after the last dose of study medication is taken if the subject a female of
             child-bearing potential

          -  Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Mean seated SBP of &gt; 180 mmHg

          -  Known or suspected secondary hypertension

          -  Anemia defined by haemoglobin concentration &lt; 10.0 g/dL

          -  Hemoglobinopathy or peripheral vascular disease

          -  Clinically significant renal or hepatic disease (i.e., subjects with serum creatinine
             = 2.0 mg/dL; Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, or
             alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal reference range)

             requiring pharmacologic treatment

          -  Chronic disease requiring intermittent or chronic treatment with oral, intravenous, or
             intra-articular corticosteroids (i.e. only use of topical, inhaled or nasal
             corticosteroids is permissible)

          -  Female who is lactating, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant

          -  clinically significant abnormality identified at screening which in the judgement of
             the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study (e.g.
             physical examination, laboratory tests, or electrocardiogram etc.)
