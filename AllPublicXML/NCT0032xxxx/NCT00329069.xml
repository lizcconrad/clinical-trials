    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine, whether an intensified atorvastatin therapy can
      improve monocyte function in patients with coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypercholesterolemia is one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors that
      significantly elevates the risk for the development and progression of arteriosclerotic
      diseases.

      Statins such as atorvastatin have been shown to reduce atherogenic lipoprotein levels as well
      as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a large number of clinical trials. It is
      suggested that statins have- apart from their lipid-lowering properties- other pleiotropic
      effects that are responsible for their anti-atheroslerotic and and cardioprotective
      potential.

      Monocytes are crucially involved in the process of arteriogenesis (i.e. the growth of
      preexisting arterioles). Monocyte chemotaxis can be stimulated with arteriogenic molecules
      such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). In previous studies we could
      demonstrate that the VEGF-A- induced monocyte chemotaxis is severely impaired in
      hypercholesterolemic patients. This reduced response to VEGF seems to be associated with a
      decreased ability to form functional collaterals.

      Therefore we hypothesize that an intensified therapy with atorvastatin 40 mg once a day can
      significantly improve monocyte function in patients with coronary artery disease and
      hypercholesterolemia compared to patients who are only treated with a placebo.
