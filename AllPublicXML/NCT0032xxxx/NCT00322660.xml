  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children born after elective C-section have a greater risk of respiratory problems and
      hypoglycemia - most likely due to a lower concentration of stress hormones compared to
      children born vaginally. Hypothesis: can we eliminate or reduce the risk of respiratory
      distress and hypoglycaemia by administrating adrenaline to the newborn.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All children born at elective section with gestational age more than 37 + 0

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children in whom a serious malformation was found during pregnancy assuming this
             malformation will lead to very early death or respiratory problems.

          -  Serious malformations (ex.anencephalia) will be excluded at birth

          -  Other malformations will be estimated by investigator whether it will lead to
             exclusion.
