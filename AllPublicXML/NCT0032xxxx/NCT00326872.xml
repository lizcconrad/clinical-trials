  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well AZD2171 works in treating patients with
      neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibroma and/or neurofibroma near the spine.
      AZD2171 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of AZD2171, in terms of volume change in target tumors by
      3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI).

      II. Describe and define the toxicities of AZD2171 in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the value of 3D MRI data analysis in evaluating plexiform or paraspinal
      neurofibromas compared to conventional 2-dimensional MRI data analysis.

      II. Assess the value of delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in determining changes in
      vascularity of neurofibromas before and during treatment. III. Assess the quality of life of
      patients treated with AZD2171. IV. Evaluate the effect of AZD2171 on biological changes of
      human neurofibroma by comparing pre- and post-treatment specimens from patients involved in
      this trial or, alternatively, by evaluating the effect of AZD2171 on human tumor grafts in
      experimental animals.

      V. Evaluate relevant pharmacodynamic markers (circulating endothelial cells [CECs] and
      vascular endothelial growth factor-2 [VEGF2] levels) and pharmacogenetics analyses (variation
      in kdr/flk-1 and other genes) in response to AZD2171.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor location
      (peripheral vs paraspinal plexiform neurofibroma). Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily
      on days 1-28.

      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding or stable disease may continue treatment
      beyond 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of
      life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 2, prior to course 4, and every 6 courses
      thereafter.

    <description>Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of volumes of target lesions taking as reference the smallest volume recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
If a patient dies without documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of their death unless there is sufficient documented evidence to conclude no progression occurred prior to death.</description>

    <time_frame>From time of confirmed tumor objective response as CR or PR to the date of progression max 51 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients who have achieved a confirmed tumor objective response as the date at which the patient's objective status is first noted to be either a CR or PR to the date progression is documented.

    <description>Time to treatment failure is defined to be the time from the date of randomization to the date at which the patient is removed from treatment due to progression, toxicity, or refusal. If the patient is considered to be a major treatment violation or is taken off study as a non-protocol failure, the patient will be censored on the date they are removed from treatment.

    <description>Reduction in self reported worst pain per cycle as measured by the Worst Pain scale from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group Brief Pain Inventory (short form).
