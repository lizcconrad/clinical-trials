    <textblock>
      AMP-007 is a Phase 1/2 study for the treatment of advanced, previously treated multiple
      myeloma. The first phase of the study is designed to determine a safe dose of imexon that can
      be given to patients with advanced, previously-treated multiple myeloma. The Phase 2 part of
      the study is designed to provide additional safety data and to gain an understanding of
      whether imexon can improve the outcome for patients with multiple myeloma
