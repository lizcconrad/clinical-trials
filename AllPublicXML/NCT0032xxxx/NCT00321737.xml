  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of once-daily (QD) treatment with
      dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) 30 mg and 60 mg or placebo in maintaining healing of
      erosive esophagitis (EE).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, 6 month
      maintenance study. The study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of daily
      dexlansoprazole MR (30 mg and 60 mg) with that of placebo, in maintaining healing of EE.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have successfully completed the Phase 3 Study T-EE04-084 (NCT00251693)
             or T-EE04-085 (NCT00251719); and have healed esophageal erosions proven by endoscopy.
             Complete healing was assessed for change in LA Esophagitis Classification grades A, B,
             C, or D to healed (defined as anything less than the criterion for Grade A). The
             subject was counted as healed if endoscopy findings did not meet the Grade A
             criterion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine (H2)
             receptor antagonists, sucralfate, misoprostol, or prokinetics throughout the study.

          -  Use of antacids (except for study supplied) throughout the study.

          -  Use of drugs with significant anticholinergic effects such as tricyclics who cannot
             stay on a stable dose throughout the study.

          -  Chronic (&gt;12 doses per month) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
             cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors.

          -  Need for continuous anticoagulant therapy.

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled systemic disease.

          -  Subjects who have participated in either maintenance study (T-EE04-086 [NCT00255164]
             or T-EE04-087 [NCT00255151]).

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, is unable to comply with the
             requirements of the study or is unsuitable for any reason.
