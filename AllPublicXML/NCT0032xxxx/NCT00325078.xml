      This study will determine if the drug infliximab is safe for treating inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD) in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). IBD is an inflammation or
      irritation of the gut that leads to symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating and stomach cramps.
      CGD is an inherited disease affecting white blood cells called neutrophils in which patients
      are susceptible to repeated bacterial and fungal infections. They also have a higher
      incidence of some autoimmune diseases, such as IBD. Infliximab is approved to treat Crohn's
      disease, an IBD similar to that seen in patients with CGD.

      Patients 10 years of age and older with CGD and IBD may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests,
      electrocardiogram (EKG), tuberculosis skin test (PPD skin testing), and stool test for the
      presence of infections. Additional tests may be done, including colonoscopy (procedure using
      a flexible tube through the rectum to examine the lining of the gut) and imaging studies such
      as an x-ray, chest CT scan (test using a special x-ray machine), MRI (test using a magnetic
      field and radio waves), and barium studies (study using a drinkable solution of barium to
      help enhance the x-ray pictures of the gut).

      Participants are divided into patients with IBD symptoms (Group 1) and patients without IBD
      symptoms (Group 2) for the following procedures:

      Group 1

      Patients are evaluated every 6 months with a medical history and physical examination for
      signs and symptoms of IBD. Patients who are taking moderate to high doses of steroid
      medications have their medication slowly lowered (tapered) and are evaluated every 3 months
      for a total of 2 years. Patients in this group who start to develop IBD symptoms are moved to
      Group 2 for treatment with infliximab (see below).

      Group 2

      Patients in Group 2 receive infliximab infusions at 2-week intervals for three doses. The
      drug is given over a 2-hour period through a catheter placed in a vein. Patients are
      evaluated with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests the day of each dose. One
      week after the last dose, they have another evaluation, including a colonoscopy. Patients who
      respond well to infliximab may continue to receive the drug every 2 months for a total of 1
      year, with evaluations at every dosing visit. At the end of the first year of receiving
      infliximab, all patients have follow-up evaluations every 6 months for a total of 2 years.

      Group 3

      Subjects who volunteer to undergo colonoscopy and research biopsies that serve as controls
      for evaluation of the patient gut samples.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited immune disorder involving decreased
      phagocytic superoxide oxygen radical production, resulting in increased susceptibility to
      infections. Furthermore, there is a predominance of immune-related inflammatory problems in a
      subset of CGD patients, such as the inflammatory bowel disease (CGD-IBD). CGD-IBD is often
      complicated by obstruction, strictures, fissures, fistulae, and extra-intestinal problems. In
      fact, it is clinically and histologically indistinguishable from Crohn's Disease (CD),
      another inflammatory bowel disease that affects the general population. Crohn's disease (CD)
      is a prototypic T helper cell type 1 (Th1) immune disease. Since CGD-IBD bears such close
      resemblance to CD, it is possible that CGD-IBD is also immune-based. Furthermore, mice
      studies also support a primarily immune basis for CGD-IBD. However, currently there is little
      data on this Crohn's-like CGD-IBD in human patients. Treatment for the Crohn's-like CGD-IBD
      has been primarily oral or topical corticosteroids. Antibiotics have been ineffective and
      stool cultures typically do not identify clear pathogens. Many patients with the Crohn's-like
      CGD-IBD disease remain steroid-dependent, thus new therapeutic regimens are needed.

      This is a Phase I/II study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tumor Necrosis
      Factor Alpha Inhibitor (Infliximab or Adalimumab) in CGD patients with symptomatic
      Crohn's-like IBD. Infliximab and Adalimumab are standard-of-care treatments for moderate to
      severe CD, with extensive experience using these agents being well documented in terms of
      safety and efficacy. Preliminary reports from ongoing studies of CD at NIH are encouraging in
      inducing remission. We will also evaluate changes in immunophenotype and cytokine profiles of
      peripheral blood and colonic lamina propria lymphocytes following treatment. In addition, we
      will evaluate the immunophenotype and cytokine profile of blood and mucosal cells in CGD
      patients, with or without IBD, to determine the CGD-specific cytokine profile. Specific
      cytokine profiles have been observed in different genetic immunodeficiencies, despite similar
      IBD clinical manifestation.

      Documentation of clinical status will be performed using the Crohn's Disease Activity Index
      (CDAI). Potential effects of genetic variation (including CGD mutation type) on the
      expression of IBD in patients with CGD, and their responses to treatment will also be
      assessed. The long-term goal of this study is to establish better or alternative treatment
      modalities with low risk profiles for CGD patients with Crohn's-like IBD.

    <description>Measured participant Crohn's disease Activity Index (CDAI) values. The CDAI is a tool comprised of clinical and laboratory factors such as stool frequency, consistency, abdominal pain, general well being, weight and blood profile as an objective measure of disease activity. A higher score corresponds to greater severity of inflammatory bowel disease; severe disease conventionally defined as &gt;450, a remission as &lt;150, and a response to treatment as a fall of CDAI of &gt;70 points. Infections and IBD are not expected in healthy control subjects. The greater the score, the more severe the disease, and a score of less than 5 represents clinical remission.</description>

The subjects are treated with a TNFa inhibitor at standard recommended doses for treatment of Crohn’s disease. Infliximab is administered as intravenous infusions at 5mg/kg on weeks 0, 2 and 6 for induction and every 6-8 weeks at 5-10mg/kg for maintenance. Adalimumab is administered at 160mg, 60mg, 40mg, 40mg on weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 via subcutaneous injection.
Endoscopies and gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies are obtained before treatment, following induction, and again at completion of treatment.</description>

The CDAI is a tool comprised of clinical and laboratory factors such as stool frequency, consistency, abdominal pain, general well being, weight and blood profile as an objective measure of disease activity.

Infections and IBD are not expected in healthy control subjects. The greater the score, the more severe the disease, and a score of less than 5 represents clinical remission.</description>

          <description>This group comprises patients with Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) complicated by significant inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The subjects are treated with a TNFa inhibitor at standard recommended doses for treatment of Crohn’s disease. Infliximab is administered as intravenous infusions at 5mg/kg on weeks 0, 2 and 6 for induction and every 6-8 weeks at 5-10mg/kg for maintenance. Adalimumab is administered at 160mg, 60mg, 40mg, 40mg on weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 via subcutaneous injection.
Endoscopies and gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies are obtained before treatment, following induction, and again at completion of treatment.</description>
