      Information technology will be brought directly to renal transplant recipients to help them
      learn about the large number of medications they are required to take on a life long basis,
      in order to prevent errors and improve safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable to medication errors because of the large
      number of chronic drugs needed to prevent rejection and treat comorbidities. Compliance
      failures directly compromise patient safety through acute immunologic events and premature
      graft loss. For society, the loss of invested fiscal and organic (organs) resources is
      catastrophic. As the unique constant in the chain of people who provide, modify and consume
      prescription medications, health information technology should be focused on empowering the
      patient to prevent medication errors. Our principal clinical hypothesis is that HIT can be
      proven to improve patient safety by minimizing medication errors. Specific aims address the
      creation of new knowledge and evidence ( in a renal transplant population) of benefits of
      widely applicable HIT tools. Web enabled education of two groups, new (&lt;6 months) and
      established (&gt; 6 months), kidney transplant recipients is proposed.
