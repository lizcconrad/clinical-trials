  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate objective of this proposal is to assess the effectiveness of a multi-faceted
      intervention to improve patient-provider communication about colorectal cancer screening in
      improving patient adherence with colorectal cancer screening recommendations. This
      intervention consists of: (1) guiding the communication process through patient activation to
      initiate a colorectal cancer screening discussion; (2) optimizing communication content
      through the use of a prompt sheet; and (3) cueing the provider to assess patient perception
      of the communication. The long-term objective of our research program is to maximize
      colorectal cancer screening rates throughout the VA through widespread adoption of clinically
      feasible approaches to enhance patient-provider communication.

    <textblock>
      In the United States, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the second
      leading cause of cancer mortality with over 56,000 deaths in 2004). Early detection through
      screening decreases the mortality associated with the disease. However, adherence with
      current screening recommendations is low. A survey of the general population indicates that
      only 53.1% of Americans, age 50 years and older for whom colorectal cancer screening is
      recommended, are up-to-date with this preventive service. While colorectal cancer screening
      rates with the VA Healthcare System (VHA) are better than in the general population (75% in
      FY 2005), they are lower than performance rates for other types of cancer screening (e.g.,
      mammography) in VHA. Further, numerous VA medical centers report colorectal cancer screening
      rates below the level considered satisfactory. Of 138 VA medical centers, 25% reported
      colorectal cancer screening rates as

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Provider Eligibility. Primary care providers (MD, CRNP, or PA) at the study sites who see
        patients in the primary care setting at least 1 day per week and had no involvement in the
        design of the study are eligible for enrollment in the study.

        Patient Eligibility. Primary care patients who are not &quot;up-to-date&quot; with colorectal cancer
        screening are the targeted population for study enrollment. Up-to-date with colorectal
        cancer screening is defined as having completed one of the following: (1) fecal occult
        blood testing within the past year; (2) sigmoidoscopy within the past 5 years; (3)
        colonoscopy within the past 10 years; or (4) barium enema within the past 5 years. Other
        patient eligibility criteria are: (1) PCP enrolled in the study; (2) clinic visit scheduled
        with the enrolled PCP during the recruitment period; (3) age 50-74 years; (4) English
        speaking; (5) no prior history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps; and (6) no prior
        history of inflammatory bowel disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who are deemed clinically not appropriate for colorectal cancer screening due to
        severe comorbidity and/or limited life expectancy as determined by the patient's primary
        care provider will be excluded from the study.
