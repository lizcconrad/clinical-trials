      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and safety of 2 and
      6 micro g/kg/day sargramostim administered subcutaneously once daily for 4 weeks, and to
      assess the efficacy and safety of 6 micro g/kg/day sargramostim administered subcutaneously
      once daily for 8 weeks in comparison with placebo, in patients with moderately to severely
      active Crohn's disease.
