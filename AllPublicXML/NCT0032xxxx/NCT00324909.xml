  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that currently affects as many as 1 out of 166
      children in the United States. Autism is considered by many to be a permanent condition with
      little hope for improvement. Treatment for autism is centered on special schooling and
      behavioral therapy; medical science currently has little to offer.

      Recent research has discovered that some autistic individuals have decreased blood flow to
      the brain, evidence of inflammation in the brain, and increased markers of oxidative stress.
      Multiple independent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission
      tomography (PET) research studies have revealed hypoperfusion to several areas of the
      autistic brain, most notably the temporal regions and areas specifically related to language
      comprehension and auditory processing. Several studies show that diminished blood flow to
      these areas correlates with many of the clinical features associated with autism including
      repetitive, self-stimulatory and stereotypical behaviors, and impairments in communication,
      sensory perception, and social interaction. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used
      with clinical success in several cerebral hypoperfusion syndromes including cerebral palsy,
      fetal alcohol syndrome, closed head injury, and stroke. HBOT can compensate for decreased
      blood flow by increasing the oxygen content of plasma and body tissues and can even normalize
      oxygen levels in ischemic tissue. In addition, animal studies have shown that HBOT has potent
      anti-inflammatory effects and reduces oxidative stress. Furthermore, recent evidence
      demonstrates that HBOT mobilizes stem cells from human bone marrow which may aid recovery in
      neurodegenerative diseases. Based upon these findings, it is hypothesized that HBOT will
      improve symptoms in autistic individuals.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if HBOT improves clinical outcomes in children with
      autism. The study will also determine if HBOT changes markers of inflammation and oxidative
      stress in autistic children.
