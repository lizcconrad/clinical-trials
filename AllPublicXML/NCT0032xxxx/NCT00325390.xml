        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged above 20, admitted to hospitals with symptoms suspected to represent an
             acute coronary syndrome defined as unstable angina or acute MI without ST segment
             elevation greater than 1 mm are eligible for the study if they meet the following
             criteria:

               -  (1)Clinical history consistent with new onset or worsening pattern of
                  characteristic ischemic chest pain occurring at rest or with minimal exercise
                  (lasting longer than 5 minutes or requiring sublingual nitroglycerin for the
                  relief of pain within 24 hours before registration).

               -  (2)Patients who meet either of following criteria

                    -  ECG changes compatible with new ischemia [e.g. ST depression (at least 1
                       mm), T wave inversion (at least 2 mm), or hyperacute peaked T waves in 2
                       contiguous leads].

                    -  already elevated CK at least twice the upper limit of normal or CK-MB or
                       Troponin I or T above the upper limit of normal or positive qualitative test
                       for Troponin T.

               -  (3)A percutaneous coronary intervention is planned within 96 hours after the
                  first study drug administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A)Factors that affect participation in study:

               -  (1)Previous disabling stroke

               -  (2)Previous intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic stroke

               -  (3)Severe co-morbid condition such that the patient is not expected to survive 1
                  month

               -  (4)NYHA Class IV heart failure

               -  (5)Uncontrolled hypertension

               -  (6)Requirement for use of oral anticoagulants, non study antiplatelet agents
                  (including ticlopidine) or NSAIDs (excluding unum sumatur), during study period,

          -  B)Factors related to ASA and/or ticlopidine treatment:

               -  (1)Use of ticlopidine within 1 week prior to randomization

               -  (2)History of ASA or ticlopidine intolerance or allergy

               -  (3)Contraindications to ASA or ticlopidine
