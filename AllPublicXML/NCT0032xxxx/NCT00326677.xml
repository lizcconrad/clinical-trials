  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Institute of Medicine has called for studies of &quot;indicated&quot; preventive interventions to
      reduce the incidence of mental illness in persons already symptomatic but not yet presenting
      with fully developed clinical syndromes.

      The investigators' Advanced Center for Interventions and Services Research in Late Life Mood
      Disorders has embraced the development and testing of preventive interventions as one of its
      key objectives. The investigators propose to test the following hypotheses related to primary
      prevention of major depressive episodes in old age, focusing on elderly patients who have
      symptoms of emotional distress but who are not yet presenting with the full syndrome of a
      major depressive episode.

      Hypothesis 1: Problem solving therapy (PST) will be superior to an attention-only control
      (dietary education) in lowering the two-year incidence of episodes of syndromal major
      depression in already symptomatic elderly primary care patients.

      Hypothesis 2: PST will also prevent higher levels of depressive symptoms and associated
      disabilities, over a two-year period of follow-up.

      306 participants will be randomly assigned to either problem solving therapy or to a dietary
      education control. PST will consist of 6 to 8 sessions, distributed over 6 to 16 weeks,
      teaching participants a structured process of problem definition, generation of potential
      solutions, evaluation and choice of solution, and its implementation. The dietary education
      control will consist of 6 to 8 sessions also, distributed over 6 to 16 weeks. Subjects
      assigned to the DIET condition will receive education in healthy eating practices (e.g., food
      pyramid, types of food and calories recommended for people age 60 and above, tips on shopping
      for healthy food, food preparation, and healthy eating behavior). Subjects will be followed
      up to 2 years. Length of study is 24 months.
