      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an online cognitive behavioral therapy
      intervention in improving sleep, mood, and cognitive functioning in people with insomnia.

      Insomnia is a disorder that is characterized by a perception or complaint of inadequate or
      poor-quality sleep. Symptoms of insomnia include difficulty falling asleep, waking frequently
      during the night and having difficulty returning to sleep, waking too early in the morning,
      and unrefreshing sleep. Insomnia may also cause problems during the day, such as tiredness,
      difficulty concentrating, and irritability. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been found
      to have significant short- and long-term benefits for people with insomnia. Access to CBT for
      many people, however, is limited, due to the high cost of treatment and a lack of trained
      professionals in some locations. Delivering CBT via the internet could help make the
      treatment more widely available. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an online CBT
      intervention in improving sleep, mood, and cognitive functioning in people with insomnia.

      Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive the online CBT
      intervention either immediately or after a 4-month waiting period. Participants will use the
      online program for 1 to 2 hours per week for 8 weeks. Participants will keep track of their
      sleep patterns for the first and last 2 weeks of a 4-month period by keeping a daily diary
      and wearing a wrist watch device that monitors movement. All participants will report to the
      study site for baseline evaluations before beginning treatment and for final evaluations upon
      completing the program, about 4 months after study entry.
