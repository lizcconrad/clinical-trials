  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a rare form of malignancy in which neoplastic plasma cells accumulate in
      the bone marrow. Most malignant plasma cells continue to produce immunoglobulin. The activity
      of multiple myeloma can therefore usually be monitored easily by serial measurement of the
      serum paraprotein levels. Except for a few patients who receive a donor bone marrow
      transplant, multiple myeloma remains incurable despite intensive chemotherapy. Its course is
      typically marked by periods of active disease alternating with increasingly shorter
      remissions.

      Interferons are substances produced in human cells in response to a variety of stimuli, such
      as viral infection. When given to myeloma patients as part of maintenance treatment ,
      interferon-alpha 2 b (INTRONA) has been shown to be of value in prolonging the periods of
      remission. Until now, INTRONA could only be given as injections under the skin, three times
      a week. Some patients experience flu-like symptoms with each injection, particularly early on
      during maintenance therapy. This, as well as the chronic fatigue and even depression that
      INTRONA can induce may considerably reduce the quality of life of myeloma patients on
      interferon, so much so that sometimes this useful adjunct to chemotherapy for myeloma has to
      be stopped.

      Recently, a new preparation of interferon namely pegylated interferon (PEG Intron) has become
      available. It has the advantage of being broken down much more slowly by the body and
      therefore only needs to be given once a week. This minimises the swings in blood interferon
      levels that may be responsible for some of the interferon side effects. The safety and
      superior tolerability of PEG Intron has already been demonstrated in patients with hepatitis
      C for which it now carries a licence, but not in myeloma patients. Here, we propose to study
      whether the quality of life and side effect profile of myeloma patients on PEG Intron is
      better compared to that of Intron®A.

      In the main study, consenting eligible myeloma patients who are well and have been
      established on INTRONA maintenance therapy for at least six weeks will be randomly allocated
      to receive PEG Intron for three months followed by INTRONA for 3 months, or to continue with
      INTRONA for 3 months followed by PEG Intron for 3 months. All patients will be monitored
      regularly for any side effects and will be asked to fill in a quality of life questionnaire
      at the beginning (i.e. before receiving the first randomised treatment) and at the end of
      each study period (i.e. at 3 and 6 months). Initially, we are aiming at enrolling 60 patients
      into this part of the study.

      In a smaller sub-study involving only 14 patients initially, we are proposing to investigate
      whether myeloma patients who need to be taken off Intron®A because of its side effects can
      tolerate PEG Intron more easily. Should their tolerance of PEG Intron also be poor we would
      stop the interferon maintenance therapy altogether. However, should PEG Intron be found to be
      acceptable to them, we intend to switch these patients back to the standard treatment at the
      end of six weeks treatment with PEG Intron to assess whether they have become more tolerant
      of Intron®A in the intervening period. Patients will again be monitored carefully for any
      side effects and will be asked to fill in three quality of life questionnaires (at 0, 6 and
      12 weeks).
