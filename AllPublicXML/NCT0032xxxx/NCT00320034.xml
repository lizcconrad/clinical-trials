  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most commonly used drug for immediate relief of symptoms of asthma is the blue puffer,
      albuterol or salbutamol (Ventolin). Racemic albuterol is a mixture of two forms of albuterol
      which are mirror images of each other i.e. R-and S- isomers. The investigational treatments
      are R-albuterol and S-albuterol.

      R-albuterol ( levalbuterol) has been shown to have a slightly better bronchodilator effect as
      compared to the racemic albuterol and is well- tolerated in patients. However it is still not
      clear whether the S-isomer has no effect or has a harmful effect on the airways.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the R- and S- isomers on allergen
      induced airway inflammation in subjects with mild atopic asthma. This will give us a better
      idea as to whether the routine use of levalbuterol is superior to racemic albuterol.

      The most commonly used drug for immediate relief of symptoms of asthma is the blue puffer,
      albuterol or salbutamol (Ventolin). Racemic albuterol is a mixture of two forms of albuterol
      which are mirror images of each other i.e. R-and S- isomers. The investigational treatments
      are R-albuterol and S-albuterol .

      R-albuterol ( levalbuterol) relieves the narrowing of the bronchial air passages in the lungs
      and has been approved by the U.S. FDA, but is not currently licensed for use in Canada. We
      have obtained approval from Health Canada to use these isomers for the purpose of this study.
      R-albuterol has been shown to have a slightly better bronchodilator effect as compared to the
      racemic albuterol and is well- tolerated in patients, with only a few mild to moderate side
      effects (such as palpitations, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bodyache, leg cramps and headache).
      However it is still not clear whether the S-isomer has no effect or has a harmful effect on
      the airways.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of this drug, levalbuterol, on the
      allergen-induced inflammatory response in adult subjects with asthma. Specifically, we want
      to look for changes in airway eosinophils by examining sputum samples and to compare the
      effects of the R- and S- isomers on airway inflammation. This will help us to understand
      whether the racemic albuterol could worsen inflammation because of the presence of the
      S-isomer, and this will give us a better idea as to whether the routine use of levalbuterol
      is superior to racemic albuterol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female (medically or surgically postmenopausal or practicing an accepted form
             of barrier or hormonal contraception) subjects age 18-55.

          -  Stable, mild atopic asthma with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1.0)
             greater than 70% of predicted for age and height, and not requiring any medical
             treatment other than short acting inhaled beta-agonists as needed.

          -  No recent or significant history of cigarette smoking (no cigarettes within six months
             prior to entry into the study; less than 10 pack-years cumulative history of cigarette
             smoking).

          -  Peak decrease in FEV1 in both early (0-2 hour) and late (3-7 hour) allergen-provoked
             response of &gt; 15% compared with the baseline (pre-allergen challenge) spirometric
             determination.

          -  Signed written informed consent to participate in the protocol; ability to return to
             the outpatient clinic for repeated clinic visits.

          -  No history of asthma exacerbations or acute intercurrent respiratory illness (viral
             respiratory syndrome, bronchitis, pneumonia) for a six week period preceding entry

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to short-acting beta-agonists.

          -  Inability to discontinue asthma medications for the duration of the study or receipt

          -  Psychosis, alcoholism, active substance abuse, or any personality disorder which would
