  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We examined the hypotheses that severely depressed inpatients treated for 5 weeks with IPT-S
      plus pharmacotherapy have 1) a higher reduction in depressive symptoms and 2) higher
      response- and remission rates compared to pharmacotherapy plus CM. For the follow-up period
      (12 months) we hypothesized a better symptomatic and psychosocial longterm outcome and lower
      rates of relapse for patients initially treated with combination therapy.

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 124 hospitalized patients with a DSM IV
      diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder comparing 5 weeks of Interpersonal Psychotherapy
      modified for depressed inpatients (IPT-S) plus pharmacotherapy versus medication plus
      intensive Clinical Management (CM). The study included a prospective, naturalistic follow-up
      3- and 12 months after acute treatment in 97 of 105 treatment completers. The 17-item version
      of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) served as the primary outcome measure.
