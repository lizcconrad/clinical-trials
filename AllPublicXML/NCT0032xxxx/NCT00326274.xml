    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety potential of Helioblock® SX Cream as a
      sunscreen product in long term intermittent use conditions among pediatric subjects.. Each
      subject will be enrolled to participate for six months. The test product should be applied
      every day that outdoor activities are planned, prior to any significant sun exposure during
      out-door activities (such as the beach, outdoor sport activities), or whenever the subject
      needs to be protected against sunburn or other damage due to the sun. A minimum of 14 days
      test product use and sun exposure is required.
