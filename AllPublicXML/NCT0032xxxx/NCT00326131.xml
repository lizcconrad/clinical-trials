    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to determine how the body absorbs, metabolizes, and
      eliminates a single dose of BMS-275183 (labeled with radioactive carbon). Secondly, to
      measure the levels of BMS-275183 in your blood, study the safety of the drug, and to see what
      effects it has on your cancer.
