  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the TRIAD Project: Pennsylvania Adolescent Intervention Research Study (PAIRStudy;
      Project 3a) we aim to test the efficacy of a brief treatment aimed at treating depression and
      family conflict among a population of adolescents with depression, and thereby reducing the
      future chance of these adolescents initiating smoking. We will examine Attachment-Based
      Family Therapy (ABFT) for the treatment of depression in comparison with Enhanced Usual Care
      for Depression (EUCd). Reduction of depression will be measured by a clinically significant
      reduction of score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Second, we will examine how
      reduction of family conflict mediates the effect of ABFT on depression. The third aim will be
      an exploratory look at the potential prevention of the onset of smoking. Specifically, we
      will examine if reduction of depression and/or reductions in family conflict regardless of
      treatment type reduces the initiation of smoking or reduces smoking behavior at 52 weeks.
      These aims will be accomplished by randomizing 240 adolescents to one of two treatment
      conditions: a) Attachment-Based Family Therapy or b) Enhanced Usual Care for Depression.
      Patients randomized to the ABFT condition will receive 6-12 weeks of family therapy. Patients
      enrolled in the EUCd condition will be referred for outpatient psychological services at an
      agency that fits their geographic and financial needs. Research staff will help patients
      navigate the referral process. All participating therapists will have carried out the full,
      manualized treatment with 2-3 pilot cases prior to treating any randomized cases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TRIAD project aims to address the persistent and acute problem of depression in a
      population largely made up of low-income disadvantaged youth. There are numerous treatment
      studies available for depression, but few exist studying the treatment of depression via the
      reduction of family conflict. Through this clinical trial, we aim to investigate the efficacy
      of a treatment for depression for adolescents largely recruited through primary care. The
      primary aim of this study is to test whether Attachment-Based Family Therapy reduces
      depression more effectively than enhanced usual care for depression. Attachment-Based Family
      Therapy (ABFT) is a manualized therapy designed exclusively for anxious and depressed
      adolescents. Secondly, we intend to examine how reduction in family conflict mediates the
      effect of ABFT on depression. We will, furthermore, examine whether reduction in depression
      or reduction in family conflict, regardless of treatment type reduces the likelihood of
      smoking initiation at one year.

      These aims will be accomplished through a randomized clinical trial of 240 adolescents who
      meet criteria for a DSM-IV depressive disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymia, or
      Depression NOS). Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment conditions. The
      two treatment conditions are as follows: Attachment-based Family Therapy for depression or
      Enhanced Usual Care for Depression. Treatment for Attachment-Based Family Therapy includes
      anywhere from 6-12 sessions. Some of the 6-12 sessions will include the patient and or the
      parent meeting alone with the therapists, others will include the family meeting together for
      family therapy sessions. The Enhanced Usual Care condition will include referrals to outside
      counseling or therapy, and the number of sessions will vary by patient and practitioner
      desire. In addition to their treatment sessions, patients and their parents will be required
      to complete intake, 6-week, 12-week, 26-week, and 52-week assessments. These assessments will
      include a large battery of self-report measures covering numerous topics around family
      conflict, risk-taking behavior (including smoking) and depression. The intake, 12, 26 and 52
      week assessments will include a diagnostic interview. Additionally, bi-weekly for 12 weeks,
      adolescent's will be asked to complete a brief set of questionnaires that will help monitor
      their progress and safety.
