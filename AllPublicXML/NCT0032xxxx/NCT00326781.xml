  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to:

        1. compare the effectiveness of a nicotine patch and nicotine nasal spray for smoking
           cessation; and

        2. identify predictors of response to these alternate forms of nicotine replacement therapy
           (NRT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate objective is to obtain information necessary to match NRT to those smokers with
      the greatest need and likelihood of benefit. The investigators hypothesize that the nicotine
      nasal spray (NS) will result in significantly higher abstinence rates than transdermal
      nicotine (TN) for the following subgroups of smokers: those with genotypes associated with
      less transmission of dopamine or serotonin, or greater metabolism of nicotine; and those with
      higher levels of novelty-seeking, depression, and attention deficit symptoms.

    <measure>Continuous Abstinence at End of Treatment (Self-report)(Defined as the Number of Consecutive Days Without Smoking a Cigarette for Each Subject)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment (8-weeks after quit date)</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure of continuous abstinence at end of treatment. It is defined as the number of consecutive days without smoking a cigarette for each subject, as determined by the Timeline Followback (TLFB), completed by research staff. The TLFB is an assessment tool that obtains estimates of daily smoking. Using a calendar, people provide retrospective estimates of their daily smoking over a specified time period that can vary up to 12 months from the interview date. The TLFB has also been used to assess other forms of substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, drugs, etc.).</description>

    <measure>Verified 7-day Point Prevalence Abstinence at End Of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>End-of-Treatment (EOT) is defined as the phone survey that takes place at the end of each subject's nicotine replacement therapy treatment. The EOT took place up to 8 weeks after participants began the study and also utilized the Timeline Followback. It is a 7-day point prevalence measure describing a subject's ability to remain abstinent from smoking for the 7 previous days occurring before a subject's EOT phone survey.
This was verified by a Carbon Monoxide breath reading taking place within a week of a subject's End of Treatment phone survey.</description>

    <description>8 weeks of self-administered nicotine nasal spray at 40 recommended doses per day, tapering by 1/3 for the last 4 weeks. Nasal spray dosing was 0.5 mg spray per nostril (1 mg) for a maximum of 5 doses per hour and 40 doses per day. This dosing schedule is based on the average nicotine intake per cigarette of 1 mg per cigarette. Treatment lasted 8 weeks.</description>

        <title>Continuous Abstinence at End of Treatment (Self-report)(Defined as the Number of Consecutive Days Without Smoking a Cigarette for Each Subject)</title>
        <description>A self-report measure of continuous abstinence at end of treatment. It is defined as the number of consecutive days without smoking a cigarette for each subject, as determined by the Timeline Followback (TLFB), completed by research staff. The TLFB is an assessment tool that obtains estimates of daily smoking. Using a calendar, people provide retrospective estimates of their daily smoking over a specified time period that can vary up to 12 months from the interview date. The TLFB has also been used to assess other forms of substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, drugs, etc.).</description>

Nasal spray dosing was 0.5 mg spray per nostril (1 mg) for a maximum of 5 doses per hour and 40 doses per day. This dosing schedule is based on the average nicotine intake per cigarette of 1 mg per cigarette.</description>

        <title>Verified 7-day Point Prevalence Abstinence at End Of Treatment.</title>
        <description>End-of-Treatment (EOT) is defined as the phone survey that takes place at the end of each subject's nicotine replacement therapy treatment. The EOT took place up to 8 weeks after participants began the study and also utilized the Timeline Followback. It is a 7-day point prevalence measure describing a subject's ability to remain abstinent from smoking for the 7 previous days occurring before a subject's EOT phone survey.
This was verified by a Carbon Monoxide breath reading taking place within a week of a subject's End of Treatment phone survey.</description>
