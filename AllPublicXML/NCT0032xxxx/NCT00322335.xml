    <textblock>
      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at
      Months 18, 30, 42, 54 and 66 post booster. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary
      phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = NCT00352963). The objectives
      &amp; outcome measures of the Booster phase/study are presented in a separate protocol posting
      (NCT number =NCT00323050).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of meningococcal serogroup C and Hib
      antibodies on a yearly basis for a period of 5.5 years after booster vaccination. The
      Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

      This multicenter study is open. No vaccine will be administered during this persistence phase
      of the study. The subjects were randomized in the primary vaccination study 217744/097
      (DTPa-HBV-IPV-097) and will not be further randomized in this study. The study has 3 groups
      with Meningitec™ primed group as control. The protocol was amended to allow for enrollment of
      subjects of the Meningitec™ primed control group who were boosted with Meningitec™ after the
      end of the booster study as per new local reccommendation in Spain.
