      Comparison of incidence of hypoglycaemic events and glycaemic fluctuations in diabetic
      patients with basal substitution with NPH insuline versus insuline glargine. Evaluation of
      HbA1c, FBG (Fasting Blood Glucose), BMI (Body Mass Index), dose of insulin, ratio of basal
      and prandial insulin, satisfaction with treatment, incidence of adverse events.
