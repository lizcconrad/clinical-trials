    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      memantine compared to placebo in outpatients diagnosed with moderate-to-severe dementia of
      the Alzheimer's type on a concurrent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI).

    <textblock>
      Memantine is a therapeutic agent that represents a unique class of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      treatment options. A once daily (QD) dosing regimen in an AD population would simplify
      administration for the caregiver. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of modified release memantine taken once daily in outpatients with
      moderate-to-severe AD on a concurrent AChEI.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) at Week 24 (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SIB was developed for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with more advanced dementia, and evaluates the areas of memory, language, praxis, orientation, and attention. The SIB test items consist of simple, one-step commands presented with gestural cues that are repeated if necessary. The test contains 51 items, and the range of possible scores is 0 to 100 (with 0 being the worst result). The SIB has been shown to be a valid and reliable instrument sensitive to longitudinal change.</description>

    <measure>Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change With Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus) at Week 24 (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CIBIC-Plus is a measure of an overall clinical effect and is based on a comprehensive evaluation at Baseline and later visits of four domains: general (overall clinical status), functional (including activities of daily living), cognitive, and behavioral. A skilled clinician interviews the patient, and includes information supplied by a knowledgeable caregiver. The CIBIC-Plus is a rating of the patient's global status relative to Baseline, ranging from a score of 1, indicating &quot;marked improvement&quot; to a score of 4, indicating &quot;no change&quot; to a score of 7, indicating &quot;marked worsening.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the 19-Item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL19) Scale at Week 24 (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL19 modified inventory consists of 19 items used to measure the functional capabilities of patients with moderate to severe dementia. Each activity-of-daily-living (ADL) item comprises a series of hierarchical subquestions ranging from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss of ability to perform the ADL Inventory. The inventory is performed by interviewing a person in close contact with the patient and covers the most usual and consistent performance of the patient over the preceding 4 weeks. Response range is 0 (total disability) to 54 (total independence).</description>

             National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's
             Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) and the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)

          -  Confirmatory magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomographic (CT) scan within
             the prior 12 months.

          -  Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores &gt;/= 3 and &lt;/= 14 at Screening (Visit 1)

          -  Ongoing daily acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) therapy at a stable dose for at
             least 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1). It is preferred that patients continue to

             amantadine.

          -  Patients whose AChEI therapy is likely to be interrupted or discontinued during the

          -  Patients who are receiving therapy with more than one AChEI.

          -  Patients with a DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than Alzheimer's disease, including
             amnestic disorders, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder,
             current major depressive episode, psychosis, panic, or post-traumatic stress disorder.

             within the next 6 months.

          -  Patients who had evidence of other neurological disorders that included, but were not
             limited to, stroke, Parkinson's disease, seizure disorder, or head injury with loss of
             consciousness within the prior 5 years

          -  Patients who had dementia that was complicated by other organic disease

        <title>Change From Baseline in Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) at Week 24 (LOCF)</title>
        <description>The SIB was developed for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with more advanced dementia, and evaluates the areas of memory, language, praxis, orientation, and attention. The SIB test items consist of simple, one-step commands presented with gestural cues that are repeated if necessary. The test contains 51 items, and the range of possible scores is 0 to 100 (with 0 being the worst result). The SIB has been shown to be a valid and reliable instrument sensitive to longitudinal change.</description>

        <population>Primary efficacy analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population. The ITT Population was consisted of all patients in the Safety Population who completed at least one post-Baseline efficacy assessment in SIB or CIBIC-Plus. The last-observation-carried-forward approach was used to impute missing post-Baseline values.</population>

        <description>The CIBIC-Plus is a measure of an overall clinical effect and is based on a comprehensive evaluation at Baseline and later visits of four domains: general (overall clinical status), functional (including activities of daily living), cognitive, and behavioral. A skilled clinician interviews the patient, and includes information supplied by a knowledgeable caregiver. The CIBIC-Plus is a rating of the patient’s global status relative to Baseline, ranging from a score of 1, indicating “marked improvement” to a score of 4, indicating “no change” to a score of 7, indicating “marked worsening.”</description>

        <description>The ADCS-ADL19 modified inventory consists of 19 items used to measure the functional capabilities of patients with moderate to severe dementia. Each activity-of-daily-living (ADL) item comprises a series of hierarchical subquestions ranging from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss of ability to perform the ADL Inventory. The inventory is performed by interviewing a person in close contact with the patient and covers the most usual and consistent performance of the patient over the preceding 4 weeks. Response range is 0 (total disability) to 54 (total independence).</description>
