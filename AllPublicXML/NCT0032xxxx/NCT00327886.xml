  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective study is to review the postoperative medical management of
      infants who underwent bidirectional Glenn operation from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005
      who were significantly cyanotic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants following bidirectional Glenn operation are at times significantly cyanotic. The
      medical management of significant postoperative cyanosis has changed with the advent of
      nitric oxide, sildenafil and bosentan. The purpose of this retrospective study is to review
      the postoperative medical management of infants who underwent bidirectional Glenn operation
      from Jan 1, 2003 to Dec 31, 2005 who were significantly cyanotic.

      Summary of Procedures This is a retrospective study, therefore, the only procedure will be a
      chart review. I estimate the number of patients to be around 150, however, request permission
      to review the patient population in order to provide exact numbers. We request permission to
      review hospital charts from the time of bidirectional Glenn operation and the last clinic
      note within the dates Jan 1, 2003 to Dec 31, 2005.

      We will assign each chart a unique study number and collect data of:

      date of follow-up oxygen saturation during stay time since discharge 02 saturation at home
      home medications when discontinue medications
