    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate if 600 mg ELB139 given orally t.i.d. to patients
      suffering from panic disorder is effective in reducing anxiety evoked by inhalation of 35%
      CO2 measured by a visual analogue scale after the first intake and after approximately one
      week of treatment as compared to placebo treatment.
