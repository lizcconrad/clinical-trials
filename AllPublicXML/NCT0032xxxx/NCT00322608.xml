  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 clinical trial examining the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
      of escalating doses of the vascular disrupting agent NPI-2358 in patients with refractory
      solid tumors or lymphoma. The formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is an important
      component of tumor growth and vascular disrupting agents are intended to target the
      differences between these tumor blood vessels and the blood vessels in normal tissues.
      NPI-2358 has also been seen to directly affect tumor cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Pathologically or histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy

          -  Patients must not be candidates for regimens known to provide clinical benefit.

          -  All adverse events of any prior chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy, must have
             resolved to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (NCI CTCAE) (v. 3.0) Grade ≤ 2, except for neurological toxicity that must have
             resolved to Grade ≤ 1.

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic and renal function

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Administration of chemotherapy, biological, immunotherapy or investigational agent
             (therapeutic or diagnostic) within 21 days prior to receipt of study medication (6
             weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C; 12 weeks for radioimmunotherapy). Major
             surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 6 weeks before first study drug
             administration. Radiotherapy within 4 weeks (some types of radiation therapy are
             excluded regardless of interval since treatment).

          -  Significant cardiac history or findings

          -  Underlying conditions or medications associated with bleeding diathesis

          -  Disorders associated with significant vascular pathology

          -  Lung cancer with central chest tumors

          -  Prior treatment with vascular disruptive agents

          -  Seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsant therapy; prior transient ischemic attack or
             cerebrovascular accident

          -  Brain metastases

          -  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with hypoxemia

          -  Active uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, requiring systemic therapy

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis A, B, or C

          -  Patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to any product containing Solutol
             and/or propylene glycol

             sterile or they must agree to use acceptable methods of birth control. Female patients
             with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Male patients
             must be surgically sterile or agree to use an acceptable method of contraception.

          -  Concurrent, active second malignancy for which the patient is receiving therapy,
             excluding basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix
