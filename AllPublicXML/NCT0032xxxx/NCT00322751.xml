    <textblock>
      Given the activity of single-agent Topotecan in NSCLC, there is both scientific rationale and
      a medical interest in studying this agent in combination with radiation. In addition,
      Topotecan administered on a weekly basis offers advantages over the daily x 5 regimen, i.e.,
      the convenience of administration and fewer visits to the clinic.

      This is a study of chemoradiation for patient with inoperable non small cell lung cancer with
      poor pulmonary function. These patients have usually very limited treatment options because
      of the compromised lung function. Chemoradiation is usually superior to radiation alone, but
      has not been extensively tested in this patient population. Topotecan is a drug approved for
      lung cancer that has synergistic activity with radiation. The study will determine what is
      the safest dose of topotecan to use with radiation in this patient population

    <description>The starting dose for the first cohort will be 2 mg/m2/week. Increment between cohorts will be by 1 mg/m2/week if no toxicity related to topotecan occurs. All members of a dose cohort must have safely completed all radiotherapy and topotecan dosing prior to beginning enrollment in the next higher dose cohort. Increments will be reduced to 0.5 mg/m2 if mild to moderate toxicity occurs (grades 1 or 2). The escalation will continue until the maximum dose of 4 mg/m2/week is reached. Therefore the minimum number of dose levels (cohorts) is 3 to reach the goal of 4 mg/m2/week, and the maximum is 5.</description>
