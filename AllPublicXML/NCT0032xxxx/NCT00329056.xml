  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Parkinson's Disease, the mitochondrial membranes in cells that produce dopamine become
      damaged by oxidants, leading to the death of these cells and progressive tremor, slowness of
      movement and the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra (a part of the brain that is
      involved in movement). Mitoquinone is targeted to reach the membrane of mitochondria and
      provide protection from damaging oxidants. There are no treatments currently available to
      slow the progression of PD and this trial will help advance the development of this unique
      disease modifying drug.

      This trial will enroll 120 participants with untreated early onset of PD. Participants will
      be randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments: 40 mg of MitoQ tablets, 80 mg of MitoQ tablets or
      placebo. The researchers, participants and sponsor will all be blinded to the treatment
      allocation. Participants will be assessed after 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12 months of treatment and
      again 28 days after their last dose. The effectiveness of the trial drug will be measured via
      the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The safety of the trial drug will be
      monitored via regular participant examinations, blood tests, ECG and collecting information
      on adverse events.
