    <measure>Change From Baseline (Week 8) in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 24-hour Average Pain Item Score at Week 34 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 8), Week 34</time_frame>
    <description>Maintenance effect of duloxetine 60 mg in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) was assessed by the change in BPI 24-hour average pain item score from baseline of the maintenance therapy arm (week 8) to 34 week endpoint in patients who achieved at least a 30 percent reduction on the BPI 24-hour average pain item after 8 weeks of acute therapy (Acute Therapy Phase). BPI is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain based on the average pain over the past 24-hours. The severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine).</description>
