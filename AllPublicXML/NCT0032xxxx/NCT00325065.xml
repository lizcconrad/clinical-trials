      The goal of this protocol, broadly stated, is to use targeted manipulations with intranasally
      administered oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in conjunction with neurocognitive
      and neuroimaging paradigms to evaluate claims that OT and AVP inhibit and facilitate,
      respectively, the effective processing of aversive signals. Moreover, we wish to examine
      whether increased vasopressin levels will increase, and increased oxytocin levels decrease,
      the neural response in the amygdala and other limbic structures to aversive stimuli. In
      addition, we wish to assess whether OT and AVP administration will lead to the facilitation
      of conspecific recognition as appears to be the case for other mammalian species....

      Objective:

      The goal of this protocol, broadly stated, is to use targeted manipulations with intranasally
      administered oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in conjunction with neurocognitive
      and neuroimaging paradigms to evaluate claims that OT and AVP inhibit and facilitate,
      respectively, the effective processing of aversive signals.

      Study Population:

      A total of 216 healthy male and female adults between 20-40 years of age.

      Design:

      This protocol will involve a series of independent studies. Each study will require one visit
      in addition to a screening visit, involves a physical and psychiatric assessment. The study
      visit itself will involve pharmacological challenge followed by neurocognitive or
      neuroimaging testing.

      Outcome Measures:

      Moreover, we wish to examine whether increased vasopressin levels will increase, and
      increased oxytocin levels decrease, the neural response in the amygdala and other limbic
      structures to aversive stimuli. In addition, we wish to assess whether OT and AVP
      administration will lead to the facilitation of conspecific recognition as appears to be the
      case for other mammalian species.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Age: Participants will be healthy males and females, 20-40 years of age.
                  Approximately equal numbers of males and females will be included in each study.

               2. IQ: IQ, as measured by 4 subscales from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
                  Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), must be greater than 80. Prior testing in our laboratory
                  has indicated that this cutoff allows for maximally generalizeable results while
                  ensuring that all participants will understand and be able to complete the
                  testing procedures.

               3. Menstrual phase: Female participants will be tested only during the follicular
                  phase of their menstrual cycle (defined as days 6-12 after the first day of the
                  last menstrual period and confirmed using ovulation testing kits).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Because factors such as psychiatric disease or CNS disease can influence functional brain
        activity, these factors are exclusionary.

          1. Psychiatric history: Participants will be assessed using DSM-IV criteria via
             standardized psychiatric interviews conducted by trained examiners (SCID). All
             participants will be free of any current or past major affective disorder, psychotic
             disorder, substance dependence, anorexia, somatoform disorder, or anxiety disorders
             including specific phobias.

          2. Medical Illnesses: Moderate or severe acute or chronic medical illnesses (e.g. cardiac
             disease, diabetes, epilepsy, influenza).

          3. Cardiovascular risk factors: History of hypertension with baseline blood pressure
             above 140 mm Hg (systolic) over 85 mm Hg (diastolic). Also any history of syncope
             and/or baseline blood pressure below 100 mm Hg (systolic).

          4. CNS disease: Known history of brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasms, subarachnoid
             cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), other central
             nervous system disease, or history of head trauma which resulted in a persistent
             neurologic deficit or loss of consciousness greater than 3 minutes.

          5. Medication status: Currently on regular medication that would interfere with study
             results. This includes contraceptive hormones, psychotropic medications or
             benzodiazepines, alpha and beta adrenergic medications, other anti-hypertensive
             medications, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid medications, and medications causing
             sedation or stimulation. For example, current use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen is
             permitted, while current use of benadryl or methylphenidate is not.

          6. Pregnancy or Nursing Status: Currently breast feeding or pregnant (as documented by
             pregnancy testing which will be performed at screening and on the day of the challenge
             study).

        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR FMRI STUDIES:

          1. Metal or electronic objects: Metal plates, certain types of dental braces, cardiac
             pacemakers, etc., that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields contraindicate MRI
             scans.

          2. Claustrophobia: Participants will be questioned about potential discomfort in being in
             an enclosed space, such as an MRI scanner.
