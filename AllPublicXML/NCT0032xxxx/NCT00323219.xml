  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients often come to the emergency department with bacterial skin infections (known as
      &quot;cellulitis&quot;). Some patients with very severe infections are admitted to hospital for
      antibiotic treatment and some are sent home on oral antibiotics. Many patients have moderate
      infections and are treated as outpatients with daily intravenous antibiotics for 2-5 days. In
      this patient group it is unclear if treatment with oral antibiotics is as effective as
      intravenous antibiotics. The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment of moderate
      cellulitis with an intravenous antibiotic (cefazolin) for 3-5 days is as effective as
      treatment with an oral antibiotic (moxifloxacin). We hypothesize that the oral agent will be
      as effective as intravenous treatment for moderate cellulitis.

      Extended description of the protocol, including information not already contained in other
      fields.

      Objective: To compare 400 mg of oral moxifloxacin (Oral Group) once daily to 2 grams of IV
      cefazolin and 1 gram of oral probenecid once daily (IV group) for the treatment of moderate
      cellulitis.

      Patients: Any patient presenting to the emergency department at St Paul's Hospital in
      Vancouver with a diagnosis of cellulitis requiring IV antibiotics, without contraindications
      to any of the study treatments, and not requiring hospital admission.

      Assessments: Daily assessments are performed double-blind at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 14
      days.

      Primary outcome: Clinical cure at 7 days (resolution of symptoms, no change in antibiotic, no
      adverse events requiring discontinuation of study drug, no admission to hospital).

      Secondary outcomes: Area of erythema, days of treatment, side-effects of medication, cost of
      treatment, patient satisfaction, relapse at 14 days.

      Sample size: Based on equivalence of treatments a total of 390 patients are required
      (195/group).
