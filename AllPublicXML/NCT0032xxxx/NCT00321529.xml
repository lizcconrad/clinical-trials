  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the ProAdjuster system of analysis can be used
      to determine cervical spine instability using the Penning system of radiographic marking as a
      standard of comparison.

      This study will utilize the ProAdjuster Device as a method of assessing the motion of the
      cervical spine in participants with instability as determined by a Penning Radiographic
      analysis. Only participants with existing radiographic studies will be included in the study.
      No additional Radiographic will be required.
