      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a problem-solving training program in preventing
      depression in the spouses or family caregivers of persons with mild cognitive impairment or
      early dementia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have an estimated 12% probability
      each year of progressing to a dementing disorder. Pilot data suggest that the spouses of
      people with MCI begin to adopt the caregiver role and its burdens as they cope with this
      condition. Although levels of caregiver burden and psychiatric illness are lower than those
      typically observed in family dementia caregiving samples, our findings suggest that MCI
      spousal caregivers have already begun to experience distress associated with elevated
      caregiver burden. In order to protect the mental health and well-being of caregivers as they
      cope with their spouses' current and future health care needs, it may be ideal to implement
      selective preventive strategies while they are in the very earliest stages of caregiving.
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a problem-solving training program in preventing
      depression in the spouses or significant others of people with MCI.

      Participants in this open-label study are randomly assigned to receive either a
      self-management intervention targeted at problem-solving training or an attention-matched
      intervention targeted at nutritional education. The self-management intervention trains
      participants to effectively use problem-solving skills with the aim of strengthening their
      ability to cope with burdens of caregiving and preventing the onset or worsening of
      depression. The nutritional education program is based on the new United States Department of
      Health and Human Services 2005 dietary recommendations. All participants attend weekly
      individual training sessions, either in their home or another convenient location for a total
      of 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, participants receive a weekly phone call for an additional
      3 weeks to support the training they received. Follow-up data is collected at Months 1, 3, 6,
      and 12 post-intervention. If a participant's spouse is diagnosed with dementia during the
      study, additional follow-up data is collected after the Month 12 visit.

    <description>Depressive symptoms were measured with Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D was designed as a self-report measure of depressive symptoms in nonpsychiatric subjects and has been used with spousal dementia caregiving populations with no report of negative psychological effects. It is composed of 20 items, each rated on a 4-point response scale corresponding to the frequency of the symptom in the preceding week. The possible range of CES-D scores is 0-60, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. A cutoff score of 16 or greater is indicative of individuals at high risk for clinical depression. The CES-D was chosen because of its relatively high internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .88) and predictive validity for the diagnosis of depression.</description>

    <description>The experimental Intervention (PST-MCI/AD Caregiving) focuses on training in adaptive problem-solving attitudes and skills (Problem-Solving Therapy or PST). It was adapted from a manualized protocol for PST use in primary care. Our adaptation sought to enhance problem-solving skill levels of family caregivers as they began to face a variety of potential caregiving stressor.</description>

    <description>The PST-based intervention will train participants to effectively use problem-solving skills with the aim of strengthening their ability to cope and preventing the onset or worsening of depressive and anxiety disorders. Participants received 2 phases of treatment; the first phase involved 6 sessions conducted in the caregiver's home approximately 2 weeks apart, each lasting approximately 1.5 hours. The second phase included three telephone contacts (approximately 2 weeks apart) to reinforce principles taught during the first phase, each lasting approximately 45 minutes.</description>

        <title>Depressive Symptoms</title>
        <description>Depressive symptoms were measured with Center for Epidemiological Studies – Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D was designed as a self-report measure of depressive symptoms in nonpsychiatric subjects and has been used with spousal dementia caregiving populations with no report of negative psychological effects. It is composed of 20 items, each rated on a 4-point response scale corresponding to the frequency of the symptom in the preceding week. The possible range of CES-D scores is 0-60, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. A cutoff score of 16 or greater is indicative of individuals at high risk for clinical depression. The CES-D was chosen because of its relatively high internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .88) and predictive validity for the diagnosis of depression.</description>

        <population>Using an intention-to-treat approach, we performed a repeated-measures linear mixed effects analysis for each study outcome. This analysis included group assignment (PST-MCI/AD Caregiving vs NT), type of caregiver (MCI versus dementia), and time (baseline, 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up). The depression data were log-transformed for analysis.</population>

            <title>Problem Solving Intervention</title>
            <description>The experimental Intervention (PST-MCI/AD Caregiving) focuses on training in adaptive problem-solving attitudes and skills (Problem-Solving Therapy or PST). It was adapted from the work of Areán and colleagues, who developed a manualized protocol for PST use in primary care. Our adaptation sought to enhance problem-solving skill levels of family caregivers as they began to face a variety of potential caregiving stressor.
Problem-solving therapy: The self-management intervention will train participants to effectively use problem-solving skills with the aim of strengthening their ability to cope and preventing the onset or worsening of depressive and anxiety disorders. All participants attend weekly individual training sessions, either in their home, another convenient location, or by telephone for a total of 9 weeks.</description>

The NT intervention was matched to the PST-based intervention in terms of number and duration of sessions.
Nutritional education program: The nutritional education program will be based on the new USDA dietary recommendations. All participants attend weekly individual training sessions, either in their home or another convenient location for a total of 6 weeks.</description>

          <title>Experimental Intervention</title>
          <description>The experimental Intervention (PST-MCI/AD Caregiving) focuses on training in adaptive problem-solving attitudes and skills (Problem-Solving Therapy or PST). Participants received 2 phases of treatment; the first phase involved 6 sessions conducted in the caregiver’s home approximately 2 weeks apart, each lasting approximately 1.5 hours. The second phase included three telephone contacts (approximately 2 weeks apart) to reinforce principles taught during the first phase, each lasting approximately 45 minutes.
During the first session, participants received written and verbal education about the structure of sessions, MCI or dementia and the family caregiving role, the link between problems, overwhelming stress, and symptoms of depression, the relationship between low mood and reduced pleasurable activities, and the rationale for problem-solving training. In subsequent sessions, participants received written instructions and coaching in the systematic application of PST.</description>

During the first session, participants received written and verbal education about the structure of the sessions, MCI or dementia, and an overview of USDA Dietary Guidelines. Participants also completed a questionnaire about their current eating practices and activity level. In subsequent training sessions, the interventionist provided education related to the major food categories, discretionary calories, and tips and resources for menu planning. Participants were asked to keep a record of menu planning, eating habits between session, and any questions they had related to the application of NT. These records were used as a basis for discussion during both phases of the intervention.</description>
