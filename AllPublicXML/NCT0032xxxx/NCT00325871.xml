  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the common malignancies worldwide, accounting for a
      significant percentage of cancer mortality. Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is now a
      standard treatment for unresectable malignancies of anorectum. To improve quality of life,
      CCRT is also commonly applied in treatment of lower rectal and anal canal cancer to preserve
      anal sphincter function. The most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs combined with
      radiation as radiosensitizers is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Circulating endothelial progenitor
      cells (EPC), which contribute to the tumor vessel formation, reflect the response to
      chemotherapy both in animal model and clinical trial. Thus, circulating EPC can be used as a
      marker for optimizing and monitoring the anti-angiogenesis therapy including angiogenesis
      inhibitors and chemotherapy. Whether circulating EPC can be served as a marker of CCRT
      efficacy or not remains undetermined. Since CCRT is now a standard treatment of locally
      advanced and high-risk CRC, the development of a surrogate marker for monitoring CCRT
      response and optimize treatment intensity is very important.

      In this grant we intent to monitor the levels of circulating EPC in locally advanced and
      high-risk CRC patients before, during and after CCRT. To further characterize the changes in
      function and biology of EPC caused by CCRT, a syngeneic animal model will be also used to
      evaluate the clonogenecity and specific gene expression of EPC in tumor-bearing mice
      receiving CCRT.

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the common malignancies worldwide, accounting for a
      significant percentage of cancer mortality. The incidence in both developing and developed
      countries has been increasing over the past few decades (1). Radiation therapy, either as
      post-operative adjuvant treatment for resectable disease or definitive treatment along with
      chemotherapy for unresectable disease, has an important role in management of this cancer
      (1−4).

      Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is now a standard treatment for cervical cancer (bulky and
      locally advanced lesions) (5) and unresectable malignancies of gastrointestinal system origin
      (esophagus, stomach, pancreas and anorectum) (6−9). To improve quality of life, CCRT is also
      commonly applied in treatment of lower rectal and anal canal cancer to preserve anal
      sphincter function (9). The most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs combined with radiation
      as radiosensitizers are cis-platinum, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C (6−9). These
      drugs are myelosuppressive and prone to cause life-threatening neutropenia, anemia or
      thrombocytopenia, which are more severe than those with radiotherapy alone (5−9). To avoid
      unnecessary over-treatment in CRC, the optimization of CCRT is of critical importance.
      Herein, the development of a surrogate marker for monitoring treatment efficacy is pivotal to
      optimize CCRT.

      Angiogenesis is a heavily regulated process, which is involved by complex interactions
      between inhibitory and stimulatory angiogenic factors. It is essential for tumor growth,
      progression and metastasis and is correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients including
      CRC. Many novel compounds that potently inhibit formation of neoplastic blood vessels have
      been recently developed. There is increasing interest in developing angiogeneis-suppressive
      agents for colorectal cancer treatment and growing number of anti-angiogenesis drugs
      currently being evaluated in clinical trials for CRC. Promising results have been reported
      include an increase in overall survival and reduction in the risk of death (Bevacizumab),
      reversal of cellular resistance (Cetuximab) and activity as second-line therapy in patients
      who have exhausted other available treatment options (Cetuximab, ABX-EGF, PTK-787, Gefitinib,
      Erlotinib) (10,11).

      Although the therapeutic role of angiogenesis target therapy has been approved in cancer
      treatment including CRC, the way to optimize the dose of angiogenesis inhibitors remains to
      be determined because of the lack of reliable surrogate markers of tumor angiogenesis. Shaked
      et al. reported that the levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), which
      contribute to the tumor vessel formation, reflect the anti-tumor efficacy of
      anti-angiogenesis regimens (12). Growing evidence suggests that the levels of circulating EPC
      reflect the response to chemotherapy both in animal model and clinical trial (13,14). Thus,
      circulating EPC can be used as a marker for optimizing and monitoring the anti-angiogenesis
      therapy including angiogenesis inhibitors and chemotherapy.

      Whether circulating EPC can be served as a marker of CCRT efficacy or not remains
      undetermined. Since CCRT is now a standard treatment of locally advanced and high-risk CRC,
      the development of a surrogate marker for monitoring CCRT response and optimize treatment
      intensity, again, is very important.

      In this grant we intent to monitor the levels of circulating EPC in locally advanced and
      high-risk CRC patients before, during and after CCRT. To further characterize the changes in
      function and biology of EPC caused by CCRT, a syngeneic animal model will be also used to
      evaluate the clonogenecity and specific gene expression of EPC in tumor-bearing mice
      receiving CCRT.
