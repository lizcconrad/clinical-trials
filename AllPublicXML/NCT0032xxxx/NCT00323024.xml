        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must either:

               -  meet the PAH diagnostic criteria at Screening (based on a documented history of
                  diagnosis as outlined in the American College of Chest Physicians [ACCP] 2004
                  Evidence-Based Clinical Practices Guidelines)15; or

               -  have elevated pulmonary pressure with a suspected PAH diagnosis based on a
                  clinical referral at Screening for a RHC.

          -  Patient must have PAH as defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) &gt; 25 mmHg.

          -  Patient must have symptoms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) according to the World
             Health Organization (WHO) Functional Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension Class II
             through IV.

          -  Patient must consent to, be able to tolerate, and have adequate venous and arterial
             access for Swan-Ganz catheterization (SGC) and an arterial line.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant right-to-left intracardiac shunts based on Doppler
             echocardiography with bubble study.

          -  History of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease or clinically significant aortic or mitral
             stenosis.

          -  History of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT-S) or ventricular fibrillation (VF)
             and cardiac arrest, or presence of atrial fibrillation.

          -  Active cardiac disease meeting the following criteria:

               -  Patient with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures (PCWPs) &gt; 25 mmHg.

               -  Patient with a history of myocardial infarction or coronary intervention within
                  the last 60 days.

               -  Patient with a history of pacemaker, cardiac defibrillator, or biventricular
                  pacemaker insertion within 4 weeks of Baseline.

               -  Patient who cannot be withdrawn from nitrate therapy.
