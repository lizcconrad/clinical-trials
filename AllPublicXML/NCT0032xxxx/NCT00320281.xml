  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As clinicians, it is often a struggle to find effective pain control for a certain subgroup
      of patients with tetraplegia. These patients often have severe upper back, neck, and shoulder
      pain, limiting rehabilitation productivity and potential, and always limiting quality of
      life.

      This pain appears to be primarily musculoskeletal. Muscles in the upper back and neck become
      shortened, rock hard, and extremely tender with even the slightest touch or stretch.
      Refractory to multiple classes of medications, modalities, and other treatments, patients
      truly suffer-not only from pain, but from fatigue, sedation, expense, and loss of useful
      rehabilitation time due to attempted remedies. Unfortunately, this subgroup of patients is
      not small and the problem is significant, as anyone who specializes in the treatment of
      spinal cord injury patients will recognize.

      In search for another form of treatment, botulinum toxin A (BTXA) may be promising for pain
      control in that group of patients with tetraplegia whose pain has proven to be refractory to
      treatment. It did not take long searching the literature to find compelling evidence that
      BTXA may have another mechanism of action for direct pain control, apart from its well known
      mechanism for spasticity control. Clinically, it is increasingly being recommended and used
      for this purpose. In fact, one of the specific indications now recognized by most for BTXA
      treatment is for myogenic pain due to short, tight, strained muscles-just as we see with our
      population. Yet, it's application has not been studied in people with tetraplegia. Thus, the
      genesis of the project and the hope to help our patients evolved.

      Study hypotheses:

        -  In addition to traditional treatments used for pain control, injection of BTXA into
           cervical and upper back muscles will effectively reduce cervical/shoulder pain severity
           reported by individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries, regardless of the etiology
           of pain.

        -  Pain reduction secondary to the use of BTXA will be associated with a decrease in total
           analgesic medication use among SCI patients during acute inpatient rehabilitation.

        -  BTXA to treat cervical/shoulder pain will increase active participation in the
           rehabilitation program for individuals with tetraplegia during inpatient rehabilitation.

        <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is a numerical scale from 0-10 used to rate pain. Participants were asked to assess the worst pain experienced in the past 5 days and rate it on a numerical scale from 0-10, with 10 being the &quot;worst possible pain&quot; they have experienced and 0 being &quot;no pain.&quot;</description>

Botulism toxin A was diluted in 25 cc of saline for the injections.
