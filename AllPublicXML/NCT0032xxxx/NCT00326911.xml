      Eligible patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer will be treated with dual agent
      monoclonal antibody consisting of cetuximab and bevacizumab alone or in combination with

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The planned enrollment was 130 patients and the study was halted prematurely due to lack of
    efficacy in both arms. Enrolled patients continued treatment.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause (Range: 0 -10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is the time from randomization until the date of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause whichever is first reported. Patients who die without a reported prior progression were considered to have progresssed on the day of their death. Patients who did not progress were censored at the day of their last tumor assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Survival information was collected continuously every 3 months after completion of therapy and/or follow-up (range: 1-19 months).</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Survival of living patients or those who lost to follow-up were censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Number of Patients With a Best Overall Response of Either a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumor evaluations were performed every 8 weeks while on cetuximab therapy until PD or recurrence. Patients with a PR or CR had a confirmatory tumor assessment no less than 4 weeks after the initial evaluation.</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response is the number of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR, as classifed by the investigator according to the RECIST guidelines. A CR is the disappearance of all target lesions and a PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) Response at End of Cycle 2 in Patients With Elevated Baseline Values (Equal or Greater Than 2 x Upper Limit of Normal).</measure>
    <time_frame>First day of treatment to the end of Cycle 2, Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>CA19-9 is a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer and the level usually increases as the disease is progressing. The CA19-9 response was the percentage of patients whose CA19-9 level was declining, stable or increasing &lt; 10% compared with baseline, divided by the total patients with elevated baseline CA19-9 in that arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomization until the date of objective tumor progression was first reported (range: 11 -38 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression was defined as the time from randomization until the date of objectively confirmed tumor progression was first reported. The censoring rule was consistent with PFS except death. Patients who died from any cause were censored at the time of death or at last tumor assessment date if the death date was missing. For patients lost to follow-up, they were censored at the last tumor assessment date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>An AE was included in the safety analysis if its onset date occurred anytime during cetuximab treatment or up to 30 days after the last dose of cetuximab.</time_frame>
    <description>Reported AEs per patient were coded according to the corresponding preferred term and system organ class in the Medical Dictionary for regulatory Activities dictionary. The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Version 3.0 was used to grade all AEs. The collection of AEs began at the time the patient received the first cetuximab dose and continued during the study until 30 days after the last dose of cetuximab. All patients who were enrolled and treated with cetuximab were assessed for safety (mITT population, as treated).</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival is the time from randomization until the date of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause whichever is first reported. Patients who die without a reported prior progression were considered to have progresssed on the day of their death. Patients who did not progress were censored at the day of their last tumor assessment.</description>

The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Version 3.0 was used to grade all AEs. The collection of AEs began at the time the patient received the first cetuximab dose and continued during the study until 30 days after the last dose of cetuximab. All patients who were enrolled and treated with cetuximab were assessed for safety (mITT population, as treated).</description>

          <description>Accrual on the trial was stopped earlier than planned due to insufficient efficacy on both arms. Analysis of pain using the BPI was considered exploratory. The Interference question (change from baseline) to Cycle 2 Week 4 is reported. Complete interference is scored as 10 and no interference is scored as 0. A negative score indicates improvement from baseline.</description>
