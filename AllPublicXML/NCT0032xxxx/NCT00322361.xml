  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B Vaccine [Recombinant] is a well-established vaccine which has been used
      extensively, worldwide since its initial licensure in 1986. Hepatitis B vaccines: [1] induce
      protection against the morbidity and mortality of acute hepatitis B virus infection, [2]
      reduce the incidence of chronic infection in vaccinated populations, and [3] thereby, reduce
      the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of the trial is to assess if the new
      manufacturing process of the Hepatitis B Vaccine [Recombinant] vaccine shows the same level
      of hepatitis B antibody response or better as the currently licensed Hepatitis B Vaccine
      [Recombinant] vaccine. This study will also confirm that the new process vaccine is as well
      tolerated as the current vaccine.
