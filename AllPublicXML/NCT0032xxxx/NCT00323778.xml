  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the effect of an injectable medication called Hyalgan on the cartilage of
      the knee in people who have osteoarthritis (&quot;wear and tear arthritis&quot;) of the knee. Hyalgan
      is a medication which is injected into the knee, and is FDA approved to treat knee arthritis.
      We will be using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and x-rays to look at knee cartilage to see
      how it responds over the course of a year to the injections. A comparison to patients taking
      oral pain medication will be made.
