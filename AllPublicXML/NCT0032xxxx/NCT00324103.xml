  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last years Structured Treatment Interruptions (STI) have been proposed to reduce
      HAART-related toxicity and to increase patients’ compliance. ISS PART is a randomized
      comparison of repeated STIs versus continuous HAART in chronically HIV-infected subjects with
      persistent suppression of viral replication. The two arms of the study will be compared in
      terms of immunological response (proportion of patients with CD4&gt;500/mmc) at 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to continue their current antiretroviral regimen
      (Arm A) or to undergo structured treatment interruptions (STI) (Arm B) according to the
      following scheme: STIs of 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 months each followed by a 3-month therapy period.

      During STIs, therapy is resumed in the presence of an HIV-RNA rebound &gt; 50,000 copies/ml or
      of a CD4+ T cell decline &gt; 25% of the baseline count (&gt; 35% for patients with CD4+ &gt; 500/mm3
      at randomization). After the first cycle, subsequent STIs are performed only if an HIV-RNA
      level &lt; 400 copies/ml is reached after 2 months of therapy resumption.

      At the time of treatment interruptions patients in arm B who are on treatment with
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors suspend these drugs first and continue the
      treatment with the other drugs of the combination for 3 days if nevirapine-treated and for 6
      days in case of previous efavirenz-based regimen.

      Patients are seen at the clinical site every three months for arm A and monthly for arm B. On
      these occasions, blood samples are obtained for biochemical and viro-immunological
      assessments.

      The toxicity grading scale of the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) is used for the reporting
      of clinical and laboratory adverse events.

      In arm B, plasma genotype is obtained in samples taken after 15 or 30 days of drug
      suspension.

      Patients will discontinue the study in case of : early therapy resumption for 2 consecutive
      times (only arm B patients); acute retroviral syndrome (only for arm B patients);
      AIDS-defining event; severe adverse event; pregnancy; non-compliance; patient’ s request;
      physician’s decision.
