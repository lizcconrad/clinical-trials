    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy
      together with chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of
      normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when
      given together with radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients who
      are undergoing surgery for high-risk localized prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of neoadjuvant radiotherapy and docetaxel in
           patients who are undergoing prostatectomy for high-risk localized prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the pathologic response rate in patients treated at the phase II dose.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) short-term response rate in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the long-term safety of this regimen prior to radical prostatectomy in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response to this regimen by urologic examination of these
           patients.

        -  Determine the surgical margin status at the time of prostatectomy in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen, in terms of Health-Related Quality of Life by
           Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and urinary symptom scores by the
           American Urological Association's measures, in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical progression-free rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Identify pretreatment predictors of response in these patients by examining tissue
           biomarkers in preserved pretreatment biopsy specimens.

        -  Determine the biologic impact of this regimen on these patients by examining the
           prostatectomy specimens.

        -  Collect frozen serum for future analysis of correlative biomarkers.

        -  Compare the RNA content (gene expression profile) of pre- and post-treatment tumor
           specimens in order to describe the molecular impact of this regimen on prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of docetaxel followed by a phase II study.
      All patients undergo a biopsy of the prostate to gather research-only specimens prior to the
      beginning of treatment.

        -  Phase I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. Patients
           also receive docetaxel IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Treatment continues in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 4-6 weeks after
           completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo a radical prostatectomy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the
      MTD.

        -  Phase II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in phase I. Patients also receive docetaxel
           at the MTD determined in phase I and then undergo prostatectomy as in phase I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination radiation (45 Gy) and docetaxel.
The dose of radiation will be fixed at 45 Gy while the dose of docetaxel will be escalated. The starting dose of docetaxel will be 10 mg/m2 and will be escalated in increments of 10 mg/m2 up to a dose of 30 mg/m2 the pre-planned ceiling).
MTD will be the dose that is associated with no more than 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) up to 6 patients. The DLT will be defined as clinically significant grade 3 non-hematologic or grade 4 hematologic toxicity, attributable to the chemoirradiation. If 2 of 3 patients experience a DLT, dose escalation will stop and the previous dose level will be considered the MTD. If 1 of 3 has DLT, additional 3 patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. If none of the additional 3 patients has DLT, the dose escalation will continue. If 1 additional patient has DLT, the previous dose will be considered the MTD and dose escalation will be stopped.</description>

    <description>Pathologic response rate is determined post-prostatectomy by pathologist laboratory analyses. The TNM system is the most widely used cancer staging system. Most hospitals and medical centers use the TNM system as their main method for cancer reporting. In the TNM system:
The T refers to the size and extent of the main/primary tumor. T1, T2, T3, T4: Refers to the size and/or extent of the main tumor. The higher the number after the T, the larger the tumor or the more it has grown into nearby tissues. T's may be further divided to provide more detail, such as T3a and T3b.</description>

The M refers to whether the cancer has metastasized. This means that the cancer has spread outside of the primary tumor to other parts of the body.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy Assessed Using Health-Related Quality of Life by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and Urinary Symptom Scores by American Urological Association's Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months Post-Prostatectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in score from Baseline to 12-months pot-op. A single outcome, Health Related Quality of Life (QOL), was specified in the protocol. All 6 score means and confidence intervals are reported here as a single outcome; a separate row for each score.
AUA Symptom Score is designed to measure lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia or other causes in men. Higher scores indicate more LUTS (scale 0-35). 1-7, mild; 8-19, moderate; 20-35, severe.
EPIC quality of life instruments is a 32-item self-report questionnaire that measures the QOL of prostate cancer patients. 4 subscales measuring urinary (further consisting of two sub-components, EPIC Urinary Incontinence Score and EPIC Urinary Obstructive/Irritative Score), bowel, sexual and hormonal changes. Scores for each of the subscales, as well as for each sub-component within the Urinary sub scale, are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale with higher scores representing better QOL.</description>

The dose of radiation will be fixed at 45 Gy while the dose of docetaxel will be escalated. The starting dose of docetaxel will be 10 mg/m2 and will be escalated in increments of 10 mg/m2 up to a dose of 30 mg/m2 the pre-planned ceiling).
MTD will be the dose that is associated with no more than 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) up to 6 patients. The DLT will be defined as clinically significant grade 3 non-hematologic or grade 4 hematologic toxicity, attributable to the chemoirradiation. If 2 of 3 patients experience a DLT, dose escalation will stop and the previous dose level will be considered the MTD. If 1 of 3 has DLT, additional 3 patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. If none of the additional 3 patients has DLT, the dose escalation will continue. If 1 additional patient has DLT, the previous dose will be considered the MTD and dose escalation will be stopped.</description>

The higher the number after the T, the larger the tumor or the more it has grown into nearby tissues. T's may be further divided to provide more detail, such as T3a and T3b.</description>

AUA Symptom Score is designed to measure lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) resulting from benign prostatic hyperplasia or other causes in men. Higher scores indicate more LUTS (scale 0-35). 1-7, mild; 8-19, moderate; 20-35, severe.
EPIC quality of life instruments is a 32-item self-report questionnaire that measures the QOL of prostate cancer patients. 4 subscales measuring urinary (further consisting of two sub-components, EPIC Urinary Incontinence Score and EPIC Urinary Obstructive/Irritative Score), bowel, sexual and hormonal changes. Scores for each of the subscales, as well as for each sub-component within the Urinary sub scale, are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale with higher scores representing better QOL.</description>
