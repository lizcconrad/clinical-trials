  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide additional efficacy and safety data for a treatment
      strategy based on the combination valsartan with amlodipine in hypertensive patients
      previously treated with monotherapy and remaining uncontrolled. A naturalistic approach will
      be taken comparing two different doses, i.e. 160mg of valsartan with amlodipine 5mg and 10mg
      with possible addition of HCTZ
