  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have established that high blood pressure (BP) is the most common risk factor for
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite a heavy burden of hypertension (33% of all persons aged
      45 years and over), there are no reliable data on comparative strategies to manage
      hypertension in Pakistan. Our Wellcome Trust funded pilot study in Karachi, Pakistan on 320
      adults aged 40 years and over showed that the prevalence of hypertension (95% CI) was 40.3%
      (34.9-45.7%), and CVD was 32.5% (27.6-37.8%).

      We will now conduct a study with two components: 1) cross sectional study to determine the
      prevalence of CVD, and its determinants in Karachi, Pakistan; and 2) prospective, 2x2
      factorial design, cluster allocation intervention study to evaluate the impact of a i)
      Population approach of household health education (HHE) by community health workers (CHW) on
      BP levels of population aged 5 years or over in low-middle income communities of Karachi; and
      ii) High-Risk approach of special BP management administered by intensively trained local
      general practitioners on BP levels of hypertensive subjects aged &gt; = 40 years from the above
      population.

      The cost effective BP control strategy would serve as a model for a much-needed national
      level hypertension control programme in Pakistan, and possibly other developing countries in
      South Asia.

      We hypothesize that 1) HHE delivered by trained CHW is superior to no HHE in lowering BP
      levels of the population; and 2) management of hypertension by specially trained GPs is
      better than usual care provided in the communities of Karachi in lowering blood pressure of
      hypertensive subjects.

      The proposed study will be conducted among the low and middle-income population in Karachi.
      This population is likely to be particularly prone to CVD, has the poorest access to quality
      care, and is often prescribed expensive drugs by GPs.

      Screening visit: The Community Health Workers (CHW) will pay home visits to invite all
      subjects aged 5 years or over to participate in the survey. The screening would have three
      levels: 1) Household screening for subjects aged 5 years and over (n= 17,850 individuals,
      3000 households). 2) Adult screening for individuals aged 40 years or over (n= 4200
      individuals). 3) Hypertensive adults screening (n= 1860 individuals) for those identified to
      have hypertension on adult screening will be invited for re-measurement of BP to confirm
      hypertension.

      Intervention Effectiveness Study: This is a 2x2 factorial design, cluster allocation
      intervention study comparing controls with intervention by primary care GP, with or without
      health education. The main comparisons relate to the reduction of BP in a) all household
      members (aged &gt; 5 years), and b) hypertensive adults (aged &gt; 40 years).

      Interventions: The sample will be assigned to four intervention groups:

        -  Group A: Routine care.

        -  Group B: Routine care plus Health Education

        -  Group C: Care provided by trained GP

        -  Group D: Care provided by trained GP plus Health Education.
