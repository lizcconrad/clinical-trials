      To determine if there is a clinically and statistically significant difference between
      OROS-MPH and IR MPH in ADHA and ODD symptoms by the parent completed SNAP-IV. It is
      hypothesized that OROS-MPH is superior in improving symptom outcomes overall, remission rate,
      functional improvement, quality of life and persistence with medication over time.

      This one-year prospective observational study is designed to evaluate and compare outcomes
      effectiveness between OROS-MPH and IR MPH in ADHA and ODD symptoms at the ADHD Clinic of the
      British Columbia Children's and Women's Health Centre. A practical clinical trial is valuable
      because it has the potential to provide us the information which represents the actual
      outcomes in real settings.

      The primary objective of this study is to analyze the treatment outcomes of ADHD patients
      under conditions of routine clinical practice. Patients will, therefore, be treated according
      to the current practice of each participating physician, with the exception of several
      additional rating scales which are SNAP-IV, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, WEISS
      Functional Impairment Rating Scale (WFIRS)-Parent, Child Health and Illness Profile (CHIP),
      EQ-5D, Parent/Caregiver Questionnaire, ADHD Side Effect Checklist, Adolescent Diversion
      Questionnaire, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition (ABAS-2) and Clinic Global
      Impressions. Patients will be assessed at baseline and 12 months regardless of whether the
      original treatment is continued. If a patient terminates the study early, all assessments
      that are normally collected at the end of the study will be collected at the time of
      termination. Only patients with pre and post data will be included in the analysis.

      Results of this study are expected to make breakthrough on the treatment of ADHD in practice;
      and, particularly, information which come out from this study is not currently available from
      other researches.
