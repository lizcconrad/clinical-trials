      Hepatoma ranks the first on the cancer mortality list in Taiwan, and there are currently no
      other effective treatment options for advanced HCC. Therefore, alternative medical
      intervention is needed to improve the survival and quality of life of these patients.
      Dendritic cells are the most potent type of antigen presenting cells in the human body, and
      are involved in the regulation of both innate and adoptive immune responses. If we use
      matured antigen presenting cells pulsed in vitro with appropriate tumor associated antigens
      under optimal activation conditions. It is anticipated that such treatment might generate or
      reactivate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against tumor cells and thereby inhibit tumor
      growth.

      Although there are excited results of tumor vaccine in animal models but successful clinical
      tries are rare. There are still some problems needed to be resolved such as immune deficiency
      of the cancer patients or the defect of T cell receptors or the problems of tumor escape.
      There are complex compositions in tumor cells to be a tumor antigen that will influence the
      efficacy of tumor vaccine, so we are going to use tumor lysate to be a tumor antigen.

      In this study, the generation of dendritic cells from the patientâ€™s peripheral blood will use
      rhGM-CSF and rhIL-4 as stimulating factors, and matured dendritic cells will pulse with tumor
      lysate, the ex vivo T cell cytotoxicity for the primary tumor cell will be test. We hope to
      cooperate with basic study group in our hospital to do more ex vivo tests and clinical trials
      in the future.

      Hepatoma ranks the first two of the cancer mortality list in Taiwan, and there are currently
      no effective treatment options for advanced HCC. Therefore, novel medical intervention is
      needed to improve the survival and quality of life of these patients. Dendritic cells are the
      most potent type of antigen presenting cells in the human body, and are involved in the
      regulation of both innate and adoptive immune responses. It is assumed that matured antigen
      presenting cells pulsed in vitro with appropriate tumor associated antigens under optimal
      activation conditions might generate or activate a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against
      tumor cells and thereby inhibit tumor growth(1,2).

      Although there are exciting results of tumor vaccine in animal models but successful clinical
      tries are lacking. There are some problems needed to be resolved such as immune deficiency of
      the cancer patients, defect of T cell receptors or the immune evasion of tumor. The efficacy
      of tumor vaccine is mainly affected by both the heterogenicity of tumor cells and complexity
      of tumor antigens. Tumor lysates which include multiple antigens, are supposed to be a good
      source of tumor antigens(3-7). The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of
      autologous peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from hepatoma patients
      pulsed with autologous tumor lysate to elicit T cells cytotoxicity against hepatoma cells ex
      vivo. We plan to do HCC primary culture and DCs are derived from peripheral blood monocytes
      by triggering differentiation with recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) to immature DCs. Immature DCs will
      be pulsed with autologous hepatoma cell lysates and matured by using a cytokine cocktail.
      Surface molecule expression on DCs will be analysed by flow cytometry. The ability of the
      pulsed DCs to stimulate autologous T cell proliferation will be assessed by using
      carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining. The cytotoxicity of
      DC-stimulated T cells against primarily cultured hepatoma cells will be estimated by using
      trypan blue exclusion test. The purpose is to investigate the ability of autologous
      peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from hepatoma patients pulsed with
      autologous tumor lysate to elicit T cells cytotoxicity against hepatoma cells ex vivo.
