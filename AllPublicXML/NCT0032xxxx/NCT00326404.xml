    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the compliance rates of adolescents who take
      oral contraceptives (OCPs) continuously to those who take OCPs cyclically.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral contraceptive pills have traditionally been prescribed in a cyclical manner, where there
      are 21-24 days of active pills and 4-7 days of placebo pills or a pill-free interval,
      creating a 28-day cycle. It has now been proven that as long as a woman has both estrogen and
      progesterone, her uterine lining is protected and is thin. To that effect, a new OCP
      (SeasonaleÂ®, Barr Laboratories, Pomona, NY) has been packaged in the United States that
      combines 84 days of active pills with 7 days of placebo pills. This allows a withdrawal bleed
      every 3 months.

      Like in adult women, OCPs are the most popular form of birth control and cycle control in
      adolescents. But, for a variety of reasons, adolescents tend to have poorer compliance when
      taking OCPs. Adult women tend to be noncompliant about 6% of the time, but, by the end of one
      year, adolescents have a non-compliance rate of 34-66%.

      There have been few studies that even describe improved compliance and decreased ovarian
      follicular development in women who take OCPs continuously, which could be beneficial in
      decreasing the rate of adolescent pregnancy. The majority of the studies looking at
      continuous use of OCPs have been performed in adult women. At present, there has been only
      one article that has addressed the use of continuous OCPs in adolescents. Sucato and Gold
      discussed the indications of continuous use of OCPs, how to prescribe them, and what type of
      progestin to use; but they did not specifically examine compliance or the safety and efficacy
      of continuous OCPs in adolescents. We plan to evaluate these issues in our study.

    <description>The participants in the continuous study arm will be given 4 packs of Marvelon-21, so that they can take the pills continuously for 84 days followed by no medication for 7 days. During these 7 days, the participant will have a withdrawal bleed. This sequence is repeated by the participant for a total of 12 months. Each patient in the continuous arm will have 4 withdrawal bleeds per year.</description>

    <description>The participants in the cyclical arm of the study will be given 3 packs of Marvelon-28 and asked to take all the pills in the packet, including the placebo pills. During the week of placebo pills, these participants will have a withdrawal bleed. Each patient in the cyclical arm will have 12 withdrawal bleeds per year. The duration of study drug treatment for both arms is 12 months.</description>
