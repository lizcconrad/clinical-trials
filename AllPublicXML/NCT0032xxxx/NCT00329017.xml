    <textblock>
      A study to examine the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting
      steroid and carcinogen metabolism and benign breast tissue cytomorphology collected via
      random periareolar fine needle aspiration in postmenopausal women at increased risk for
      breast cancer and taking hormone replacement therapy.
