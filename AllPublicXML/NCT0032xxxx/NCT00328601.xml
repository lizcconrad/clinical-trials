      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the optimal dose of orally (tablet)
      administered thioctic acid in the treatment of symptoms of diabetic polyneuropathy (dPNP). It
      is expected that at least one of the three dosages to be tested (600, 1200, or 1800 mg
      tablets) of orally administered thioctic acid improves the symptoms of dPNP as compared to
      placebo.

      Secondary objectives are evaluations of other variables pertinent to dPNP, safety, and
      tolerability.

      Following a screening visit, patients will receive placebo oral for 7 days. Eligible patients
      with chronic symptoms will then randomly be assigned to one of 4 treatment groups and treated
      with trial medication for 5 weeks.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes mellitus (Type I or II), as defined by the American Diabetes Association,
             1997, lasting 1 year.

          2. Patient must have a symmetric sensory-motor peripheral polyneuropathy of at least
             stage 2 attributable to diabetes mellitus following a thorough evaluation for other
             causes of neuropathy.

          3. HbA1C &lt; 10%.

          4. TSS &gt; 7.5 points.

          5. NISLL &gt; 2 points.

          6. Pain sensation (according to pin-prick sensitivity test) absent or decreased (NIS item
             35 1).

          7. Age range: 18 to 74 years. Inclusion criteria prior to randomisation

          8. The TSS must be &gt; 5 points

          9. The TSS range (maximum TSS minus minimum TSS during the run-in phase) must be less
             than 3 points to avoid inclusion of patients with rapidly oscillating symptoms.

         10. At least 1 of the 4 symptoms of the TSS must have occurred continuously over the last
             3 months.

         11. Lack of compliance, i.e. below 85% or above 115% (Accordingly, 6 daily doses taken of
             the 7 daily doses scheduled for Phase A would be acceptable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Lack of suitability for the trial:

          1. Proximal asymmetric neuropathy, cranial neuropathies, truncal radiculopathy, diabetic
             plexopathies, or acute or active mononeuropathies (including cranial neuropathies,
             post-herpes neuralgias, etc.), with the exception of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) or
             tardy ulnar neuropathy (TUN) or both.

          2. Neuropathy of any cause other than diabetes mellitus which might interfere with the
             assessment of the severity of dPNP.

          3. Other neurologic diseases that may produce weakness, sensory loss, or autonomic
             symptoms or test abnormality.

          4. Myopathy of any cause.

          5. Peripheral vascular disease severe enough to cause intermittent claudication or
             ischemic ulcers or limb ischemia.

          6. Patients with proliferating retinopathy requiring immediately therapy and impending
             blindness.

          7. Psychiatric, psychological, or behavioural symptoms that would interfere with the
             patient's ability to participate in the trial.

          8. Patients with any active neoplastic disease except basal cell carcinoma.

          9. Patients with atrial fibrillation unless controlled and stabilised by medication.

         10. Patients with clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             haematological, or endocrine disease (other than diabetes) that may confound
             interpretation of the study results or prevent the patient from completing the study.

         11. Patients who have had organ transplants of any kind.

         12. Patients with significant hepatic or renal disease (ASAT, ALAT or GGT &gt;2 times normal,
             serum creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dL (&gt;159 mmol/l) for males or &gt;1.6 mg/dL (&gt;141 mmol/l) for
             females).

         13. Patients with a recent history (within last 12 months) of drug or alcohol abuse.

         14. Use of any investigational drug (participation in a clinical trial) within last 1
