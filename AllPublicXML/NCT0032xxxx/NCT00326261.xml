  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve blocks for arm and hand surgery provide many advantages for patients including
      excellent pain control and reduction in general anesthesia-related adverse effects.
      Infraclavicular block is possibly the best method for performing regional anesthesia of the
      arm because of the consistent anesthesia of the whole arm and low incidence of serious
      adverse effects. Normally the anesthetist uses nerve stimulation to identify nerves supplying
      the forearm and hand. Recent research has indicated that to improve success from 60% to 79%
      two types of muscle stimulation must be sought before injection of local anesthetic. This can
      be time consuming, requires a significant learning process, increases complications and
      leaves 21% of patients with inadequate anesthesia requiring supplementation or general
      anesthesia. More recently practitioners have been using ultrasound imaging to direct the
      needle and watch local anesthetic spread around the nerves. Preliminary reports have
      documented that this technique is associated with much greater success than the nerve
      stimulation method. However a good quality study comparing the dual-endpoint infraclavicular
      technique with an ultrasound-guided technique has not been performed. This randomized study
      aims to rectify this deficiency by determining if ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block has
      a significantly greater success than the current standard, dual end-endpoint nerve
      stimulation technique.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing elective upper limb surgery at or below the elbow.

          -  Patients aged &gt; 18 and &lt; 80 years.

          -  ASA I-III.

          -  BMI &lt; 35.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to read, write or speak English. (This is necessary because subjects will
             have to follow detailed instructions to allow testing of motor and sensory function.
             it is not feasible to have an interpreter present in the block room during performance
             of these procedures).

          -  Contraindication to brachial plexus block.

          -  Existing neurological deficit in the area to be blocked.

          -  Known loco-regional malignancy or infection.

          -  Coagulopathy.

          -  Allergy to local anesthetic agents.

          -  Chest or shoulder deformities.

          -  Severe respiratory disease.

          -  Healed but dislocated clavicle fracture.
