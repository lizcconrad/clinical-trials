    <textblock>
      This protocol aims to collect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the production of
      dendritic cells (DC). There are two ways to collect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      in this protocol. One is by using the method of leukapheresis from normal healthy adults. The
      other is by drawing the blood from normal healthy adults and then getting the buffy coats
      from the blood.

      One objective of these studies on DC is to complete a preclinical development for a human
      study of a candidate anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic
      cells primed with heat-inactivated P. aeruginosa (PA) strain POA1 and expressing the T-cell
      costimulatory molecule CD40 ligand (CD40L). The other objective is to complete a preclinical
      development for a human study of a candidate anti-anthrax vaccine. Prior to testing the
      vaccine in humans, the Food and Drug Administration will require preclinical and Good
      Manufacturing Practice (GMP) practice batches of dendritic cells. The intent of the
      leukapheresis or collecting the buffy coats is to provide the biological materials for this
      purpose.

        Group A is for leukapheresis and Group B is for buffy coats collection. We will use either
        Group A or Group B or both to collect mononuclear cells. The source of potential subjects
        in both groups will be normal individuals recruited from the population of healthy
        individuals. Accrual will be random with no bias as to gender or racial/ethnic group.
        Nevertheless, because the accrual process will be random, it is possible that there may be
        differences in the proportion of males and females, and racial/ethnic groups. The study
        volunteers will be recruited through IRB approved advertisements placed in local newspapers
        and fliers. All efforts will be made to recruit women and minorities.
