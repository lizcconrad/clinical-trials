    <textblock>
      It is well known that abnormal heart beats from the top parts of the heart, atrial
      fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (Aflut), occur frequently after most types of cardiac
      surgeries. Postoperative AF and Aflut are associated with significant morbidity, longer
      hospital stay, and higher related costs. Currently therapies are marginally effective at
      preventing this abnormal heart beat. The incidence of abnormal heart beats after cardiac
      surgery seems to be a function of the amount of inflammation and oxidative stress induced.
      Our group and others have shown that atrial abnormal heart beats are associated with
      increased oxidative stress. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are medications used to treat diabetes.
      Beside their glucose lowering effects, TZDs are shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidant properties. Therefore, we propose to retrospectively analyze the effect of
      pre-operative TZDs on the incidence of post-operative AF or Aflut. This study will involve
      retrospective chart reviews without further patient contact of all patients having undergone
      cardiac surgery in Emory University Hospital, Crawford Long Hospital, or the VA Medical
      Center from 2000 to 2005. This study is preparatory to a funding proposal for a prospective
      trial.

      1.0 Background

      Cardiac surgery is associated with many perioperative complications, including
      supraventricular arrhythmias.(1-4) Atrial fibrillation occurs in 15 to 40% of patients after
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and up to 60% after CABG and valve repair. It can lead
      to significant complications such as stroke, prolonged hospitalizations, increasing mortality
      and morbidity.(1;5)

      Post-operative atrial arrhythmias seem to be related to the degree of inflammation and
      oxidative stress induced during surgery.(2-4) Our group and others have shown that atrial
      arrhythmias are associated with increased oxidative stress.(6-10) Moreover, increased
      oxidative stress associated with angiotensin II-mediated NADPH oxidase activation leads to
      electrical abnormalities likely to propagate arrhythmias.(11;12)

      Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are antidiabetic agents that enhance insulin sensitivity through
      activating peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. Beside their glucose
      lowering effects, TZDs are shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
      properties.(13-17)

      2.0 Objectives

      Based on the discussion above, we hypothesize that pre-operative use of TZDs will decrease
      post-operative AF or Aflut incidence. This study will be a retrospective cohort analysis of
      all patients that underwent elective cardiac surgeries between 2000-2005 at Emory University
      Hospital, Crawford Long Hospital, or the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center to evaluate
      the relationship of pre-operative TZD use to the incidence of post-operative atrial
      arrhythmias.. This study is undertaken in preparation for a funding proposal for a
      prospective trial.

      3.0 Patient Selection

      3.1 Eligibility criteria:

      1. All patients that patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery in the Emory University
      Hospital, Crawford Long Hospital, or the VA Medical Center between 2000-2005.

      3.2 Ineligibility criteria:

        1. Emergent operations.

        2. The presence of AF or Aflut at the time of surgery.

        3. Patients without adequate documentation of atrial rhythm following surgery.

        4. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure at the time of surgery.

        5. Hyperthyroidism

        6. Implanted devices for designed for active management of atrial arrhythmias by pacing or
           defibrillation

        7. Known illicit drug use

        8. Known ethanol abuse

        9. Electrophysiological ablation for atrial tachycardia within 6 months of the operation.

      4.0 Registration and randomization: none

      5.0 Therapy: none

      6.0 Pathology: none

      7.0 Patient assessment: none

      8.0 Data collection: Data will be collected from review of the patient's hospital charts,
      from telemetry recordings, and ECGs to document the presence or absence of AF or Aflut during
      the hospital admission for cardiac surgery. The presence or absence of atrial fibrillation
      will be diagnosed on the basis of an electrocardiographic recording and confirmed by a
      cardiologist. Demographic data collected will include: age, race, sex, body mass index, blood
      pressure, NYHA classification, Killip classification, and the history of previous myocardial
      infarction, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, antiarrhythmic drug use, presence
      and type of pacemaker if any, history of AF or Aflut, previous cardioversions, type of
      operation, and length of operation. Patients enrolled in this study will be given unique
      study numbers. No follow up data will be required from patients.

      9.0 Statistical considerations: This study design is a retrospective chart review of a cohort
      of patients undergoing cardiac surgery to determine if there is an association between
      pre-operative TZD use and the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation or Aflut. The
      null hypothesis is that there is no association between the preoperative use of TZDs and
      postoperative AF and Aflut. Within the cohort, those patients with AF or Aflut will be
      compared to those without these atrial arrhythmias in the post-operative period. Baseline
      data for the two groups will be expressed as mean Â± standard deviation for continuous
      variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. Differences in baseline characteristics
      between the groups will be examined by use of Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests for
      categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Quantification of any association between
      pre-operative TZD and the presence of atrial fibrillation will modeled by logistical
      regression analysis after adjusting for other variables that may affect arrhythmia frequency.
