    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the Positive Action program on
      reducing negative behaviors, increasing positive behaviors and improving academic achievement
      of elementary school students.

      This project will: 1) evaluate the efficacy of a comprehensive, multi-grade, multi-year
      program, the Positive Action program (PA) designed to reduce student problem behaviors
      (including drug use and violence), disciplinary referrals and suspensions, and academic
      underachievement; 2) evaluate the effects of the program on the presumed/theoretical mediator
      variables; and 3) assess which of these changes in mediator variables actually mediate the
      effects of the program on behavior and school performance. The Hawaiian school district has
      agreed to implement a randomized trial of the PA program. We randomly assigned schools to PA
      or control conditions from strata matched on multiple indicators of risk. PA schools will
      receive the full PA program for four years (the 2002-03 through 2005-06 school years). This
      includes all materials for all students (at all grades), families, teachers, and principal,
      plus community kits; training for teachers and other interested staff; and continuous
      technical support and monitoring by a PA staff person. Data on behavior and academic
      achievement will be obtained from school archival records for all students for all years and,
      where appropriate for several years prior to the study. Students in grades 1 and 3 in the
      2001-02 school year and their parents and teachers will also be followed through the project
      with surveys every year. The subject population will contain equal portions of males and
      females, and proportionate numbers of the major ethnic groups on Oahu (Hawaiian or
      part-Hawaiian, white, Asian, Other). Analyses will test for program effects on all
      hypothesized mediating variables and outcomes, and the hypothesized mediational pathways.
