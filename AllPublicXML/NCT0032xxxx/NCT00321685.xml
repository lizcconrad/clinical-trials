      This phase II trial studies how well giving bevacizumab, radiation therapy, and combination
      chemotherapy works in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for locally advanced
      nonmetastatic rectal cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as capecitabine,
      may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      capecitabine, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      bevacizumab together with radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy before surgery may
      make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.
      Giving bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor
      cells that remain after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pathological complete response rate in patients with T3 and T4 rectal
      cancers when treated preoperatively with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, and
      concurrent radiotherapy (XRT).

      II. To evaluate the resection rate for T3 and T4 rectal cancers and the expected versus
      actual type of resection (abdominoperinal resection [APR] vs. low anterior resection [LAR]
      vs. LAR/coloanal anastomosis).

      III. To make preliminary observations of patient survival and patterns of recurrence for this
      treatment combination.

      IV. To gain additional experience regarding the toxicity and tolerability of this
      preoperative and postoperative regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      PREOPERATIVE CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo radiotherapy (total dose to the tumor bed
      was 5040 cGy) once daily (QD) 5 days a week and receive capecitabine 825 mg/m^2 orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive oxaliplatin 50 mg/m^2
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV over
      30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 during radiotherapy.

      SURGERY: Approximately 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo
      surgical resection. Patients whose tumors are not completely resected or who have metastatic
      disease discontinue protocol therapy.

      POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Approximately 4-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium 400 mg/m^2 IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab 5
      mg/kg IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil 2400 mg/m^2 IV
      continuously over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 9 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive up to 3
      additional courses of leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and bevacizumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 10 years.

    <description>Pathologic complete response to preoperative therapy was determined at the time of surgical resection. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined as no evidence of invasive cells on pathologic examination of the primary rectal cancer (or tissue from the area where the tumor had been if there is a complete clinical response). Pathologic complete response rate is calculated as number of patients achieving pathologic complete response divided by all eligible and treated patients</description>

Preoperative chemotherapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 during radiotherapy.
Surgery: Approximately 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection.
Postoperative chemotherapy: Approximately 4-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil (5-FU) IV continuously over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 9 courses. Patients then receive up to 3 additional courses of leucovorin calcium, 5-FU, and bevacizumab.

        <description>Recurrence free survival is defined as time from surgery to disease recurrence or death without recurrence (whichever occurred first) among resected patients. 5-year recurrence-free survival rate is estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, with 90% confidence interval calculated using Greenwood's formula.</description>
        <time_frame>recurrence follow-up began after post-operative chemotherapy, assessed every 3 months for patients 3-5 years from registration, every 6 months for patients 5-10 years from registration and every 12 months for patients 10 years from registration</time_frame>

            <description>Preoperative radiation therapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week.
Preoperative chemotherapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 during radiotherapy.
Surgery: Approximately 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection.
Postoperative chemotherapy: Approximately 4-12 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil (5-FU) IV continuously over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 9 courses. Patients then receive up to 3 additional courses of leucovorin calcium, 5-FU, and bevacizumab.</description>
