      The purpose behind the proposed research is that diabetes care in First Nations people can be
      improved by involvement of a Home Care team providing diabetes education and management,
      supported by emerging technology, specifically Bluetooth-enabled glucometers and blood
      pressure monitors, capable of transmitting their data to a web environment in tabulated and
      graphical format available for remote viewing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease that produces a diverse array of complications. The
      pathogenesis of these complications refers back to two factors, one of which (high blood
      glucose) alters proteins leading to tissue and blood vessel damage, while the other (high
      blood pressure), exacerbates the vascular damage causing further damage to target organs. Our
      long term goal is to achieve targets for blood glucose and blood pressure as outlined by
      Clinical Practice Guidelines.

      Despite current Clinical Practice Guidelines and evidence-based practice by the medical
      community, including family physicians and the Home Care team, blood glucose control in
      general and in the First Nations community specifically is not meeting targets. Poor control
      of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes dramatically increases the risk of heart disease, stroke,
      vascular limb loss, blindness, kidney disease and the need for dialysis. Control of blood
      glucose levels prevents these complications. Additionally, the intensification of diabetes
      control, including the initiation of insulin, is not easily done during a regular primary
      care visit. The lack of intensification of diabetes management in people with poorly
      controlled diabetes has been referred to as 'clinical inertia'. While subjects referred to
      specialists have somewhat better control of diabetes, more than 50% still failed to have
      intensification of diabetes management within four months of a lab report showing a high
      level of A1c. Multidisciplinary care can overcome clinical inertia, even in difficult
      practice settings. Finally, the emerging technology of Bluetooth-enabled devices and secure
      web-based monitoring logs allows health care providers for the first time to remotely monitor
      progress providing a higher level of confidence in self blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) and
      blood pressure results. Based on these facts, the experimental focus of this proposal is on
      the introduction of a Home Care Team diabetes management program that can provide
      intensification of diabetes management right in the patient's home, supported by the emerging
      technology of Bluetooth- enabled devices. The specific aims are designed to provide a
      comprehensive assessment of the impact of the introduction of this program.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 2 Diabetes with baseline A1c &gt; 8.0 % on diet or medical therapy with no history
             of diabetic ketoacidosis.

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained prior to admission to this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hypoglycemic therapy and A1c&lt;8.0%

          -  New York Heart Association Stage III-IV congestive heart failure. This will eliminate
             approximately 2% of people with diabetes based on the Strong Heart Study Data.

          -  Suspected secondary hypertension due to any cause (e.g. pheochromocytoma,coarction of
             the aorta or renal insufficiency.)

          -  Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or revascularization within the last 3 months.

          -  Angioedema.

          -  Cerebrovascular event, including stroke or transient ischemic attack, within the last
             six months.

          -  Creatinine &gt;250 umol/L

          -  Cerebral Vascular event, including strike or transient ischemic attack, within the
             last six months.

          -  Connective tissue disorders (e.g.lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)

          -  Active hepatic disease as indicated by AST and ALT &gt;2X the upper limit of normal;
             serum bilirubin &gt;1.5X upper limit of normal, or serum albumin &lt;3.0 gm/dl.

          -  Severe systemic or malignant disease(which could reasonably be expected to be fatal or
             life-threatening during the course of the study.)

          -  Pregnancy. It is expected that some women will want to exit the study to become
             pregnant (5% of female enrollees).

          -  Factors suggesting low likelihood of compliance with the protocol (e.g current alcohol
             abuse, history of unreliability in keeping appointments or taking medications.

          -  Any medical condition that study physicians believe would interfere with study
             participation or evaluation of results.

          -  Mental incapacity and/or cognitive impairment on the part of the patient that would
             preclude adequate understanding of, or cooperation with, the study protocol.

          -  Participation in any clinical trial of any investigational medication within 3 months
             prior to this trial. This is unlikely because clinical trials among First Nations
             people are rare.
