      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of the drug EPO906 that could shrink
      tumors when used with radiation therapy in cancer patients.

      -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of EPO906 administered in combination with
           radiation therapy and establish a recommend phase II dose.

        -  To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of EPO906 when administered concurrently
           with radiotherapy in three disease cohorts.

        -  To evaluate tumor response.
