  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether giving acetaminophen (the medicine in Tylenol)
      for routine infant vaccinations is helpful in preventing fever or other symptoms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-vaccination fever occurs in up to 40% of infants receiving routinely recommended
      childhood vaccinations. Although serious events are rare, post-vaccination fever causes
      discomfort for the child, can lead to medical utilization, can rarely result in febrile
      seizure, and can cause a working parent to miss time from their job to care for a febrile
      infant who cannot attend day care. The benefits of acetaminophen prophylaxis for infants
      receiving current vaccinations, in terms of reduction of discomfort for the child,
      improvement of quality-of-life indicators for the parent, or reduction of medical
      utilization, have not been measured. This randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial will
      assess the efficacy of prophylaxis with acetaminophen in prevention of fever following
      routine childhood immunizations.

          <description>Children were randomized 1:1 to receive up to five doses of acetaminophen (10-15mg per kg) or placebo following routine vaccinations. Children were to receive a maximum of five doses of the study medication and all doses were to be administered within 24 hours of vaccination. Parents were encouraged to take the bottle of study medication to the vaccination visit, and to give the first dose at that visit, after the child’s weight was assessed and within an hour before or after vaccination. Parents were instructed to give subsequent doses a minimum of four hours apart and to give the last dose of study medication no later than 24 hours after vaccination. Following the first dose, each subsequent dose was to be given no earlier than 4 hours following the previous dose. A maximum of five doses of study medication were to be given; the last dose no later than 24 hours after the study vaccination. Study drug was formulated to provide 160 mg of acetaminophen per 5 cc dose.</description>

            <groups_desc>The study sample size of 1000 children was selected to have 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in risk of the primary outcome of rectal temperature &gt;=38 following vaccination. In 2009, during the enrollment period of our trial, another paper reported the results of a randomized trial of acetaminophen prophylaxis in infants which found significantly lower immune responses to various vaccines in the acetaminophen group. In light of thse findings we elected to stop enrollment in our trial.</groups_desc>

          <description>Children were randomized 1:1 to receive up to five doses of acetaminophen (10-15mg per kg) or placebo following routine vaccinations. Children were to receive a maximum of five doses of the study medication and all doses were to be administered within 24 hours of vaccination. Parents were encouraged to take the bottle of study medication to the vaccination visit, and to give the first dose at that visit, after the child’s weight was assessed and within an hour before or after vaccination. Parents were instructed to give subsequent doses a minimum of four hours apart and to give the last dose of study medication no later than 24 hours after vaccination. Following the first dose, each subsequent dose was to be given no earlier than 4 hours following the previous dose. A maximum of five doses of study medication were to be given; the last dose no later than 24 hours after the study vaccination. Study drug was formulated to provide 160 mg of acetaminophen per 5 cc dose.</description>
