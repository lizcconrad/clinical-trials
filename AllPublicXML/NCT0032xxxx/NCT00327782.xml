  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care in pediatric oncology and neurology is well described in the literature.
      There is a lack of information on the care of children terminally ill due to heart failure. A
      significant number of children are diagnosed with terminal heart failure for which palliative
      care is required.

      Objective:

      To describe palliative care of children over one year of age with end-stage heart failure,
      including need for and types of pain control, hospice use, need for and use of home nursing
      and quality of life issues.

      Methods:

      Retrospective chart review of all children over one year of age diagnosed with end-stage
      heart failure between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2005 at Children's Healthcare of
      Atlanta, Egleston Hospital, followed by Sibley Heart Center Cardiology.

      Patient variables taken from the medical charts will include:

      Diagnosis Age, gender Medications Prior surgery or transplantation Associated conditions such
      as muscular dystrophy, renal failure

      Practice variables taken from the medical charts will include:

      Hospice care provided Home inotropic infusions Medications administered for pain Social
      work/psychology evaluation DNR status
