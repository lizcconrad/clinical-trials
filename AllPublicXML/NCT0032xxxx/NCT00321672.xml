      Study C119 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled evaluation of the efficacy
      and safety of NGX-4010 for the treatment of painful HIV-associated neuropathy. Eligible
      subjects had painful HIV-associated neuropathy resulting from HIV disease and/or
      antiretroviral drug exposure in both feet, with average numeric pain rating scale (NPRS)
      scores during screening of 3 to 9 (inclusive). Up to four patches covering an area of up to
      1120 square centimeters could be used during a single treatment administration in this study.
      Subjects were randomly assigned to receive active NGX-4010 patches (8% capsaicin) or
      low-concentration control patches (0.04% capsaicin) identical in appearance, at doses (patch
      application duration) of either 30 or 60 minutes, according to a 2:1:2:1 allocation scheme.

      Subjects could be on stable chronic oral pain medication regimens, but could not be using any
      topical pain medications on the affected areas. NPRS scores for the average pain in the past
      24 hours were recorded daily in the evening, beginning on the day of the Screening Visit
      (usually on Day -14). Subjects continued to record NPRS scores in a take-home diary from the
      evening on the day of treatment through the evening before the Termination Visit at Week 12.
      Subjects returned for interim follow-up visits at Weeks 4 and 8 following study treatment.

    <description>Efficacy was assessed by daily Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) capturing &quot;average pain for the past 24 hours&quot; for painful HIV-associated neuropathy area(s) at approximately 9 PM every evening throughout the 12-week study period. The NPRS is an 11-point scale (0 to 10) with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst possible pain.</description>
