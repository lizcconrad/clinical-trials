      This study will examine whether mitochondrial function is impaired in patients with bipolar
      disorder. Mitrochondria are small organelles inside the cell that are responsible for energy
      production. Recent studies in animals and humans suggest that abnormalities of mitrochondria
      may be involved in bipolar depression. The study will also examine whether the food
      supplement Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) improves mitochondrial function and symptoms such as
      depressed mood, low energy, anxiety or slowness in thinking and movements in bipolar
      patients. CoQ10 has been used to increase cell energy production and as an antioxidant. It
      has had some benefit in patients with Parkinson's disease and migraine and in prolonging
      survival in patients with cancer and heart failure.

      Patients 18-65 years of age with bipolar disorder who are currently in a depressive episode
      of at least 4 weeks duration may be eligible for this study. The study has four phases, as
      follows:

      Phase I: Medication Withdrawal

      Patients taper off all psychotropic medications, usually over 1 to 2 weeks.

      Phase II: Baseline Evaluation

      After being off all medication for about 2 weeks, patients undergo the following procedures:

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The two
           procedures are performed in an MRI scanner. Both tests use a strong magnetic field and
           radio waves to obtain images that provide information on brain anatomy and chemistry.

        -  Blood tests to assess mitochondrial function isolated from blood cells.

        -  Skin biopsy for tests of mitochondria. A small sample of skin tissue 5 x 5 millimeters
           is surgically removed.

      Phase III: Administration of CoQ10 or Placebo

      Participants are randomly assigned to take either CoQ10 or placebo (an inactive look-alike
      substance) twice a day by mouth. While taking the study medication, patients have the
      following procedures periodically:

        -  Rating scales for anxiety and depression and adverse events.

        -  Check of vital signs.

        -  Blood and urine sample collections.

      Phase IV: Study Completion

      At the end of the 8 weeks of treatment, patients have a physical examination and
      electrocardiogram, and the procedures in phase II are repeated. Participants may then receive
      short-term treatment (up to 12 weeks) with medications for bipolar depression, followed by
      referred to a community physician for long-term treatment.

    <textblock>
      Bipolar affective disorder is a common, severe, chronic and often life-threatening illness.
      The depressive phase contributes to the majority of morbidity and mortality in this illness.
      Impairments in physical and social functioning resulting from depression are often as severe
      as other chronic medical illnesses. Few of the treatments in use have resulted from an
      understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Undoubtedly, a greater
      understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder will lead to improved treatments.

      Current theories of depression suggest that mood disorders are associated with impairments of
      cellular resilience and structural plasticity possibly a result of abnormal cellular energy
      metabolism. Studies with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in bipolar subjects show
      reduced brain intracellular pH and reduced ATP. Cellular energy generated by mitochondrial
      oxidative phosphorylation from glucose via the electron transport chain is stored as ATP,
      which provide neurons and glia with energy required to maintain their function. Mitochondrial
      dysfunction and its inability to compensate for increase in ATP demand might lead to impaired
      cellular resilience believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.
      Abnormal regulation of nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins in the hippocampus of
      bipolar subjects provides further evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder.

      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain
      necessary for cellular energy generation. Exogenous administration of CoQ10 attenuates ATP
      depletion and has anti-oxidant properties. In light of the above evidence, we hypothesize
      that bipolar disorder is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by impaired
      brain energy metabolism and that administration of CoQ10, a mitochondrial enhancer, will
      restore mitochondrial function. To accomplish these objectives, we will compare mitochondrial
      functions in bipolar depressed subjects to 26 healthy controls matched for age, gender and
      BMI. Measures of mitochondrial function will include brain lactate levels (a product of
      anaerobic glycolysis) with H+ MRS, 2) assays of mitochondrial function in cultured
      fibroblasts and platelets, and 3) gene expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes using a
      cDNA Microarray. Further, subjects with bipolar depression, ages 18 to 65 will be randomized
      to either CoQ10 (300-1200 mg/day) or placebo in a double-blind placebo controlled trial for a
      period of 8 weeks. Measures of mitochondrial function will be compared between subjects
      randomized to placebo or CoQ10 at baseline and at the end of the 8-week trial.
