  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests that blood pressure is influenced by both genetic and environmental
      factors. The goal of this study is to find genes that play a role in blood pressure and
      understand how they interact with life events (such as job stress) to influence blood
      pressure. We hypothesize that the gene for endothelin-1 is associated with increased blood
      pressure. Further, we predict that this genetic relationship is moderated by psychosocial
      stress factors, specifically job strain and marital cohesion.
