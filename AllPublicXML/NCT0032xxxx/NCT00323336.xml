  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is being done to determine if it is possible to use saliva to measure bone specific
      proteins and predict bone turnover which could be used in the treatment of osteoporosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis require sensitive and specific assays of bone
      turnover. Presently, serum or urinary assessments are used. However, the development of other
      procedures that are more patient-convenient, non-invasive and cost-efficient would
      significantly facilitate a clinician's ability to determine bone turnover. The objective of
      this application is to determine the feasibility of using saliva for this measurement. We
      will compare serum, urinary and salivary levels in 50 pre- and 50 post-menopausal women.
      Markers to be measured are bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, procollagen type
      propepties hydroxypyridinium crosslinks of collagen and crosslinked collagen telopeptides.
      Collection of saliva, serum and urine will be done at a single visit. We expect to observe
      reasonable good correlation between serum and saliva levels and poorer correlation between
      urine and saliva levels.

        The subject population will be limited to pre-menopausal and post-menopausal females who
        are in good systemic health in an attempt to determine whether salivary levels of bone
        turnover markers hold valuable promise as a replacement or partner biofluid for serum
        and/or urine. In addition, proper selection of the subject population will minimize the
        effect of confounding variables. The specific inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria are
        listed below.
