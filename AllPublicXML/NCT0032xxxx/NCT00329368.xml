    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of vaccination with
      EC90 (KLH-FITC) and GPI-0100 (adjuvant) followed by treatment with EC17 (Folate-FITC) in
      combination with low-dose cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-alpha) in patients with metastatic or
      refractory cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: This is a Phase 1b, single-cohort study of FolateImmune in combination with
      low-doses of the cytokines Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha).
      FolateImmune treatment consists of subcutaneous vaccinations with EC90, a compound designed
      to elicit an immune response (antibodies) to a dye called fluorescein (FITC), in combination
      with GPI-0100 adjuvant (a drug intended to improve antibody production). Vaccination is
      followed by treatment with EC17, a drug made by linking folate (a vitamin) with FITC.
      Experimental evidence has shown that the folate vitamin receptor is over-expressed in many
      human cancers. It is expected that EC17 will attach to cancer cells through the folate
      vitamin receptor and that antibodies to FITC will recognize the cancer cell and mark it for
      destruction by the body's immune system. Two drugs, IL-2 and IFN-alpha, will be administered
      at low doses in combination with EC17 in order to boost the immune response.

      Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the safety of administering EC90 vaccine with GPI-0100 adjuvant.

        -  Evaluate the safety of administering EC17 concurrent with IL-2 and IFN-alpha

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or refractory cancer for which
             there are no effective standard therapeutic options available, (Note: for patients
             accrued at Southern Illinois University, a diagnosis of renal (i.e., kidney) carcinoma
             is required.)

          -  Have signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form (ICF)
             prior to performing any study evaluation/procedures

          -  Be &gt; or = 18 years of age and women must either be 1) not of childbearing potential or
             2) have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencing treatment.
             Patients are considered not of childbearing potential if they are surgically sterile
             (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal (12 consecutive months of amenorrhea [lack of
             menstruation])

          -  (If applicable) Have completed prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy or
             immunotherapy or experimental therapy &gt; or = 30 days prior to the study enrollment,
             and recovered form associated toxicities

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of &lt; or = 2, and an
             anticipated life expectancy of at least 6 months

          -  Have adequate hematologic function, as defined by an absolute or calculated neutrophil
             count &gt; or = 1500/microL, platelet count &gt; or = 100000/microL, lymphocyte count &gt; or =
             500/microL, and hemoglobin level &gt; or = 10 g/dL. Patients may not receive prophylactic
             transfusion in order to qualify for trial eligibility

          -  Have adequate renal function, as defined by a documented serum creatinine of &lt; or =
             2.0mg/dL. Greater than &quot;1+&quot; proteinuria will require microscope evaluation and the
             results discussed with the medical monitor prior to patient enrollment; or if serum
             creatine is &gt;2.0, patient must have an actual or calculated 24-hour creatinine
             clearance of &gt;60mL/min and no obvious evidence of concurrent medullary cystic disease
             or obstructive uropathy

          -  Have adequate hepatic function, as defined by a total bilirubin level &lt; or = 1.5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase (AST),
             and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels &lt; or = 2.5 x ULN. If alkaline phosphatase is
             outside of these parameters and is due to bone metastases (as verified by the
             assessment of isoenzymes), then the patient is eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have previously participated in a FolateImmune trial

          -  Have a history of severe hypersensitivity (grade 3 - 4 allergic reaction) to
             fluorescein or any drug, radiologic contrast agent, insect bite, food, cytokines, or
             any other agent; or have received fluorescein within 30 days of the study.

          -  Have medical conditions that preclude the use of IL-2 or IFN-alpha. These conditions
             include but are not limited to, diabetes mellitus with a history of progression to
             diabetic ketoacidosis, history of severe coagulation disorder, psoriasis, sarcoidosis,
             retinal hemorrhage, symptomatic pulmonary disease, heart failure (&gt; or = New York
             Heart Association NYHA class II), or transplant requiring immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Be pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  Be currently receiving an experimental drug, or used an experimental device within 30
             days of study entry

          -  Be currently undergoing chemotherapy, anticancer hormonal therapy, and/or therapy with
             immunosuppressant agents

          -  Have any concomitant malignancy with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of skin

          -  Have radiographically documented evidence of current brain metastases, a history of
             stem cell transplant, immunodeficiency, and/or a medical or psychiatric illness (that
             in the investigator's opinion, would prevent adequate compliance with study therapy or
             evaluation of the endpoints)
