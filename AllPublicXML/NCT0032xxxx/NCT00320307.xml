  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of the drug abacavir (ABC) in blood. Also,
      the study will look at the levels of carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), which is the active
      substance produced from ABC in the body√¢ s cells which helps prevent HIV from multiplying.
      CBV-TP will be measured in specific blood cells. The amount of ABC and CBV-TP will be looked
      at when subjects receive ABC as a 300mg dose twice a day and compared with the levels when
      they receive ABC as a 600mg dose once a day.
