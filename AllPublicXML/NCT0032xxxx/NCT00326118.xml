  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the primary phase of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a
      single dose of GSK Biologicals' Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal C (Hib-MenC)
      conjugate vaccine when given in the second year of life to subjects primed in infancy with a
      Hib vaccine, but not with a meningococcal serogroup C vaccine, versus commercially available
      Hib and MenC vaccines.

      In the extension phase, at Years 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5, one blood sample is taken at each year to
      follow the antibody persistence up to 5 years after vaccination. No additional vaccine is
      administered during the extension phase. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to
      comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study is open and has 2 treatment groups with Hiberix™ + a commercially
      available MenC vaccine as active controls. Priorix™ is given concomitantly in both groups. In
      the primary phase, two blood samples are taken from all subjects for immunogenicity analyses:
      before and one month after vaccination. In the extension phase, at Year 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5, one
      blood sample is taken at each year to follow the antibody persistence up to 5 years after
      vaccination. No additional vaccine is administered during the extension phase.

Functional anti-meningococcal serogroup C activity (SBA-MenC) was determined by a serum bactericidal test using rabbit complement. For SBA testing at a GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) laboratory up to Year 3 after vaccination, titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution resulting in 50% inhibition. For SBA testing at the Public Health England (PHE), formerly known as Health Protection Agency (HPA), at Year 4, titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the last dilution resulting in at least 50% inhibition.</description>
