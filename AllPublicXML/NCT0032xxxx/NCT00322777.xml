  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is a widely spread health problem in Canada. Recent research suggests a
      potential role for religion/spirituality in the prevention of and recovery from depression in
      adults. The purpose this study was to assess the efficacy of a home-based Spirituality
      Teaching Program for adults in the treatment of major depression. The objectives of the study
      were to determine:

        1. whether the Spirituality Teaching Program is efficacious in improving depression
           severity, response rate, and remission rate in adults,

        2. whether efficacy is maintained long term (over a 16 week period).

      Major depression is a widely spread health problem in Canada with a life time prevalence of
      11% in men and 16% in women. A recent avenue of research suggests a role for
      religion/spirituality in the prevention of and recovery from depression. It has been
      hypothesized that religion/spirituality acts as a coping resource in distressing life
      situations including illness and loss and may address the struggles of depressed patients of
      feeling separated from their surrounding world, as well as from their inner self. Majority of
      the research conducted to date on this topic has been observational and focused on the
      religious denomination, primarily the Christian and Muslim faiths. However, given the
      distinction between spirituality and religion and since a growing portion of the Canadian
      population identifies themselves as nonreligious but spiritual (10), it is pertinent to
      explore whether there is a role for a nondenominational spiritual intervention as a mental
      health resource. Considering the burden of depression on an individual and social level and
      need for effective and accessible treatment options, evaluation of spirituality based
      approaches is highly relevant. This study aims to assess whether nurturing spiritual coping
      resources in a non-faith based way may play a therapeutic role in recovery from major
      depression in adults.

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - Depression Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depression severity was assessed at the four time points (baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 24 weeks) using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The HAM-D is a standardized outcome measure of depression severity in adults. Total scores includes the sum of 17-items, with eight items scored on a range of 0 (absent) to 2 (marked or definite) and nine scored on a range of 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). The level of depression was based on the following scoring ranges: 7 or under not depressed, 8-13 some depressive symptoms but no depressive disorder, 12-15 mild depression, 16-19 moderate depression, 20-24 moderately severe depression, and 25+ severe depression.
The HAM-D was administered through a face to face interview, which was conducted by a trained nurse who was blinded to participants' allocation.</description>

    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was assessed at the four time points (baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 24 weeks) using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A response was determined as a reduction in the HAM-D score by at least 50% from the baseline score. The data are presented as the percentage of participants with response at each time point as compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Remission</measure>

    <description>Remission of depression was assessed at the four time points (baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 24 weeks) using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Remission was based on a HAM-D score of less than 7. Remission is indicated as a percentage of participants at each time point whose scores were below 7.</description>

    <description>The Spirituality Teaching Program is a home study program delivered through audio CDs over an 8-week period. The program consists of weekly 90 minute teaching sessions, based on the content of a workshop developed to assist users in developing a more spiritual outlook on life and coping resources. Using didactic comment and storytelling, the following spiritual concepts are addressed in the sessions: self-transcendence, connectedness, forgiveness, self-acceptance, detachment, compassion and gratitude. Each session concludes with a relevant guided visualization practice. In addition, a 15-minute progressive relaxation exercise is included that is to be used on a daily basis. The presented content is nondenominational to ensure compatibility with any beliefs participants may hold.</description>

        <title>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - Depression Severity</title>
        <description>Depression severity was assessed at the four time points (baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 24 weeks) using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The HAM-D is a standardized outcome measure of depression severity in adults. Total scores includes the sum of 17-items, with eight items scored on a range of 0 (absent) to 2 (marked or definite) and nine scored on a range of 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe). The level of depression was based on the following scoring ranges: 7 or under not depressed, 8-13 some depressive symptoms but no depressive disorder, 12-15 mild depression, 16-19 moderate depression, 20-24 moderately severe depression, and 25+ severe depression.
The HAM-D was administered through a face to face interview, which was conducted by a trained nurse who was blinded to participants’ allocation.</description>

        <title>Remission</title>
        <description>Remission of depression was assessed at the four time points (baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 24 weeks) using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Remission was based on a HAM-D score of less than 7. Remission is indicated as a percentage of participants at each time point whose scores were below 7.</description>
