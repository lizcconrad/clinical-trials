    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the effectiveness of a
      comprehensive interdisciplinary post-discharge stroke care management intervention in
      improving the overall well-being of 190 stroke survivors as compared to 190 patients who
      receive usual post-discharge stroke care.

    <textblock>
      The major components of the model of post-stroke care being tested include equal emphasis on
      physical and psychosocial issues known to impact stroke outcomes, an Advanced Practice Nurse
      care manager (APN-CM), an interdisciplinary healthcare team, evidenced-based care plans,
      collaboration with the patient's primary care physician (PCP), and ongoing patient
      monitoring. The APN-CM will work as part of an interdisciplinary post-stroke consultation
      team (PSC-Team) that will review problems identified at an in-home patient assessment. The
      core PSC-Team will include a geriatrician, a community-based general internist, a Clinical
      Nurse Specialist from the acute stroke unit, the APN-CM, and a physical therapist. Extended
      team members will be available as-needed and will include a neurologist, pharmacist,
      physiatrist, social worker, speech therapist, occupational therapist, and dietitian. The
      PSC-Team will develop patient care plans specific to each problem identified by the APN-CM. A
      copy of the care plans, evidence-based guidelines, pertinent references, and a short
      paragraph providing &quot;academic detailing&quot; specific to the patient's problems will be given to
      the patient's PCP by phone and in writing. The APN-CM will work collaboratively with the PCP
      to implement the recommendations and provide ongoing monitoring.The primary outcome of
      overall well-being of stroke survivors will be obtained at 6 months.
