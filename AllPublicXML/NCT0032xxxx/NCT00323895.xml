      A Prospective, Randomized, Multi-Center Comparison of the Cypher Select™ Sirolimus-Eluting
      Stent and Balloon Re-Angioplasty for Treatment of Patients with Intra-Des Restenosis.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study to be conducted at up to 33 sites in France with 3
      groups of patients (1 group with intra-Taxus™ restenosis, 1 group with intra-Cypher™
      restenosis and 1 control group with intra-BMS restenosis). All patients will have a repeat
      angiography at 9 to 12 months post-procedure and will be followed up to 12 months
      post-procedure.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald
             Classification B&amp;C, I-II-III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia;

          -  Patient has an intra-DES (TAXUS™ OR CYPHER™) or intra-BMS restenosis of &gt;= 50% and
             &lt;100% (by QCA online of the MLD compared to the distal reference diameter) in a native
             coronary artery;

          -  Study target lesion must be located in a restenotic native coronary artery &gt;=2.25mm
             and &lt;=3.5mm in lumen diameter and &lt;=30mm in length by visual estimate and within a
             region up to 5mm to the proximal/distal stent edge;

          -  Study target lesion must have undergone coronary interventional treatment &gt;= 4 weeks
             previously. Patients with one ore more prior PTCA procedures at the target lesion are
             acceptable candidates.

          -  Study target lesion can not be located in a vessel containing another lesion requiring
             treatment. Lesions located in other vessels may be treated with percutaneous
             revascularization at the time of the procedure, BUT they must be successfully treated
             prior to the treatment of the study target lesion;

          -  Patient is candidate for a current percutaneous revascularisation technique;

          -  Patient is willing to comply with the specified follow-up evaluations (including
             angiographic follow-up);

          -  Patient must provide written informed consent prior to the procedure using a form that
             is approved by the local Ethics Committee;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has experienced a Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with documented
             total CK &gt;2 times normal within the preceding 72 hours and the CK enzymes remain above
             normal at the time of treatment;

          -  Has unstable angina classified as Braunwald A I-II-III;

          -  Unprotected left main coronary disease with ³50% stenosis;

          -  Significant (&gt;50%) stenoses of additional lesions proximal or distal to the target
             lesion(s) that might require revascularization or impede runoff;

          -  Target lesion is in an internal mammary artery, saphenous vein bypass graft or is
             located in the left main or is ostial;

          -  Stent implantation(s) is a non-elective, emergency procedure;

          -  Stent at the target restenosed lesion is neither TAXUS™ , CYPHER™ DES nor a BMS;

          -  Documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;=25%;

          -  Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 level).
