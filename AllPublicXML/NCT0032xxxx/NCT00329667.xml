      This study is a multi-centered, multi-country, prospective, non-randomized, observational
      study, without concurrent or matched controls, conducted under a common protocol. Bayesian
      methods will be used for the design and analysis of this study. The Bayesian model will
      determine if the data for the valve configurations are poolable. Bayesian methods also
      provide a means of determining the appropriate stopping time for the study based on the
      amount of information generated. The objectives of this study are to confirm the clinical
      safety and efficacy of the SJM Epic Valve by establishing the following:

        -  adverse effect rates

        -  clinical status as indicated by NYHA functional classification

        -  hemodynamic performance

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient requires replacement of the aortic and/or mitral valve (Note: Patients
             undergoing concomitant procedures, e.g. coronary artery bypass grafting, valve repair,
             are eligible for this study).

          -  The patient (or legal guardian) has signed a study-specific informed consent, agreeing
             to the data collection and follow-up requirements.

          -  The patient is of legal age in host country.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient already has a prosthetic valve, other than the aortic and/or mitral valve
             being replaced at this time.

          -  The patient requires replacement of the tricuspid or pulmonary valve.

          -  The patient is pregnant or nursing.

          -  Patient has active endocarditis.

          -  Patient is actively participating in the study of an investigational drug or device.

          -  Patient has had an acute preoperative neurological event.

          -  The patient is undergoing renal dialysis.

          -  Patient is an intravenous drug abuser, alcohol abuser or prison inmate.

          -  Patient has an inability or unwillingness to return for the required follow-up
             intervals.

          -  The patient had the SJM Epic Valve implanted during the clinical study but then had
             the bioprosthesis explanted.
