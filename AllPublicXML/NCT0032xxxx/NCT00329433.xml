  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A blood clot in the veins, also known as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), is one of the most
      common complications after surgery. This may result in death if a clot breaks off and travel
      to the lungs; this is referred to as pulmonary embolism (PE). After heart surgery the
      incidence of DVT ranges from 20-48% and following lung surgery the incidence is 19-26%. In
      order to decrease the likelihood of this complication, patients receive by injection a blood
      thinning medicine. Heparin is the usual medicine used for this purpose following heart and
      lung surgery. Recently there have been reports that other medicines may be more effective
      than heparin for this purpose. Also there have been reports that some patients develop
      antibodies to heparin. When this occurs, this may prevent the heparin from being effective
      and may even promote the formation of blood clots. Antibodies to heparin may be present more
      often following heart and lung surgery than other types of surgery. There is a new medicine
      called desirudin (Iprivask), which may be used instead of heparin to prevent blood clots
      following heart and lung surgery. Desirudin is currently approved by the FDA to prevent blood
      clots following hip surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare desirudin with heparin
      for the prevention of vein clots after heart and lung surgery.

            <groups_desc>Published data show that the incidence of PF4/heparin EIA antibodies is approximately 40% (range, 20% to 60%) following cardiac surgery. We estimated that antibody formation would occur in approximately 20% of patients following thoracic surgery. Sixty patients in each group would provide 80% power to detect a decrease in the incidence of positive PF4/heparin EIA tests from 20% to 4% at an alpha level of &lt;0.05.</groups_desc>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study size was small and a surrogate end point was the primary outcome. The study was not powered to show statistical differences in clinical outcomes. Many patients received both desirudin and heparin during the study.</limitations_and_caveats>
