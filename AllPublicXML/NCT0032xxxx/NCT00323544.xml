  <brief_title>SWEET: Once Daily Truvada Versus Twice Daily Combivir for the Treatment of HIV Infection</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase 3, Open Label, Randomised, Parallel Group Study to Compare the Effect on Prevention and Resolution of Treatment Related Adverse Events of a Simplified, Once Daily Regimen of a Fixed Dose Combination Tablet of Emtricitabine and Tenofovir DF Versus Twice Daily co-Formulated Zidovudine and Lamivudine (Combivir®) or Zidovudine and Lamivudine, in Virologically Suppressed, HIV Infected Patients Taking Efavirenz</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether the simplified regimen of a once daily fixed dose
      combination of Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [DF]) will be
      associated with a reduced rate of adverse events, seen with long term use of antiretrovirals,
      as well as improved adherence compared to a twice daily fixed dose combination of Combivir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success of HAART is largely dependant on an individual's ability to adhere strictly to an
      antiretroviral regimen. Regimen characteristics that affect adherence include dosing
      frequency and pill burden. Several studies have shown improved adherence with lower pill
      burden and a meta-analysis of the virological outcome in relation to pill burden has shown a
      significant correlation between lower pill burden and better virological outcome. A
      systematic review of studies across a range of medical specialties demonstrated that once
      daily therapy improves adherence relative to more frequent dosing although statistical
      significance was not demonstrated relative to twice daily regimens.
