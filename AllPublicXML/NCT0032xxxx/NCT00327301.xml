    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of blindness. The key feature of this ocular neuropathy
      is characterized by an excavating optic nerve head. Loss of retinal ganglion cells is the
      final end point in blinding diseases of the optic nerve such as glaucoma. It is known that
      neuronal cell death in glaucoma occurs by an apoptotic mechanism. In earlier studies the
      investigators could demonstrate that the process of apoptosis is reflected in circulating
      leukocytes by different parameters, like differential mRNA expression and an increased
      fragmentation of the DNA. Such alterations point out a relationship between cellular stress
      and apoptotic events.

      Based on the results of mRNA-expression the investigators also expect alterations on the
      protein level.

      This study is, therefore, designed to characterize the proteome related to the proteins
      involved in cell death related pathways.

      Thus, the expression pattern of several proteins in leukocytes from patients with primary
      open angle glaucoma will be analyzed by techniques like Western-blot and tandem mass
      spectrometry. These samples will be compared with samples from healthy controls. In addition,
      they will also be compared with samples from patients with Parkinson's disease. Since
      glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease, these patients will be included as positive controls
      in this study.

      Hypothesis:

      Differences in the proteome concerning cell death pathways of glaucoma patients correspond to
      the differences in the mRNA expression of these patients.

      Specific aims:

      Characterization of the cellular proteome from human leukocytes of glaucoma patients compared
      to healthy controls and patients with Parkinson's disease.

      Background:

      Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of blindness. The key feature of this ocular neuropathy
      is characterized by an excavating optic nerve head. Loss of retinal ganglion cells is the
      final end point in blinding diseases of the optic nerve such as glaucoma. It is known that
      neuronal cell death in glaucoma occurs by an apoptotic mechanism. In earlier studies we could
      demonstrate that this cell death is reflected in circulating leukocytes by different
      parameters, like differential mRNA expression, and an increased fragmentation of the DNA. The
      differences in mRNA expression indicate a close relationship to cellular stress conditions
      and apoptotic events: increased mRNA expression was detected for p53, 20S proteasome alpha
      subunit, ABC1 transporter, p21(WAF1/CIP1), 14-3-3 sigma factor, MMP-9 and MMP-14, and TIMP-1.

      Based on the assumption that glaucoma patients may differ on the level of their expression
      for these mRNAs, we expect that similar differences should exist at the protein level.

      This study is, therefore, designed to characterize the proteome related to the proteins
      involved in cell death related pathways.

          -  Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) with and without vasospasm

          -  An inclusion criterion for one control group is Parkinson's disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any history of:

          -  Ocular or systemic diseases other than glaucoma or Parkinson's disease

          -  Drug or alcohol abuse
