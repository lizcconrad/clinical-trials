      Primary Objective: This trial is elaborating a model for rapidly predicting (day 21) the
      response to monoclonal antibodies anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF (cetuximab and bevacizumab) based
      on biological markers and/or functional imaging. The response to treatment is evaluated by
      the conventional method after 2 months (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]
      criteria).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. This trial is also analyzing the correlation between the magnitude of response to
           treatment at 2 months (stabilization or objective response, RECIST criteria) and that of
           response observed after 6 months of treatment.

        2. The organisational objective is to develop a tumour bank of metastatic colorectal
           cancer.

      Population: The population includes 252 male and female patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer justifying the use of cetuximab or bevacizumab, with no heart disease.

      Techniques: Computed tomography (CT scan), functional imaging (ultrasound with SonoVue);
      molecular imaging (positron emission tomography [PET] with fluorodeoxyglucose F18 [18-FDG]);
      and biology and pathology on microbiopsy of liver metastasis are used.

      Outcome Criteria: The primary outcome is response to treatment with monoclonal antibodies
      according to RECIST criteria at two months.

      Studied Factors:

      Radiology:

        1. CT scan: RECIST criteria (gold standard);

        2. Ultrasound with SonoVue injection: 1 representative target (delay of contrast
           appearance, peak of rising, curve of increase and decrease of the signal, area under the
           curve, time of average transit).

      Nuclear Medicine: PET scan and 18-FDG (standard uptake values [SUV])

      Molecular Characterization of Tumors: p53 status; microsatellite instability (MSI) status;
      expression of oncogenes; EGFR status; VEGF status; determination of FcgammaRIIIA
      polymorphisms

      Statistics:

        1. Descriptive analyses;

        2. Analysis of the appropriate threshold to measure: response to treatment by an ultrasound
           with SonoVue and by PET scan; correlation between response predicted by the ultrasound
           with SonoVue and the PET; conventional morphological CT at 2 months

        3. Analysis of prognostic factors:

             1. Evaluation of the role of each prognostic factor (pathology and imaging) on
                response to treatment;

             2. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors;

             3. Analysis of the prognostic power of early response at 2 months on the response
                observed after 6 months of treatment.
