  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma is a incurable disease. Recently developed targeted therapy gave new hope
      for the patients with multiple myeloma. Velcade in combination with other agents are
      currently in trials for the newly diagnosed patient, we designed sequential treatment with
      VTD and MPT for the patients who are not transplant candidates. This would be expected to
      result in maximal tumor control, and thus, in maximal survival benefit, equivalent to high
      dose therapy with autologous transplantation in younger population

      The two effective and non-cross resistant regimens, VTD and MPT, will be applied sequentially
      to the patients with multiple myeloma who are not transplant candidates. This would be
      expected to result in maximal tumor control, and thus, in maximal survival benefit,
      equivalent to high dose therapy with autologous transplantation in younger population
