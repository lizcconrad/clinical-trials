    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of two
      ISIS 113715 subcutaneous doses (15 mg and 30 mg/day) in combination with oral antidiabetic
      agents (OAD) versus OAD + placebo in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes,
      despite ongoing maximal treatment with OAD.
