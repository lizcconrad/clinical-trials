  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC) is the leading cause of death in Korean men after stomach
      cancer. Surgical resection plays a main role for curative treatment. However, less than 20 %
      of the NSCLC patients have been found in stage I-II disease. In inoperable stage IIIA/B
      disease, the recommended treatment is combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Various
      kinds of combination of 2 modalities have been used either in sequential or concurrent
      setting. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy(CCRT) have been recognized to have better survival than
      radiation therapy alone or sequential therapy, but additional consolidation chemotherapy
      after CCRT is not yet to be determined for the beneficial role in survival gain. Docetaxel is
      an anticancer drug and has synergistic anticancer effect in various cancer with cisplatin,
      another anticancer drug. In the present study, randomised trial will be performed to confirm
      the efficacy of the consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel and cisplatin after completing
      CCRT with the same chemotherapeutic agents in stage III inoperable NSCLC on progression free
      survival and overall survival.
