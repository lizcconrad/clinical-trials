  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue fever, which is caused by dengue viruses, is a major health problem in tropical and
      subtropical regions of the world. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      immune response to the dengue vaccine DEN4delta30-4995 in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses account for more than 50 million cases of dengue fever and a half million
      cases of the more severe disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Infection
      with dengue viruses is the leading cause of hospitalization and death in children in at least
      eight Asian countries. The goal of producing a vaccine against dengue fever is to induce a
      long-lived antibody response against all four dengue serotypes. The rDEN4delta30-4995 vaccine
      candidate is a live attenuated recombinant virus derived from rDEN4delta30 for protection
      against dengue virus serotype 4. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of rDEN4delta30-4995 in healthy adults.

      This study will last 180 days (6 months). Participants in Cohort 1 will be randomly assigned
      to receive the highest dose of rDEN4delta30 or placebo at study entry. Participants in Cohort
      2 will be randomly assigned to receive a lower dose of rDEN4delta30 or placebo. Participants
      in Cohort 3 will be randomly assigned to receive the lowest dose of rDEN4delta30 or placebo.
      Cohorts 2 and 3 will begin after a safety review of all participants in the previous cohort.

      After initial vaccination, participants in Cohort 1 will be followed every other day for the
      first 16 days of the study, monitoring their temperature three times a day through Day 16 and
      recording these measurements in a diary. After Day 16, study visits will occur on Days 21,
      28, 42, and 180 and will include a physical exam and blood collection. Some participants will
      also be asked to undergo a skin biopsy or additional blood collection at selected visits.
