      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and Phase 2
      recommended dose of satraplatin when administered in combination with capecitabine in
      patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, Phase I dose finding study of the
      investigational, oral cytotoxic drug, satraplatin in combination with capecitabine in
      patients with advanced solid tumors for whom curative therapy is not available. Please refer
      to the Eligibility Criteria below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      PURPOSE: The purpose of this trial is to determine a tolerable dose and schedule for the
      combination of satraplatin and docetaxel when given to patients with advanced solid tumors.

      WHAT IS SATRAPLATIN: Satraplatin is an oral, investigational anticancer drug that is a member
      of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based drugs have been clinically
      proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer therapies. Unlike the currently
      marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given orally.
