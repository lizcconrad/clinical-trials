  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a new
      investigational protease inhibitor (PI) plus background antiretrovirals plus Fuzeon (90mg sc
      bid) in HIV-1 infected, triple-class treatment-experienced, Fuzeon-naive adults. The new
      investigational PI will be administered according to the procedures of the early access
      program in which the patient is enrolled. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12
      months, and the target sample size is approximately 120 individuals.

The percentage adherence to the ENF regimen at each study visit is given by: % Adherence = ([8 - the number of doses missed] / 8) x 100. The number and percentage of participants adhering to the ENF regimen were presented by adherence category (100%, ≥95%, ≥90% and ≥85%) at Weeks 4, 12, and 24.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With 1 or More Injection Site Reactions Meeting the Criteria of an Serious Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Injection site reactions (ISRs) referred to any localized sign or symptom, including erythema, induration, pruritus, nodules, ecchymosis (degree of bruising/ discoloration), and pain/discomfort. Injection site reactions were monitored by trained study personnel at weeks 1, 4, 12, 16, and 24. Interruption of ENF for toxicity management of recurrent local grade 3 or 4 ISRs until the sign or symptom resolved to grade 2 was at the discretion of the investigator. Any individual injection site signs or symptoms meeting the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE) had to be reported as an SAE. In the event of a serious ISR, the participant was to immediately discontinue ENF and withdraw from the study. If the participant was not already hospitalized, serious ISRs required a clinic visit within 72 hours of the event.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Injection site reactions (ISRs) referred to any localized sign or symptom, including erythema, induration, pruritus, nodules, ecchymosis (degree of bruising/ discoloration), and pain/discomfort. Injection site reactions were monitored by trained study personnel at weeks 1, 4, 12, 16, and 24. Grades 0 through 4 are a measure of intensity, not seriousness. Thus, a grade 3 or grade 4 sign or symptom could be severe, but not necessarily serious. Only active, ongoing ISR were counted. The maximum severity grade for pain/discomfort since the last visit at any injection site was recorded whether or not the maximum severity of pain/discomfort was ongoing at the time of clinical evaluation.</description>

        <description>Summary statistics for change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA count were presented. Change from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA count was derived as follows: Change from baseline = (plasma HIV-1 RNA count at Week X) – (plasma HIV-1 RNA count at baseline).</description>

        <description>Adherence to ENF treatment regimen was calculated using the participant’s response to the query on the “Participant Adherence Questionnaire case report form (CRF)” about injections incomplete or missed in the last 4 days preceding the study visit. The percentage adherence to the ENF regimen at each study visit is given by: % Adherence = ([8 - the number of doses missed] / 8) x 100. The number and percentage of participants adhering to the ENF regimen were presented by adherence category (100%, ≥95%, ≥90% and ≥85%) at Weeks 4, 12, and 24.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With 1 or More Injection Site Reactions Meeting the Criteria of an Serious Adverse Event</title>
        <description>Injection site reactions (ISRs) referred to any localized sign or symptom, including erythema, induration, pruritus, nodules, ecchymosis (degree of bruising/ discoloration), and pain/discomfort. Injection site reactions were monitored by trained study personnel at weeks 1, 4, 12, 16, and 24. Interruption of ENF for toxicity management of recurrent local grade 3 or 4 ISRs until the sign or symptom resolved to grade 2 was at the discretion of the investigator. Any individual injection site signs or symptoms meeting the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE) had to be reported as an SAE. In the event of a serious ISR, the participant was to immediately discontinue ENF and withdraw from the study. If the participant was not already hospitalized, serious ISRs required a clinic visit within 72 hours of the event.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on the Safety Population. The Safety Population included all the participants who received at least one dose of trial medication and had a safety follow-up.</population>

        <description>Injection site reactions (ISRs) referred to any localized sign or symptom, including erythema, induration, pruritus, nodules, ecchymosis (degree of bruising/ discoloration), and pain/discomfort. Injection site reactions were monitored by trained study personnel at weeks 1, 4, 12, 16, and 24. Grades 0 through 4 are a measure of intensity, not seriousness. Thus, a grade 3 or grade 4 sign or symptom could be severe, but not necessarily serious. Only active, ongoing ISR were counted. The maximum severity grade for pain/discomfort since the last visit at any injection site was recorded whether or not the maximum severity of pain/discomfort was ongoing at the time of clinical evaluation.</description>
