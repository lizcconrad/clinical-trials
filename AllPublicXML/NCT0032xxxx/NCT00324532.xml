    <textblock>
      The study is an Open Label, Prospective, Non Comparative, Pilot, clinical trial design.
      Patients with inadequate relief in GI symptoms associated with GERD despite PPI treatment
      will be screened and those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will perform a
      glucose breath test for bacterial overgrowth . Each patient will then complete a
      questionnaire to record their GERD related symptoms. Each patient will then receive a daily
      intake of 30 mL two times daily, 30 minutes before meals for a period of 4 weeks. During the
      course of the trial, they will have 4 visits with the study physician to assess treatment
      compliance and occurrence of adverse events, and will complete periodic daily diaries to
      record compliance.

             at least 60 days

          4. Patient with positive or negative glucose breath test for bacterial overgrowth unless
             they are not able to do this secondary to diabetes. Diabetics will have a lactulose
             breath test

          5. Able to give informed consent

          6. Candidate will be available for the next 4 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Pregnant, breast-feeding, or not using approved methods of contraception (if of
        childbearing potential) 2. Unstable medical disorder 3. Patient has had E. coli strain M17
        administered in the past month 4. History of major psychiatric disorder or substance abuse
        within the previous 2 years, including psychiatric illnesses requiring medication that may
        cause doubt in the validity of the signed Informed Consent form 5. Existing illness or
        medical condition that will prevent the patient from participating in the study (such as
        severe heart disease, insulin dependent diabetes, hyperactive thyroid gland, HIV positive,
        etc.) 6. Participation in another clinical study during the past four weeks. 7. Any use of
        a probiotic supplement within 30 days of the screening period (with the exception of
        standard food yogurt products) 8. Any use of antibiotics within 30 days of the
        screening/enrollment period (however, candidate may wait to initiate screening exam until
        30 days have lapsed since antibiotic course was completed)
