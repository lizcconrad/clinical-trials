  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted at multiple sites to determine the activity, safety
      and tolerability of XL999 when given weekly to patients with relapsed or newly-diagnosed AML.
      XL999 is a small molecule inhibitor against Flk1/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), PDGFR,
      c-Kit, FLT3 and SRC. c-Kit and FLT3 are receptors commonly expressed on AML blasts.

    <description>XL999 was administered at a dose of 2.4 mg/kg given as a 4-hour IV infusion weekly for 4 weeks. In the absence of progressive disease and unacceptable toxicity, subjects were to receive XL999 treatment weekly for up to 1 year on this study</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (except AML FAB-M3 or acute promyelocytic leukemia
             [APL]) based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of ≥ 20% blasts in
             the bone marrow or peripheral blood at initial diagnosis (prior to start of standard
             chemotherapy)

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Subjects with newly-diagnosed AML or subjects with relapsed AML after at least 2
             chemotherapy regimens.

          -  Adequate liver and renal function

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anticancer therapy including chemotherapeutic, biologic, or investigative agents

             graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) within 30 days prior to the start of XL999

          -  The subject has not recovered to grade ≤ 1 or to within 10% of baseline from adverse
             events due to investigational or chemotherapeutic drugs or stem cell transplantation
             which were administered &gt; 4 weeks prior to study enrollment
