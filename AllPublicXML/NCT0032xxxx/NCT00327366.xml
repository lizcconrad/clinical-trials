      The study investigated whether bright artificial light may influence menstrual cycle and
      ovulation conclusively, and what underlying hormonal changes for this effect are.

      Several studies have shown a shortening of the menstrual cycle following light therapy in
      women with abnormally long menstrual cycles or with winter depression, which suggests that
      bright light may influence sex hormones and ovulation. The study was designed to investigate
      this possibility. Twenty-two women with slightly lengthened menstrual cycles and without
      clinically evident endocrine abnormalities completed a study lasting for two menstrual cycles
      separated by an off-protocol episode of at least 1 menstrual cycle. Bright light therapy was
      administered for a week at home during one experimental cycle, and dim light during another
      cycle (placebo-controlled, crossover, counter-balanced order). Daytime blood sampling and
      ultrasound scan were performed before and after a week of light therapy, on the ~7th and 14th
      days after menstruation onset. Ultrasound examination was repeated further to document
      ovulation. Serum was assayed for thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone,
      follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol. The preliminary results were reported at the
      SLTBR meeting in June, 2005.
