  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of BXT-51072 as a
      cardioprotective agent in diabetics undergoing elective angioplasty / percutaneous
      intervention (PCI), a procedure to &quot;open&quot; coronary arteries.

      BXT-51072 belongs to a class of drugs called &quot;glutathione peroxidase mimics.&quot; BXT-51072 works
      by imitating a substance produced in various tissues in the body, which prevents damage of
      the heart and blood vessels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following screening, baseline measurements and informed consent, patients will receive
      BXT-51072 40 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, 30 minutes before their scheduled PCI and then
      three times per day for 2 days. There will be 5 treatment visits and 3 follow-up visits.

      Blood samples will be obtained for CK-MB, troponin and routine chemistry. A 24-hour
      continuous electrocardiogram will be obtained following the PCI and regular
      electrocardiograms will be obtained during the study and follow-up period.
