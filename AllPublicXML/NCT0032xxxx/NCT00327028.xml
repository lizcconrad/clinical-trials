      The purpose of this study was evaluation the efficacy of antiepileptic drug phenytoin
      (diphenine) in the treatment of bronchial asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective therapy of asthma still remains quite serious problem. According current opinion of
      leading specialists, asthma is an inflammatory disorder. But asthma also is a paroxysmal
      disorder: many specialists underline paroxysmal clinical picture of asthma. According to some
      authors, neurogenic inflammation may play important role in asthma mechanism. But migraine
      and trigeminal neuralgia are also neurogenic inflammatory paroxysmal diseases, and some
      antiepileptic drugs, like diphenine and valproates, are very effective in therapy of these
      diseases - more than in 80% of cases. If bronchial asthma also is paroxysmal inflammatory
      disease, we can suppose a possibility that some antiepileptic drugs also may show high
      efficacy in asthma therapy. Taken in consideration this hypothesis, we performed a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled 3-month trial for evaluation of phenytoin (diphenine)
      efficacy in treatment of patients with bronchial asthma.
