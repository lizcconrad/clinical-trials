  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an international, multicenter, randomized (2:1 active:placebo), double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in subjects with PAH who were NOT currently receiving approved
      therapy for their PAH. Study visits occurred at 4 week intervals for 12 weeks (with an
      additional visit at Week 11) with the key measure of efficacy being the 6-minute walk test.
      Study procedures included routine blood tests, medical history, physical exams, disease
      evaluation, and exercise tests. Two optional substudies were also a part of FREEDOM-M at
      select centers - a hemodynamic substudy with a right heart catheterization at Baseline and
      Week 12 and a genetics and biomarkers substudy with blood samples collected at Baseline and
      Week 12.

      Patients who completed all assessments for 12 weeks were also eligible to enter an
      open-label, extension phase study (FREEDOM - EXT).

    <measure>Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Placebo corrected change in six minute walk distance (6MWD) from Baseline to Week 12, correlates with the historical clinical standard for assessing patient functional status in the treatment of PAH and is considered an objective measure of patient functional status by the American Thoracic Society (ATS).
The six minute walk test was to be conducted 3 to 6 hours after the previous dose of study drug.
The Hodges-Lehmann median difference between treatment groups was used to estimate the treatment effect on 6MWD from Baseline to Week 12. A rank-based methodology was used instead of parametric-based methodology to avoid statistical bias caused by extreme outliers resulting from the handling of data that are missing due to death or clinical worsening of PAH. It is a more robust estimator than the between-treatment difference in medians.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Worsening Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Definition of clinical worsening included patients who met at least one of the following criteria during the 12 weeks of the study:
Death (all causes excluding accident)
Transplantation or atrial septostomy
Clinical deterioration as defined by:
Hospitalization as a result of PAH, or
greater than or equal to 20% decrease in 6MWD from Baseline (or too ill to walk) and a decrease in WHO functional class And
Initiation of new PAH specific therapy (i.e., ERA, PDE5-I, prostacyclin)</description>

    <measure>World Health Organization Functional Classification for PAH</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Class I: Patients with pulmonary hypertension but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
Class II: Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. These patients are comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope.
Class III: Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
Class IV: Patients with pulmonary hypertension with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may be present even at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</description>

    <measure>Borg Dyspnea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg dyspnea score is a 10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced during the 6-minute walk test. The Borg dyspnea score was assessed immediately following the 6-minute walk test. Scores ranged from 0 (for no shortness of breath) to 10 (for greatest shortness of breath ever experienced).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea-Fatigue Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The dyspnea-fatigue index has three components, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4, for the magnitude of the task that evokes dyspnea or fatigue, the magnitude of the pace (or effort) with which the task is performed and the associated functional impairment in general activities. The ratings for each component were added to form an aggregate score, which could range from 0, for the worst condition, to 12, for the best.</description>

        <title>Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD)</title>
        <description>Placebo corrected change in six minute walk distance (6MWD) from Baseline to Week 12, correlates with the historical clinical standard for assessing patient functional status in the treatment of PAH and is considered an objective measure of patient functional status by the American Thoracic Society (ATS).
The six minute walk test was to be conducted 3 to 6 hours after the previous dose of study drug.
The Hodges-Lehmann median difference between treatment groups was used to estimate the treatment effect on 6MWD from Baseline to Week 12. A rank-based methodology was used instead of parametric-based methodology to avoid statistical bias caused by extreme outliers resulting from the handling of data that are missing due to death or clinical worsening of PAH. It is a more robust estimator than the between-treatment difference in medians.</description>

        <title>Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD)</title>
        <description>Placebo corrected change in six minute walk distance (6MWD) from Baseline to Week 8, correlates with the historical clinical standard for assessing patient functional status in the treatment of PAH and is considered an objective measure of patient functional status by the American Thoracic Society (ATS).
The six minute walk test was to be conducted 3 to 6 hours after the previous dose of study drug.
The Hodges-Lehmann median difference between treatment groups was used to estimate the treatment effect on 6MWD from Baseline to Week 8. A rank-based methodology was used instead of parametric-based methodology to avoid statistical bias caused by extreme outliers resulting from the handling of data that are missing due to death or clinical worsening of PAH. It is a more robust estimator than the between-treatment difference in medians.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
        <population>Analyses were conducted using the modified intention to treat (mITT) group, which includes subjects with access to 0.25 mg tablets at randomization (n=228). All alpha was spent on this subgroup, thereby maintaining an overall type I error rate of 0.05. For sensitivity purposes, efficacy analyses were also performed on all enrolled subjects (n=349).</population>

        <title>Six Minute Walk Distance by Baseline WHO Functional Classification III or IV</title>
        <description>Exploratory efficacy analyses were to determine the effect of Baseline WHO functional class on treatment effect for change in 6MWD.
The Hodges-Lehmann median difference between treatment groups was used to estimate the treatment effect on 6MWD from Baseline to Week 12. A rank-based methodology was used instead of parametric-based methodology to avoid statistical bias caused by extreme outliers resulting from the handling of data that are missing due to death or clinical worsening of PAH. It is a more robust estimator than the between-treatment difference in medians.</description>

        <title>Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) for the Entire Study Population</title>
        <description>Placebo corrected change in six minute walk distance (6MWD) from Baseline to Week 11, a time expected to correlate with trough treprostinil concentration. This outcome measure was assessed using data from all subjects enrolled in the study, regardless of tablet strength availability at the time of randomization.
The six minute walk test was to be conducted 8 to 13 hours after the previous dose of study drug.
The Hodges-Lehmann median difference between treatment groups was used to estimate the treatment effect on 6MWD from Baseline to Week 11. A rank-based methodology was used instead of parametric-based methodology to avoid statistical bias caused by extreme outliers resulting from the handling of data that are missing due to death or clinical worsening of PAH. It is a more robust estimator than the between-treatment difference in medians.</description>
