      The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to compare the effectiveness of two promising
      treatments for social phobia, a new cognitive therapy model (Clark &amp; Wells, 1995; Borge et
      al., 2001) and interpersonal therapy (Lipsitz, Markowitz, &amp; Cherry, 1997), adapted for
      inpatient groups; and (2) to study the empirical change processes in these therapies and
      compare them with the cognitive and interpersonal models of change.

      Social phobia typically leads to severe impairment in work and other social life, and -
      without treatment - it can persist for decades. Given its prevalence, severity, and
      chronicity, effective treatment methods are strongly needed. However, traditional
      psychological and pharmacological treatments have had statistically significant, but
      clinically limited effects (Taylor, 1996).

      Based on an empirical analysis of the cognitive processes in social phobia, Clark and Wells
      (1995) have developed a new cognitive model. Cognitive therapy (CT) derived from this model
      has been found to be superior to a combination of fluoxetine and self-exposure (Clark et al.,
      2003).

      Social phobic symptoms may be viewed as a result of more general interpersonal difficulties
      and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) can be a reasonable alternative for social phobia
      (Lipsitz &amp; Markowitz, 1996). A clinical case series indicates that social phobic patients
      improve during interpersonal psychotherapy for social phobia (IPT-SP; Lipsitz et al., 1999.
