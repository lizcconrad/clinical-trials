    <textblock>
      This study is not being conducted in the United States. Vildagliptin is an oral antidiabetic
      agent. This 12-week clinical study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      vildagliptin as add-on therapy to a sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 diabetes
      inadequately controlled with sulfonylurea monotherapy.
