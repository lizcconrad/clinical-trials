  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of fibrin sealant reduces
      post-operative drainage following groin and axillary lymph node dissection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Fibrin sealant has been used for many years in clinical practice and has a wide
      range of applications including the control of lymphatic leaks and haemostasis. The
      physiological mechanism of action of fibrin was first described by Morawitz in 1905; fibrin
      sealant was first marketed in 1983.

      Lymph node dissection is undertaken for the control of malignant disease - frequently
      malignant melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Following groin or axillary dissection,
      excessive post operative drainage may necessitate the presence of wound drains for 10 days or
      more. This may prolong hospital stay in some patients, and may be associated with an
      increased complication rate (such as wound infection).

      Hypothesis: the use of fibrin sealant prior to wound closure following either groin or
      axillary dissection may reduce post-operative wound drainage.

      Comparison: patients who require an elective groin or axillary dissection who either undergo
      standard wound closure or those who have fibrin sealant instilled into the surgical wound
      prior to wound closure.

    <measure>Post-operative Wound Drainage.</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of surgery to date of wound drain removal (typically a period of approximately one week).</time_frame>
    <description>The postoperative wound drainage volume was measured from the day of surgery until the the date of removal of the last wound drain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of Hospital Inpatient Stay.</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of surgery until date of discharge from hospital.</time_frame>
    <description>The length of hospital stay was calculated from the day of surgery to the day that the patient was discharged from hospital.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Post-operative Complications (Excluding Lymphoedema).</measure>
    <time_frame>Until wound healing complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Complications were classified as being either 'Minor' (i.e. (managed without operation, prolonged hospital stay or readmission) or 'Major' (i.e. requiring surgical intervention or readmission to hospital). The number of patients with each 'Minor' and 'Major' complication were recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Operative Pain Score Measured on 1st Post-operative Day.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the immediate post-operative period.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain score was recorded at 24 hours following the completion of surgery using a Visual Analogue Score (using a scale of 1 [no pain] to 10 [very severe pain]) which the patient was asked to record.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Recurrence.</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of surgery until end of study follow-up period (1st June 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>This was measured as either: 1. the number of participants with local recurrence; 2. the number of participants with in transit or regional recurrence; or 3. the number of participants with distant metastasis (but alive on 1st June 2010).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Death.</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of surgery until end of study follow-up period (1st June 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Death was recorded as the number of participants who had died by the end of the study follow-up period (1st June 2010). Deaths were recorded as either being related to the primary disease (i.e. due to distant metastasis) or death due to another (unrelated) cause (e.g. myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident).</description>

Diathermy and ligating clips were used as required and the wound bed irrigated with sterile water prior to closure.

            <description>All infrainguinal nodes, including Cloquet’s node, were removed in all groin dissection cases. Routine peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis was used. Diathermy and ligating clips were used as required and the wound bed irrigated with sterile water prior to closure. Closed suction drains were inserted and secured with drain sutures. 4 ml of Tisseel fibrin sealant (containing 1000 IU of human thrombin as the ‘fast-set’ preparation) were instilled into the wound using the Duploject™ spray delivery system. Firm pressure was applied to the wound for three minutes whilst the sealant set in order to obliterate the dead space, following which the skin was closed in two layers using absorbable sutures and the drains were vacuumed. A dry dressing was applied.</description>
