      Sponsor has decided to discontinue Luveris® in the United States (US) due to level of
      customer demand for this product, and not due to any efficacy or safety concerns.

      To confirm the efficacy of the 75 IU dose of Luveris® compared to placebo when administered
      concomitantly with follitropin alfa for induction of clinical pregnancy in women with
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and profound LH deficiency (LH &lt;1.2 IU/L), and to study the
      efficacy of a lower dose (25 IU) of Luveris® compared to placebo when administered
      concomitantly with follitropin alfa for induction of follicular development in women with
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and profound LH deficiency (LH &lt;1.2 IU/L).

After 7 days of treatment, if the participant's response was suboptimal, based on follicular growth and serum estradiol (E2) levels, follitropin alfa dose adjusted to maximal dose of 225 IU. When the follicular response was adequate, ovulation was triggered by a single 250 microgram subcutaneous injection of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (r-hCG, choriogonadotropin alfa). Duration of treatment cycle was up to 14 days, or maximum up to 21 days (if follicular maturation is imminent, based upon follicular growth and E2 levels).

      <desc>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, or diseases that emerges or worsens relative to baseline during a clinical study with an investigational medicinal product (IMP), regardless of causal relationship and even if no IMP has been administered.</desc>

          <title>Luveris® 75 IU</title>
          <description>Recombinant human luteinizing hormone (r-hLH, lutropin alfa, Luveris®), 75 international unit (IU) administered subcutaneously once daily along with fixed dose of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH, follitropin alfa) 75 to 150 IU subcutaneously for 7 days. After 7 days of treatment, if the participant's response was suboptimal, based on follicular growth and serum estradiol (E2) levels, follitropin alfa dose adjusted to maximal dose of 225 IU. When the follicular response was adequate, ovulation was triggered by a single 250 microgram subcutaneous injection of recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (r-hCG, choriogonadotropin alfa). Duration of treatment cycle was up to 14 days, or maximum up to 21 days (if follicular maturation is imminent, based upon follicular growth and E2 levels). Total duration was up to 3 treatment cycles.</description>
