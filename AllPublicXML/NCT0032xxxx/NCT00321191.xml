  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the &quot;second gas effect&quot;, a phenomenon produced by the uptake of
      nitrous oxide (N2O) by the lungs, during the course of a typical anaesthetic. The effect is
      to increase the concentration of other breathed gases in the lung. These include oxygen and
      volatile anaesthetic agents such as sevoflurane, which are also normally administered along
      with N2O. We wish to i) measure the magnitude of the second gas effects on both blood and
      expired concentrations of sevoflurane (Part 1), and ii) see if a demonstrable difference
      exists between the effects on blood and expired concentrations.

      This study is investigating the &quot;second gas effect&quot;, a phenomenon produced by the uptake of
      nitrous oxide (N2O) by the lungs, during the course of a typical anaesthetic. The effect is
      to increase the concentration of other breathed gases in the lung. These include oxygen and
      volatile anaesthetic agents such as sevoflurane, which are also normally administered along
      with N2O.

      While the second gas effect has been demonstrated previously, by measuring the concentration
      of volatile anaesthetic in the expired breath, no study has yet shown that it has a
      significant effect on the concentrations in the blood. The blood concentration is in fact
      more important, as it directly determines the concentration of anaesthetic reaching the
      brain, and therefore the effect on the depth of anaesthesia. The second gas effect on blood
      concentrations may be more powerful than that on expired concentrations, due to the
      detrimental effect of anaesthesia on the evenness of distribution of ventilation and blood
      flow in the lung.

      The proposed study will have two parallel components or Parts. We wish to i) measure the
      magnitude of the second gas effects on both blood and expired concentrations of sevoflurane
      (Part 1), and ii) see if a demonstrable difference exists between the effects on blood and
      expired concentrations.
