  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the effectiveness and safety of a new medical device
      which sprays liquid nitrogen through an upper endoscope (cryotherapy) to treat Barrett's
      esophagus with high-grade dysplasia and early esophageal cancer. It is hypothesized that this
      treatment will remove the abnormal lining of the esophagus and allow the normal esophageal
      lining to return.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) with high grade dysplasia (HGD) is a precursor of esophageal
      adenocarcinoma. Eliminating this condition may control the current rapid rise of
      adenocarcinoma. Ablative techniques are attempted to avoid the high morbidity and mortality
      of esophagectomy or for use in patients who cannot undergo surgery. Current ablative
      techniques have achieved mucosal ablation with variable success but are associated with high
      cost, patient discomfort and/or significant complications. A novel device which sprays liquid
      nitrogen through an upper endoscope (cryotherapy) has been shown to be a safe and effective
      procedure to ablate the esophageal mucosa in swine and dog models and in pilot studies in
      humans. Successful reversal of BE, LGD, HGD and superficial adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
      carcinoma have been demonstrated when cryotherapy with this device is followed by healing of
      the esophageal lining in a low acid environment.

      This study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy and safety in the ablation of Barrett's
      esophagus with high-grade, neoplasia, and severe esophageal squamous dysplasia and to confirm
      preliminary results in humans.
