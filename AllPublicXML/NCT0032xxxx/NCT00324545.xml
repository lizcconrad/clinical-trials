      (1) What effect does behavioral counseling for vegan, for low to moderate fat, and for
      lowered carbohydrate diets have on coronary blood flow? (2) What are the effects of different
      diet protocols when caloric intake and exercise are equalized? (3) Do people, so counseled,
      maintain their modified behaviors after they have completed their diet program? (4) How does
      targeting different diets affect secondary indices associated with heart disease such as
      weight, lipid, inflammatory, and thrombotic factors?

      Given the current epidemic of overweight and obesity on a global scale (“globesity”) and the
      consequent world public health objective of reducing that obesity, it is evident as a
      practical matter that, the main line of attack must be through diet. The public health
      objective and the lack of information regarding the long-term public health effects of
      alternative weight-loss diets motivated this comparative study of the three major types of
      weight-loss diets and their long term effects on coronary blood flow. Secondary endpoints are
      inflammatory and other variables associated with heart disease and obesity.

      Specifically we asked: (1) What effect does behavioral counseling for vegan, for low to
      moderate fat, and for lowered carbohydrate diets have on coronary blood flow? (2) What are
      the effects of different diet protocols when caloric intake and exercise are equalized? (3)
      Do people, so counseled, maintain their modified behaviors after they have completed their
      diet program? (4) How does targeting different diets affect secondary indices associated with
      heart disease such as weight, lipid, inflammatory, and thrombotic factors?
