      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine SR in combination with an
      antidepressant versus an antidepressant alone in patients with MDD with inadequate response
      to an antidepressant treatment.

      PLEASE NOTE: Seroquel SR and Seroquel XR refer to the same formulation. The SR designation
