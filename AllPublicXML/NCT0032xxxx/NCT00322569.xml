      To demonstrate non-inferiority in 6-month angiographic in-stent late lumen loss of the
      pimecrolimus-eluting coronary stent (Corio) compared to the CoStar coronary stent control arm
      and the dual pimecrolimus/paclitaxel-eluting (Symbio) coronary stent compared to the CoStar
      coronary stent control arm for the treatment of single de novo lesions &lt;25 mm in length in
      native coronary arteries 2.5 - 3.5 mm in diameter.
