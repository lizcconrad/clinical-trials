  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide a basis for research on the impact of liver injury caused by
      antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients. Elevated liver enzymes called AST and ALT
      are common in HIV-infected patients taking antiretroviral medications and can indicate liver
      damage. Although there are a number of possible causes for these elevations, such as
      infections with a hepatitis virus, antiretroviral medications alone can lead to the
      elevations. The study will focus particularly on evidence of liver fibrosis, which is a sign
      of progressive liver damage.

      HIV-infected patients 18 and older who 1) have been taking combination antiretroviral therapy
      for at least 12 months and have been on a stable regimen for at least 3 months, and 2) have
      had elevated AST or ALT levels for at least 6 months may be eligible for this study. Patients
      who have had liver biopsies performed in the past may be eligible for participation.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures over a 12-month period:

        -  Oral glucose tolerance test: The patient drinks a glucose (sugar) drink. Blood samples
           are then drawn over 2 hours through an intravenous (IV) line in the patient's arm. This
           test measures how high the patient's blood sugar and insulin levels rise after drinking
           a standard glucose load.

        -  Transient elastography: This ultrasound test uses vibration (sound waves) to measure
           liver stiffness (fibrosis). Vibrations move faster through a fibrotic liver.

        -  Triple-phase CT scan and single slice CT scan of L4-5: Patients fast for 4 hours before
           the CT scan. A contrast material is injected through a catheter placed in an arm vein to
           improve the visibility of the liver in the specialized X-ray images obtained in the CT
           scanner.

        -  Liver biopsy: This test removes a small sample of liver tissue for microscopic
           examination, particularly for evidence of fibrosis. The skin over the biopsy site is
           numbed and a needle is passed through the skin and rapidly in and out of the liver.
           Patients may be given a sedative for the procedure.

        -  Follow-up visits. Patients return for follow-up visits 1 to 4 weeks after the liver
           biopsy and three more times over the course of the study for a medical history, physical
           examination and blood tests.

      Patients may participate in an additional 4-year follow-up, during which they have visits
      every 3-12 months and are offered the opportunity to repeat the biopsy no sooner than 1 year
      after the first biopsy.

      At present, there are no clear guidelines as to when antiretroviral therapy for human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection should be stopped in the setting of elevated liver
      enzymes. In large part, this is due to a limited understanding of the natural history of
      antiretroviral-related hepatotoxicity. Although several antiretrovirals have been reported to
      cause fatal acute hepatitis, more often they cause an asymptomatic elevation in transaminase
      levels, the optimal management of which is uncertain. This pilot study seeks to create a
      foundation for research on the impact of antiretroviral-induced liver injury by providing an
      estimate of the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis in a cohort of sixty HIV-infected patients who
      have chronically elevated transaminases while on antiretroviral therapy in the absence of
      chronic hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) coinfection. Liver biopsy specimens will be evaluated
      for fibrosis by microscopic examination, the current gold standard for assessing the nature
      and severity of liver disease.[1] The presence of fibrosis, as well as other histopathology,
      will be described using a validated scoring system. Primarily, this will be a crosssectional
      study, but subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in an extended follow-up
      period and undergo another liver biopsy. Individuals will not be excluded on the basis of
      alcohol abuse, insulin resistance, or lipodystrophy, but data will be collected on these
      potentially confounding variables. Noninvasive measures, such as transient elastography (an
      ultrasonic technique), will be assessed for their ability to predict fibrosis in this
      population. Correlations will also be sought with laboratory markers of fibrosis. The
      identification of fibrosis (and its precursors) in association with antiretroviral therapy
      may be very clinically relevant as it may slowly regress with cessation of the causal
      agent(s). If the causal agent is continued, however, cirrhosis may develop, the reversal of
      which is thought to be rare.
