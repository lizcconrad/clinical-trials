      -  In-vitro study

        -  Collect data regarding the color appearance on the new developed indicator strips (NEW
           NORMA-SENSE), in contact with vaginal secretion with elevated pH

        -  Measure the buffering capacity of vaginal secretion from non-symptomatic and symptomatic

      This in-vitro study was designed to collect data regarding the color appearance on the new
      developed indicator strips (NEW NORMA-SENSE) when coming in contact, in-vitro, with vaginal
      secretion with elevated pH, and to measure the buffering capacity of vaginal secretion from
      non-symptomatic subjects and symptomatic subjects, and to detect these indicator strips'
      performance when come in contact with urine.
