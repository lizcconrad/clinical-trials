  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility of the clinical use of
      RMSSH SPECT imaging technology for breast imaging and to develop a standardized clinical
      protocol.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this protocol is to develop and evaluate a novel SPECT imaging technique for
      imaging the breast using rotating multi-segment slant-hole (RMSSH) collimators. The
      motivation is the requirement of a low cost RMSSH collimator and a conventional
      Large-Field-Of-View (LFOV) camera. It is believed that RMSSH SPECT is particularly suitable
      for applications in breast imaging.
