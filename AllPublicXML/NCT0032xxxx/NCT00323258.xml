      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a program to help patients with
      heart disease stay on their heart medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States. For
      patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD), anti-platelet agents, beta-blockers
      and statins have all been shown to improve survival and reduce the frequency of myocardial
      infarction. Yet, previous research by the Duke CERTs has shown that in a population of over
      28,000 patients with documented CAD, only 21% reported consistent use of triple therapy with
      aspirin, beta-blockers and lipid lowering therapy. These results stimulated the Duke CERTs to
      devise an intervention to improve adherence to these life-saving medications.

      Comparisons: Patients admitted to Duke University Hospital or Southeastern Regional Medical
      Center (SRMC) with CAD or CAD plus heart failure who agree to participate, will be randomized
      to an intervention or control arm. The control group will receive usual care, which consists
      of routine discharge counseling performed by the patient-care nurse and a letter/discharge
      summary from the Duke physician to the community physician. In addition to usual care, the
      intervention group will receive focused medication counseling in the hospital by the clinical
      pharmacist-investigator, who will identify and address potential barriers to medication
      adherence and will reinforce the importance of taking evidence-based medications long term.
      Discharge medications will be shared with the community pharmacist. The community pharmacist
      will monitor for problems with adherence and communicate issues back to the patient and the
      patient's care team.

          <description>Patients enrolled in the intervention arm received inpatient education on the importance of medication and assessment of barriers to adherence. A pill box, pocket medication card, and tips for remembering to take medications were provided. The community pharmacist was notified of the subject's enrollment. The community pharmacist was asked to reinforce importance of evidence-based medications and assess the subject's medication adherence every 6 weeks for 6 months. If a problem was noted, the subject's health care team will be notified.
The intervention arm originally contained 71 subjects, 55 completed the 6 month follow-up phone call and 57 had refill records available at 6 months post-discharge. The periods listed here represent the same 6 month period with different numbers of particpants having the phone call or refill records available.</description>
