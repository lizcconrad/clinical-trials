  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RTS,S/AS02A vaccine (or GSK 257049 vaccine), GSK Biologicals' candidate Plasmodium
      falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria vaccine is being developed for the routine immunization of
      infants and children living in malaria endemic areas. The vaccine would offer protection
      against malaria disease due to the parasite P. falciparum. The vaccine would also provide
      protection against infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV).

      This phase IIb trial is being carried out following the demonstration of efficacy of the
      candidate malaria vaccine in children in Mozambique: there, the vaccine demonstrated
      approximately 30% efficacy against clinical episodes of malaria and approximately 58%
      efficacy against severe malaria disease.

      In this study, the children from Mozambique (NCT= NCT00197041) are followed-up to assess the
      safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the candidate malaria vaccine for a two year period
      commencing 21 months after Dose 1.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at year
      2. During this extension study, no new subjects will be recruited and no vaccine will be
      administered.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

    <description>Malaria infection by Plasmodium falciparum was detected by passive case detection. A symptomatic PFMI episode of Primary Case Definition (PCD) was defined as the presence of P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia above 2500 per µL on Giemsa stained thick blood films accompanied by fever (axillary temperature equal or above 37.5 degrees Celsius at the time of presentation) occurring in an unwell child brought for treatment to a healthcare facility. The time to first or only episode of symptomatic PFMI is expressed in terms of rate of first PFMI (RPFMI), that is, the number of PFMI events reported (n) over the period elapsed until the PFMI event occurred (i.e. events per Persons Year at Risk [PYAR]) for each group. Analysis for this outcome was solely performed on Cohort 1 subjects, with groups pooled across age ranges.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This current study NCT00323622, a follow-up (FU) study to the primary study NCT00197041, is aimed at vaccine safety assessment, and took place from Months 21 to 45 (Month 0 = Dose 1 administration of RTS,S/AS02A (GSK 257049) or comparator vaccine in the primary study).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Once re-enrolled, subjects in this study were allocated to the same groups as in the NCT00197041 study, as well as the same cohorts, e. a. Cohorts 1 and 2 whose subjects were followed for analysis of, respectively, malaria infection and disease.</pre_assignment_details>

No additional dose of vaccine or drug was administered during this open follow-up NCT00323622 study.

        <description>Malaria infection by Plasmodium falciparum was detected by passive case detection. A symptomatic PFMI episode of Primary Case Definition (PCD) was defined as the presence of P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia above 2500 per µL on Giemsa stained thick blood films accompanied by fever (axillary temperature equal or above 37.5 degrees Celsius at the time of presentation) occurring in an unwell child brought for treatment to a healthcare facility. The time to first or only episode of symptomatic PFMI is expressed in terms of rate of first PFMI (RPFMI), that is, the number of PFMI events reported (n) over the period elapsed until the PFMI event occurred (i.e. events per Persons Year at Risk [PYAR]) for each group. Analysis for this outcome was solely performed on Cohort 1 subjects, with groups pooled across age ranges.</description>

        <description>PFMI was detected by passive case detection. Symptomatic PFMI of Secondary Case Definition (SCD) 2 was defined as the presence of P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia (any level if parasitemia) on Giemsa stained thick blood films in an unwell child brought for treatment with a history of fever (axillary temperature equal or above 37.5 degrees Celsius) within 24 hours or documented fever. The time to first or only episode of symptomatic PFMI is expressed in terms of rate of first PFMI (RPFMI), that is, the number of PFMI events reported (n) over the period elapsed until the PFMI event occurred (i.e. events per Persons Year at Risk [PYAR]) for each group. Analysis for this outcome was performed on Cohort 1 subjects, with groups pooled across age ranges.</description>

        <title>Number of Primary Case Definition Clinical Episodes of Symptomatic Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria Infection (PFMI)</title>
        <description>PFMI was detected by passive case detection. A symptomatic PFMI episode of Primary Case Definition (PCD) was defined as the presence of P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia above 2500 per µL on Giemsa stained thick blood films accompanied by fever (axillary temperature equal or above 37.5 degrees Celsius at the time of presentation) occurring in an unwell child brought for treatment to a healthcare facility. The number of PFMI episodes (EPFMI) per person-year (pyr) was tabulated, using as unit EPFMI episode per pyr. Analysis for this outcome was performed on Cohort 1 subjects solely, with groups pooled across age ranges.</description>

Subjects in this group are part of the Cohort 2 of the study, which was followed for analysis of malaria disease. As Cohort 2 subjects, subjects in this group also received as part of the Primary NCT00197041 Study one dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine per day for 3 days 4 weeks prior to onset of surveillance, so as to clear any parasitemia. No additional dose of vaccine or drug was administered during this open follow-up NCT00323622 study.</description>
