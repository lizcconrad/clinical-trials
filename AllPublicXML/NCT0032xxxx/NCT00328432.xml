        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  women with a recent diagnosis of T1 or T2 non-invasive breast cancer by large core
             needle or excisional biopsy

          -  confirmation that tissue was processed in methods acceptable to protocol and
             sufficient tissue remains post-diagnostic analyses to perform research assessments

          -  reexcision planned within 10 days to 6 weeks from study start

          -  if on prevention tamoxifen or raloxifene, must have begun administration at least six
             weeks prior to initial biopsy and continue through reexcision

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  no hormone replacement therapy within the 90 days prior to biopsy

          -  if on prevention tamoxifen or raloxifene, must have begun administration at least six
             weeks prior to initial biopsy and continue through reexcision

          -  no evidence of metastatic malignancy of any kind

          -  no history of asthma, allergy ASA, NSAIDS, celecoxib or other COX-2 inhibitors for a
             chronic non-oncological condition with the excision of low dose ASA (160 mg daily)
             during 4 weeks prior to biopsy and for the duration of the study.

          -  no celecoxib or rofecoxib use within one month of biopsy

          -  no history of gastrointestinal ulcer or ulcerative colitis requiring treatment

          -  no current anticoagulants

          -  no neoadjuvant antihormone or chemotherapy as treatment following biopsy prior to
             study entry or concurrently with participation on study

          -  no aromatase inhibitor in the six months prior to participation

          -  no concomitant lithium

          -  no known significant bleeding disorder
