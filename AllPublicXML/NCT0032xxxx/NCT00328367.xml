  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aripiprazole augmentation is safe and
      effective in the treatment of clozapine-treated patients with refractory schizophrenia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clozapine is renowned for its efficacy in treating schizophrenia refractory to typical or
      atypical antipsychotics. Though the effectiveness of clozapine has been established, a
      considerable number of patients with schizophrenia are partially responsive or unresponsive
      to clozapine. In addition, long-term use of clozapine is associated with the development of
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms and metabolic syndrome. In order to overcome these
      short-comings and to increase efficacy, aripiprazole augmentation was implemented.
      Quantitative electroencephalogram will be used to monitor the occurrence of abnormal findings
      and to analyze the changes in electroencephalographic pattern with linear and non-linear
      methodology.

      Refractory Schizophrenia Clinique in Department of Neuropsychiatry at Seoul National
      University Hospital.
