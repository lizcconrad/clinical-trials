  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma surgeons throughout the US have begun using recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa)
      to control severe hemorrhage following injury when traditional measures have failed. Despite
      promising results from several small studies, there remain several unanswered questions
      regarding the use of this relatively expensive product in injured patients including:

        -  The timing of administration

        -  Selection of appropriate patients who are most likely to benefit

        -  The effective dose in injured patients

        -  The potential need for repeated dosing

        -  The need for administration of platelets and correction of acidosis prior to
           administering the first dose

        -  The risks associated with the use of rFVIIa including venous and/or arterial thrombosis

        -  The potential for rFVIIa to cause or aggravate post-injury organ failure and/or
           infectious complications

        -  An analysis of cost versus benefit The purpose of this study is to collect a large
           sample of patients from multiple institutions in order to address the issues listed
           above. To this end, the Western Trauma Association Foundation is sponsoring a
           multi-center case registry for patients receiving rFVIIa for treatment of uncontrolled
           hemorrhage.

      This is a prospective, multi-center case registry that seeks to combine the collective
      experience with the use of rFVIIa at UCSF/SFGH with other trauma centers. The study is being
      conducted under the auspices of the Western Trauma Association and the American Association
      of the Surgery of Trauma. Both organizations have a long history of successfully completing
      multi-center studies. The outcomes to be used in this study are: 1) survival, 2) amount of
      blood products infused before and after rFVIIa, 3) coagulation factors (PTT, INR) before and
      after, and 4) the surgeon's assessment of hemostasis. Data will also be analyzed to determine
      the cost effectiveness of rFVIIa when compared with other methods of treating severe
      hemorrhage, primarily administration of blood products. Finally, the incidence of
      complications and thrombotic events after drug administration will be evaluated.
