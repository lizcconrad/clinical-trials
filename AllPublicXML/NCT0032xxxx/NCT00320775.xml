  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of a
      single intravitreal injection of VEGF Trap in patients with subfoveal choroidal
      neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD.

      This study consists of three parts, Part A, Part B and Part C. Part A is a dose escalation.
      Part B was terminated early. The (one) subject who received Macugen is not discussed in this
      website. Part C had subjects receive one of two doses of VEGF Trap (0.15 mg or 4.0 mg).

      This is the first study in which human subjects received intravitreal injections of VEGF Trap
      in a study eye.

    <description>Part A: An open label study in which six successive cohorts of 3-6 patients each with neovascular AMD will receive a single intravitreal (ITV) injection of 0.05, 0.15, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg of VEGF Trap into the study eye. The total volume of each injection will be 100 μL. Enrollment in new dose levels will not begin until all patients in the preceding dose level have completed Visit 5 (Day 15).</description>

    <description>Part B: A controlled, prospective, randomized, double-masked study in which up to 30 subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single ITV injection of2.0 mg/eye VEGF Trap (or the MTD if reached prior to 2.0 mg) followed by 1 sham injection six weeks later, or an initial dose of 0.3 mg pegaptanib sodium into the study eye, followed by a second dose six weeks later. Enrollment into Part B will begin 2 weeks after the last subject to receive the 2.0 mg/eye dose in Part A has been observed for 15 days and it has been determined that the safety profile of VEGF Trap at this dose level is adequate to support expansion of dosing at this dose level. The dose of pegaptanib sodium will be 0.3 mg, according to the package insert.</description>

Initiation of Part C is contingent upon the 4.0 mg dose being adequately tolerated in Part A.</description>

Part B: Up to 30 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single of 2.0 mg/eye VEGF Trap followed by 1 sham injection six weeks later, or an initial dose of 0.3 mg pegaptanib sodium into the study eye, followed by a second dose six weeks later.
Part C: Approximately 30 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive up to two ITV injections of either 0.15 or 4.0 mg/eye VEGF Trap.
After completion of Visit 8 (Day 57), patients from all parts of the study, may be eligible to continue in Open-label Extension and will receive 4.0 mg of VEGF Trap.</description>
