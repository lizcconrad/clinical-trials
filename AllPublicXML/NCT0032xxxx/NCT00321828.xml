      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab
      may also stop the growth of colon cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving
      combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with bevacizumab works in treating patients with stage IV colon cancer that cannot be removed
      by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of major morbidity in patients with unresectable stage IV colon
           cancer and a synchronous asymptomatic primary tumor treated with fluorouracil,
           leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) in combination with bevacizumab without
           resection of the primary tumor.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of specific events related to the intact primary tumor requiring
           hospitalization or a major intervention but not requiring surgery.

        -  Determine the rate of ≥ grade 3 toxicity as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria
           for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0) that is related to study therapy prior to
           disease progression.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV given concurrently with
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on
      days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years after
      study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Cumulative incidence was used to compute percent probability of morbidity. Cumulative incidence at time t measures the probability of a participant having an event (i.e., Colonic bleeding, perforation, bowel obstruction, or fistula formation requiring surgery or resulting in patient death) over the given duration, t. It involves computing the probability of an event at any observed time (i.e., the number of new cases during a period divided by the number of subjects at risk) and multiplying these successive probabilities by any early computed probability to get the final estimate.</description>

Cumulative incidence at time t measures the probability of a participant having an event (i.e., Colonic bleeding, perforation, bowel obstruction, or fistula formation requiring surgery or resulting in patient death) over the given duration, t. It involves computing the probability of an event at any observed time (i.e., the number of new cases during a period divided by the number of subjects at risk) and multiplying these successive probabilities by any early computed probability to get the final estimate.</description>
