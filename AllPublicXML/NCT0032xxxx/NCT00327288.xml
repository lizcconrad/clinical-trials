    <textblock>
      Protocol AMP-010 is a Phase 1b study of imexon plus docetaxel for patients with previously
      treated breast cancer, previously treated lung cancer or hormone refractory prostate cancer.
      Docetaxel is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a second line therapy for
      these cancers. The imexon is administered on days 1-5 and the docetaxel on day 1 of every 3
      week cycle. The objective of the protocol is to determine the highest dose of imexon which
      can be given with a full dose of docetaxel, and to provide information to enable the design
      of a future study focused on one or more specific cancer types.
