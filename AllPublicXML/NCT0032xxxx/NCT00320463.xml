      In this study, infants will be randomly allocated into three groups:

        -  one group of subjects will receive DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (new formulation)

        -  the second group of subjects will receive DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (current formulation)

        -  the third group of subjects will receive DTPa-HBV-IPV vaccine The study will be
           double-blind for the two groups receiving the DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (new or current
           formulation). The study will be single-blind for the group receiving DTPa-HBV-IPV
           vaccine.

      A study to compare the immunogenicity &amp; safety of 2 formulations of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
      Biologicals' DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine given in healthy infants at 3,4 &amp; 5 months age. The
      immunogenicity &amp; safety of DTPa-HBV-IPV vaccine will also be evaluated in a 3rd group of
      subjects Subjects in the group that will receive DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine (current
      formulation) will be the control group for the group that will receive DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib
      vaccine (new formulation)
