  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the nature of the physiological reasons for the
      decreases in resting blood pressure that can result from systematic practice of
      computer-guided breathing exercises or meditative relaxation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized clinical trial, persons with moderately elevated blood pressure were
      trained in either computer-guided breathing exercises or meditative relaxation to breathing.
      The computer-guided breathing exercise involves listening to tones of ascending and
      descending pitch to which breathing is entrained to low frequencies over a 15 minute
      interval. The meditative relaxation involves passive attention to natural breathing for the
      same duration. Participants will perform these breathing exercises daily at home for four
      weeks. Before and after the intervention, respiratory, cardiovascular, and urinary endogenous
      digitalis-like factors will be systematically recorded to determine the extent to which
      chronic neuroendocrine changes underlie the reductions in blood pressure.

          <title>Device Guided Breathing</title>
          <description>The Device Guided Breathing (DGB) group were instructed to sit comfortably with eyes closed and arms and legs uncrossed. Individual breathing rate was initially determined from an expandable band around the torso connected to a commercially available device (RESPeRATE, Lod, Israel) that presented distinctive tones via earphone. Each subject was instructed to inspire during ascending tones and expire during descending tones, following two training sessions, respiration, blood pressure and breathing parameters were monitored during a 10 min rest period, a 15 min guided breathing task period, and a 10 min recovery period during an experimental session on a subsequent day.</description>

          <title>Control Group</title>
          <description>The Control Group were instructed to sit in the same matter, passively attend to their breathing, and silently repeat 'one' during each exhalation. If thoughts came to mind, they were instructed to calmly refocus attention on breathing. Following two sessions of practice of passive attention to breathing, blood pressure and breathing parameters of each subject were also monitored during a 10 min baseline, 15 min passive attention to breathing and 10 min recovery.</description>
