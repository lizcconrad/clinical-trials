      The trial is a phase II trial in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a rare malignancy with poor
      prognosis. It will provide results leading to the establishment of the effect of the included
      drugs. The regimen consists of cisplatin plus taxotere. Over a period of 1-2 years this
      national trial will include 19-36 patients with advanced ACC from different centres in
      Denmark. Patients not responding to the first line treatment will be switched to the
      alternative regimen. The primary objective of this trial is to investigate response rate.
      Secondary endpoints are survival, time to progression, best overall response rate and
      duration of response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma

          -  Locally advanced or metastatic disease not amenable to radical surgery resection
             (Stage III-IV)

          -  Radiologically measurable disease

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve (neutrophils &gt; 1500/mm3 and platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3)

          -  Effective contraception in pre-menopausal female and male patients

          -  Patient's written informed consent

          -  Ability to comply with the protocol procedures (including availability for follow-up
             visits)

          -  Previous palliative surgery, radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation is acceptable as
             long as radiologically monitorable disease is verifiable afterwards.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior malignancy, except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively in
             situ cervical carcinoma, or other cancers treated with no evidence of disease for at
             least five years.

          -  Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy for adrenocortical carcinoma

          -  Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥2 mg/dl or creatinine clearance ≤ 60 ml/min)

          -  Hepatic insufficiency (serum bilirubin ≥2 x the institutional upper limit of normal
             range and/or serum transaminases ≥ 3 x the institutional upper limit of normal range;
             exception: in patients on mitotane, transaminase levels up to 5 x the institutional
             upper limit of normal range are acceptable)

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any drug included in the treatment protocol

          -  Presence of active infection

          -  Any other severe clinical condition that in the judgment of the local investigator
             would place the patient at undue risk or interfere with the study completion

          -  Current treatment with other experimental drugs and/or previous participation in
             clinical trials with other experimental agents for adrenocortical carcinoma
