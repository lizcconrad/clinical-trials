      The aim of the study is to compare messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of various
      genes in lymphocytes between glaucoma patients and sex and age-matched healthy subjects. A
      secondary objective is to analyze the impact of different forms of glaucoma or of a
      vasospastic propensity on the findings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness world-wide. Chronic primary open-angle glaucoma is
      the most common form among Caucasian patients. The glaucoma patients will be divided into
      four groups: (1) high tension glaucoma, (2) normal tension glaucoma, (3) pseudoexfoliation
      glaucoma, and (4) juvenile glaucoma. Healthy subjects are separated into two age groups.
      Vasospastic propensity will be assessed with a questionnaire: patients and subjects answering
      yes to the questions: &quot;do you have always cold hands, even during summer time?&quot; and &quot;do other
      people tell you that you have cold hands?&quot; will be classified as vasospastic, and as normals
      if they deny a history of cold hands. Blood will be drawn from an arm vein, lymphocytes will
      be isolated and mRNA of following genes will be assessed in these lymphocytes:

      Nuclear proteins: NF-kappa B, XPGC, P53, XIAP; Multi-drug resistance proteins: ABC 1, ABC 8,
      MDR 3; Adhesion protein: ICAM 1; Blood brain barrier breakdown protein: P2Y; Energy
      metabolism proteins: Adrenodoxin, Adrenodoxin-reductase, Cytochrome p450,
      Cytochrome-reductase, Alcohol-dehydrogenase; Tissue remodeling proteins: MMP 9, MMP 8, MMP
      14, TIMP 1, TIMP 2, TIMP 3, TIMP 4.
