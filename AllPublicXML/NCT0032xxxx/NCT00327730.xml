      Acute Musculoskeletal spasm associated with Low-Back Pain.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center trial, which will be conducted in a total of 240 patients (120
      patients in each treatment group). Patients attending the out-patient setting of traumatology
      and orthopedic departments of the study centers will be screened for lumbar pain and spasm by
      clinical and radiological examination for inclusion. In this study, it has been planned to
      enroll a total of 240 patients with 120 patients in each group. The total duration of
      treatment will be 14 days. Patients will be screened for baseline parameters and will then be
      randomized, as per the predetermined randomization schedule, into two groups. Patients will
      be treated with either Eperisone-HCl (Myonal) or placebo for a period of 14 days. After the
      baseline-screening visit (Day 1), the patients would be asked to follow up on day 3, day 7,
      and day 14. During each visit, a complete general examination and clinical evaluation of
      efficacy parameters would be done. Adverse events would be monitored during the study period
      and would be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF). At the end of the treatment, Global
      Assessment of Response to Therapy by Physicians and Patients (PGART) would be done for
      efficacy and tolerability separately.
