  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather data to see if the Laser Cane and/or U-Step Walker
      with laser accessory is more effective in aiding with gait freezing than a regular
      cane/U-Step Walker in patients who have idiopathic Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait is a significant clinical problem in Parkinson's disease (PD). It interferes
      with daily functioning and quality of life and often results in falls that potentially can
      inflict serious injury. In recent years, much more attention has been focused on the clinical
      characteristics of gait freezing, the severity of falls that can result, and the use of
      visual cues as a possible treatment in order to understand the implications of episodic
      freezing. Few clinical studies have been done to confirm the clinical observations to date.
      The laser cane is a device that has been used and prescribed in movement disorder centers as
      the only form of treatment for freezing of gait. Although it has been shown to be effective
      in many cases, there is no published data to support what has been observed in the clinic.
      The proposed study seeks to clarify unanswered questions regarding the laser cane and its
      efficacy in aiding with episodic gait freezing and falls.

    <description>The FOGQ has a minimum of 0 and max of 4 for each question, with 4 representing more severe freezing of gait. There are 6 questions, so the total score ranges from 0 to 24. It was pre-specified that all 26 subjects were treated as a single group with respect to the primary outcome measure regardless of whether or not they had a 1 month or 2 month baseline period.</description>
