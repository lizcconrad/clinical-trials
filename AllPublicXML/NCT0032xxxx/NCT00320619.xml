  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who undergo spine surgery often have a significant loss of blood and may require
      multiple blood transfusions. Research has shown that epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) may
      reduce the amount of blood lost during surgery, which would decrease the number of blood
      transfusions required. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of EACA at
      reducing blood loss and the need for blood transfusions in individuals undergoing spine
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spine surgery is often required to correct a number of diseases, including spondylosis,
      pseudoarthrosis, scoliosis, or other spinal deformities. Spine surgery is often associated
      with significant blood loss and individuals may require multiple blood transfusions during
      and following surgery. Blood transfusions are expensive and carry an increased risk of health
      complications, including fever, allergic reactions, or infections. Preliminary research has
      shown that EACA may be beneficial for individuals undergoing spine surgery. In addition, EACA
      appears to be safer and less expensive than other medications typically used to treat serious
      bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of EACA at
      reducing the number of blood transfusions required during and following spine surgery in
      adults.

      This study will enroll individuals who are undergoing spine surgery at Johns Hopkins
      Hospital. Prior to surgery, participants' demographic data and medical history will be
      collected. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either EACA or placebo
      intravenously during surgery and for 8 hours following surgery in the intensive care unit
      (ICU). While in the hospital, participants will have blood drawn frequently for laboratory
      testing. They will receive blood transfusions as needed and will be closely monitored for
      blood loss and any medical, surgical, or transfusion complications. Outcome measurements
      related to the amount of transfused blood required and postoperative complications will be
      collected on the 8th day following surgery. Study participation will end on the day of
      hospital discharge or the day of a necessary second surgery.
