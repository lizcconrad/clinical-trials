    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Total Score at 104 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BPRS is an 18-item clinician-administered scale used to assess the degree of severity of a subject's general psychopathological symptoms. For this study, the BPRS total score was derived from 18 PANSS questions. To calculate the score, the score of the 18 questions was added then 18 was subtracted from the total. As an example, if a subject had a score=1 (absent) on all 18 items, the resulting total=zero. Responses range from 0 (absent) to 6 (extremely severe); the Total Score range is 0-108.</description>

          -  Patients with uncorrected narrow-angle glaucoma, seizures, uncontrolled diabetes,
             certain diseases of the liver, uncontrolled thyroid condition or other serious or

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heinrich-Carpenter Quality of Life in Schizophrenia Scale (QLS) Total Score at 104 Weeks</title>
        <description>Interviewer-rated scale which measures the impact of negative symptoms on occupational, social, and psychological functioning in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Each of 21 items is rated on a scale from 0 (severely impaired functioning) to 6 (normal or adequate functioning). Total score range is 0-126. Least Squares Mean (LS Mean) values were adjusted for investigator and treatment at baseline, and the change values were also adjusted for baseline.</description>

ITT analysis: analysis of all randomized patients allocated to the randomized treatment even if they did not take assigned treatment, did not receive correct treatment, or otherwise did not follow the protocol.

Domains and scores: general health=5-25; physical functioning=10-30; role-physical=4-8; role-emotional=3-6; social functioning=2-10; bodily pain=2-11; vitality=4-24; mental health=5-30. There are 2 summary scores (mental component summary [MCS] and physical component summary [PCS]). MCS and PCS scores=0-100 (higher scores indicate better health status). LS Mean values were adjusted for investigator and treatment at baseline; change values were also adjusted for baseline.</description>

        <description>Generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. Overall health status is self-reported using a visual analogue scale marked on a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 representing worst imaginable health state and 100 representing best imaginable health state. LS Mean values were adjusted for investigator and treatment at baseline; change values were also adjusted for baseline.</description>

ITT analysis: analysis of all randomized patients with patients allocated to the treatment to which they were randomized even if they did not take assigned treatment, did not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise did not follow the protocol.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Total Score at 104 Weeks</title>
        <description>BPRS is an 18-item clinician-administered scale used to assess the degree of severity of a subject's general psychopathological symptoms. For this study, the BPRS total score was derived from 18 PANSS questions. To calculate the score, the score of the 18 questions was added then 18 was subtracted from the total. As an example, if a subject had a score=1 (absent) on all 18 items, the resulting total=zero. Responses range from 0 (absent) to 6 (extremely severe); the Total Score range is 0-108.</description>
