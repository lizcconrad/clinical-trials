  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a patient decision aid regarding natural
      health products for menopausal symptoms on decisional conflict, knowledge and persistence for
      an option of women aged 45-64 years old. We are expecting a decrease in decisional conflict
      and an improvement on knowledge level. We are also expecting an intention to use the decision
      aid in the future and to discuss with the physician or pharmacist about the use, or the
      intention to use natural health products.

      Health decision making is a process known to be difficult, specially in uncertainty context.
      Because of a lack of evidence, natural health products field remains uncertain. Decision aids
      (or decision support interventions) have been elaborated in the past for several health
      decisions and previous studies showed that they seem to be effective on reducing decisional
      conflict. Following a needs assessment with 40 women and 15 key informants, we developed a
      decision aid tool specific to the context of natural health products for menopause. In this
      study, we will assess its impact on decisional conflict, knowledge, persistence for an
      option, intention to use for a future decision in the same area, and intention to disclose
      use of natural health products to health professionals.

      Comparison: An existing general information brochure on menopause compared to a decision aid
      tool that we developed based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework.
