    <textblock>
      In the study Influvac will be compared to Agrippal, another subunit influenza vaccine that is
      already on the market in China. The main objective of the study is to show that both vaccines
      are comparable with regard to efficacy. In addition, safety and efficacy data with Influvac
      will be assessed in the Chinese population.
