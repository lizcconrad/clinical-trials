      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, treatment extension study evaluating the
      long-term safety and tolerability of encapsulated mesalamine pellets (MP) given QD in

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. An Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved informed consent is
             signed and dated prior to any study-related activities.

          2. Subject has successfully participated in a previous MP clinical study per
             investigator's discretion with successful participation minimally defined as compliant
             with study-related procedures and study drug dosing schedule in the previous study and
             did not discontinue from the previous study due to study drug-related AE(s) or if new
             subjects:

             a. Subject is a male or,

             If the subject is female, she is eligible to enter if she is of:

             Non-childbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who has undergone sterilization [hysterectomy or bilateral tubal
             ligation] or is post-menopausal. For purposes of this study, postmenopausal is defined
             as 1 year without menses); OR,

             Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screen and, if
             heterosexually active, agrees to one of the following:

             i) Double barrier method of contraception, specifically, use of a condom and
             spermicide, for 1 week prior to study drug administration, throughout the 6-month
             Treatment Phase, and the 2-week follow-up phase.

             ii) Oral contraceptives administered for at least 2 monthly cycles prior to study drug
             administration during all 6 months of study drug administration and administered for 1
             monthly cycle following completion of the study.

             iii) An intrauterine device (IUD), inserted by a qualified clinician, with published
             data showing that the lowest expected failure rate is &lt;1% per year (not all IUDs meet
             this criterion).

             iv) Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA) administered for a minimum of 1 monthly
             cycle prior to the study drug administration, during all 6 months of study drug
             administration, and administered for 1 monthly cycle following study completion.
             Norelgestromin/ ethinyl estradiol transdermal system (Ortho Evra patch) administered
             for at least 2 monthly cycles prior to study drug administration and administered for
             2 monthly cycles following study completion v) Partner has undergone vasectomy and
             subject is in a monogamous relationship. The investigator is responsible for
             determining whether the subject has adequate birth control for study participation.

             b. Subject is ≥18 years of age. c. Subject has historically confirmed diagnosis
             (physician letter for newly/recently diagnosed and by medical records for previously
             diagnosed subjects) of mild to moderate UC in remission for &gt;1 month and &lt;12 months.

             d. Confirmed current remission defined as both: A screening rectal bleeding score of 0
             as described in the Disease Activity Index (DAI) (Sutherland Index) where 0 = None A
             screening sigmoidoscopy score of 0 to 1 for mucosal appearance as described in the
             (Sutherland Index where 0 = intact mucosa with preserved or distorted vessels and 1 =
             Erythema, decreased vascular pattern, granularity, no mucosal hemorrhage (see ;
             Appendix 2 for a copy of the entire Index).

          3. Subject and investigator consider there is the potential for benefit to the subject
             with MP treatment.

          4. Subject is capable and willing to comply with all study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has any condition or circumstance that would, in the opinion of the

             results, including history of noncompliance with treatments or visits.

             If a new subject, the following additional exclusion criteria will apply:

          2. Subject has a history of allergy or intolerance to aspirin, mesalamine or other
             salicylates.

          3. Subject has an abnormal clinical lab result which in the opinion of the investigator
             is significant enough to prevent subject's enrollment in the study.

          4. Subject or subject's parents are known to have phenylketonuria.

          5. Subject has participated in an investigational drug or device study within the 30 days
