  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear. Schizophrenia patients reveal positive
      symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive impairments. In addition to dopamine system
      hyperactivity, hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a role in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Consequently, enhancing NMDA receptor neurotransmission has
      been considered as a novel treatment approach. To date, there have been several trials on
      NMDA enhancers reported. For example, sarcosine (N-methylglycine, a glycine transporter I
      inhibitor) showed therapeutic effects not only in chronically stable patients but also in
      acutely exacerbated ones when added-on to antipsychotics. In addition, sarcosine yields
      excellent safety profiles, in comparison to current antipsychotics.

      It remains unclear whether NMDA enhancers, such as sarcosine, can serve as monotherapy for
      schizophrenia. The aims of this project are to examine the efficacy and safety of sarcosine
      monotherapy for acutely-ill schizophrenic patients, and to compare the effects of 2
      grams/day, effective dose, with 1 gram/day, ineffective lower dose.

      In the study, 20 schizophrenic patients are recruited into the 6-week trial and randomly
      assigned into the two groups (1 g/d and 2 g/d) with a double-blind manner. Clinical
      manifestation (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; Scale for the Assessment of Negative
      Symptoms), side effects and quality of life are evaluated every two weeks during the trial.
      The efficacies of two groups are compared, and the characteristics of better responders are
      analyzed.
