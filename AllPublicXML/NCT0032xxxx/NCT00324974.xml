    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of lansoprazole microgranules
      oral suspension, once daily (QD), in infants with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms during a
      4-week treatment period.

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted by approximately 20 investigative sites in the U.S. and Poland.
      Participants who qualify will be randomized in equal proportions to receive either
      lansoprazole Pediatric Suspension (0.2-0.3 mg/kg/day in infants &lt;10 weeks of age or 1.0-1.5
      mg/kg/day in infants &gt;10 weeks of age) or Placebo. This study consists of three periods:
      Pretreatment Period of 7-14 days, Double-Blind Treatment Period of 4 weeks (Dosing), and the
      Post-Treatment Period of 30 days (Follow-Up).

             disease.

          -  Must continue to have reflux symptoms during the Pretreatment Period despite reducing
             or eliminating exposure to tobacco smoke, using one positioning and feeding strategy
             the last 7 days as documented in the Daily Diary.

          -  The infant exhibited crying, fussing, or irritability during or within 1 hour of
