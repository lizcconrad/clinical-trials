  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococci group B (GBS) is a the major reason for morbidity and mortality in neonates. It
      can present as pneumonia ,meningitis or sepsis.The mortality today is 5-20% and even more in
      preterm babies.

      During the past two decade, the introduction of protocols for prophylactic antibiotics for
      women with a high risk for GBS infection, have led to a decline of 65% in GBS cases(0.32 for
      1000 live birth compared to 1.8 cases in 1000).The purpose of the study is to check the
      morbidity and mortality at Sheba medical center in the last 12 years in children with
      positive blood culture for GBS. We assume that in our hospital the morbidity and mortality is
      less then expected. If proven right, we would then check the reasons for that outcome
      considering the type and length of treatment and the different virulence of the
      streptococcus.

      This is a retrospective case control study. We will review from archive the charts of all the
      neonates with positive blood culture for GBS, reviewing the course and severity of their
      illness.
