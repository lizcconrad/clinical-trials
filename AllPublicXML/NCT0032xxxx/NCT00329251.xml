  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an immunization schedule is beneficial to
      HIV-infected patients with CD4 recount over 500 cells/mm3 and undetectable viral load.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As HIV-infected patients are considered immunocompromised, it is generally recommended that
      they have to receipt appropriate vaccines. However data are conflicting concerning potential
      harmful effects following the administration of commercial vaccines in HIV-infected patients.
      Transient increases (“blips”) in the viral load have been described associated with a single
      dose of vaccine, with the potential risk of developing resistance to HAART. On the other
      hand, there has been described that patients with blips can have an increase in HIV-specific
      immune responses, which may help to improve the viral control.

      Comparison: We have performed a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a vaccination
      program in successfully treated HIV-infected adults on HAART compared to placebo.
