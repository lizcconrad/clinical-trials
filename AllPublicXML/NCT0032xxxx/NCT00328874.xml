      Study hypothesis:

      A 6-week p.o treatment with 5 mg/Kg Coenzyme Q10 is safe and tolerable,increases the brain's
      metabolism and ameliorates clinical symptoms in patients with PSP.

      Background and Rationale:

      1. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP, Steele-Richardson-Olszewski Syndrome) is a sporadic
      neurodegenerative disorder resulting clinically in a Parkinson syndrome (i.e. akinetic-rigid
      movement disorder) with prominent postural instability, oculomotor deficits, and cognitive
      decline (for review: Albers and Augood, 2001; Burn and Lees, 2002). With an average annual
      incidence of 5.3 per 100000 and an age-adjusted prevalence of 6.4 per 100000, PSP is as
      common as motor-neuron disease (Burn and Lees, 2002). There is no symptomatic treatment,
      because PSP patients do not respond to any known therapy (Albers and Augood, 2001; Burn and
      Lees, 2002). The progression of PSP is rapid and the median survival after onset of symptoms
      is 5-10 years (Albers and Augood, 2001). Presently, there is no known effective symptomatic
      or neuroprotective therapy for PSP.

      2. Evidence suggests an impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism in PSP (Albers and
      Beal, 2002):

        1. Reduced cerebral glucose and ATP metabolism have been shown in functional imaging
           studies in PSP patients (Forster et al., 1988; Martinelli et al., 2000).

        2. Cybrid cells harboring mitochondrial genes from PSP patients have decreased ATP-levels
           and complex I activity (Swerdlow et al., 2000; Albers et al., 2001; Chirichigno et al.,
           2002).

        3. A tropical PSP-like tauopathy has been linked clinically and experimentally to the
           consumption of the fruit and teas of leaves of the tropical plant annona muricata rich
           in lipophilic complex I inhibitors (Caparros-Lefebvre et al., 1999; 2001). These
           clinical observations suggest a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology of
           PSP.

      3.Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is the physiological electron recipient of complex I. Exogenous CoQ10
      (1.) enhances the electron transport by complex I and (2.) powerfully scavenges free
      radicals. Thus, CoQ10 has been shown to reduce the toxicity of complex I inhibitors in vitro
      (Menke et al., 2003) and in vivo (Beal et al., 1998

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of clinically probable PSP (Litvan et al., 1996).

          -  Early stage PSP [PSP staging system ≤ III (Golbe, 1997)].

          -  Capability and willingness to give written informed consent to participate in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 85 years.

          -  Parkinson syndromes other than PSP (e.g. idiopathic Parkinson's disease, multiple
             system atrophy, diffuse Lewy body disease, FTDP17, symptomatic parkinsonism)

          -  Dementia [Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) ≤ 24]
