  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the benefits and side effects of a new medication called Cinacalcet
      for treating patients with primary hyperparathyroidism associated with multiple endocrine
      neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or type 2A (MEN2A). Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have
      elevated levels of blood calcium caused by too much parathyroid hormone released by one or
      more parathyroid tumors. The parathyroids are small glands located in the neck. Most cases of
      primary hyperparathyroidism are due to a single overactive parathyroid gland, but in MEN1 and
      MEN2A, several glands are overgrown and overactive. Cinacalcet decreases the secretion of
      parathyroid hormone.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with primary hyperparathyroidism and MEN1 or MEN2A and who
      are not candidates for parathyroid surgery may be eligible for this study.

      Participants are admitted to the Clinical Center for 1 week blood and urine tests and imaging
      studies, and initiation of Cinacalcet treatment. They take the drug by mouth and have daily
      blood tests until the dosage required to achieve normal blood calcium levels is determined.
      Patients return to the hospital 2 weeks later for 1 week to evaluate the response to the drug
      and make any necessary adjustments. Treatment may continue for as long as 1 year with 1-week
      admissions every 3 months to monitor the benefits and side effects of Cinacalcet. Evaluations
      may include the following:

        -  Blood and urine analyses.

        -  Measurement of gastric acid secretion. For this test, a soft plastic tube is inserted
           into the nose or mouth and then swallowed and then gently removed about an hour later.

        -  Injections of secretin, calcium and arginine into a vein and collection of blood samples
           to measure the responding increase in levels of gastrin, calcitonin and insulin,
           respectively. These tests are used to diagnose and monitor hormone secretion from
           endocrine tumors and are used in this study to assess the response to Cinacalcet
           treatment.

        -  Radioisotope test to evaluate tumors of the endocrine organs. A radioactive substance
           injected into a vein is taken up by the endocrine tissue and the concentrated
           radioactivity is measured.

        -  Imaging tests, such as MRI and CT, to detect or follow growing tumors in the pituitary,
           neck, and abdomen. CT is a special type of x-ray machine that visualizes tissues, such
           as thyroid or parathyroid tumors. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain
           pictures of different tissues in the head, neck and abdomen.

        -  DEXA scan to assess bone density. This test uses standard low-intensity x-rays.

      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of short- and long-term Cinacalcet in treatment
      of hypercalcemia of familial primary hyperparathyroidism. The study population will include
      patients with primary hyperparathyroidism caused by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 or
      type 2A. This is a prospective unblinded pilot study, where each patient will serve as
      his/her own control. It will include 6 one-week-long admissions, over a 1 year period. Main
      measurements will be tests of hyperparathyroidism such as parathyroid hormone and serum
      calcium as well as tests of nonparathyroid tumors. The latter tests may include hormones
      released by the tumors and images of the tumors.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Criteria for inclusion

          1. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism associated with MEN1 or 2A syndrome and no
             indications for current surgical interventions.

          2. For initial pilot study, 15-20 patients with MEN1 syndrome and biochemical evidence of
             hyperparathyroidism will be included.

          3. For initial pilot study, 5-10 patients with MEN2A syndrome and biochemical evidence of
             hyperparathyroidism will be included. Each MEN2A case must have residual MTC tumor.
