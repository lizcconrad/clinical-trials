  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During their hospitalization, burn patients frequently require dressing changes that may be
      painful. Deep analgesia and sedation are used but carry the risk of remnant somnolence and
      other effects of anesthesia such as dizziness and nausea/vomiting. All these side effects may
      delay refeeding after the procedure, ambulation and physical therapy. Drugs from the opioid
      class are used to relieve pain during these procedures. Morphine with its slow onset and
      remnant sedation is difficult to use in these patients. Pro-emetic properties and histamine
      liberating effects also make this drug non optimal for iterative procedures. Fentanyl, a
      synthetic opioid with shorter onset and lower incidence of nausea and vomiting, is the
      standard drug used in dressing changes in burn patients. It is metabolized by hepatic
      glucoconjugation. Remifentanil, a well known novel opioid, that has a unique metabolism
      independent from renal or hepatic functions, is metabolized by a non specific esterase. It
      has a very short half-life (3.5 minutes) and should therefore be administered as a continuous
      infusion. The investigators hypothesized that the use of remifentanil for daily burn dressing
      changes is associated with less pain during procedures and faster recovery. Studied patients
      will be the ones requiring iterative dressing change procedures under sedation. The primary
      endpoint will be the maximal pain during the procedure. Secondary endpoints will be: average
      pain during and after the procedure; subjective sensation of comfort; total amount of opioids
      received; times to feeding after the procedure and ambulation after the procedure; comfort of
      the procedure according to the nurses; mobilisation according to the physical therapist; and
      safety of the analgesia technique. The study will be conducted according to the
      recommendations of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) that have been endorsed by
      the Canadian Anaesthetists' Society (CAS). All patients who consent will fast for at least 6
      hours before the procedure. The two following regimens will be compared: a bolus infusion of
      fentanyl, starting with 1 µg/kg, followed by 0.5 µg/kg as needed every 5 to 10 minutes versus
      continuous infusion of remifentanil adapted to ensure analgesia. The initial dose of
      remifentanil will be 0.1 µg/kg/min to be adjusted between 0.05 µg/kg/min and 2 µg/kg/min. To
      allow blinding during the study, patients will receive a double-blinded protocol with sham
      (normal saline) in one arm. In other words: for each procedure, the patient will always
      receive boluses, either of fentanyl or saline, and a perfusion, either of remifentanil or
      saline. According to power calculations, 30 patients will be necessary to achieve the primary
      end-points. The investigators plan to enroll 40 patients in the study to allow for some drop
      outs and to increase their statistical power.
