  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be the first to examine whether changes in blood flow patterns within
      the brain account for the possible cognitive benefits of CR. A clearer understanding of this
      possibility may provide key insight into the way CVD affects the brain, help identify
      effective treatments, help a greater number of patients return to work, and improve quality
      of life.

      Based on recent patient referrals, we expect that 30 participants will subsequently enroll in
      CR and 30 will not. CR patients will complete standardized neuropsychological tests (45-60
      minutes) and Transcranial Doppler (30-40 minutes) during their first and last week in the CR
      program. Patients who do not enroll in CR will undergo testing at similar intervals to serve
      as a matched control group. Standard medical records will be collected for participants in
      both groups to obtain demographic and medical information. CR-specific medical records will
      also be collected to obtain information about possible mechanisms for cognitive benefits
      (e.g. improved stress test performance, reduced blood pressure, etc.). All participants will
      be compensated for their time.
