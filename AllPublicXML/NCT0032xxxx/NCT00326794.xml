    <textblock>
      Background: Nonsurgical proximal humerus fracture is common, causing prolonged disability,
      for which the time to begin rehabilitation is not well determined. We assessed the
      feasibility and efficacy of early (within 3 days’after fracture) mobilisation of the shoulder
      compared with conventional 3-week immobilization followed by physiotherapy.

      Methods: We randomly assigned 74 patients with impacted nonsurgically treated proximal
      humerus fracture to receive early passive mobilisation or conventional-treatment. The primary
      outcome was functional assessment of the shoulder (Constant score) at 3 months. Secondary
      outcomes were functional assessment at 6 weeks and at 6 months, change in pain (on a visual
      analogue scale) and passive range of motion.
