    <textblock>
      Inotropic therapy is a well-established practice for children with advanced congestive heart
      failure (CHF). Inotropes are intravenous medications to help the heart pump stronger and
      prolong life while awaiting heart transplantation. Traditionally children have been
      maintained on inotropic therapy in the hospital under close, monitored supervision. The
      United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), which governs organ distribution, has now changed
      listing criteria allowing patients awaiting heart transplantation to be discharged to home,
      yet maintaining a higher status on the waiting list. In adults, home inotropic therapy has
      been shown to be a safe and cost-effective bridge to transplantation. To date, there are no
      data on the use of home inotropic therapy in children.

      Hypothesis:

      We request to do a retrospective chart review of patients receiving this therapy to determine
      safety and efficacy of continuous ambulatory home inotropic therapy in children.

      Hypothesis:

      We request to do a retrospective chart review of patients receiving this therapy to determine
      safety and efficacy of continuous ambulatory home inotropic therapy in children.

      Methods:

      Data will be obtained from CHOA and Coram Home Healthcare, Inc over a two year period,
      January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005. Data will be collected on approximately 35
      children aged 0-18 years receiving therapy. The length of therapy, type of therapy,
      therapy-related complications, number of readmissions, deaths at home and catheter-related
      infections data will be collected.

      Inclusion Criteria:

      Receiving inotropic support at home Choa patients with Coram Healthcare only
