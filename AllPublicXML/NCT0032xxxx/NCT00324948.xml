  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 300 patients with female sexual arousal disorder who meet eligibility criteria
      will be enrolled and randomized to receive either active drug or matching placebo. After a
      two-month, non-treatment period, patients will receive study drug for 6 months and will
      record information about sexual encounters in a daily diary. Study drug will be applied
      directly to the genital area 30-60 minutes before initiation of sexual activity. The endpoint
      of the study is based on the use of a standard measure of sexual function (FSEP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study
      involving about 300 women who are 21-60 years of age inclusive, who have undergone a
      hysterectomy (with or without oophorectomy), and who have a primary diagnosis of FSAD. The
      diagnosis of FSAD will be made based on a medical and sexual history and confirmed using a
      structured interview by trained personnel. Study subjects will undergo a 2-month
      non-treatment run-in period followed by a 6-month period of blinded study therapy. Study drug
      is applied topically to the genitalia 30-60 minutes prior to initiation of sexual activity.
      Study subjects will complete several questionnaires at various times during the study and
      will complete a daily diary. The study endpoint is based on the FSEP and other standard
      questionnaires, as well as safety and tolerability of study drug.
