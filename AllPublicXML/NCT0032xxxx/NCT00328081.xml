  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether care gap(s) exist in the management of obesity
      and its related conditions in obese patients seen by primary care physicians and specialists.
      The study will also look at whether there is a compliance and adherence gap that exists in
      patients prescribed medication for obesity management.

      Obesity currently affects over 15% of the adult population in Canada. The economic burden
      associated with obesity is estimated at $4.3 billion or 2.2% of the total health care costs
      in Canada. Despite increasing recognition as a public health problem, clinical management of
      obese patients in Canada has received little attention. This study will collect information
      on the current status, characteristics and management of subjects with obesity. The design of
      the study will mirror real-life management of these subjects.There are three goals in this
      study: the primary goal is to document appropriate obesity management strategies aimed at
      reducing and maintaining a healthy body weight by participating primary care physicians and
      specialists. The second goal is to explore factors that determine patients compliance and
      adherence to anti-obesity medication when prescribed. Obesity management is currently not a
      priority in tertiary care centres in Canada. An exception being the Bariatric Clinic located
      at McMaster University, which is one of the few academic centers dedicated to obesity
      management in Canada. The primary goal of the Bariatric Clinic Substudy is to evaluate the
      management, compliance and adherence of patients seen at a tertiary care obesity clinic
      compared to those of primary care physicians and specialists.
