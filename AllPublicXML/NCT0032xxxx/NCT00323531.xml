      The null hypothesis is that patients receiving either thoracoscopy or fibrinolysis for
      empyema recover in the same amount of time. Therefore, we will test this by randomizing the
      next 40 patients who consent to the study to one treatment or the other.

      This will be a single institution, prospective, randomized clinical trial involving patients
      who are found to have at least a single septation within a pleural effusion as diagnosed by
      ultrasound or computed tomography. Additionally, patients with a pleural effusion wherein a
      pleural tap reveals pus as defined by many (&gt; 10,000/mm3 ) white blood cells or positive
      cultures will be considered. This is intended to be a definitive study.

      Power calculations based on the known 4.8 post intervention hospital days after VATS and the
      estimated 7 post intervention days after fibrinolysis with Î± = 0.05 and power of 0.8 show the
      need for 18 patients in each arm. We will intend to recruit 40. This sample size was
      constructed in consultation with Dr. Steve Simon, and the range of hospital stay in our
      retrospective experience was utilized. Therefore, this number should represent an adequate
      power in spite of the known varied level of illness.

      One group will undergo thoracoscopy to clean the pleural space and leave a chest tube
      postoperatively to drainage. The other group will undergo chest tube placement with
      subsequent infusion of fibrinolytics to dissolve the thick purulent material allowing
      drainage.

      Both groups will have the same antibiotic regimen with the same management algorithm.
