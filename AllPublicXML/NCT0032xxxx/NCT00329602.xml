    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale Total Score at Week 12 and Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item, participant-reported scale covering different symptoms of the condition. Each item is scored from 0 to 4; 0 represents the absence of a problem and 4 reflects a very severe problem. The best and worst possible scores are 0 and 40, respectively; higher scores represent a greater severity of symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement, and a negative treatment difference indicates a benefit of Ropinirole IR over placebo. The primary assessment was made by calculating the difference in the average score obtained at Baseline with scores at Week 12 and then Week 26.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Augmentation and Early Morning Rebound (EMR) Cases</measure>
    <time_frame>During 15-month study duration at scheduled (Weeks 16, 20, 26, or early withdrawal for DB phase; Weeks 39, 47, 55, 63, 67, or early withdrawal for the OL phase) and unscheduled (26-week DB phase and 40-week OL phase) visits</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically meaningful augmentation and early morning rebound (EMR) were assessed and confirmed by an independent Adjudication Board. EMR describes the development of RLS symptoms during the early morning, following therapeutic intervention. EMR is differentiated from augmentation, in which the earlier onset of symptoms occurs in the evening.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the International RLS (IRLS) Rating Scale Total Score at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, and 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, and 20</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item, participant-reported scale covering different RLS symptoms. Each item is scored from 0 to 4; 0 represents the absence of a problem and 4 reflects a very severe problem. The best and worst possible scores are 0 and 40, respectively; higher scores represent a greater severity of symptoms. The primary assessment from this study was made by calculating the difference in the average score obtained at Baseline with scores at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, and 20. Scores were adjusted for baseline IRLS total score, treatment group, visit, visit by treatment group interaction, and center group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Domains of the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study (MOS-12) Sleep Scale at Weeks 12 and 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS-12 Sleep Scale is a comprehensive battery, which measures specific aspects of sleep in participants that may have varying co-morbidities, and, as a result, is appropriate for a medically diverse participant population. Domain values are presented on a 0-100 scale, where a higher score means a greater degree of the attribute implied by the scale name. Scores were adjusted for baseline MOS sleep scale domain value, treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and center group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Johns Hopkins RLS Quality of Life (RLS QoL) Questionnaire Overall Life Impact Score at Weeks 12 and 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Johns Hopkins RLS QoL Questionnaire is a disease-specific instrument that assesses the impact of RLS on the daily life, emotional well-being, social life, and work life of participants. The overall life impact score for the John Hopkins RLS QoL scale ranges from a lowest possible score of 0 to a highest possible score of 100. Higher scores represent better quality of life. Scores were adjusted for baseline RLS Quality of Life score, treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and center group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Domains of the MOS 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Weeks 12 and 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The MOS SF-36 is a generic QoL instrument measuring functional status and well-being. Positive change from baseline for all domains indicates improvement. For all MOS SF-36 domains, the minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 100, respectively, for the transformed scale. Scores were adjusted for baseline domain score, treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and center group.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Score of Much/Very Much Improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) Scale at Weeks 1, 12 and 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 12 and 26</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a psychometric instrument that is used to measure general clinical status in a variety of disease states. The CGI-I allows the investigator to rate the participant's global improvement or worsening compared with the condition at Baseline (Day 0). The scale is rated from 1-7 (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). Typically, a participant with a score of 1 or 2 (much improved) is considered a responder.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Withdrawing Due to Lack of Efficacy During the First 26 Weeks of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Lack of efficacy is defined as up to a 10% improvement in the IRLS Rating Scale total score from the participant's Baseline value and at least 12 weeks of treatment during the double-blind phase.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Rated as Normal or Borderline Ill on the CGI Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Scale at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S scale is a psychometric instrument that is used to measure general clinical status in a variety of disease states. The CGI-S allows the investigator to rate the severity of the participant's illness considering their total clinical experience with the subject population being studied and on all information available at the time of rating. The scale is rated from 1-7 (1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severly ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants).</description>

    <measure>Median Time to First CGI-I Response of Much/Very Much Improved During the Double-blind Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The median time to first CGI-I response of much/very much improved was calculated. The CGI-I is a psychometric instrument that is used to measure general clinical status in a variety of disease states. The CGI-I allows the investigator to rate the participant's global improvement or worsening compared with the condition at Baseline (Day 0). The scale is rated from 1-7 (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). Typically, a participant with a score of 1 or 2 (much improved) is considered a responder.</description>

        A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:

          1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is post-menopausal); or,

          2. Childbearing potential, has a negative result on all required pregnancy tests prior to
             randomisation, and agrees to an acceptable contraceptive method.

               -  Subjects with a diagnosis of idiopathic RLS using the RLS Diagnostic Clinical
                  Interview and the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) Diagnostic Criteria
                  during the Screening Visit.

               -  Subjects have had RLS symptoms with a history of a minimum of 15 RLS episodes
                  during the previous month. If this is not possible due to the subject being on
                  previous medication to treat RLS the investigator should ensure that the subject
                  should have experienced 4-5 episodes of RLS symptoms during the last 7 days of
                  the wash-out phase (see below). The subject must discontinue and wash-out any
                  previous medication for the treatment of RLS or sleep prior to the Baseline Visit
                  (Day 0). The minimum discontinuation period for wash-out is generally 5
                  half-lives of the medication or 7 consecutive evenings/nights medication-free
                  prior to baseline, whichever is the longer period.

               -  During the Wash-out and Screening Phase, RLS symptoms must be present for at
                  least 4 of the last 7 nights immediately prior to the Baseline Visit (e.g., any
                  combination of evenings and /or nights for = 4 days).

                  clinical judgment and guided by subject response to Question 4 of the IRLS Rating
                  Scale (e.g., ordinarily this will include a response of (3) severe or (4) very
                  severe sleep disturbance) at the Baseline Visit OR RLS symptoms that cause
                  severe/very severe discomfort in the limbs based on clinical judgment and guided
                  by subject response to Question 1 of the IRLS Rating Scale (e.g., this will
                  include a response of (3) severe or (4) very severe discomfort in limbs) at the
                  Baseline Visit (Day 0).

               -  Subjects must be experiencing RLS symptoms requiring treatment at night-time.

               -  Subjects must have given written informed consent prior to any specific study
                  procedures.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects suffering from augmentation and/ or 'end of treatment' rebound RLS symptoms
             at baseline (Day 0). Augmentation is defined as RLS symptoms that occurred while on
             treatment and occur earlier in the afternoon/evening than they did before, symptoms
             which are more severe than when not treated, symptoms which start after less time at
             rest than they did before treatment, or symptoms which involve other parts of the
             body, such as the arms or trunk. 'End of treatment' rebound describes worsening of
             symptoms from baseline that occur after pharmacological treatment is stopped.

             and dystonias).

          -  Subjects who have medical conditions which could affect efficacy assessments or
             clinically significant or unstable medical conditions that present a safety concern.
             These may include, but are not limited to, the following disorders: diabetes,
             peripheral neuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia syndrome, symptomatic

             include the following:

        Atypical and typical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, opioids (including propoxyphene and
        oxycodone), anxiolytics, all sedatives/hypnotics (including benzodiazepines), lithium, oral
        neuroleptics, stimulants (including methylphenidate), dopamine agonists (including
        ropinirole), dopamine antagonists (e.g., typical neuroleptics, metoclopramide),
        levodopa/carbidopa, clonidine, and sedating antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine,

        For subjects entering the 40-week, open-label treatment phase, the GSK Medical Monitor can
        be contacted to discuss individual cases where adherence to the above may not have
        occurred.

          -  Withdrawal, introduction, or change in dose of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
             and/or any drug known to substantially inhibit CYP1A2 (e.g., ciprofloxacin,
             cimetidine, fluvoxamine, HRT) or induce CYP1A2 (e.g., tobacco, omeprazole) within 7
             days prior to enrolment. Subjects already on these agents may be enrolled, but must
             remain on stable doses of the agents from 7 days prior to enrolment through to the
             follow-up visit at the end of the study.

          -  Night workers or any others whose sleeping habits are incompatible with the study

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale Total Score at Week 12 and Week 26</title>
        <description>A 10-item, participant-reported scale covering different symptoms of the condition. Each item is scored from 0 to 4; 0 represents the absence of a problem and 4 reflects a very severe problem. The best and worst possible scores are 0 and 40, respectively; higher scores represent a greater severity of symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement, and a negative treatment difference indicates a benefit of Ropinirole IR over placebo. The primary assessment was made by calculating the difference in the average score obtained at Baseline with scores at Week 12 and then Week 26.</description>

        <description>The MOS-12 Sleep Scale is a comprehensive battery, which measures specific aspects of sleep in participants that may have varying co-morbidities, and, as a result, is appropriate for a medically diverse participant population. Domain values are presented on a 0-100 scale, where a higher score means a greater degree of the attribute implied by the scale name. Scores were adjusted for baseline MOS sleep scale domain value, treatment group, visit, visit by treatment interaction, and center group.</description>

        <description>The CGI-I is a psychometric instrument that is used to measure general clinical status in a variety of disease states. The CGI-I allows the investigator to rate the participant's global improvement or worsening compared with the condition at Baseline (Day 0). The scale is rated from 1-7 (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). Typically, a participant with a score of 1 or 2 (much improved) is considered a responder.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S scale is a psychometric instrument that is used to measure general clinical status in a variety of disease states. The CGI-S allows the investigator to rate the severity of the participant's illness considering their total clinical experience with the subject population being studied and on all information available at the time of rating. The scale is rated from 1-7 (1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severly ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants).</description>

        <title>Median Time to First CGI-I Response of Much/Very Much Improved During the Double-blind Phase</title>
        <description>The median time to first CGI-I response of much/very much improved was calculated. The CGI-I is a psychometric instrument that is used to measure general clinical status in a variety of disease states. The CGI-I allows the investigator to rate the participant's global improvement or worsening compared with the condition at Baseline (Day 0). The scale is rated from 1-7 (1 = very much improved; 7 = very much worse). Typically, a participant with a score of 1 or 2 (much improved) is considered a responder.</description>
