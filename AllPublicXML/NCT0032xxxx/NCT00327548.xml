  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of relaxation, with or without
      guided imagery, for treating children with functional abdominal pain. The study will evaluate
      a child's ability to decrease the amount of pain with these techniques to allow continuation
      of normal daily activities at home and at school. The hypothesis is that these relaxation
      techniques will help decrease reports of abdominal pain and improve levels of activity.
