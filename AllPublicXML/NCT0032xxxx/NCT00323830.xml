      The objective of the trial is to compare disease-free survival between adjuvant
      capecitabine/cisplatin alone vs capecitabine/cisplatin with radiotherapy (chemoradiation) in
      curatively resected gastric cancer patients.

      Although gastrectomy is the only potentially curative treatment in gastric cancer patients,
      the overall survival results remain unsatisfactory. The main factor accounting for high
      mortality rate is the relapse after surgical resection. During the past few decades, the
      principle of combined modality treatment has been developed and applied in practice for
      various solid tumors and gastric cancer has not been an exception. In an attempt to prevent
      recurrence and increase the cure rate of gastric cancer patients after surgery, multiple
      studies using variable modalities have been undertaken. One of the landmark study in adjuvant
      trials was the Intergroup study INT-0116, which reported a significant improvement in
      survival with the use of chemoradiation therapy after gastric resection of stage Ib to IV
      gastric cancers. Thereafter, the chemoradiation therapy has gained popularity and has been
      increasingly recognized as a standard of care in U.S. Nevertheless, the result from INT-0116
      study has been challenged by the fact that the surgical treatment applied in the trial was
      gastrectomy with limited lymph node dissection (D0 or D1) in 90% of cases. Therefore, it is
      debatable whether adjuvant chemoradiation therapy can confer survival benefit in patients
      with extensive lymph node dissection.

      It is still disputable if chemoradiotherapy after D2 can improve the results of D2 alone.
      Thus, the assessment of the effect of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in D2 resected gastric
      cancer is essential.
