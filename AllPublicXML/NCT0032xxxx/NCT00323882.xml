    <textblock>
      Multicenter study in which patients with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer
      (HRPC), who have not had previous chemotherapy or immunotherapy treatments, received MDX-010
      every 3 weeks for 4 doses (12 weeks total duration of induction). MDX-010 was administered at
      escalating dosage levels of 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg/dose infusions. At least 6 patients were to be
      enrolled in each dosage level. Patients who tolerated and responded to treatment or who had
      stable disease for 3 months or longer and who subsequently progressed during the follow up
      phase of the study had the option to receive additional treatment with MDX-010, up to 4
      cycles. Patients were followed in the study for response up to 2 years and were followed for
      survival status for up to 5 years after enrollment.

      <recruitment_details>Study initiated January 2006; Primary endpoint last visit September 2009; follow up period last visit July 2013 with data cut off September 2013. Male patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who met study criteria were enrolled.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>75 participants enrolled and were assigned to treatment; 71 were treated. Reasons for the 4 participants not receiving treatment were not specified by the investigators. Ipilimumab was administered at escalating dosage levels of 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg/dose.</pre_assignment_details>

Those participants with a clinical response of stable disease (SD) or conflicting disease response assessment (CDRA) at the end of the induction period could have received additional treatment up to a total of 16 doses in the maintenance period. The length of time on study for an individual could be up to 2 years. Follow up for survival status was for up to 5 years after enrollment.</description>

In addition, participants received a single dose of 800 rads (8 Gray) of focal radiotherapy (XRT) to each target lesion within 48 hours before the first infusion of ipilimumab during the induction period. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), target or measurable lesions were defined as lesions that could be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT). Those participants with a clinical response of SD or CDRA at the end of induction could have received additional treatment up to a total 16 doses in the maintenance period. Radiotherapy was not administered during maintenance period. The length of time on study for an individual could be up to 2 years.

AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4= Potentially Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death. Related=relationship to study drug reported as certain, probable, possible, or missing. Immune-related AE (irAE) was defined as a clinically significant AE of any organ that is associated with drug exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.

In addition, participants received a single dose of 800 rads (8 Gray) of focal radiotherapy (XRT) to each target lesion within 48 hours before the first infusion of ipilimumab during the induction period. According to RECIST, target or measurable lesions were defined as lesions that could be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT).

          <description>PSA response rate was defined as the number of participants with a PSA response (PR or CR) divided by the total number of PSA evaluable participants. PSA response at Day 85, as reported by the investigator, was defined as a PSA concentration &lt; 50% of the PSA reference value occurring on or before Day 85 and this response was confirmed at least 4 weeks after the first determination. The PSA reference value was the PSA concentration measured immediately prior to treatment. Overall Response is &lt; 50% of the PSA reference value occurring anytime after treatment was initiated and this response was confirmed at least 4 weeks after the first determination. Complete response=PSA concentration &lt; 2 ng/mL, confirmed at least 4 weeks after first value; Partial response=PSA concentration ≤ 50% of PSA reference value, confirmed at least 4 weeks after first determination.</description>

According to RECIST, target or measurable lesions were defined as lesions that could be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT). Those participants with a clinical response of SD or CDRA at the end of induction could have received additional treatment up to a total 16 doses in the maintenance period.

Clinically significant abnormalities could include atrial fibrillation, anterior fascicular block, marked sinus bradycardia, possible lateral infarct, and T-wave abnormality (other potential abnormalities were not excluded from consideration).</description>
