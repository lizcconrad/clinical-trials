    <textblock>
      The goal of this phase I-II clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of
      XRP9881 and capecitabine that can be given in combination in the treatment of metastatic
      breast cancer in patients who have been previously treated by taxanes and anthracyclines. The
      safety and effectiveness of this combination will also be studied. Patients participating in
      the study will be asked to give additional blood samples to look at the level of study drugs
      in the blood.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of breast adenocarcinoma that is now
             metastatic or locally recurrent and inoperable with curative intent.

          -  Prior treatment with a standard regimen of anthracycline and taxane.

          -  Female patients at least 18 years old.

          -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function

          -  Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria
             (For the part I component, patients with non-measurable disease are accepted.)

          -  Resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects

          -  Completion of all prior therapy ≥ 3 weeks prior to registration. Patients on
             bisphosphonate therapy may continue such therapy.

          -  Patients must be either post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective
             contraception.

          -  Willing and able to comply with study procedures and sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any second malignancy within the last 5 years (except adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri).

          -  Patients receiving more than one adjuvant regimen or more than one metastatic regimen

          -  Known brain or leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Concurrent treatment on another clinical trial or with any other cancer therapy
             including chemotherapy, biological therapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy,
             chemoembolization therapy, cryotherapy, targeted non-cytotoxic therapies, or patients
             planning to receive these treatments during the study.

          -  Prior treatment with capecitabine, XRP9881, or any investigational chemotherapy.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to taxanes, Polysorbate-80, or to compounds with similar
             chemical structures. Patients with known intolerance to fluoropyrimidines or patients
             with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.

          -  Concurrent treatment with potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4, or patients
             planning to receive these treatments. For patients who were receiving treatment with
