      The appearance of aged skin is a common cosmetic complaint of middle aged and older
      individuals. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of a new laser with cooling to
      improve the appearance of aged skin. The laser being used will heat various depths of the
      skin while protecting the outer layer.
