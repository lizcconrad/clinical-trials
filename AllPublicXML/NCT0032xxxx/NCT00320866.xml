      Background: Terminal patients are often unable to swallow and need medications to control
      symptoms. In these cases medications are administered continuously and subcutaneously by a
      syringe driver. A syringe driver is an expensive and sophisticated equipment to operate.
      Hypodermoclysis is a useful and easy alternative used in the homecare setting for hydration.

      Objectives:

        1. To assess the level of symptoms control by the administration of morphine,
           metoclopramide and midazolam by hypodermoclysis versus by a syringe driver.

        2. To assess the complications and side effects of infusing these medications continuously
           by hypodermoclysis versus by a syringe driver.

      Methods: Patients in the homecare setting who meet the criteria for parentral infusion and
      suffer: pain, vomit/nausea and/or agitation will be recruited for the study.

      A double blind crossover methodology will be used. Each patient will serve as both
      intervention and control, and both patient and medical staff will be blinded to the
      medication route administration. A research nurse will administer the medications. Crossover
      will take place 48 hours thereafter. A research assistant will conduct evaluation of symptoms
      and side effects for a period of 4 days. A sample size of 27 patients will be included in the
      study (calculated for a significance level of 95% and power of 80%).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in the home care unit that need medication/s continuously subcutaneously with
             symptoms level of 6 or higher on a visual analogue scale (VAS) for that symptom.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients and caregivers that refuse to participate.

          2. Every occasion when the infusion period will be less than 48 hours.

          3. Every occasion when the patient and/or main care giver are not able to provide
             reliable information by the judgment of the medical staff person or research worker.

          4. Patients that will need other medications subcutaneously that are not included in the
             study during their study treatment period.
