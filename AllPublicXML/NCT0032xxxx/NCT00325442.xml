  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study in subjects with PAH who were currently receiving approved therapy for their PAH (i.e.,
      endothelin receptor antagonist and/or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor). Study visits occurred
      at 4 week intervals for 16 weeks; the key measure of efficacy was the 6-minute walk test.
      Study procedures included routine blood tests, medical history, physical exams, disease
      evaluation, and exercise tests. One optional substudy was also a part of FREEDOM-C at select
      centers - a hemodynamic substudy with a right heart catheterization at Baseline and Week 16.

      Patients who completed all assessments for 16-weeks were also eligible to enter an
      open-label, extension phase study (FREEDOM - EXT).

    <measure>Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Placebo corrected change in six minute walk distance (6MWD) from Baseline to Week 16, correlates with the historical clinical standard for assessing patient functional status in the treatment of PAH and is considered an objective measure of patient functional status by the American Thoracic Society (ATS).
The six minute walk test was to be conducted 3 to 6 hours after the previous dose of study drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Borg Dyspnea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg dyspnea score is a 10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea experienced during the 6-minute walk test. The Borg dyspnea score was assessed immediately following the 6-minute walk test. Scores ranged from 0 (for no shortness of breath) to 10 (for greatest shortness of breath ever experienced).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Worsening Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Definition of clinical worsening required one of the following:
Death (all causes excluding accident)
Transplantation or atrial septostomy
Clinical deterioration as defined by:
Hospitalization as a result of PAH, or
≥ 20% decrease in 6-minute walk distance from Baseline (or too ill to walk) and a decrease in WHO functional class And
Initiation of new PAH specific therapy (i.e., ERA, PDE5I, prostacyclin).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea-Fatigue Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The dyspnea-fatigue index has three components, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4, for the magnitude of the task that evokes dyspnea or fatigue, the magnitude of the pace (or effort) with which the task is performed and the associated functional impairment in general activities. The ratings for each component were added to form an aggregate score, which could range from 0, for the worst condition, to 12, for the best.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>World Health Organization Functional Classification for PAH</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Class I: Patients with pulmonary hypertension but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
Class II: Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. These patients are comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope.
Class III: Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
Class IV: Patients with pulmonary hypertension with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may be present even at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Symptoms of PAH From Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Defined symptoms of PAH including fatigue, dyspnea, edema, dizziness, syncope, chest pain, and orthopnea were assessed at Baseline prior to starting study drug and during the Treatment Phase at Week 16. Severity grade values (i.e., 0, 1, 2, or 3 in increasing severity) were assigned for each symptom. The outcome data describes the change in severity values from Baseline to Week 16 for each defined symptom of PAH.</description>

Class III: PH resulting in marked limitation of PA; comfortable at rest; ordinary PA causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
Class IV: PH with inability to carry out any PA without symptoms and signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any PA.</description>

Class II: Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. These patients are comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain or near syncope.
Class III: Patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
Class IV: Patients with pulmonary hypertension with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. These patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may be present even at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.</description>

Severity grade values (i.e., 0, 1, 2, or 3 in increasing severity) were assigned for each symptom. The outcome data describes the change in severity values from Baseline to Week 16 for each defined symptom of PAH.</description>
