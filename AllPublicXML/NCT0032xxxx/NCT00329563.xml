  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of initiating hypothermia in
      cardiac arrest patients as soon as possible in the field. In this pilot study we will
      randomize 125 patients after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) to hypothermia with
      rapid infusion of 2 liters of 4oC Normal Saline IV solution over 20 to 30 minutes, IV
      sedation and muscle paralysis or to standard of care following ROSC. The primary objectives
      of this study will be to determine whether temperature of 33-34oC can be achieved and
      maintained using this strategy. The primary outcome measures will include: temperature
      changes of the patients at time of admission to the hospital. Secondary analysis will include
      determining if the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital is increased in the
      group receiving hypothermia. If this initial pilot study can demonstrate feasibility in
      achieving and maintaining hypothermia, a larger randomized clinical trial to test the
      hypothesis that hypothermia initiation in the field will increase the proportion of patients
      surviving following cardiac arrest will be planned.
