  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively evaluate the utility of enoxaparin vs. oral warfarin in reduction of
      echocardiographic indices of LV mural thrombus. The primary outcome is the presence of LV
      mural thrombus at 3.5 months. The secondary outcome is cost analysis comparing the two arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with anterior Q-wave MIs and ejection fractions&lt;=40% will be enrolled within the
      first 4 days of infarction. Patients will be randomized to receive either enoxaparin 1mg/kg
      (maximum 100mg) subcutaneously every 12 hours for one month or heparin followed by oral
      warfarin for 3 months.

      Clinical and safety evaluations, 2-D echocardiograms at baseline and at 3.5 months and cost
      analysis will be performed.
