    <textblock>
      Open prospective pilot monocentric phase II clinical trial evaluating the therapeutic
      efficacy of a new &quot;Low Dose Bowel Prep&quot; formulation for gut cleansing prior to colonoscopy.

      Thirty patients admitted to the hospital (inpatients) planned to undergo a complete
      colonoscopy will have gut cleansing with the &quot;Low Dose Bowel Prep&quot; using a one-step intake
      mode.
