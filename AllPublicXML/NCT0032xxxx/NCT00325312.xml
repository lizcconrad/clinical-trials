      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate whether patients with acute non specific neck pain
      get pain free sooner, if treated with subcutaneous carbon dioxide insufflations compared to
      sham ultrasound.

    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous carbon dioxide insufflations popular in Central und Eastern Europe are a safe
      and inexpensive treatment modality in complementary medicine and are used mainly in
      musculoskeletal pain and vascular conditions. However, no rigorous trial exists on their
      efficacy.

      The study is designed as a double blind sham controlled randomized trial to evaluate whether
      patients with acute non specific neck pain get pain free sooner, if treated with subcutaneous
      carbon dioxide insufflations compared to sham ultrasound.Since acute non specific neck pain
      is often self limiting, speed of recovery rather than outcome at fixed points in time is
      evaluated.

      Participants receive either a maximum number of 9 subcutaneous carbon dioxide insufflations
      or a maximum number of 9 sham ultrasound administered by 4 therapists in a randomized order,
      thrice weekly. Carbon dioxide gas is insufflated subcutaneously at the locations of neck
      muscle tenderness. Per tender location 25 ml carbon dioxide gas is administered.

      Primary outcome measure is recorded daily by means of a diary. Analysis is done by intention
      to treat. Differences in time curves are tested using the logrank test. Time curves are
      graphically displayed by a 1 minus survival Kaplan-Meier plot.
