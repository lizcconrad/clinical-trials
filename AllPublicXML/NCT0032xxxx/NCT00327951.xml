  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failure to thrive and difficulty gaining weight is a sign of uncompensated congestive heart
      failure (CHF). Infants with Trisomy 21 and complete atrioventricular canal defects (CAVC)
      frequently develop uncompensated CHF and weight gain failure pre-operatively. A weight of 5
      kg has been suggested as optimal for timing of CAVC repair. A delay in surgical repair often
      occurs if weight gain stalls and reaches a plateau prior to reaching 5 kg. A retrospective
      review performed by Kogon, et al, of children undergoing surgery for VSD at CHOA at Egleston
      recently reported that age and weight at surgery may not, however, be associated with adverse
      surgical outcome.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal timing for surgical correction of CAVC
      in Trisomy 21 infants based on reaching a plateau of failed weight gain despite maximal
      anti-congestive and nutritional therapy.

      A retrospective chart review of 100 infants with Trisomy 21 and CAVC operated at CHOA at
      Egleston between January 1, 2001 and March 24, 2006 will be performed. Graphs of birth weight
      and rate of weight gain over time will be plotted for each patient and for the group as a
      whole. The point of reaching a plateau of weight gain will be decided for each patient and
      indexed for birth weight. Medical management will be detailed, i.e. all medications and all
      dietary information (caloric density of formula, route of administration). This medical
      management will be indexed as a function on the weight gain chart. Medical complications
      (such as respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, hospitalizations, and additional
      non-cardiac medications) will likewise be plotted and segmented according to position
      relative to the weight gain plateau. Age at eventual surgery and whether surgical date was
      delayed by complications will be noted. Surgical cardiopulmonary bypass time and morbidity
      and mortality will be noted. Postoperative length of ventilator support, length of stay in
      the CICU and total length of stay will be determined and also displayed as a function of body
      weight and as a function of time at plateau weight. Postoperative morbidity and mortality for
      the three months after repair will be noted, including all cause hospital re-admissions and
      outpatient medical complications (such as respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and the
      need for continued medications for CHF).
