  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study (EGF104911) is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapatinib in
      patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Eligible subjects must have ErbB2
      overexpressing tumors and are refractory to treatment with anthracycline, taxanes and
      trastuzumab containing regimens. The study data obtained from EGF104911 will be combined with
      the data from EGF100642 and integrated analysis will be carried out in order to enhance the
      credibility of the study results.

        <description>Tumor response was measured as the number of participants achieving either a complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR; 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions) among all participants who received study treatment. Tumor response was evaluated as the best response in accordance with response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). Progressive disease: a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Stable disease: small changes that do not meet the above-mentioned criteria.</description>

          <description>Intra-tumoral expression levels of ErbB4, a tumor tissue biomarker, were measured using immunohistochemistry methods that incorporated both intensity and distribution of staining. A value designated the H score was derived by summing the percentages of cells staining at each intensity multiplied by the weighted intensity of staining (0, 1+, 2+, 3+: 3+ indicates the strongest staining, 2+ indicates medium staining, 1+ indicates weak staining, and 0 indicates no staining). Minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 300; the maximum score indicates the strongest expression.</description>
