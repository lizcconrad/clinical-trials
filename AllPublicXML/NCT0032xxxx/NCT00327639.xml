  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with beta thalassemia in North America has altered dramatically during
      the past 40 years, with improvements in transfusion therapy and introduction of iron
      chelation therapy. Thalassemia patients now enjoy an increased life expectancy to the fifth
      and sixth decades of life, with fertility and childbearing becoming important issues. Data
      regarding this important topic remain limited, without clear data regarding iron control
      including serial assessment of hepatic iron concentration, the need for assistance in
      becoming pregnant, and use of iron chelating agents during pregnancy. As the life expectancy
      increases and overall health improves in thalassemia, clear data on fertility, pregnancy
      complications, and the effect of pregnancy on maternal health in thalassemia patients are
      necessary since these will have a direct impact on patient care, quality of life, and patient
      expectations.
