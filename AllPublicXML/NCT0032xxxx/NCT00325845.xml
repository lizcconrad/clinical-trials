  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      viscosupplementation in treating symptomatic lumbar facet joint arthropathy. The intended use
      of the device (Synvisc) is to alleviate pain and improve function in patients with painful
      lumbar facet joint arthrosis by intra-articular injection into the involved joint.

      Patients will enter the study once the putatively painful joint or joints have been confirmed
      by single blind, double local-comparative anesthetic blockade. The joint(s) suspected by
      historical features and physical examination will be injected under fluoroscopic guidance
      with contrast-enhancement confirming intra-articular placement. The initial injectate will be
      1cc of 2% xylocaine. Single diagnostic lumbar facet joint injections carry a false positive
      rate of 38%. In order to maximize the specificity of the diagnostic injections a second 1cc
      injection of a longer-acting local anesthetic, 0.5% marcaine, will be performed on all
      patients reporting clinically significant pain reduction (&gt; 75% VAS reduction from
      pre-injection baseline) within 10-15 minutes after the xylocaine injection. This second
      diagnostic injection will be completed upon return of the patient’s pain back to baseline (no
      sooner than 3 days after the initial diagnostic injection). A true positive response will be
      defined as &gt; 50% VAS reduction after the second injection. Patients will then undergo 2 IA
      Synvisc injections into the painful facet joint(s). An initial IA injection of 1.0cc (or a
      volume, not to exceed 1.0cc, accepted by the joint upon reaching a capsular endpoint) of
      Synvisc (1cc, 10mg/ml) will be injected into the painful joint(s) 7 days after the second
      diagnostic injection after the baseline pain has returned. A 2nd injection will then be
      performed 10 days after the initial injection. A 3rd injection may be offered to patients not
      satisfied with the results obtained with the first 2 Synvisc injections. A 2.0cc vial of
      Synvisc per patient will be shipped including other trial materials to the investigator for
      implementation. A fluid dispenser connector will allow direct dispensation of 1.0cc of
      Synvisc from the pre-packaged 2.0cc unmarked vial. Outcome measurement tools will include
      Visual Analogue Scale, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, SF-36, lumbar spine range of motion
      (ROM), sitting and walking tolerance, analgesic usage, and patient satisfaction. Data will be
      collected at baseline, at 7-10 days after the second Synvisc injection, and at 1, 3, 6, and
      12 month follow up (after the final Synvisc injection) visits. For example, patient X will
      undergo an initial 2 Synvisc injections and then be evaluated in the office 7 days later. If
      the patient experiences significant benefit, no other injections will be pursued. However, if
      a therapeutic benefit is achieved but is not satisfactory to the patient, a 3rd Synvisc
      injection will be performed within 3 days. A side effect and complications questionnaire will
      be completed by each patient within 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 72 hours after each injection
      (including diagnostic injections).
