  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol on
      lumbar spine (L1-L4) and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) in pediatric subjects with
      anorexia nervosa.

      Although oral contraceptives are prescribed in an effort to prevent bone loss in adolescents
      with anorexia nervosa, there have been no previous definitive placebo-controlled studies
      evaluating the effectiveness of oral contraceptive treatment on bone mineral density in
      pediatric females with anorexia nervosa. This is a randomized (patients are assigned
      different treatments based on chance), multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the
      physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage),
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the bone mineral density in pediatric patients with
      anorexia nervosa following treatment with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol or placebo for 13
      consecutive 28-day cycles. Norgestimate/Ethinyl Estradiol is packaged in a 28-day
      blistercard. Each tablet contains the following:

      a) Days 1-7 0.180 mg norgestimate/0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol b) Days 8-14 0.215 mg
      norgestimate/0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol c) Days 15-21 0.250 mg norgestimate/0.035 mg ethinyl
      estradiol d) Days 22-28 inactive tablets;One tablet is to be taken once daily by mouth. After
      28 days, the next cycle is started the following day without interruption. Color-matched
      placebo tablets are identically pack
