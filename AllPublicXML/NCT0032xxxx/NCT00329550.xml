  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label extension study in subjects who showed clinical response
      to induction therapy in the treatment of subjects with active Crohn's disease in the
      double-blind main study C87037 (NCT00291668).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the double-blind main study subjects were dosed at Weeks 0, 2 and 4, with the primary
      outcome, clinical response, being assessed at Week 6. Subjects who showed clinical response
      at Week 6 were eligible to enter this open-label extension study. The first visit in this
      extension study was 2 weeks after Week 6, i.e., Week 8. Subjects in this extension study were
      dosed at Weeks 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, with the primary outcome, clinical response, being
      assessed at Week 26. All week numbers quoted are relative to the start of the double-blind
      main study.

        <title>Percentage of Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Responders at Week 26</title>
        <description>CDAI responders are subjects achieving either clinical response (a reduction in CDAI score of ≥100 points from Week 0), or remission (CDAI ≤150). CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn’s disease. A score of 150 or below indicates remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease.</description>

If a subject withdrew or received rescue therapy, they were counted as a non-responder in that study from that time-point onwards.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Responders at Last Visit [Week 26 for Completers or the Withdrawal Visit for Premature Withdrawals]</title>
        <description>CDAI responders are subjects achieving either clinical response (a reduction in CDAI score of ≥100 points from Week 0), or remission (CDAI ≤150). CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn’s disease. A score of 150 or below indicates remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 0 and Last Visit (Week 26 relative to the start of the 6-week double-blind main study (NCT00291668) for completers or the Withdrawal Visit for premature withdrawals). 'Week 26' is 18 weeks after the first visit in this extension study.</time_frame>
        <population>Responders at Week 6 of double-blind main study, C87037 (NCT00291668) could enter this open-label extension study, C87047 (NCT00329550). All 39 subjects in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) were included in this summary. If a subject withdrew or received rescue therapy, they were counted as a non-responder in that study from that time-point onwards.</population>

          <description>Time to disease progression is defined as the earliest of:
time to an increase from Week 6 of ≥100 points in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score and CDAI &gt;175 points for at least 2 consecutive visits,
time to use of rescue therapy, or,
time to subject withdrawal from the study.</description>

As so few subjects experienced disease progression in this study it was not possible to calculate the median time to disease progression.

        <title>Number of Subjects With Disease Progression</title>
        <description>Disease progression is defined as:
an increase from Week 6 of ≥100 points in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score and CDAI &gt;175 points for at least 2 consecutive visits,
use of rescue therapy, or,
subject withdrawal from the study.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 6 to Week 26 (relative to the start of the 6-week double-blind main study (NCT00291668)). 'Week 6' is the last visit in the double-blind main study and 'Week 26' is 18 weeks after the first visit in this extension study.</time_frame>
        <population>Responders at Week 6 of Study C87037 (NCT00291668) could enter this extension study, C87047 (NCT00329550). As it was not possible to calculate the time to disease progression (outcome measure 22) due to the very small number of subjects meeting this definition, the post-hoc outcome of number of subjects with disease progression is presented here.</population>
