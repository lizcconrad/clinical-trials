  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether patients who are likely to fail R-CHOP, as
      predicted by a mid-treatment PET scan, can have an improved outcome if switched to a standard
      salvage regimen R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide).

      Patients who have a negative PET scan after 4 cycles of R-CHOP have an excellent prognosis
      (&gt;85% chance of cure) and should complete treatment with 6 cycles of standard R-CHOP.
      Patients who have a positive PET scan after 4 cycles of R-CHOP have a very poor prognosis
      (~10% chance of cure) and may have an improved outcome if switched to a non-cross resistant
      chemotherapy combination R-ICE.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial investigating tailoring first-line therapy for advanced stage
      diffuse large B-cell NHL (DLBCL) based on a mid-treatment 18F-FDG- positron-emission
      tomography (PET) scan result. More than half of all patients with DLBCL can be cured with 6-8
      cycles of standard R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,
      prednisone). Patients who are not cured with R-CHOP have a very poor prognosis. This study
      will assess whether patients who are likely to fail R-CHOP, as predicted by a mid-treatment
      PET scan, can have an improved outcome if switched to a standard salvage regimen R-ICE
      (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide).

      Objectives:

        -  To assess the efficacy of tailoring first-line therapy based on a mid- treatment PET
           scan result for patients with advanced stage DLBCL.

        -  To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage DLBCL who
           have a negative mid-treatment PET scan and receive standard therapy with six cycles of
           CHOP-R and patients with a positive mid-treatment PET scan who receive four cycles of
           CHOP-R followed by four cycles of R-ICE chemotherapy.

        -  To assess the overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced stage DLBCL who have a
           negative mid-treatment PET scan and receive standard therapy with six cycles of CHOP-R
           and patients with a positive mid-treatment PET scan who receive four cycles of CHOP-R
           followed by four cycles of R-ICE chemotherapy.

Progression-free survival is defined as the duration of time from diagnosis to time of disease progression or death from any cause. Living patients who have remained free of progression will have their PFS censored on the date last known alive.</description>

Overall survival will be defined as the time from diagnosis to the date of death. If the participant is lost to follow-up, survival will be censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive.</description>

    <description>A central pathology review of original diagnostic biopsies will be performed by pathologists at the Coordinating Center to ensure appropriate lymphoma subclassification. This centralized review is not required prior to enrollment, provided the patients biopsy has been carefully reviewed by local pathologists and determined to be DLBCL.
Correlative studies of biologic markers will be performed on cases with adequately preserved tissue to explore the biologic heterogeneity between patients and to investigate determinants of response to therapy.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive 4 cycles of standard dose R-CHOP chemotherapy administered at 3-weekly intervals. Non-progressing participants will undergo a mid-treatment PET scan along with routine restaging investigations after 4 cycles of R-CHOP. Patients with a negative mid-treatment PET scan (no evidence of abnormal 18F-FDG uptake) will complete therapy with two additional cycles of R-CHOP for a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Patients with a mid-treatment PET scan interpreted to be &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;equivocal&quot; will be recorded as such, but should be considered negative for the purpose of treatment planning and should not prompt a change in therapy.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive 4 cycles of standard dose R-CHOP chemotherapy administered at 3-weekly intervals. Non-progressing participants will undergo a mid-treatment PET scan along with routine restaging investigations after 4 cycles of R-CHOP. Patients with a mid-treatment PET scan (abnormal 18F-FDG uptake) will be switched to R-ICE chemotherapy and receive 4 cycles of R-ICE for a total of 8 cycles of chemotherapy.
Following completion of R-ICE chemotherapy, patients will undergo a post-treatment PET scan along with routine restaging investigations. The post-treatment PET scan will be performed between days 28 and 35 following the final cycle of R-ICE. Patients with a negative post-treatment PET scan will undergo no further therapy. Patients with a positive post-treatment PET scan corresponding to persistent abnormalities on CT scan will be considered for radiation therapy to PET positive sites.</description>
