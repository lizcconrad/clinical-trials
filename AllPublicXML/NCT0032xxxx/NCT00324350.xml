  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ACCORD-BONE Study is to investigate the effects of intensive glycemic
      control for type 2 diabetes (in ACCORD participants) on factors related to bone health,
      including, fractures, falls, and bone mineral density.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have established that type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for fractures,
      particularly of the hip, shoulder and foot. Additionally, type 2 diabetes is associated with
      a 50-60% increase in the risk of falling. The higher risk of fracture associated with type 2
      diabetes is an important health burden for these patients. More frequent falls and perhaps
      reduced bone strength in those with diabetes are thought to be key contributing factors. The
      best approach to preventing fractures in type 2 diabetes is not yet understood. There is
      observational evidence to support our hypothesis that better glycemic control will preserve
      bone and reduce falls and fractures. The ACCORD-BONE study provides a unique opportunity to
      determine whether intensive glycemic control will prevent fractures, falls, and bone loss in
      older diabetic adults, which may lead to improved treatment and prevention in the future.

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Non-vertebral Fracture</measure>
    <time_frame>Average follow-up of 3.8 years</time_frame>
    <description>The BONE ancillary study was initiated during recruitment for the main ACCORD trial. Beginning in January 2006, at the next annual visit participants were asked about the occurrence of any non-spine fractures since randomization. After the annual visit in 2006, participants were asked if they had suffered a fracture since their last annual visit. Reported fracture events were centrally adjudicated, based on radiology records, at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with the adjudicators blinded to treatment assignment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least One Fall</measure>
    <time_frame>Average follow-up of 2.0 years</time_frame>
    <description>At each annual visit starting in January 2006, participants were also asked about falling: &quot;In the last 12 months have you fallen and landed on the floor or ground, OR fallen and hit an object like a table or stair?&quot; Those who answered &quot;yes&quot; were also asked how many times they had fallen in the previous 12 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With &gt; 2 cm of Height Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Standing height was measured according to a standard protocol at baseline and annual visits on all ACCORD participants. Height loss was compared by treatment assignment using linear mixed models with random intercepts and slopes. Treatment effects were captured by the interaction between treatment assignment and time. The proportions losing &gt;2 cm of height during follow-up were compared using logistic models. This degree of height loss is associated with incident vertebral fracture with 94% specificity but only 28% sensitivity</description>

      <recruitment_details>The ACCORD trial has been described previously (Buse JB,et al. Am J Cardiol 99:21i-33i, 2007). Five of the 7 clinical center networks agreed to participate in the BONE ancillary study, including 54 of 77 clinical sites and 7,287 participants. The BONE ancillary study was initiated during the main recruitment for ACCORD (beginning in 2006).</recruitment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With at Least One Non-vertebral Fracture</title>
        <description>The BONE ancillary study was initiated during recruitment for the main ACCORD trial. Beginning in January 2006, at the next annual visit participants were asked about the occurrence of any non-spine fractures since randomization. After the annual visit in 2006, participants were asked if they had suffered a fracture since their last annual visit. Reported fracture events were centrally adjudicated, based on radiology records, at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with the adjudicators blinded to treatment assignment.</description>
        <time_frame>Average follow-up of 3.8 years</time_frame>
        <population>As per protocol, pathological fractures, confirmed as occurring secondary to neoplasm, necrosis, or sepsis, and periprosthetic fractures were excluded (N=7). These analyses are limited to confirmed fractures that occurred on or before Feb 5, 2008, when the intensive glycemia intervention was ended.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With &gt; 2 cm of Height Loss</title>
        <description>Standing height was measured according to a standard protocol at baseline and annual visits on all ACCORD participants. Height loss was compared by treatment assignment using linear mixed models with random intercepts and slopes. Treatment effects were captured by the interaction between treatment assignment and time. The proportions losing &gt;2 cm of height during follow-up were compared using logistic models. This degree of height loss is associated with incident vertebral fracture with 94% specificity but only 28% sensitivity</description>
