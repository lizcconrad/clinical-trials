  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to assess the accuracy of a new means of estimating urine sodium excretion. We will
      compare the chloride to creatinine ratio obtained by titrator sticks with urine sodium
      measured by a standard laboratory. If found to approximate sodium excretion, the titrator
      sticks could provide a convenient means for doctors and patients to monitor their salt
      intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Level of salt intake has an important impact in patients with high blood pressure or
      congestive heart failure. Despite this there is no convenient way for doctors or patients to
      assess their salt intake other than diet recall, which is unreliable, or measurement of
      sodium excretion in a 24 hour collection of urine, which is very inconvenient. As a result,
      salt intake is not monitored in most patients.

      2 innovations might enable a more convenient assessment of salt intake. A titrator stick that
      measures chloride ion concentration (chloride and sodium concentrations correlate strongly
      with each other), and a titrator stick that measures urine creatinine. The latter enables
      estimation of 24 hour excretion from a single sample of urine. In assessing sodium intake, a
      measurement that provides an approximation of urine sodium intake would be of considerable
      clinical value

      In this study, we shall compare the estimation of urine sodium excretion measured by a
      laboratory with estimation of sodium excretion from measurement of chloride/creatinine ration
      in a random urine sample. We will compare the estimate obtained by titrator stick with the
      sodium concentration from the same urine sample, and from measurements obtained from a 24
      hour urine collection. In the next phase we will also compare the average estimate from
      titrator stick obtained on 3 different days with the measurement obtained from 3 24 hour
      urine collections.

      We will assess the accuracy with which the titrator stick estimate approximates the measured
      urine sodium.

      As of March 2007, we have recruited 50 subjects, and continue to study the predictive value
      of spot urine chloride/creatinine ratio, as described.
