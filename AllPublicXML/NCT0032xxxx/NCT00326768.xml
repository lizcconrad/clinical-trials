  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of 52 weeks of open-label
      treatment with the fixed dose combination of telmisartan 80 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg and
      telmisartan 40 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg in patients with essential hypertension.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre study with three centres participating with a target of 30 to 90
      patients entering the maintenance period and 20-60 patients completing long-term treatment
      per centre. The recruitment period will be about three months from the start of the study.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the long-term safety of a fixed dose
      combination of telmisartan/HCTZ fixed-dose combination treatment. This study has no control
      group; therefore, no hypothesis testing will be performed.

      Comparison(s):

      This study has no control group.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        1. Essential hypertensive patients who meet the following criteria:

               -  In case of using any antihypertensives, mean seated DBP* must be over 90 and
                  under 114 mmHg at Visit 1

               -  In case of not using any antihypertensives, mean seated DBP* must be over 95 and
                  under 114 mmHg at Visit 1

               -  Mean seated DBP* must be over 90 at Visit 2 (* The mean DBP values will be
                  calculated as the average of three seated measurements taken at two-minute
                  intervals).

          2. Age over 20 and under 80 years at Visit 1 (Male or Female)
