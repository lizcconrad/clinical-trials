  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing pre-admission administration of routine oral
      preoperative non-narcotic analgesics with the administration of these medications in the
      pre-anesthesia care unit per our standard practice. Patients will be screened, enrolled,
      consented, and randomized during the preoperative office encounter, typically occurring
      within the 30 days prior to surgery. Patients randomized to pre-admission administration
      (study group) will be provided with a prescription for a one-time dosing of routine oral
      non-narcotic analgesic medications to be filled at the Cleveland Clinic outpatient pharmacy.
      Both the study and the control groups will receive written pre-operative instructions. Those
      patients randomized to the standard practice of administration in the pre-anesthesia unit
      (control group) will be administered the same medications in the same doses by the nursing
      staff.

      Patients in both groups will undergo general anesthesia, orogastric tube placement, and
      minimally invasive hysterectomy (MIH). Post-operatively, patient pain will be assessed via
      NRS at standard intervals and treated with narcotics. Amount of total intravenous (IV) and
      oral (PO) narcotics given during PACU stay will be documented in the medication
      administration record (MAR) within the electronic medical record (EMR) and later converted
      into oral morphine equivalents (OME). Pain will be assessed via NRS on discharge and
      documented.

      Patients will be emailed on POD10 a survey to rate their satisfaction with their medication
      administration regimen on a 5-point Likert scale. Participants will also be asked to complete
      a thirteen-point surgical recovery scale (SRS) to evaluate their functional recovery from
      MIH.

      Patient participation will conclude after completion of the patient satisfaction survey and
      SRS. A maximum of 58 patients will be enrolled into the study, as we aim to randomize 26
      patients to each arm.
