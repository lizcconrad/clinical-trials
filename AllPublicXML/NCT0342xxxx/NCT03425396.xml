    <measure>Investigator's assessment of clinical response at Post Treatment Evaluation (PTE) based on microbiological response.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success is defined as sufficient resolution of cystitis signs and symptoms such that no additional antibacterial therapy is required for the current infection. Clinical response will be determined by the judgement of the investigator at the subject's post-treatment evaluation and will be based on the following factors:
Microbiological Response: The subjects will present a urine sample at each visit and pathogen load will be measured via urine culture and urine dipstick analysis. Investigators will examine the results of these tests across all visits and will measure clinical success as a significant reduction in pathogen load such that the subjects do not require additional antibacterial therapy at the end of their 14-day time frame. All of these factors will be aggregated into the clinician's assessment of the subject.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator's assessment of clinical response at Post Treatment Evaluation (PTE) based on subject's report of UTI signs and symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will record her assessment of UTI signs and symptoms severity using the UTI Symptoms Assessment questionnaire (UTISA) during each visit. The UTISA is a 14-item instrument asking about the severity and bothersomeness of seven key uUTI symptoms, and applies a 4-point scale: No Symptoms, Mild, Moderate, Severe. The investigator will review each subject's responses and decide at the end of their treatment if there is sufficient resolution of UTI signs and symptoms.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator's assessment of clinical response at Post Treatment Evaluation (PTE) based on subject's report of health and adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will interview the subjects at each visit to ask questions about their general health, how they feel, and to report on any adverse events they may be experiencing. Investigators will factor in adverse event reports to their decision on each subject's clinical outcome at the end of their 14-day time frame.</description>
