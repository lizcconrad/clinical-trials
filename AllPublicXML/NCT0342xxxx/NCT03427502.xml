  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative agitation is an important complication of general anesthesia, moreover, it has
      been found with high incidence in ear, nose, throat (ENT) surgeries. We aim to study whether
      anterior ethmoidal nerve block will be successful in reducing postoperative agitation in
      those patients. Study population will be randomized into two groups, treatment and control
      group. Anterior ethmoidal nerve block will be done in treatment group and postoperative
      agitation compared between these two groups. Agitation score will be scored with Riker
      Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS).

      Ho: Occurrence of post-operative agitation in patients undergoing nasal surgery with nasal
      pack under general anesthesia is equal in those with ethmoidal nerve block as compared to
      those without the block.

      Ha: Occurrence of post-operative agitation in patients undergoing nasal surgery with nasal
      pack under general anesthesia is not equal in those with ethmoidal nerve block as compared to
      those without the block.

It is a Likert scale with scores from 1 to 7 where 1 indicates unarousable (Minimal or no response to noxious stimuli, does not communicate or follow commands) and 7 indicates Dangerous agitation (Pulling at ET tube, trying to remove catheters, climbing over bedrail, striking at staff, thrashing side-to-side). A higher value indicates worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Experimental: Study Group At the end of surgery before nasal packing, scrub nurse will prepare 10 ml solution 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:2,00,000 adrenaline in a syringe and pass it over to the operating surgeon. The surgeon will block anterior ethmoidal nerve.
Injection technique: External nasal nerve will be blocked through an inter-cartilaginous injection into the dorsum of the nose.
Internal nasal nerve will be blocked in septum and lateral wall of nose. Septal block is done in upper anterior part of nasal septum. Three injections will be given on lateral nasal wall. First injection will be given just antero-superior to the attachment of middle turbinate (axilla). Second injection will be given at the anterior end of middle turbinate and third injection at the medial surface of middle turbinate. Withdrawal of injection will be done prior to deposition of solution every time to ensure that the solution is not deposited directly into a blood vessel.</description>
