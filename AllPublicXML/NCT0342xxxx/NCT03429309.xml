    <textblock>
      Telomeres are protein-bound DNA repeat structures at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes that
      are made up of a simple repetitive sequence (in humans, TTAGGG) and regulate cellular
      replicative capacity and cellular proliferation, protect chromosomes from fusing together
      during mitosis and maintain genomic stability, and prevent the loss of genetic data.
      Telomeres are specialized repetitive DNA sequences, typically ranging from 5,000 to 15,000 bp
      in humans, which are the critical chromosome capping DNA sequences. The loss of telomere
      repeats diminishes telomeric functional capacity.Telomere length(TL) is important in
      determining telomere function.This is known as the end replication problem and results in a
      gradual decline in TL over time. Consequently,leukocyte TL shortens in a predictable way with
      age by roughly 20-40 base pairs per year. Cellular senescence and subsequent cell death often
      occur when the mean telomere length reaches a critical value.Shortened telomeres and lower
      telomerase are linked to age-related risk factors and disease.Peripheral blood leukocyte
      express telomerase at low levels, which can be measured over a short duration (hours) to
      demonstrate immediate, short-term changes. Shorter mean leukocyte telomere length has been
      shown to be associated with risk of several age-related diseases.The dosage of propofol
      gradually reduced with the aging process. However,it is not known whether the telomere length
      and variation of telomerase in PBL relate to the dosage of propofol and time of consciousness
      disappearance in anesthesia induction. In this exploratory study, the investigators examined
      that the changes of peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length was associated with the dosage
      of propofol and time of consciousness disappearance in anesthesia induction.

      Given the importance of telomeres in nuclear and cellular function, the central role of
      telomere length in determining telomere function,the investigator study that the changes of
      telomere length in peripheral blood leukocyte of patients are associated with the dosage of
      propofol in anesthesia induction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hundred patients with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II,
      aged from 18 to 80 years, gave an informed-written consent to participate.Testing took place
      in the morning after an overnight fast. Patients were scheduled for elective surgical
      procedures. After arrival to the operating theater, the peripheral venous line for fluid and
      drug administration was inserted. The electrocardiogram, heart rate, a noninvasive blood
      pressure, a pulse oximeter and bispectral (BIS) Index were monitored continuously. 100%
      oxygen was given for 3 min by face mask. Anesthesia was induced by intravenous infusion of
      propofol via the syringe pump at a rate of 30 mg/kg/h. Recordings began before propofol
      induction started. After the start of the propofol infusion and BIS Index at 80, patients
      were asked loudly &quot;open eyes&quot; and examined eyelash reflex at 15-s intervals until loss of
      consciousness (unresponsiveness to the verbal command, no spontaneous movements and loss of
      eyelash reflex); and recordings of the heart rate, a noninvasive blood pressure and BIS Index
      were obtained during awake baseline and unconsciousness induced by propofol. Propofol dosage
      and consciousness disappearance time were recorded after propofol-induced loss of
      consciousness. The commands were spoken in a loud voice by the investigator and were repeated
      up to three times, if the subject failed to respond. A subject who obeyed command was
      considered conscious. The BIS index is useful, and a reliable and sensitive indicator for
      assessing the level of consciousness during sedation and hypnosis with propofol so that the
      investigators recorded BIS index to evaluate level of consciousness. To minimize artifacts,
      patients were instructed not to open their eyes, talk, or move during the heart rate, a
      noninvasive blood pressure and BIS Index recordings before the propofol infusion and the
      sedation level was assessed until the patient's unconsciousness.
