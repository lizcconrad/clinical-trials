  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, cross-over study,
      conducted to find out whether the etoricoxib 120 mg film-coated tablet produced by PT Dexa
      Medica (test drug) was bioequivalent to the reference drug (Arcoxia速 Film-Coated Tablet 120
      mg, PT. Schering-Plough Indonesia Tbk), under fasting condition with a fourteen days wash-out
      period, involving 26 healthy adult male and female subjects.

      This was a randomized, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, cross-over study under fasting
      condition with a fourteen days wash-out period, involving 26 healthy adult male and female
      subjects. The participating subjects had an overnight fast and in the next morning were given
      orally either one film-coated tablet of the test drug or one film-coated tablet of the
      reference drug with 200 mL of water. Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the
      drug (baseline), and at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48,
      and 72 hours after drug administration, analysed for plasma concentrations of etoricoxib and
      used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics parameters of the single dose administration. After a
      fourteen-day washout period, the procedure was repeated using the alternate drug. The plasma
      concentrations of etoricoxib were determined by using a high pressure liquid chromatography
      with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method.
