    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if stretching the contralateral sacroiliac (SI)
      joint improves GIRD in baseball players. Additionally, we aimed to compare our SI joint
      stretching regiment with a classically described sleeper stretch routine.

      Abstract:

      Background:

      Glenohumeral Internal Rotational Deficit (GIRD) is a well-documented finding in throwing
      athletes.

      Hypothesis/Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to investigate if stretching the contralateral sacroiliac (SI)
      joint improves GIRD in baseball players. Additionally, the effect of the SI joint stretch
      will be compared to that of the classically described sleeper stretch.

      Study Design:

      Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial

      Methods:

      With the athlete supine and arm abducted 90o, internal rotation of both shoulders was
      measured in 23 minor league baseball players.

      Next, each player randomly was assigned to either a control (sleeper stretch of dominant
      shoulder) or experimental (stretch of the SI joint contralateral to the dominant shoulder)
      group supervised by a certified athletic trainer. The players performed their own stretches.

      Finally, the initial two investigators, unaware of to which group the player was assigned,
      re-measured the end-range internal rotation of each athlete's dominant shoulder.
