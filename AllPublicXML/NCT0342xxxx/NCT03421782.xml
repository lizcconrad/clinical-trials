      This randomized pilot phase II trial studies how well exercise intervention with or without
      internet-based cognitive behavior therapy works in reducing fatigue in patients with stage
      III-IV breast cancer or prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body and
      usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Exercise intervention and
      internet-based cognitive behavior therapy may help to improve feelings of tiredness in
      patients with breast or prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the change in fatigue as assessed with the Patient Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue 7a questionnaire with 12 weeks of exercise +
      internet-based intervention + usual care compared to exercise + usual care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the change in other patient-reported measures (e.g., insomnia, pain severity,
      physical function) as assessed with the PROMIS Profile 29 questionnaire with 12 weeks of
      exercise + internet-based intervention + usual care compared to exercise + usual care.

      II. To compare the change in activity level and associated parameters (e.g., graded exercise
      test) with 12 weeks of exercise + internet-based intervention + usual care compared to
      exercise + usual care.

      III. To examine associations between change in fatigue and change in activity level.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo POWER exercise intervention consisting of supervised exercise
      training sessions over 50 minutes every 7 days for a total of 12 sessions and 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity exercise weekly for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo POWER exercise intervention consisting of supervised exercise
      training sessions over 50 minutes every 7 days for a total of 12 sessions and 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity exercise weekly for 12 weeks. Patients also undergo PROSPECT
      internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention over 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 6-12 months for 2 years.

    <description>Will estimate the effect size of the addition of the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention to exercise. To assess the severity and frequency of fatigue over time, the PROMIS Fatigue T score will be compared between the control arm (exercise alone) and the experimental arm (exercise plus CBT intervention) using a mixed regression model for repeated measures with a linear response. The models will also include the corresponding baseline measurement, time, age, and disease (breast or prostate cancer). Presence of treatment-by-time interaction will be investigated for each model.
