  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aims: To investigate the effects of different food structures on appetite signals from the
      upper gastrointestinal tract.

      DESIGN: A randomised, controlled, clinical trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      There is very little evidence at the present time in the role of food structure in energy
      homeostasis. There is circumstantial evidence that foods consumed intact have great effects
      on suppressing appetite.

      To test the effect of three structurally different meals with the same nutritional content
      and volume on appetite regulation. Each participant will receive the following meals:

      Solid meal group. Milled (intact-cell) meal group. Milled (destroyed-cell) meal group.

      All of which will contain the same macro and micro nutrients from the same food sources
