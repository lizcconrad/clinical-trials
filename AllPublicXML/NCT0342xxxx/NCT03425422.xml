      A multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate Autonomic Regulation Therapy
      with the VITARIA system in patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection
      fraction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ANTHEM-HFrEF is a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial with an
      adaptive design. Patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduced LVEF will be enrolled
      and randomized 2:1 to receive VITARIA system implantation on the right cervical vagus nerve
      in addition to stable guideline-directed medical therapy (therapy), or to continue receiving
      stable guideline-directed medical therapy alone (control arm).

      Subjects in the therapy arm will receive continuous, periodic VNS stimulation after surgery
      is completed, and will undergo visits for VNS up titration over a period of 3 months.
      Subjects in the control arm will also undergo scheduled visits at a similar frequency as the
      titration visits that are scheduled for subjects in the therapy arm. Data for safety and
      efficacy assessments will be collected for both study arms at 4 weeks post-randomization,
      every 3 months for the first 12 months, and every 4 months thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 or above

          2. Willing and capable of providing informed consent

          3. Capable of participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation

          4. Currently in sinus rhythm

          5. Stable, guideline-directed medical therapy for at least 4 weeks.

          6. Stable symptomatic heart failure NYHA class III; or NYHA class II with a heart failure
             hospitalization in the previous 6 months

          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) â‰¤ 35%, as confirmed by core echocardiography
             laboratory during screening

          8. N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) level of at least 800 pg/mL within 45 days of
             randomization; or NT-proBNP level of at least 400 pg/mL with a heart failure
             hospitalization in the previous 12 months

          9. Received a standard cardiac assessment, including history, physical exam, and
             electrocardiogram, and determined by a heart failure cardiologist and study surgeon to
             be an appropriate candidate for the study's surgical procedure

         10. Physically capable and willing to perform repeated 6-minute walk tests associated with
             the study, and having a baseline distance of between 150 and 450 meters. Symptoms
             limiting the duration of the 6 minute walk test must be due primarily to heart failure

             therapy (CRT) device, baroreceptor stimulation (BRS) device, artificial or donor
             heart, or ventricular assist device (VAD)

          4. Heart failure of non-ischemic origin for less than 6 months, or due to congenital
             heart disease, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative cardiomyopathy
             (e.g. amyloidosis, sarcoidosis)

          5. Severe mitral or aortic valve disorder

          6. Symptomatic uncontrolled bradycardia

          7. Chronic (permanent) atrial fibrillation
