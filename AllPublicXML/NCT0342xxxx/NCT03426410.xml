  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose and background:

      The purpose of the study is to investigate physiotherapeutic courses of rehabilitation in the
      primary sector for low back pain patients. This is done by identifying both how
      physiotherapeutic rehabilitation is organized in the primary sector and further what
      different types of physiotherapeutic interventions are offered for this patient group.
      Furthermore the study aims to evaluate to what extent existing physiotherapeutic
      rehabilitation practice adheres with the national and international guidelines and
      recommendations for low back pain rehabilitation.

      Methods:

      A quantitative survey is carried out, which includes development and validation of a
      questionnaire for the purpose, and this is subsequently distributed electronically to private
      and public providers of physiotherapy rehabilitation in all 19 municipalities in Central
      Denmark Region. Approximately 500 physiotherapists will be asked to participate in the survey
      in the period February to March 2018.

    <description>Adherence to guidelines is assessed on the basis of the responses given to the two patient vignettes in the questionnaire. Thus, for each vignette there is a total 3 questions with four possible answers for each question. For each question 1 answer is correct, 1 partly correct and 2 are wrong. Adherence to guidelines is ultimately defined as:
Strictly adheres = 3 correct answers OR 2 correct and 1 partly correct answer. Partly adheres: 1 correct and 2 partly correct answers OR 2 correct and 1 wrong answer OR 3 partly correct answers.
Does not adhere: any other combination of answers than the above mentioned.</description>
