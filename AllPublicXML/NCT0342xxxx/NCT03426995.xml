  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This FTIH study, intends to identify the doses of GSK3358699, which are well tolerated by the
      subjects whilst delivering a robust pharmacodynamic (PD) response. This study will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and PD profile of single (in both fed and
      fasted states) and multiple ascending doses of GSK3358699 in healthy male subjects within a
      pre-defined and controlled pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic range for each cohort. It also
      intends to understand the effect of GSK3358699 on systemic markers of inflammation following
      low dose in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor
      (GM-CSF) challenge and local inflammation in cantharidin-induced blisters. The study has been
      carefully designed to explore the in vivo biology of the target and the potential for the
      study drug to become a transformative medicine for subjects in multiple immuno-inflammatory
      disease indications.The study will be conducted in three Parts. Total duration for
      participation will be approximately 23 weeks for Part A, 9 weeks for Part B and 12 weeks for
      Part C. The study will be conducted in up to 80 subjects.

    <intervention_model_description>Study will be conducted as Part A, B and C. Part A will consist of 2-interlocking cohorts, where each subject will receive maximum 2-single ascending oral doses of GSK3358699 and 1 dose of placebo, in treatment periods (TP) 1 to 3. In TP 4 subjects will receive GSK3358699, dose evaluated in TP (1 to 3) or placebo, with cantharidin induced blisters and either LPS or GM-CSF in vivo challenge. Part B will comprise of single cohort taking part in two-way cross over, with open label phase where each subject will receive single oral dose of GSK3358699 (based on Part A), under fed and fasted conditions in each TP. Part C will consist of 3 cohorts with multiple ascending doses, with every cohort having one repeat dose TP with 14 days of daily dosing of either GSK3358699 or placebo. Subjects on Day 14 will receive cantharidin induced blisters with either LPS or GM-CSF in vivo challenge. An optional, cohort 7 may be included for further dose evaluation of GSK3358699 or alternate dosing schedule.</intervention_model_description>

Dose of 1 mg will be given as solution and doses of 10 mg and 35 mg, will be given as a capsule. Each TP will be of 1 day and separated by a washout period of 14-days. Post completion of the dose-escalation TPs, an additional dosing TP 4 will be included where the subjects from each TP (1 to 3), will receive control blisters induced on forearm (0.2 % cantharidin) at Day -10. The subjects in cohort 1 will receive GSK3358699 at a dose level already given in TP 1-3, and will then receive an intravenous in vivo LPS challenge at a dose not exceeding 0.75 nanogram per kilogram post administration of GSK3358699.
