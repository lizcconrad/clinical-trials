  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is testing an investigator-developed decision support tool for surrogate decision
      makers for stroke patients that are unable to make medical decisions for themselves.

      A historical usual care control group will be enrolled during tool development. The tool will
      then be tested in surrogates of hospitalized stroke patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decision support tools, specifically recommended in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, have been
      shown to improve the quality of decisions and reduce burden on the decision maker in multiple
      clinical settings, yet almost none have focused on life-sustaining treatments in acute
      critical illness such as stroke. This study proposes a comprehensive frame shift in how the
      health care team and surrogates collaborate on decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments
      for acute illness, by developing a tailored web-based stroke decision support intervention.
      This web-based tool will be developed for use by the surrogate decision maker during the
      acute stroke hospitalization and will be designed to facilitate high quality patient-centered
      decisions and minimize adverse effects on the surrogate.

      The two project phases are: 1) Decision support intervention development; and 2) Pilot
      testing in surrogates of hospitalized stroke patients. A novel ordinal prognostic model will
      be developed and incorporated into the tool.

      The project expects 25 surrogate-patient pairs in the control group, and 25 surrogate-patient
      pairs in the intervention group, which equals a total of 100 subjects.

    <description>The proportion of cases where the surrogate completes use of the tool with high acceptability using the Acceptability E-Scale. The Acceptability E-Scale is a 6-item scale. A score of 1 indicates a negative evaluation and 5 indicates a positive evaluation. A score of 3 indicates a neutral evaluation. An individual will be considered to have high acceptability if the average response across the 6 items is 4 or higher)</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of the surrogate's prognostic estimate for functional recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Within approximately 5 days of admission</time_frame>
    <description>Calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the surrogate's estimate of the probability (0-100%) of return to functional independence by 90 days and the model based estimate of modified Rankin of 0-2. Range of this measure will be 0-100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Self Efficacy scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Within approximately 5 days of admission</time_frame>
    <description>11-item scale (a score of 0 indicates not at all confident and a 4 indicates very confident) with ordered categorical responses, converted to a 0-100 scale based on the average of the responses to each item. A score of 0 means extremely low self-efficacy and a score of 100 means extremely high self-efficacy</description>
