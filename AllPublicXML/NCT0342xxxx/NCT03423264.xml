      Enrollment is only available to patients enrolled on the Optima II study (NCT03107182).

      The purpose of this trial is to compare rates of opioid use at completion of radiation for
      patients with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥ 2 oral mucositis
      after receiving definitive nonoperative locoregional therapy with or without prophylactic
      gabapentin as part of best supportive care for locoregionally-advanced, HPV-related
      oropharyngeal cancer. Secondary purposes include comparison of total equivalent opioid dosage
      above baseline opioid use at end of treatment, quality of life metrics, swallowing function,
      feeding tube dependence, and protocol compliance in patients managed with best support care
      with or without prophylactic gabapentin. Rates of gabapentin-related side effects and
      discontinuation will also be investigated.

      Enrollment is only available to patients enrolled on the Optima II study (NCT03107182).

      Primary objective: To compare rates of opioid requirement as a function of supportive care in
      patients experiencing CTCAE grade ≥2 oral mucositis at completion of radiation or
      chemoradiation as part of OPTIMA II

      Secondary objectives: To compare total opioid equivalent dose above baseline opioid
      requirement at end of radiation, quality of life metrics, swallowing function, feeding-tube
      dependence, and protocol compliance in patients managed with best supportive care with or
      without prophylactic gabapentin. To investigate rates of gabapentin-related toxicity and
      discontinuation for patients treated on protocol.
