    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Trans epidermal water loss is an objective skin measurement that is measures the evaporation of water on the skin surface using a probe (DermaLab).The trans epidermal water loss is a measure for the skins barrier function. There is always aloss of water from the skin due to evaporation. When the skin barrier is damaged this evaporation of water increases. Thus, transepidermal water loss can be used to assess skin damage</description>

             in-house clinical investigations are accepted under the circumstances that the subject
             has paused the activities in the investigation and are otherwise complying with the
             inclusion and exclusion criteria of this (CP264) protocol.

          5. Are currently suffering from peristomal skin problems i.e. bleeding and/or broken skin
