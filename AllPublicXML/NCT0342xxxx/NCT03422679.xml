      This is a phase I/II, non randomized, open-label, dose escalation study to investigate the
      safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CB-103.

    <textblock>
      This Phase I/IIA, open label, multicenter, dose escalation study of CB-103 in patients with
      Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumours and Haematological Malignancies. After providing signed
      informed consent, patients will be screened for entry into the study. The study will be
      conducted in 2 stages. In a dose escalation stage, approximately 25 patients will be
      enrolled. Escalation cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will receive repeat doses of CB-103 to
      determine the MTD and RP2D. A Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control is
      used.

      CB-103 will be administered orally on a once-daily schedule, based on a 28-day treatment
      cycle. Aim of the expansion Phase IIA, Part B of the study will be to collect preliminary
      evidence of anti-tumour activity and to confirm the safety of the CB-103 MTD/RP2D in
      different expansion arms consisting of up to 140 patients with pre-selected cancer
      indications with tumour cells characterised by NOTCH over-activation.
