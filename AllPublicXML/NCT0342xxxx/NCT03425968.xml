  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee hyperextension, also called genu recurvatum or back knee, is commonly seen in women,
      people with ligamentous laxity, stroke and cerebral palsy patients. This faulty posture would
      result in excessive tension of the passive tissues such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
      and posterior capsule of the knee. Subjects may also develop compensations at hip and ankle
      joint, as well as lower extremity malalignment. Muscles surrounding the knee could also
      become dysfunctional when performing functional tasks requiring stability during terminal
      knee extension, during which uncontrolled knee hyperextension could easily be utilized to
      lock the joint for stability in gait and stair climbing. In athletes, landing from a jump on
      an extended knee is one of the common reasons resulting in ACL injury. Little is known about
      the injury rate of athletes with knee hyperextension who participate in sports involving
      jump-landing activities.

      The aim of the study is to explore if knee hyperextension is associated with poor lower
      extremity alignment and dynamic control and injury rate in athletes requiring jump-landing
      activities.

      One of the study hypothesis is that athlete with knee hyperextension can find more
      compensatory lower extremity alignments and poor control in dynamic movement than control
      group.

      The other hypothesis is with or without knee hyperextension, the parameter of lower extremity
      alignment and dynamic control can predict injury rate in jump landing athlete.

      Investigators expect to recruit 100 subjects into 2 group- control group and knee
      hyperextension group (KH group). In knee hyperextension group, investigators will include
      college athletes having knee hyperextension alignment, no lower extremity injuries in past
      three months, and participating in jump-landing activities. Control group will match the
      gender, age, height, weight and sports to KH group. Inclusion criteria is the same as KH
      group, except the knee hyperextension angle is &lt;5⁰ in control group. Every subjects will
      receive the first time assessment and follow up by filling the injury-follow-up form every
      months for about four months.

      At the first assessment, investigators will measure lower extremity alignments include pelvic
      angle in sagittal plane, hip anteversion, tibiofemoral angle, knee hyperextension angle in
      supine and standing position, tibial rotation angle, and navicular drop; lower extremity
      muscle flexibility include rectus femoris, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, iliotibial
      band; lower extremity muscle strength include hip, knee, muscle group; dynamic control task
      will record tibio-femoral acceleration, angle change ground reaction force and EMG muscle
      firing during vertical jump and drop jump.
