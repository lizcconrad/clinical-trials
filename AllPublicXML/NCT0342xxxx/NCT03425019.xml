  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical pain intensity as assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scores on the visual analogue scale (VAS) range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical pain intensity as assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC ranges from 0 to 96, with higher scores indicating worse OA pain-related symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical pain intensity as assessed by Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-MPQ-2 measures the quality as well as the intensity of pain. Participants complete the SF-MPQ-2 by rating the extent to which they experienced each of 22 pain descriptors in the past week using an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = &quot;none&quot; to 10 = &quot;worst possible&quot;). The SF-MPQ-2 is comprised of four summary scales: (1) continuous descriptors (throbbing pain, cramping pain, gnawing pain, aching pain, heavy pain, and tender), (2) intermittent descriptors (shooting pain, stabbing pain, sharp pain, splitting pain, electric-shock pain, and piercing), (3) neuropathic descriptors (hot-burning pain, cold-freezing pain, pain caused by light touch, itching, tingling or 'pins and needles', and numbness), and (4) affective descriptors (tiring-exhausting, sickening, fearful, and punishing-cruel). A total pain score is computed by averaging participant ratings across all questions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in experimental pain sensitivity as assessed by a multimodal Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) battery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to measure experimental pain sensitivity, a multimodal Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) battery will be completed: heat pain sensitivity, pressure pain sensitivity, punctate mechanical pain, and Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain-related cortical response as assessed by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-related cortical response will be measured using a continuous-wave, multichannel fNIRS imaging system (LIGHTNIRS, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with three semiconductor lasers at 780, 805, and 830 nm. Optical recordings will be collected during thermal pain stimulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility as assessed by a survey of participants' tDCS experience</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be colledted on participants' tDCS experience at the conclusion of tDCS treatment on a scale of 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree): Q1) &quot;Overall the device was easy to use&quot;; Q2) &quot;It was easy to prepare the device and accessories&quot;; and Q3) &quot;The effectiveness of the treatment increased over the course of treatment.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability as assessed by severity of side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The presence and severity of possible side effects of treatment at the end of each session will be assessed on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 10 (highest degree). The participants will be asked in an open-ended manner whether they have experienced any side effects, and they will then be asked specifically about tingling, itching sensation, burning sensation, pain at the stimulation site, fatigue, nervousness, headache, difficulty concentrating, mood change, and changes in vision or visual perception.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety as assessed by the PROMIS anxiety-short form</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 7-item PROMIS anxiety-short form assesses the pure domain of anxiety in individuals age 18 and older, and each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always) with a range in score from 7 to 35 with higher scores indicating greater severity of anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depression as assessed by the PROMIS depression-short form</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-item PROMIS depression-short form assesses the pure domain of depression in individuals age 18 and older, and each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always) with a range in score from 8 to 40 with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep disturbance as assessed by the PROMIS sleep disturbance-short form</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-item PROMIS sleep disturbance-short form assesses the pure domain of sleep disturbance in individuals age 18 and older, and each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always) with a range in score from 8 to 40 with higher scores indicating greater severity of sleep disturbance.</description>

    <description>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) involves the application of weak direct electric current to the head in a noninvasive and painless manner. tDCS with a constant current intensity of 2 mA will be applied for 20 minutes per session daily for 2 weeks (Monday to Friday) via the Soterix 1x1 tDCS mini-CT Stimulator device. Participants will self-administer tDCS at their home or a private room for two weeks (Mondays-Fridays) under real-time supervision by the research staff.</description>
