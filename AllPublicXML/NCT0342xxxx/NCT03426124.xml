  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry is designed to understand acoustic pulse thrombolysis (APT) treatment used as
      standard of care across globally for pulmonary embolism. The registry will include
      individuals who have already received the APT treatment and those that will undergo APT
      treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the prospective arm of the registry a physician must have already selected the APT
      procedure for the treatment of pulmonary embolism. The APT treatment and follow-up
      assessments are per clinical judgement and institutional standard of care which may vary at
      each clinical site.

      For the retrospective arm of the registry the investigators will gather cases of individuals
      who received the APT treatment for pulmonary embolism. Specific baseline, treatment, and
      long-term health information is collected and de-identified.
