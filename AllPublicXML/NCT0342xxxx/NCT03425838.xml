    <textblock>
      Given the uncertain benefit in efficacy of adding CDK 4/6 to first rather than second line
      endocrine treatment, the aim of this project is to evaluate whether the sequence of an
      aromatase inhibitor plus CDK 4/6 in first line followed by fulvestrant in second line is
      superior to the sequence of an aromatase inhibitor in first line followed by fulvestrant plus
      CDK4/6 in second line.

      Combining cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitors with endocrine therapies in
      hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative
      advanced breast cancer has shown to result in substantial improvements in progression-free
      survival. There is however no evidence that this combination strategy leads to an improved
      overall survival. Furthermore, no specific subgroups that will or will not benefit from the
      combination of drugs have been identified yet. This means the optimal strategy for deploying
      CDK 4/6 inhibitors in clinical practice is not yet known. Since CDK 4/6 inhibitors are costly
      and can have toxic effects, it is important to determine the optimal treatment strategy to
      avoid both over- and undertreatment.

      The SONIA-trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized phase III study. The
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate if treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase
      inhibitor combined with CDK 4/6 inhibition in first line followed at progression by
      fulvestrant in second line (strategy A) improves progression-free survival compared to
      treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor in first line followed at progression by
      fulvestrant combined with CDK4/6 inhibition in second line (strategy B). The primary end
      point is progression-free survival after two lines (PFS2), secondary end points include
      overall survival, quality of life, safety and biomarker analyses.

    <description>The cost and outcomes of both arms will be assessed by means of a decision model (a multistate Markov model or a Discrete Event Simulation model). Cost-effectiveness will be determined by comparing costs and effects of both treatment strategies. Quality adjusted life years will be computed by multiplying life-years with the observed utility scores during those life years. The friction cost method will be used for estimating the societal costs of productivity losses. Unit costs for drugs will be derived from www.medicijnkosten.nl or the Z-index. The costs of a hospital day, outpatient visit, and day care treatment, will be based on the Dutch costing manual. Other costs will be collected from NZA tariffs. All costs will be expressed in Euros.</description>

             tests, and other study procedures.

         10. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the patient (or a legal representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with advanced, symptomatic, visceral spread, who are at risk of
             life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients with massive
             uncontrolled effusions (pleural, pericardial, peritoneal), pulmonary lymphangitis, and

             radiotherapy, stereotactic surgery) and are clinically stable without the use of
             steroids for at least 4 weeks before randomization

          3. Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor
             (i.e., anastrozole or letrozole) with disease recurrence while on or within 12 months

                  fosamprenavir, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, mibefradil,
                  miconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir,
                  telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit

          6. Major surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, any investigational agents, or other
             anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks before randomization. Patients who received prior
             radiotherapy to ≥25% of bone marrow are not eligible independent of when it was
             received.

          7. Diagnosis of any other malignancy prior to randomization, except those that are not
             believed to influence the patient's prognosis and do not require any further
             treatment. This includes, but is not limited to adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          8. QTc &gt;480 msec at baseline

          9. Active inflammatory bowel disease or chronic diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, or any
             upper gastrointestinal surgery including gastric resection.

         10. Known hypersensitivity to letrozole or anastrozole, or any of its excipients, or to
             any palbociclib excipients.

         11. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

         12. Recent or active suicidal ideation or behavior.
