    <textblock>
      The study involves assessment of hearing and visual complications along with headache after
      accidental dural puncture in patients receiving epidurals. Hearing loss will be assessed by
      clinical examination and audiometry testing, while visual complications will be assessed by
      clinical examination. The patients will receive standard treatment for headache in the form
      of drugs and if required an epidural blood patch ( injecting patient's blood in the epidural
      space). The course of these complications and response to treatment will be investigated over
      a period of time.

      Audiometry results from patients with dural puncture will be compared to those of patients
      who also had epidurals, but without a dural puncture.

      The investigators hypothesize that audiovisual complications occur more frequently in
      patients having accidental dural puncture with epidural needle and that the symptoms resolve
      with the administration of epidural blood patch.

    <textblock>
      Although many studies have reported auditory complications after spinal, none have been done
      in obstetric patients with accidental dural puncture with epidural needle. Long term follow
      up of these complications has been unknown. The incidence of both auditory and visual
      complications is likely to be high in patients getting accidental dural puncture with 17G
      Touhy epidural needle as compared to small gauge spinal needles. Several case reports have
      been reported with such temporary and permanent hearing and visual loss. A prospective study
      to understand these complications is required. The study will provide us with the true
      incidence of audiovisual complications of dural puncture with an epidural needle. Early
      intervention in cases of dural puncture may alleviate or halt symptoms.
