  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Researchers want to learn more about head and neck disorders. Understanding these disorders
      could help them find better treatments. To do this, they are collecting tissue samples for
      research.

      Objective:

      To create a repository of tissue samples and data to better study conditions of the head and
      neck.

      Eligibility:

      People who had or will have tissue samples taken because of a head or neck disorder. They
      must be ages 3 and older and not pregnant to join Part 2.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a questionnaire, medical history, and physical exam.

      Part 1. Participants will give permission for any of their tissue samples leftover from
      private care or other research protocols to be used.

      If participants tissue did not contain normal tissue or if they have a condition that
      suggests a genetic issue, they will be invited to join Part 2.

      Part 2: Participants will have additional samples collected. These could be:

        -  Blood: Blood is drawn through a needle in the arm.

        -  Cheek swab or brushing: A cotton swab or small brush is rubbed inside the cheek.

        -  Saliva: They rinse their mouth with water and spit into a tube or cup.

        -  Skin biopsy: They are injected with a numbing drug. A biopsy tool removes a small piece
           of skin.

        -  Mucosal biopsy: They are injected in the mouth with a numbing medication. A small piece
           of tissue from the inside of the cheek is removed.

      Participants samples will be used for future research, including genetic testing.

      Background:

      -National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) investigators are
      studying the natural history and treatment of diverse conditions of the head and neck
      affecting hearing, balance, smell, taste, swallowing, voice and speech at the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH). These studies require the collection of biospecimens for research
      purposes.

      Objectives:

        -  Primary: To create a biorepository of diseased and normal tissue specimens for research
           purposes. The samples will be obtained:

             -  (Part 1) From surgical waste materials from participants of all ages in NIH
                protocols who have head and neck disorders, as well as from patients treated at the
                Johns Hopkins Suburban Hospital Head and Neck Surgery Clinic (JHSH), and the Johns
                Hopkins Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery Clinic Bethesda.(JHOCB)

             -  (Part 2)Participants aged 3 and older may have collection of blood, saliva, and/or
                oral swabs, Non-pregnant participants, aged 18 and older, may undergo oral mucosal
                biopsies and skin biopsies, taken from subjects with head and neck disorders

        -  Secondary:

      The specimens will be shared with other approved protocols or may be used under this protocol
      to conduct analysis of cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic biology of normal processes
      and disorders. These laboratory studies may support development of future protocols that
      include new therapeutic agents, novel treatment approaches, and new prognostic and diagnostic
      models for subjects with disorders of the head and neck affecting human communication.

      -Eligibility:

      -- Subjects must be diagnosed with a disorder of the head and neck region

      Design:

        -  Up to 1000 subjects will be enrolled.

        -  Part 1. Participants of all ages with head and neck disorders will be asked to share
           waste material from surgical procedures to create a biorepository of diseased and normal
           specimens for research. The participants will be enrolled prior to the surgery or they
           may be enrolled retrospectively and asked to share pathology specimens and slides
           previously collected that are no longer required for their medical care.

        -  Participants will be recruited from surgical protocols at the National Institutes of
           Health (NIH) Clinical Center or from subjects being treated at JHSH or the JHOCB.

        -  Part 2: Participants aged 3 and older who have agreed to share surgical waste material
           may be asked to provide additional blood, saliva, and/or oral swabs. In addition, oral
           mucosal or skin biopsies may be obtained from non-pregnant adult participants aged 18
           and older.

             -  No investigational or experimental therapy will be given as part of this protocol.
