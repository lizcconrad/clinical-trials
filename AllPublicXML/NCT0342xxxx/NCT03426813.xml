  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is a common health problem. More than 100,000 Danes contract pneumonia every year,
      and around 15,000 of these are hospitalized. The main treatment is antibiotics. An American
      study indicates that patients who are mobilized early are hospitalized for a shorter period
      of time. The objective of the thesis is: to determine the effect of mobilization within 24
      hours after hospitalization of patients with pneumonia. The result will be number of
      hospitalization days, rehospitalisation and mortality.

      Patients with pneumonia hospitalized in the period 1 September 2012 - 28 February 2013 in the
      Medical Centre, lung unit 204B at Vendsyssel Hospital will be included in the project. Within
      the first 24 hours of hospitalization, they will be tested by a physiotherapist and
      mobilized.

      There are significant costs associated with the treatment of patients with pneumonia - both
      economic costs and human costs. This thesis may clarify whether early mobilization influence
      the time these patients are hospitalized, whether they are rehospitalized and whether it is
      possible to reduce the mortality rate.
