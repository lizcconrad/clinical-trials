      Propofol is a widely used sedative anesthetic, but there are large individual differences,
      which making different patients with different sensitivity to propofol. The aim of this study
      was to analyze the effects of age, height, body weight, Drinking, metabolic enzymes CYP2B6
      and UGT1A9 on Pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics of propofol, and to provide a
      reasonable reference for clinical anesthesia patients and evidence for individual dosage
      regimens.

      Propofol is a widely used sedative anesthetic, but there are large individual differences,
      which making different patients with different sensitivity to propofol. In recent years, the
      concept of individualized administration came into being.Individual administration refers to
      according to the condition of patients,the drug's safety and efficacy, and pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical response ,then gives different dosing regimens for individual
      patients and promotes the development of rational drug use. Different people have differences
      metabolism of propofol, reported in the literature, genetic polymorphism, demographic
      characteristics, combined with drug and other variability factors, all of them will affect
      the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol.The aim of this study was to analyze
      the effects of age, height, body weight, Drinking, metabolic enzymes CYP2B6 and UGT1A9 on
      Pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics of propofol, and to provide a reasonable
      reference for clinical anesthesia patients and evidence for individual dosage regimens.
