  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies with photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) have shown positive results delaying
      skeletal muscle fatigue and improving the status of biochemical markers related to skeletal
      muscle damage when these therapies were applied before exercise. The aim of this project was
      to verify the effects of PBMT in improvement of skeletal muscle performance and skeletal
      muscle recovery in healthy male subjects. This project aimed also to validate the concept
      that simultaneous use of three wavelengths and light sources lead to optimized action
      independently of time-window between irradiation and the exercise. It was performed a
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with voluntary participation of healthy
      subjects. Investigators analyzed parameters related to volunteers exercise performance (peak
      torque through maximum voluntary contraction - MVC), delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) by
      visual analogue scale (VAS), and biochemical marker of muscle damage (CK). Analysis were
      performed before exercise protocol (baseline) and the phototherapy was applied after 3
      minutes from baseline. The eccentric exercise protocol was done after 5 minutes, 3 hours, 6
      hours and 24 hours from PBMT. Then the assessments were repeated after 1 minute from
      exercise, and 1, 24 and 48 hours after the end of exercise protocol.

    <intervention_model_description>Fifty participants were enrolled in the study. Participants were randomized in five groups according to PBMT application:
Placebo: Participants received placebo PBMT; 5 minutes: Participants performed the eccentric exercise protocol 5 minutes after PBMT.
3 hours: Participants performed the eccentric exercise protocol 3 hours after PBMT.
6 hours: Participants performed the eccentric exercise protocol 6 hours after PBMT.
24 hours: Participants performed the eccentric exercise protocol 24 hours after PBMT.
Assessments were performed before exercise protocols, after 1 minute, and 1, 24 and 48 hours after the end of exercise protocol.</intervention_model_description>
