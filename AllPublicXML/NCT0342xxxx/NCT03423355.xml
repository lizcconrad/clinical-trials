      Dapagliflozin effect on erythropoiesis and physical fitness in patients with type 2 diabetes
      - a randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel group, exploratory study

    <textblock>
      A positive outcome of this study could show that by treating diabetes, it is also possible to
      improve physical fitness, which is a major problem in many patients. Furthermore, all of the
      participants will receive lifestyle counselling to further improve glycemic control, and
      blood glucose levels are closely monitored. Thus, patients in all groups will benefit from
      improvement in glucose levels. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance in this study is
      considered favorable.

    <description>Treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin will be compared to matching placebo and the reference HCT in a parallel design. The study will be performed under double-blinded conditions with respect to treatment with dapagliflozin or matching placebo.
In this study, the effect of dapagliflozin on EPO levels, physical fitness and biomarkers for erythropoiesis and hemodynamic regulation are evaluated and compared to that of matching placebo and the diuretic and anti-hypertensive drug HCT.</description>
