  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a major cause of death in Intensive Care Units and therefore finding new therapies
      to improve survival rates and limit morbidity is a major goal. Over the past decades, blood
      purification has been proposed as an adjuvant therapy for sepsis. The goal of blood
      purification is to restore the immune homeostasis and efficiency through the removal of
      bacterial products including endotoxins, broad-spectrum cytokines and other inflammatory
      mediators. Indeed, the large and overwhelmed release of these mediators in the early phase of
      sepsis may induce multiple organ failure syndrome. In 2017, different techniques are proposed
      for blood purification. Among them, the highly adsorptive membrane, oXiris™, seems promising.
      This membrane can be used in case of Acute Kidney Injury associated with sepsis and exhibits
      enhanced blood purification capacities. Previous studies on animals have already proven that
      this membrane can remove broad-spectrum cytokines but also endotoxins from the blood. This
      ability to remove endotoxins is particularly interesting since endotoxins are believed to be
      the trigger of the immune cascade at the initiation of sepsis.

      The lack of clinical evidence is the main limit to a wider use of this membrane. Therefore,
      the aim of the present clinical trial is to characterize the blood purification properties of
      the membrane in a human clinical setting. The oXiris™ membrane is specifically designed to
      improve the adsorptive capacities of the polyacrylonitrile-based AN69 membrane. Its extremely
      rich coating of polyethyleneimine (PEI) gives the membrane the ability to bind and remove not
      only cytokines but also endotoxins due to the positive charges of PEI at the surface of the
      membrane. The tested hypothesis is that the oXiris™ filter allows for a greater endotoxin and
      cytokine removal compared to a standard polysulfone (&quot;PrismafleX HF1400&quot;) filter in patients
      with septic shock.
