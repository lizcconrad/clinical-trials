    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the impact of a group intervention combining self-hypnosis and
      self-care techniques on prostate patients' well-being. More specifically, the investigators
      want to investigate the effects of that intervention on sleep, fatigue and emotional distress
      of the patients.

    <measure>Change in Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 (before the intervention) and T1 (after the intervention : 6 months later).</time_frame>
    <description>A sense of tiredness or exhaustion linked with cancer and its treatments, that is not alleviated by sleep. Measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Core Questionnaire-30 (EORTC-QLCQ30). One symptom-related scale (fatigue, score based on 3 items, varies from 0 to 100, 100 being the worst fatigue endured) and the global health status (2 items, score varies from 0 to 100, 100 being the best quality of life) are used in this study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in emotional distress</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 (before the intervention) and T1 (after the intervention : 6 months later).</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety + Depression, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Scores range (total): 0-42 (0-14: absence of anxio-depressive disorder ; 15-42: presence of anxio-depressive disorder). Two scales: anxiety and depression. For each, scores range 0-21 (0-7: absence of anxious or depressive disorder; 8-10: possibility of an anxious or depressive disorder; 11-21: presence of anxious or depressive disorder).</description>

    <measure>Change in sleep difficulties</measure>
    <time_frame>T0 (before the intervention) and T1 (after the intervention : 6 months later).</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep difficulties (difficulties to stay asleep, to fall asleep...) and their severity. Measured by the Insomnia Severity Index. One score is calculated and ranges from 0 to 22 (0-7: absence of insomnia; 8-14: subclinical insomnia; 15-21: moderate insomnia; 22-28: severe insomnia).</description>

    <description>Our groupal intervention is divided into 6 monthly 2-hour sessions in which one self-hypnosis exercise is proposed to participants. Self-care techniques are also discussed (knowing our own needs, selfrespect, assertiveness, coping with ruminations...) and homework assignments are proposed to participants, in order to foster positive change.</description>
