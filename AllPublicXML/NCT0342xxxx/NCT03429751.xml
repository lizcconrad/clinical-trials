  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bedside lung ultrasound can detect pulmonary congestion by detecting the appearance of
      B-lines. Pulmonary edema may occur even without cardiomyopathy or heart failure, especially
      after excessive fluid administration. B-lines have been acknowledged as sonographic signs of
      pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema in critical and emergency care. Limited scientific
      evidence on optimal intraoperative fluid management has resulted in large variations of
      administered fluid regimens in daily practice. The restricted perioperative intravenous fluid
      regimen reduces complications after elective surgeries, however other studies had shown that
      intraoperative liberal fluid administration improves postoperative organ functions and
      recovery and shortens hospital stay after elective surgeries.

  <detailed_description>

      A review of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, excluding high-risk patients,
      compared liberal and restrictive ï¬‚uid regimens; concluded that it is difficult to define
      'liberal' or 'restrictive' protocols in clinical practice. patients undergoing moderate-risk
      surgery seem to benefit from the more liberal fluid administration, while patients undergoing
      high-risk or major surgery seem to benefit from restrictive or conservative strategies. Lung
      ultrasound used for comparison between liberal and restrictive fluid therapy in laparoscopic
      hysterectomy patients by detecting the B-lines intraoperatively or immediately
      postoperatively. The aim is to evaluate the lung ultrasound as a guide for intraoperative
      fluid management, being an index for increased extravascular lung water (ECLW). This
      operation is a moderately complex procedure that implies the Trendelenburg position. This
      position - in addition to liberal fluids - will increase venous return and increase the
      challenge on the cardiac muscle under anesthesia in these patients.
