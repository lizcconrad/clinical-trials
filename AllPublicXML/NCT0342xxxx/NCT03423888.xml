  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In palliative care, the relief of the dyspnea is necessary. Medications for the reduction of
      dyspnea have side effects. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) is a new way to
      deliver oxygen. Investigators hypothesize that HNFC is an acceptable technic for the patient
      with dyspnea in palliative care.

      A pilot study with 30 patients will be conducted. Acceptability of HNFC will be studied by
      the time of use by patients of the HNFC during one week. The effectiveness of HNFC in
      relieving dyspnea will be studied using Borg scale.

      Pilot study for acceptability of high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy in palliative care
      Population: 30 patients in palliative care (for lung cancer, terminal respiratory failure)
      who suffer from dyspnea and have oxygen therapy. Patients with curative care are excluded and
      patients who require non invasive ventilation.

      An oral consent is asked.

      Primary objective: acceptability of HNFC in patients with dyspnea in palliative care during
      one week

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Tolerance of HNFC at short term (1h and 24h) and long term (7 days) after initiation of
           HNFC

        -  Efficiency of HNFC at short term

      Primary outcome: duration of use of the HNFC during 7 days

      Secondary outcome:

        -  Tolerance: noise of the system of HNFC, side effects of high flow (nasal dryness..)

        -  Efficiency: evaluation of dyspnea by Borg scale and measure of respiratory rate and
           saturation of oxygen one hour after initiation of HNFC
