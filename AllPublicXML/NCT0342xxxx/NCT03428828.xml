  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of real-time functional
      magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training to increase the amygdala's
      response to positive autobiographical memories in patients with depression who are considered
      treatment-resistant

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to two-thirds of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) will not respond
      to standard pharmacological and psychological interventions and will be considered treatment
      resistant (TR-MDD). Decreased reactivity to positive stimuli, indexed by low amygdala
      reactivity to positive autobiographical memory recall, may be a causal mechanism interfering
      with recovery from TR-MDD. Previous work in our lab suggests that individuals who do respond
      to antidepressant medications show increased amygdala activity that is indistinguishable from
      controls relative to baseline, while TR-MDD individuals fail to show this increase in
      amygdala activity. Furthermore, the investigators have found that MDD participants (more
      generally, not specifically TR- MDD) are indeed able to increase their amygdala response
      during positive memory recall via real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training, and that
      this increase is associated with large and rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. Here, the
      investigators propose to evaluate whether rtfMRI-nf training to increase the amygdala
      response to positive memories may serve as an intervention for TR-MDD. 100 TR-MDD individuals
      will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive 5 amygdala rtfMRI-nf or 5
      control rtfMRI-nf sessions where they are trained to regulate a parietal region putatively
      not involved in emotional processing or MDD. The investigators will assess changes in
      amygdala activity, severity of clinical symptoms, and autobiographical memory deficits.
      Success will suggest a new non- pharmacological, non-invasive intervention for a
      traditionally treatment-resistant population of MDD individuals.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  right-handed adults (ages 18 - 55) with a primary diagnosis of MDD according to
             diagnostic criteria DSM-5 for recurrent MDD who are currently depressed will be
             recruited to participate

          -  must be able to give written informed consent prior to participation

          -  must have fewer than 45% memories categorized as specific on the Autobiographical
             Memory Test

          -  must have a SHAPS score &gt; 4, indicating the presence of anhedonia

          -  unmedicated or stable on an SSRI antidepressant regime (at least 3 weeks to ensure
             symptoms are stable)

          -  previously failed to respond to two previous SSRI medications according to either a
             medical record review or clinical interview during Visit 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have a clinically significant or unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine,
             neurological, gastrointestinal illness or unstable medical disorder

          -  met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol and/or substance dependence (other than nicotine)
             within 12 months prior to screening

          -  have a history of traumatic brain injury

          -  are unable to complete MRI scan due to claustrophobia or general MRI exclusions (e.g.,

             stimulants, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, or other medications (except SSRI
             antidepressants) likely to influence cerebral blood flow. Effective medications will
             not be discontinued for the purposes of the study. Inclusion of patients on stable
             antidepressant medications was decided in order to allow generalization towards a real
             world population

          -  have a DSM-5 diagnosis of psychotic or organic mental disorder, bipolar I or II
             disorder or any past or current manic or hypomanic symptoms, autism, or a primary
