  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol injection pain will be surfed by up to 70-80 percentage by the Patients who induced
      by propofol. Temperature of Operating room was set to a certain range in normal clinical
      practice, which is 22- 26 centigrade. Warm feeling will make skin vassal dilated and more
      blood will pass through to bring more heat out of our body. It had been reported that a
      bigger venous vessels will get less propofol injection pain.

      The investigators hypothesis that Patients who stayed in a warmer room temperature will surf
      less injection pain while compare to a normal setting room temperature.
