      Stress reactions in emergency physicians will be measures using cortol-awakening-reaction,
      heart-rate-variability and standardised stress questionnaires

      In a field study with within-subject design, there will be conducted the hormonal and
      physiological stress strain of emergency physicians working in rescue helicopters or van on
      different days of service on different headquarters. The investigation of the parameter of
      stress will be conducted on two days of rescue service, on two days of clinical service and
      as a control on two days off. The quantification of the hormonal stress strain will be
      carried out with the cortisol awakening response, there will be conducted 3 saliva samples
      with identical interval after getting up within 30 minutes. While the labour time on the
      rescue service and on the clinical service and the whole day off, the heart rate variability
      will show the degree of physiological stress. This will be measured with a pulse-belt on the
      chest, which the participant will carry the whole day. In addition, participants will fill
      out a set of questionnaire on the first day of measurement.
