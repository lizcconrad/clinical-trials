  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anaesthesia involves giving patients anaesthetic and muscle relaxant medications to
      allow transition to sleep and airway relaxation to permit laryngoscopy, respectively. During
      laryngoscopy, a breathing tube is placed to 'secure' the airway. There is therefore a length
      of time from administration of these medications to when the breathing tube is placed, when
      the patient is not breathing and the airway is not secured. This time is known as apnoea
      time. In a patient who is not breathing, blood oxygen levels fall to dangerously-low levels,
      within 1-2 minutes. In order to prevent this, patients breathe 100% oxygen before induction
      of anaesthesia as part of a process known as pre-oxygenation. There are different ways of
      delivering pre-oxygenation, but the common aim is to increase the oxygen reservoir within the
      lungs to give the anaesthetist more time to place the breathing tube. With good
      pre-oxygenation, apnoea times of up to 7 minutes are possible.

      Apnoea time is a potentially hazardous period during induction of anaesthesia and it is
      particularly so in patients with severe obesity. On the one hand, obesity makes the upper
      airway anatomy difficult, and on the other hand, lung collapse (atelectasis) caused by
      abdominal contents compressing the base of the lungs reduces the amount of oxygen available
      within the lungs. Apnoea time can be as short of 30 seconds. Identifying the most effective
      method of pre-oxygenating bariatric patients can therefore significantly improve the safety
      of delivering general anaesthesia to these patients.

      The purpose of the study is to compare effectiveness of different methods of achieving
      pre-oxygenation in bariatric patients. The investigators intend to compare facemask
      pre-oxygenation with a high-flow humidified nasal oxygen.

      The primary outcome measure of interest is time to desaturation to 92% or 18 minutes of
      apnoea.

    <time_frame>Eighteen (18) minutes maximum</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-oxygenation is delivered either by a standard anaesthetic face mask or the THRIVE technique. General anaesthesia is induced and muscle relaxation is given. The time for the peripheral oxygen saturations (SpO2) to fall to 92% is recorded. When this occurs the trial is stopped and the patient is intubated.
If 18 minutes is reached before SpO2 92% then the trial is stopped.</description>

    <description>The investigators will simultaneously record the ORI. The ORI readings will then be correlated with the SpO2 and arterial oxygen content.</description>
