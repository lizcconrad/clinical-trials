  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year a large number of patients undergo ileostomy surgery, a procedure in which a
      portion of the small intestine is attached to a hole in the abdominal wall, allowing for
      digested material to pass into a disposable bag worn attached to the skin. Ileostomies are
      performed for the treatment of a variety of diseases of the intestinal tract, such as
      inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal trauma, and gastrointestinal malignancy. Of the
      patients that undergo ileostomy surgery, 36% will require urgent medical care within the
      first 30 days of surgery. Most frequently, this is a result of dehydration due to excessive
      ostomy output. Thus, there is potential for significant improvement of the post-operative
      outcomes of ileostomy patients. Implementation of an automated text messaging system,
      EpxOstomy, can provide a way of monitoring patient's daily ostomy output and allow for timely
      intervention if output is outside normal limits, providing an effective way of improving
      patient outcomes while simultaneously reducing healthcare costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year thousands of patients undergo ostomy surgery in the treatment of diseases such as
      colorectal cancer, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, and ulcerative colitis. During the 30-day
      post-operative period, patients that undergo ileostomy have a 36.1% rate of acute healthcare
      encounter compared to 16.2% of patients undergoing similar surgery but with primary
      anastomosis. The 30-day hospital readmission rate for ileostomy patients due to dehydration
      and renal failure is 17%, with the median cost per colorectal surgery readmission being
      $8,885. Thus, there is substantial room for post-operative improvement in the care of
      ileostomy patients, both to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient quality of life. An
      automated text messaging system can provide a way to consistently monitor patients' ileostomy
      output, ensuring that patients are measuring their daily output as instructed and allowing
      for timely preemptive intervention should output be outside normal limits.
