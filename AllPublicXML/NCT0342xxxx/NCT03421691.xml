      This is a single-center prospective, open-label uncontrolled study in 15 male or female
      subjects, age 35 to 55 years who desire non-ablative laser treatment for facial
      photo-rejuvenation, specifically improvement of rhytides, lentigines, erythema,
      telangiectasia and skin texture. Subjects will receive up to 6 laser treatments spaced 2 to 4
      weeks apart and complete two follow-up visits; one at 4 weeks and one at 12 weeks post-final
      treatment.
