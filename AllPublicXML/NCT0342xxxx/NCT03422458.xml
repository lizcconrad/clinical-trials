  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that following the loss of a single tooth, severe hard- and soft-tissue
      alterations may take place within the affected site, resulting in a subsequent reduction of
      both vertical and horizontal ridge dimensions, often not allowing neither appropiate pontic
      fabrication nor correct placement of endosseous implants.

      Over the past 20 years, various surgical procedures, grouped under the term of &quot;alveolar
      ridge preservation&quot; (ARP), have been introduced, aiming to maintain the existing soft and
      hard tissue envelope as well as a stable ridge volume, simplifying subsequent treatment
      procedures and optimizing functional and esthetic outcomes. They have been widely tested in
      controlled and not controlled clinical studies with various materials and approaches, and a
      number of recently published systematic reviews on this topic have confirmed the efficacy of
      ARP in preventing post-extraction dimensional changes of alveolar ridges.

      After these procedures a minimum of four to six months must be awaited before implant
      insertion can be performed, bringing the patient compromised comfort, function and aesthetics
      and needing of a second surgical procedure for the implant placement.

      Dental implant insertion at the time of tooth extraction (type I or immediate placement)
      reduced the number of dental appointments, of surgeries required and the overall treatment
      time. Nevertheless this surgical protocol does not provide predictable outcomes, since it may
      contribute towards a more pronounced bone resorption during healing. Different anatomical
      factors, as the thickness of the buccal bone wall and the dimension of the horizontal gap,
      may influence the dimensional changes of the alveolar crest following immediate implant
      placement. Such morphological changes could lead to negative esthetic complications, such as
      marginal soft tissues recessions, especially when affecting the buccal side of maxillary
      sites in patients with a high smile line.

      It is unknown if immediate implant placement plus grafting materials and/or barrier membranes
      could influence post-extraction dimensional changes of alveolar ridges. No consensus exists
      on the need for bone augmentation simultaneously with immediate implant placement.
      Furthermore, no human study has yet compared dimensional changes of both hard and soft
      tissues after two different treatments: an alveolar ridge preservation technique for a
      subsequent implant placement, and an alveolar ridge preservation technique with an immediate
      implant placement.

      Hypothesis/Aims

      Primary hypotesis

      Placing an immediate implant into a fresh extraction site plus a bone substitute filling and
      a matrix covering could negatively modify the healing patterns and thus the tissue morphology
      of the ridge site with regard to:

        -  clinical hard tissues dimensions (bone width and height, bone volume)

        -  clinical soft tissues dimensions (soft tissues volume, keratinized tissues width and
           thickness, muco-gingival junction position's modifications, gingival color and texture,)

      Secondary hypothesis.

      Placing an immediate implant into fresh extraction site plus a bone substitute filling and a
      matrix covering could negatively influence tissue morphology of the preserved site with
      regard to:

        -  clinical hard tissues dimensions (bone width and height, bone volume)

        -  clinical soft tissues dimensions (soft tissues volume, keratinized tissues width and
           thickness, muco-gingival junction position's modifications, gingival color and texture,)

      Aims:

      The first aim of this study is to evaluate the possible impact on hard and soft tissue
      morphological changes of placing an immediate implant in post-extraction site treated by a
      bone substitute filling and a matrix covering.

      The second aim of this study is to compare hard and soft tissue morphological changes in a
      spontaneous healed extraction site versus a fresh extraction site treated by immediate
      implant placement plus a bone substitute filling and a matrix covering
