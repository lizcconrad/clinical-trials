  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DynamX stent study is a consecutive enrolling, prospective, multicenter clinical trial
      recruiting up to 50 patients at up to 10 international sites.

      Patients that require treatment of a single de novo lesion equal to or less than 14mm in
      length located in a coronary artery &gt;2.5 mm and &lt; 3.5 mm in diameter and meet all eligibility
      criteria will be invited to participate.

      After the stent implantation patients will be followed up clinically at 30 days, 180 days and
      annually for 3 years All patients will have an imaging follow up at either 6 months or 9
      months

      The objective of the study is to confirm the safety and performance of the DynamX
      Novolimus-eluting coronary stent system in de novo native coronary artery lesions. Patients
      will be followed up clinically at 30,180 days and annually for 3 years.

      The primary safety endpoint will be evaluated at 6 months. The primary imaging/efficacy
      endpoint will be evaluated at either 6 months or 9 months.

      Secondary clinical endpoints will be evaluated at each follow up time point.

          5. Target vessel was previously treated with any type of percutaneous coronary
             intervention (PCI) &lt; 6 months prior to index procedure
