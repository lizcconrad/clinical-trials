  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the combination of venetoclax and
      ibrutinib (administered up to 840 mg per day) might be useful for the treatment of CLL or SLL
      that is not responding or no longer responding to treatment with ibrutinib alone. The study
      will evaluate whether this regimen can reduce the amount of cancerous cells in your body. If
      you agree, you will receive ibrutinib at a dose of up to 840 mg a day by mouth, as well as
      venetoclax. Although both of these agents are approved by the FDA for the treatment of CLL or
      SLL, the combination and the dosing schedule of ibrutinib are considered experimental.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is phase 1 study for patients with CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) experiencing
      disease progression on single ibrutinib. This study will evaluate the optimal ibrutinib dose
      (including doses higher than 420 mg) when combined with venetoclax

      During the screening period, patients will continue on ibrutinib at their previous tolerated
      dose, unless required to stop (e.g.: by a preceding clinical trial).

      On cycle 1, day 1, the dose of ibrutinib will be assigned based on the dose cohort. Patients
      in cohort 1 will receive ibrutinib 420 mg PO daily. Patients in cohort 2 will receive
      ibrutinib 560 mg PO daily. Cohort 3 will be 840 mg PO daily.

      On cycle 1, day 1, patients will initiate venetoclax. The dose of venetoclax will ramp-up
      from 20 mg PO daily to 400 mg PO daily over a 5 week period.

      The primary safety endpoint is determination of DLTs during the first 35 days (completion of
      dose ramp up). The primary efficacy endpoint of overall response rate will be assessed on
      approximately Cycle 7, Day 1.

      Rationale: The optimal management of patients that progress on ibrutinib, including those
      with acquired Btk or PLCg2 mutations, is not determined. In other cancers, continued
      treatment with small molecule inhibitors beyond disease progression provides significant
      benefit, with additional agents or adjustments to ablate the resistant subclone. Venetoclax
      is approved for the treatment of patients with CLL, and is well-tolerated and effective in
      high-risk disease, and so is an appropriate agent for this trial.
