  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain management after shoulder surgery remains to be a major challenge. Reliance on a single
      agent (most commonly opioids) results in increased incidence of side effects. Multimodal pain
      management refers to the use of multiple drugs that target different components of pain
      pathway.This proposal aims to measure the quality of recovery and quality of pain management
      after shoulder surgery before and after implementation of a multimodal pain protocol.

    <time_frame>24 and 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>quality of pain management was measured using the revised american pain society patient oriented outcome questionnaire (APS-POQ-R). The questionnaire measures quality of pain management in 5 domains: 1- pain intensity 2- pain interference with activity and sleep 3- emotional side effects of uncontrolled pain ( affective scale). 4- patient perception of their pain management 5-side effects of pain treatment some questions answers are on a scale from 0-10. Ten is the maximum score and zero is the minimum score. other questions are listed as percentage with increments of 10% at a time (0%,10%, 20%, 30%..etc). each item/question is reported individually</description>
