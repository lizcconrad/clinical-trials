      The purpose of this investigation is to follow-up subjects who have completed participation
      in the Treatment Group of Protocol C-16-TS11 - &quot;Pivotal Study of the TruSculpt Radiofrequency
      Device for Circumferential Reduction&quot; for the long-term (18 months) safety and efficacy of
      the truSculpt radiofrequency (RF) device for circumferential reduction in the abdominal and
      flank region.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Completed participation in the Treatment Group of Protocol C-16-TS11 - &quot;Pivotal Study
             of the TruSculpt Radiofrequency Device for Circumferential Reduction&quot;

          2. Subject has maintained the same weight since enrolling in Protocol C-16-TS11 -
             &quot;Pivotal Study of the TruSculpt Radiofrequency Device for Circumferential Reduction&quot;,
             within 5% of baseline weight measurement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in a clinical trial of another device or drug in the target area since
             enrolling in Protocol C-16-TS11 - &quot;Pivotal Study of the TruSculpt Radiofrequency

             enrolling in Protocol C-16-TS11 - &quot;Pivotal Study of the TruSculpt Radiofrequency
             Device for Circumferential Reduction&quot; e.g., radiofrequency, cryolysis or light-based
             treatments.

          3. Any invasive cosmetic surgery to the target area, such as liposuction, since enrolling
