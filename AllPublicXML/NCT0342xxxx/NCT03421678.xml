  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the role of 1,3-butadiene metabolic activation and deactivation in
      lung cancer risk among various ethnic/racial groups. This project will require urine samples
      from smokers and nonsmokers from the three ethnic/racial groups recruited by the Clinical and
      Biomarker Core for the analysis of 1,3-butadiene DNA adducts. Data on nicotine intake
      (urinary TNE) in these subjects as well as in 400 lung cancer cases and 400 controls from
      Project 1 will be also required for this project.
