  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder in adolescence is prevalent and debilitating. Our group aims to
      improve treatment response through the use of an Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) based on a
      high quality Clinical Practice Guideline and measurement-based care (MBC; where periodic
      symptom scale scores are used to make treatment decisions). We propose a controlled clinical
      trial comparing ICP to treatment-as-usual (TAU) across two sites.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: There is a gap between what is known from the evidence about the treatment of
      adolescent depression and what is practiced. Moreover, while there is evidence that
      measurement-based care can improve outcomes for adults with various mental health conditions,
      there is limited information on this framework in adolescent depression.

      Objective: Our study aims to enhance the implementation of evidence-based care (using the
      NICE Clinical Practice Guidelines as a template) combined wtih measurement-based care through
      the use of an Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) in adolescents with depression.

      Hypothesis: As this is a pilot study, our hypotheses centre around feasibility. We
      hypothesize that: (1) we will recruit at least 30 participants to the ICP treatment arm and
      30 participants at the &quot;treatment-as-usual&quot; arm at a different site (2) that baseline
      measures will be fully completed by 95% of adolescents recruited, (3) that baseline measures
      will take 2 hours to complete for adolescents and 1 hour to complete for caregivers, (4) that
      a mean of 90% of the key aspects of the treatment protocol are followed in the ICP group (5)
      that 80% of participants recruited will complete measures at the end of the 20-week interval
      and that (6) 90% of the youth, caregivers and clinicians who partake int eh study will attend
      a focus group to provide qualitative feedback on their experience.

      Design: This is a non-randomized controlled clinical trial. Randomizing at the individual
      level is not possible - the intervention is implemented at the clinic level; so the effect of
      the intervention on one youth within a clinic would influence the care of other youth at the
      clinic.

      Sampling: Participants are recruited from psychiatric clinics at 2 sites. Each site will
      recruit to their respective treatment arm.

    <description>The CDRS-R is a 17-item measure rated by an evaluator after a semi-structured interview with the adolescent relating to symptoms of depression over the past 2 weeks. Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of over 55 interpreted as a moderate to severe rating. Lower values represent a better outcome.</description>

Raw scores are converted to age-standardized scores (T-Scores). T scores less than 67 are considered in the normal range, T scores ranging from 67-70 are considered to be borderline clinical, and T scores above 70 are in the clinical range.</description>

    <description>The intervention is an Integrated Care Pathway with 3 key components.
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) recommendations: The initial template of the treatment protocol was based on the NICE CPGs for Depression in Children and Young People.
Provider engagement: The clinicians at CAMH reviewed the template and collaboratively developed a flow chart defining the treatment protocol.
Measurement-based care: Feedback measures are taken every four weeks and the results are provided to the clinician, patient and family to inform treatment decisions. The feedback measures are the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS) and the General Functioning Domain of the McMaster Family Assessment Device (MFAD).</description>

    <description>The intervention is a integrated care pathway based on the NICE Clinical Practice Guidelines and measurement-based care in the form of a flow chart. Each decision point on the pathway is guided by results of self-report measures for depression (the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire), functional impairment (Columbia Impairment Scales) and family functioning (the McMaster Family Assessment Device). The results of these scales and protocol recommendations are fed back to the patients, families and clinicians in order to make further treatment decisions</description>
