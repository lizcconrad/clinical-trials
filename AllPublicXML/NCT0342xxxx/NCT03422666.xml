  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some of the fat (triglyceride) from the food humans eat gets stored in the bowel. This
      triglyceride can then be released into the blood when another meal is consumed or in response
      to hormones. How the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) releases the triglyceride
      from the gut is not known. The research team in this study is interested in finding out how
      teduglutide (a degradation resistant form of GLP-2) releases stored triglyceride from the gut
      by evaluating how blood lipoproteins respond to teduglutide in healthy individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lipoprotein response will be performed in 15 healthy individuals recruited by newspaper
      advertisements. Each subject will be their own control, receiving both placebo and
      teduglutide, administered on separate occasions. A member of the study team will explain the
      study in detail on visit 1, and if the individual is interested in participating, informed
      consent will be obtained and preliminary screening will occur on visit 2. On visit 3 &amp; 4
      participants will receive a high fat liquid meal after an overnight fast. Hourly blood
      samples will be taken for 5 hours, followed by randomized assignment to receive either
      subcutaneous placebo or teduglutide at visit 3 and the opposite treatment at visit 4.
      Following the injection, blood samples will be taken every 15 minutes for the first hour and
      every 30 minutes for the subsequent 3 hours.
