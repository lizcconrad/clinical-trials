    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the current prevalence and risk factors of hepatitis B
      virus (HBV) infection in a multi-ethnic neighbourhood situated in Middle Limburg, Belgium.
      Additionally, the investigators will determine linkage of care in hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg) positive subjects.

    <textblock>
      Although the HBV prevalence is generally low in Western countries, such as Belgium, pockets
      of higher HBV prevalence exist in areas with large immigrant populations. Therefore national
      prevalence figures can underestimate the burden of HBV infection. The prevalence of chronic
      HBV in the population-based study in 2003 is believed to be an underestimate due to
      under-representation of the non-Belgian population. Moreover, by this time there are no data
      regarding the risk factors for HBV infection in the general population of Belgium.

      Even in low-prevalence areas such as Belgium, HBV prevention and control is a public health
      priority, particularly since safe and effective vaccines are available. The aim of this study
      was to evaluate the current prevalence and risk factors of HBV infection in a multi-ethnic
      neighbourhood situated in Middle Limburg, Belgium. Additionally, the investigators will
      determine linkage of care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive subjects.
