  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous angioplasty with balloon dilation is the method of choice for the treatment of
      most femoropopliteal artery lesions. After balloon dilatation, arterial wall dissection with
      flow limiting dissection or recoil with residual stenosis often require additional procedures
      such as stent placement or prolonged balloon dilation. A shorter balloon inflation time of 30
      sec will be accompanied by a higher number of flow limiting dissection or recoil, demanding a
      time consuming and expensive stent placement or balloon redilatation. The effect of different
      balloon inflation times has only been assessed ones in peripheral balloon angioplasty with
      better outcomes after prolonged balloon inflation.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is to assess the difference in number of residual stenosis after balloon dilatation of the arterial lesion between both groups (3min and 5min). A residual stenosis (measured on the angiogram) responsible for an arterial stenosis of &gt;30% will be defined as unsuccessful treatment.
The group with the lowest number of arterial restenosis &gt;30% after dilatation has the best primary outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>at 3 or 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome of the study is to evaluate the difference in need of redilatation or provisional stenting after the first dilatation between both groups (3 vs 5min). If an arterial stenosis of &gt;30% after dilatation is measured, a redilatation of an additional stenting will be placed. The group with the lowest number of redilatation or additional stenting after dilatation has the best secondary outcome.</description>
