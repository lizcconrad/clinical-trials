        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects should read, sign and date an Informed Consent Form and be fully informed of
             possible adverse events prior to any study procedures.

          -  Subjects must agree to take effective contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy from
             2 weeks before screening until 3 months of last dose administration. Subjects must
             agree to avoid semen and blood donation until 3 months of last dose administration.

          -  Healthy male volunteers of 18-50 years old.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ranges from 18.0 to 28.0 kg/m2, body weight â‰¥ 50 kg.

             months.

          -  Subjects have difficulty to swallow or any clinical significant history of ongoing
             gastrointestinal problems which affect absorption of drugs.

          -  Received a prescription medicine within 2 weeks prior to study dosing.

          -  Received a non-prescription drugs, traditional Chinese medicine, health products
             within prior to study dosing.

          -  Received a special food (dragon fruit, grapefruit or other tropical fruit) or
             strenuous exercise within 1 week prior to study dosing. Regular use of any drugs known
             to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism within 30 days prior to study
             administration.

          -  Any anticipation in other trial within 3 months.

          -  Abnormal laboratory tests judged clinically significant.

          -  Positive test result for HBsAg, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAB, HCvAB, HIV antibody, Syphilis
             screening antibody.

          -  Received a caffeine/Xanthine beverages or food within 48 h prior to study dosing.

          -  Received an alcohol within 24 h prior to study dosing or positive test result for
             alcohol screening.

          -  Positive test result for drugs of abuse.

          -  Other reasons which, in the opinion of the medical sub-investigator, would prevent the
             subject from participating in the study.
