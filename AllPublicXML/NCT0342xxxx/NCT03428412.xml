  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial to compare the efficacy of
      two therapies for patients with AECOPD. 378 subjects will be randomly assigned to one
      therapies (conventional drug, and the combination of conventional drug and TCM) for 14 days
      treatment. After the treatment period, subjects in two arms will be followed up for 4 weeks.
      The primary outcomes will include COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and secondary outcomes include
      treatment failure rate, treatment success rate, hospitalization time, hospital admission
      rate, endotracheal intubation rate, mortality and quality of life (COPD-PRO, SF-36).
