  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, an abundance of methods has been developed to fix the
      mesh to the abdominal wall, including sutures (non-absorbable or absorbable), staples
      (non-absorbable or absorbable), clips, tacks (non-absorbable or absorbable) and (fibrin and
      synthetic) glues. Which fixation technique is superior, is still under evaluation. There is
      clearly a need for larger trials to obtain confident results on the safety and performance of
      glue mesh fixation and tack mesh fixation in LVHR. The hypothesis of this prospective,
      randomized controlled study is that post-operative pain at 4 to 6 weeks after mesh fixation
      with glue (LiquiBand® Fix 8™) will not differ compared to treatment with absorbable tacks
      during LVHR. A total of 510 patients will be recruited for this trial. This study will
      assess: pain, hernia recurrence, safety, procedural characteristics, technical success,
      analgesic intake, period to return to normal activity and quality of life.

    <description>The VAS scale contains a 0 - 100 grading with 0 equaling no pain and 100 equaling the worst conceivable pain.
