  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the balanced fluids therapy change
      plasma osmolality in neurosurgical procedures due to brain tumors, meningeomas and
      arterio-venous malformation.

  <detailed_description>

      Normal saline or 0.9% sodium chloride solution is the most commonly used intravenous fluid
      worldwide and its composition are 154 mmol Na+ and 154 mmol Cl- per litter with osmolality of
      308 mOsmol/L. That composition is not &quot;normal&quot; because plasma contains potassium in range
      between 137-146 mmol/L, and chloride in range between 98-106 mmol/L, with plasma osmolality
      of 280-295 mOsmol/kg. Recently published data suggested detrimental effects of chloride rich
      fluids on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, urine output and acute kidney
      injury. One alternative to saline solution is a buffered, balanced, crystalloid solution with
      an electrolyte composition similar to plasma and osmolality between 286-295 mOsmol/L. Someone
      could indicate that such balanced solutions are not suitable for neurosurgical patients
      because of a possible impact on the brain edema development.
