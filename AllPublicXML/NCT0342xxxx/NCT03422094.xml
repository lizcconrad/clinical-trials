                  creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy is permitted provided dosing is no greater than 4 mg
             per day (dexamethasone or equivalent) on the day of vaccine administration.

             avoid high dose of corticosteroids.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation, including at least 5 months (for women of
             childbearing potential) and at least 7 months (for men) after last dose of study drug.

             resected without need for adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy.

          -  Receiving any other investigational agents within 4 weeks of beginning study
             treatment.

          -  Known allergy, or history of serious adverse reaction to, vaccines such as

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to poly-ICLC or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  History of pre-existing immunodeficiency disorder or autoimmune condition requiring
             immunosuppressive therapy. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative
             colitis, Crohn's disease, systemic vasculitis, scleroderma, psoriasis, multiple
             sclerosis, hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid arthritis,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, or other rheumatologic
             disease or any other medical condition or use of medication which might make it
             difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or to generate an
             immune response to vaccines.

          -  Presence of clinically significant increased intracranial pressure (e.g. impending
             herniation) or hemorrhage, uncontrolled seizures, or requirement for immediate
             palliative treatment.
