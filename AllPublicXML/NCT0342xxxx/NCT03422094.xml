        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed histologically confirmed unmethylated glioblastoma multiforme (WHO
             grade IV). Patients with secondary glioblastoma, in particular those who are IDH1 or
             IDH2 mutant, will not be excluded. Unmethylated MGMT must be confirmed by a PCR-based
             assay.

             provide germline (PBMC) and tumor DNA/RNA samples of adequate quality for sequencing.
             (Acquisition of specimens for sequencing and the sequencing itself may be done as part
             of routine care or another research project.)

               -  Creatinine ≤ IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with
                  creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Systemic corticosteroid therapy is permitted provided dosing is no greater than 4 mg
             per day (dexamethasone or equivalent) on the day of vaccine administration.

          -  Bevacizumab will be allowed if given for symptomatic control of vasogenic edema and to
             avoid high dose of corticosteroids.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation, including at least 5 months (for women of
             childbearing potential) and at least 7 months (for men) after last dose of study drug.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she must inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As this study aims to assess the immunogenicity of various vaccine plus adjuvant
             combinations, no prior immunotherapy will be permitted.

          -  Inadequate tissue acquisition to allow for neoantigen screening.

          -  No candidate neoantigen identified during screening.

             skin cancer, any in situ cancer that has been successfully resected and cured, treated
             superficial bladder cancer, or any early-stage solid tumor that was successfully
             resected without need for adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy.

          -  Receiving any other investigational agents within 4 weeks of beginning study
             treatment.

          -  Known allergy, or history of serious adverse reaction to, vaccines such as
             anaphylaxis, hives, or respiratory difficulty.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to poly-ICLC or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  History of pre-existing immunodeficiency disorder or autoimmune condition requiring
             immunosuppressive therapy. This includes inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative
             colitis, Crohn's disease, systemic vasculitis, scleroderma, psoriasis, multiple
             sclerosis, hemolytic anemia, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid arthritis,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, or other rheumatologic
             disease or any other medical condition or use of medication which might make it
             difficult for the patient to complete the full course of treatments or to generate an
             immune response to vaccines.

          -  Presence of clinically significant increased intracranial pressure (e.g. impending
             herniation) or hemorrhage, uncontrolled seizures, or requirement for immediate
             palliative treatment.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 7 days of first dose of vaccine.
