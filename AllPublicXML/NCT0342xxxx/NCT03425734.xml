      I. Study design: open/ blinded randomized, controlled study.

      II. Study setting and location:

      The study will be conducted in Abul Reesh Paediatric Hospital Faculty of Medicine /Cairo
      University from 2016-2018.

      III. Study population:

      This controlled open/blinded labelled randomized study is designed to include 40 children of
      both sexes scheduled for open-heart surgery for total correction of congenital heart
      diseases.

      IV. Eligibility Criteria:

      Inclusion criteria;

        1. Paediatric patients of age group ranging from 6 months to 12 years .

        2. Patients with complex congenital heart disease undergoing open heart surgery for total
           correction of the cardiac anomaly using cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Exclusion criteria;

        -  Age less than 6 months or more than12 years.

        -  Significant ventricular dysfunction (Ejection fraction &lt; 40%).

        -  Patients with pre-existing CNS disorders e.g.: seizures.

        -  Patients with abnormal liver functions.

        -  Pre-operative creatinine level &gt;1.2 mg /dl.

        -  Patients with history of diabetes mellitus.

        -  Patients receiving NSAID for any reason. Study Protocol; The patients will be
           pre-medicated by atropine 0.01mg/kg, ketamine 0.03mg/kg and midazolam 0.02mg/kg IM, 30
           minutes before induction of anesthesia. Standard ASA monitors, including
           electrocardiogram (ECG), pulse oximetry (Spo2), and non-invasive blood pressure cuff,
           and INVOS somatic oximeter probes will be placed on the renal area (on the back to the
           right or to the left from T10 to l2) will be placed on the patients before induction of
           anesthesia.

      Anesthetic technique will be standardized for all the patients in the form of inhalational
      induction using sevoflurane 6% in a mixture of oxygen and air (1:1) to be followed by
      placement of peripheral intravenous cannula. Intubation will be facilitated by pancuronium
      0.01 mg/kg IV and ventilation will be controlled using pressure mode aiming to maintain PCO2
      between (30-35 mmHg). Anesthesia will be maintained by mixture of 2% sevoflurane in 1:1
      oxygen: air till time of CPB.

      A standard CPB technique will be used in all patients. Before aortic cannulation, patients
      will receive IV heparin 400 U.kg-1 aiming to produce ACT value &gt; 400 sec. A membrane
      oxygenator (minimax plus ;Medtronics Inc.,Anaheim,CA) will be used during CPB. Priming
      solution in the form of isotonic saline solution supplemented with heparin added to fresh
      whole blood in appropriate amounts to achieve a hematocrit 20-25% during CPB will be used.
      Furosemide in a dose of 1mg .kg-1.min-1 will be given to all patients. Venting of left heart
      will be performed with a left atrial vent inserted through a small incision at the
      inter-atrial septum . Anesthesia during CPB will be given by Sevoflurane administrated via a
      vaporizer inserted into the oxygenator gas supply with a constant gas flow 3 liter.min-1. A
      non-pulsatile roller pump (model10.10.00;Stocket instruments ;Munich, Germany) will be used
      and the pump flow will be adjusted at 2.4 to 2.6 L/min /m2 during the normothermic period
      targeting mean arterial blood pressure between 40 and 60 mmHg. If the MAP will fall below 40
      mmHg despite full perfusion pressure, a bolus dose of 0.01-0.1 ng /Kg phenylephrine will be
      given. If MAP increased above 60 mmHg, a continuous infusion of nitroglycerin at a dose of
      1-2 µg.kg.min-1will be given.

      After application of aortic cross clamp and administration of cold cardioplegia solution
      (Saint Thomas cardioplegic solution, 20ml/Kg to be followed by doses of 10ml/Kg every 20
      min.), time will be allowed to develop a stable level of perfusion pressure and moderate
      hypothermia (28°C-32°C).

      These variables will be kept constant for at least 10 minutes after initiation of full flow
      CPB and initiation of the study sequence. Thereafter, patients will be randomely allocated to
      DEX group (Group D n=20) receiving dexmedetomidine in a dose of 3 mcg/kg over 10 minutes to
      be followed by an infusion of 1 mcg/kg/hr to be continued until the first 6 postoperative
      hours.
