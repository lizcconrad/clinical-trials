  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic cells in tumors have less oxygen than normal cells do, which leads to several changes
      inside the cells that lead to genetic chages making these cells resistant to treatment. The
      end result of this is increased tumor growth, spread of the tumor and poor outcome. Early
      studies have shown that [131]I-IAZA scans can help detect if there are hypoxic cells in the
      tumor. A [131]I-IAZA scan is a nuclear medicine test used to create pictures of the whole
      body after [131]I-IAZA is injected into a vein. Further scientific research will help
      understand how [131]I-IAZA is distributed throughout the body and how it can be used to treat
      hypoxic tumor cells.

      The purpose of this study is to :

        1. Demonstrate the safety of [131]I-IAZA

        2. To Determine the biodistribution and tumor avidity of [131]I-IAZA in patients with
           locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

        3. To determine the optimal imaging time of [131]I-IAZA SPECT.

        4. To collect data from imaging and plasma sampling for radiopharmacokinetic analysis of
           [131]I-IAZA.

        5. To determine whole body dosimetry of [131]I-IAZA in selected patients.

        6. To evaluate tumor dosimetry of [131]I-IAZA in patients with positive uptake.

        7. To determine the radiation dose accrued in hypoxic tumors.

      The proposed clinical trial will be a Phase I/II open-label, single site,
      radiopharmacokinetic and radiodosimetric study in participants with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. All participants will be administered oral potassium iodide tablets
      to block radioactive iodine uptake in the thyroid. After administration of 185 MBq
      [131]I-IAZA (range: 150 - 220 MBq), all participants will undergo a series of up to six whole
      body planar scans on a dual headed gamma camera, and blood sampling for radiopharmacokinetic
      evaluation. A single fecal sample will be collected for up to 5 participants 24 - 72 hours
      post-injection, if possible, and assessed for total radioactivity. A safety evaluation will
      be conducted on the first 10 consecutively enrolled participants (safety sub-group),
      consisting of: Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) pre-injection and 6 weeks ±1 week
      post-injection; vital signs pre-injection and after scans 3 and 4; haematology, and SMA-12
      serum biochemistry profile pre-injection and after scans 3 and 4; and an AE assessment at
      each imaging time point, up to 8 days post-injection. The safety evaluation for the remaining
      participants will consist of an AE assessment at each imaging time point, up to 8 days
      post-injection of [131]I-IAZA.

      The radiodosimetry of [131]I-IAZA in different tissues will be determined in the first 5
      consecutively enrolled participants from the planar images and the measured radioactivity in
      the fecal samples, if available. SPECT/CT imaging of the tumor(s) will be acquired at 19-36
      hours post-injection for all the participants and will be used along with the planar images
      to determine the radiodosimetry and pattern of dose distribution within the tumor(s).
      Dosimetry data will be potentially correlated with the participants' health status, or other
      relevant information, as applicable .
