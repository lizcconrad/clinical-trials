  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate budesonide levels in the blood following
      inhalation of single doses of VR647 Inhalation Suspension in children with wheezing, reactive
      airway disease or mild asthma using a nebulizer, the VR647 Inhalation System. Secondary
      objectives include the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of VR647 Inhalation
      Suspension administered using the VR647 Inhalation System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of four visits; a screening visit (Visit 1), two dosing days (Visits 2 and
      3) and a follow-up visit (Visit 4). On each dosing day a single dose of treatment will be
      administered. Blood samples will be collected on eight occasions from pre-dose up to 8 hours
      post-dose at each dosing visit. Treatment allocation at Visits 2 and 3 is determined by a
      balanced incomplete block design.

      The screening period (including Visit 1) is between 2 and 30 days duration; there is a
      washout period of 4 to 10 days between each dose (Visits 2 and 3) and the follow-up safety
      assessment (Visit 4) will occur 5 to 9 days after Visit 3. Subjects and their parent(s)/legal
      guardian(s) have the option of an overnight stay the day before dosing (Day -1, Visit 2 and
      Day 7, Visit 3).

             safety of the subject. The sponsor's medical officer should be consulted in case of
             any doubt.

          -  Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episode(s) requiring
             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, hypoxic seizures,
             or asthma-related syncopal episodes.

          -  Subjects currently using long-acting β2-agonists.

          -  Use of the following prescription medications within 28 days prior to the first
             treatment day: corticosteroids by any route and drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450
