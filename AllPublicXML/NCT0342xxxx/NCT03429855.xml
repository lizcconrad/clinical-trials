  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In stroke patients, the impairment of the trunk affects many functions negatively. For this
      reason\ training of the trunk is necessary in the early period. Taking into account of
      literature, various approaches have been used to improve sitting balance and trunk control
      such as conventional physiotherapy for stroke patients . Bobath concept is another method
      used for stroke rehabilitation. When the studies about stroke rehabilitation are
      investigated, it is seen that most of the studies included only chronic patients and Bobath
      concept did not adequately take place in literature about trunk training. The aim of this
      study is to determinate effectiveness of the Bobath based trunk training on trunk control in
      acute stroke patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale (by Verheyden)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline the scale score at 20th days in hospital</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 3 subscales of static and dynamic sitting balance and trunk coordination, scored up to 7, 10, and 6 points, respectively.The total scores range between 0 and 23 points, where a higher score indicates better truncal function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Control Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline the scale score at 20th days in hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The test consists of four items which are assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale.The total score for the Trunk Control Test ranges from minimum 0 to maximum 100 points, a higher score indicating a better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline the scale score at 20th days in hospital</time_frame>
    <description>It contains three items assessing trunk performance. Each item is scored on a 7-point ordinal scale, a higher score indicating a better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline the scale score at 20th days in hospital</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was developed to measure balance among older people with impairment in balance function by assessing the performance of functional tasks. It is a valid instrument used for evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions and for quantitative descriptions of function in clinical practice and research. The BBS has been evaluated in several reliability studies.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>independently sitting time</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline sitting time at 20th days in hospital</time_frame>
    <description>Sitting with back unsupported without using hands but feet supported on floor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glasgow Coma Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, on 7th, 10th and 20th days during the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It assessed the initial and subsequent level of consciousness in a person after a brain injury. Mild head injuries are generally defined as those associated with a Glasgow Coma scale score of 13-15.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Rankin Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, on 7th, 10th and 20th days during the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) is the most commonly used to evaluate the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke. It describes &quot;global disability&quot; with a focus on mobility. The MRS is an ordered scale coded from 0 (no symptoms at all) through 5 (severe disability) 6 (death).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, on 7th, 10th and 20th days during the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) evaluates self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, communication, and social cognition. The FIM item scores range from 1 (total assistance required) to 7 (complete independence). A higher score indicates a greater degree of independence with regard to daily living activities. This subscale has good psychometric properties for stroke patients.</description>
