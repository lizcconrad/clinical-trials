      The purpose of this study is to find out if transplant of fecal matter (stool), also known as
      fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), from a healthy person into the intestines of children
      and young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

      For this study children between the ages of 5-17years will be recruited over 2 years.
      Children will be recruited who receive an ASD diagnosis using the gold-standard Autism
      Diagnosis Observation Schedule -2 (ADOS-2) using module 1, 2 or 3 (none, limited or no
      moderate expressive language). Children diagnosed with these modules of the ADOS-2 may be at
      greater risk for GI disorders and rigid-compulsive behaviors. Additional assessment of
      rigid-compulsive behaviors and social communication will be done using the Repetitive
      Behavioral Scales-Revised (RBS-R) and Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2), respectively.
      KBIT (the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test) is used at baseline to obtain patient IQ. Total
      evaluation time is approximately 90 minutes. Following baseline symptom evaluation, a medical
      exam will be performed to determine whether each child is expressing specific GI symptoms. In
      addition, parents will fill out the Questionnaire for Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms-
      Rome III (QPGS-III). Once an ASD diagnosis is confirmed, FMT treatment will be initiated,
      which typically occurs within 4-6 weeks of the initial diagnosis. Half 50% of the children
      (n=5) will receive the equivalent of 50 g of stools from a healthy donor into the jejunum
      through upper endoscopy and the other 50% off children (n=5) will receive Saline solution as
      Placebo control through upper endoscopy.

      Subjects will have a total of 5 visits within 24 weeks including phone call follow up on Day
      7 after FMT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 in 60 children are diagnosed with ASD, a dramatic increase from the start of the
      21st century. Although most children with ASD exhibit core social communication deficits,
      very limited interests, repetitive behaviors and sensory problems, the severity of symptoms
      and how well each child responds to standard behavioral therapies can vary tremendously from
      patient to patient. This makes it difficult to enact effective interventions. Other variables
      also influence the outcomes for ASD patients, including age at first diagnosis, access to
      care, the quality of treatments and the expertise of interventionists.

      Children with ASD also have medical disturbances, which affects their quality of life and
      compliance in intervention programs. For example, approximately 40 percent of children with
      ASD have gastrointestinal disturbances (GIDs). Genetics plays a substantial role in risk, but
      scientists also have determined that non-heritable factors can trigger the expression and
      severity of ASD symptoms. Clinical research studies from PI laboratories have focused on the
      gut-brain link that influences ASD symptoms, how a child functions and even responds to
      interventions .

      The investigators hypothesize that children with ASD will tolerate single endoscopic delivery
      of fecal transplant therapy which will modify their gut microbial profile leading to
      reduction of repetitive and rigid-compulsive behaviors, based on the Repetitive Behavioral
      Scales-Revised (RBS-R). Secondary outcomes include improved score in social responsiveness
      scale and gastrointestinal symptoms . Investigators propose a phase I safety study for the
      use of FMT in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

    <description>Secondary endpoints will include cognitive improvement using language use in a 10 minute interactive session, Social Responsiveness Scale-2. The SRS-2 is newly available (Western Psychological Services). It is a parent 65-item questionnaire that provides a continuous quantitative measure of three DSM domains, including social behavior, communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors, normed in typically developing (T-score=50, sd=10) and ASD populations. The SRS-2 offers new DSM-5 subscales. The SRS is used in a variety of clinical and research settings. T-scores of 65 correlate highly with an ASD diagnosis, but do not substitute for the ADOS. Changes in SRS T-scores have been used as a measure of social behavior change over time.</description>
