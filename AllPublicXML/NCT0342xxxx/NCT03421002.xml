  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of micafungin
      administered to neonates suffering from systemic candidiasis. This study will also evaluate
      the proportion of success and of failure of the therapy with micafungin among treated
      neonates and will identify a conversion factor to relate plasma levels of micafungin into
      capillary and venous blood measured through blood samples from the heel and from a peripheral
      vein, collected simultaneously. Safety of micafungin in neonates will also be assessed.
