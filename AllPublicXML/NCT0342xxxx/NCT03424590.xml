    <textblock>
      Clearblue Connected Ovulation Test System (COTS) has been designed for home use by women who
      are either planning or trying for a pregnancy. This study will determine the difference in
      pregnancy rate of female volunteers seeking to get pregnant who use COTS in comparison to
      those not using an ovulation product to assist with conception.
