  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in understanding the biology of
      cancer and this information has been used to improve cancer care and patient outcome.

      Research has shown that changes in some genes and/or proteins may be important indicators for
      certain cancers and response to treatments. Genes are molecules made up of ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA contain instructions for the development and
      functioning of the cells in the body and are passed down from parent to child. RNA is
      involved with producing proteins in the body. Further research is needed to better understand
      the changes found in cancer cells and how to target them to stop or reduce cancer growth.

      A drug that may be able to block certain specific cancer cell changes is called &quot;targeted
      therapy&quot;. Different people with the same type of cancer receiving the same drug could have
      different responses to it. For example, one person may experience a reduction of their tumor
      while another person's cancer may worsen. The reason for this is still not well understood
      and could lie in gene changes.

      Understanding these changes may allow researchers to predict how treatments may work in
      guiding decisions around choice of drugs.

      The purpose of the study is to learn more about gene changes or protein expression (levels)
      of tumors to better understand the behavior of gynecological diseases and, if possible,
      better address participants' cancer care now or in the future.

    <description>Depending on the status of disease when participants join the study, a sample of tumor tissue may be collected from:
A previous surgery for the disease,
A biopsy for diagnosing the disease,
Other surgical procedures done for clinical management or possible cancer related complications (e.g., bowel obstruction).
In addition:
At anytime participants require a biopsy as a part of their cancer care, a sample of that tumor tissue will be collected.
New biopsies will be done to collect fresh tumor tissue each time participants' disease worsens.</description>

    <description>Blood samples will be collected at the following different times points:
Before starting a new line of treatment for the disease,
One week after starting a new line of treatment for the disease,
During treatment, at each radiological assessment (imaging scan) that will be done to check the status of the disease,
At the time the disease worsens or relapses (comes back)
During observation/follow-up, at the time of any radiological assessments that will be done to check the status of the disease</description>
