      This is a randomized, open-label, interventional, controlled study to determine the effects
      of Zaltrap on Neovascularized Wet Macular Degeneration as compared to the control
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (&quot;anti-VEGF&quot;) injections (bevacizumab, ranibizumab,
      or aflibercept).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are age 50-99

          -  Have neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration (&quot;AMD&quot;) with an eye undergoing
             maintenance treatment with one or more of the following anti-VEGF drugs: bevacizumab,
             ranibizumab, or aflibercept.

          -  Have an eye undergoing treatment that is of low visual potential (20/200 Snellen
             equivalent or worse) and the contralateral eye must have better visual potential.

          -  Are willing and able to provide signed informed consent and willing to undertake all
             scheduled study-related assessments, visits, and treatments.

          -  Have received an intravitreal injection of one of the drugs listed above within 120
             days of Day 1 of the trial.

          -  Both males and females will be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active intraocular inflammation or infection

          -  History of vitreous hemorrhage within three months prior to Day 1 of the study

          -  Uncontrolled ocular hypertension or glaucoma in the study eye (defined as Intraocular
             Pressure (&quot;IOP&quot;) &gt;25 mm Hg or a Cup to Disc ratio &gt; 0.8 despite treatment with
             anti-glaucoma medication) or any such condition which the investigator feels may
             warrant a glaucoma filtering surgery during the study

          -  History of stroke within the last three months prior to Day 1 of the study

          -  History of myocardial infarction within the last three months prior to Day 1 of the
             study

          -  Undergone intraocular surgery or laser treatments within the last three months,

          -  Significant Epiretinal Membrane (&quot;ERM&quot;) or Vitreomacular Traction (&quot;VMT&quot;) causing
             distortion of macular anatomy

          -  No use of ocular corticosteroids within the last six months and no use of systemic
             corticosteroids at a dose of &gt;10 mg/day

          -  Not have active malignancies within the last 12 months except appropriately treated
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, melanoma, and prostate cancers treated with a
             curative intent

          -  Inability to comply with study or follow-up procedures

          -  Women who may become pregnant or lactating or intend to become pregnant during the
             study

          -  Women who are of childbearing potential, including women who have had tubal ligation,
             must have a blood test within 21 days prior to Day 1 of the study. A woman is
             considered to not be of childbearing potential if she is postmenopausal or has
             undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal is defined as 12
             consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause.
