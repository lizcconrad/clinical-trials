    <measure>Percentage of participants with Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) active disease</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>ASDAS active disease is defined as ΔASDAS-CRP≥0.9. The ASDAS is a composite disease activity outcome measure which combines patient reported back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global assessment of disease activity, patient assessment of peripheral joint pain and swelling and an acute phase reactant (CRP or ESR) as an objective measure of inflammation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient global assessment of disease activity</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>Participant rated instrument to measure participants' global assessment of disease activity on a 10 cm visual analogue scale, ranging from no activity to highest possible activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed the total back pain they had in the previous 1 week on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>A numeric rating scale was used, for questions 1-5 (Fatigue, Spinal Pain, Joint pain or Swelling, Discomfort and Morning stiffness severity respectively) on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). Question 6 (morning stiffness duration) was recorded on a scale of 0 (0 or more hours) to 10 (2 hours). To give the five major Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) symptoms equal weighting, the average of the two scores relating to morning stiffness was taken. This averaged morning stiffness score was then summed with the remaining 4 questions, resulting in a composite score on a scale of 0-50, which was then divided by 5 to give the final BASDAI score on a scale of 0-10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>The BASFI is a participant's self-assessment represented as a mean (VAS; 0 to 10) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the participant's functional anatomy and 2 of which relate to a participant's ability to cope with everyday life. An increase along the scale indicates a worsening condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>BASMI is an objective measure of spinal mobility. The BASMI score is composed of 5 measures: cervical rotation, intermalleolar distance, modified Schober's test, lateral flexion and tragus to wall distance. Each measure was scored 0-2 (0=normal mobility, 2=severe reduction) to give a final score ranging 0 to 10.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, generic instrument for describing and valuing health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Chest Expansion</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>Chest expansion, measured in cm, is defined as the difference in thoracic circumference during full expiration versus full inspiration, measured at the fourth intercostal space (nipple line). Chest expansion was measured for both maximum and minimum inhalation and the data presented below combined both the values.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Index (MASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>The MASES evaluation will be conducted at the designated study visits to assess the presence or absence of enthesitis at 13 different sites, noting the subjects' responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Number of swelling and tendons affected by enthesitis</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of 44 swelling joints and 46 tendons joints will be done by physical examination at the designated study visits. Joint swelling will be classified as present (1), absent (0), replaced (9), or no assessment (NA).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood samples: C-reactive protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 (baseline) to Week48</time_frame>
