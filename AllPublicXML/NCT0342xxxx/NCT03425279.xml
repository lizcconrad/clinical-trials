  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of BA3011, a conditionally active
      biologic (CAB) AXL-targeted antibody drug conjugate (CAB-AXL-ADC) in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      This study will consist of a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.
