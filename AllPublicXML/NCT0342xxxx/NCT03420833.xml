  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients who have mild heart failure (HF) and left bundle
      branch block (LBBB).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Left Ventricle End-Systolic Volume Index (LVESVI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>LVESVI is the volume of blood in the left ventricle at the end of contraction, or systole, and the beginning of filling, or diastole.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Not Experiencing Any System-Related Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, approximately 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a composite endpoint; system-related complications could include any of the following: device pocket hematoma, pneumothorax, myocardial perforation, lead dislodgement, lead revision and device-related infection.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Admitted to the Hospital for Heart Failure</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Whose N-Terminal Pro B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) Increases by 30%</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NT-proBNP is a substance that is produced in the heart and released when the heart is stretched and working hard to pump blood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Experience Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia or Fibrillation Greater than 30 Seconds</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In ventricular tachycardia, abnormal electrical signals in the ventricles cause the heart to beat faster than normal, usually 100 or more beats a minute, out of sync with the upper chambers. Ventricular fibrillation is the most serious cardiac rhythm disturbance. The lower chambers quiver and the heart can't pump any blood, causing cardiac arrest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Experience a Decrease in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) to ≤35%</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>LVEF refers to how well your left ventricle (or right ventricle) pumps blood with each heart beat. Most times, EF refers to the amount of blood being pumped out of the left ventricle each time it contracts. The left ventricle is the heart's main pumping chamber.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P)</intervention_name>
    <description>A pacemaker is an implantable, battery-powered minicomputer that sends electrical pulses to the heart whenever it detects a slow heartbeat or no heartbeat at all. When it senses a slow heartbeat or lack of heartbeat, it sends electrical impulses to restore a normal rhythm. Cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers, or CRT-Ps, treat heart failure by resynchronizing electrical impulses in the heart's four chambers, improving the heart's ability to pump blood to the body effectively and efficiently.</description>
