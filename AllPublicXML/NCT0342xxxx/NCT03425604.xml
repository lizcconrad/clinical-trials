  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an ART that provides good results in selected patients,
      improving their reproductive prognosis. Endometriosis I y II, according to ASRM
      classification, remains an indication to perform IUI. This indication is on continuous
      debate, considering that different studies have shown controversial results about it, due to
      the poor reproductive outcomes in this group of patients
