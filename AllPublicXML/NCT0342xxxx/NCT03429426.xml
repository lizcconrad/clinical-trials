  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, regular X-ray examination is not sufficiently sensitive for detecting progression of
      bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis, but a new type of high-resolution CT scanner, the
      High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) can detect very early
      and minor joint injuries.

      The purpose of this study is to use HR-pQCT techniques to look at the damage and disease
      activity progression in the hand and wrist joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of the trial is an observational study with three distinct groups. At the start of
      the trial period and at one-year of follow-up, the trial subject will have their hand X-rayed
      by conventional radiography, and their metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and wrist scanned by
      HR-pQCT-Imaging. The 28-joint Disease Activity Score(DAS28-CRP), Health Assessment
      Questionnaire (HAQ), Visual analogue scale(VAS)-score for pain, fatigue and quality of life
      are performed to investigate the correlation between radiographic changes and disease
      activity. Blood samples are collected to investigate serological markers of bone metabolism
      and inflammation and the radiographic changes. The following groups are investigated:

        -  Rheumatoid Arthritis(RA): Patients with RA ≥5 years according to the ACR/EULAR 2010
           classification criteria or the American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised criteria are
           recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Rheumatology, Aarhus
           University Hospital. Treatment will be adjusted according to the patient's need and
           according to national guidelines. (n=450)

        -  Pre-RA patients: Patients with pre-RA, (joint pain, but no swelling and Anti-CCP 3 times
           above the upper limit) are recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of
           Rheumatology, Aarhus University Hospital. (n=75)

        -  Healthy subjects: Healthy age- and sex-matched Individuals are recruited, as a control
           group, by posting at libraries in Aarhus, Aarhus University, Aarhus University Hospital
           and postings on the websites www.forsøgsperson.dk and www.Sundhed.dk. (N=100)
