      A Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study of LAM-003 in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of LAM-003 across a range of LAM 003 dose levels
      when administered to subjects with previously treated relapsed or refractory AML.

      Subjects will self-administer oral LAM 003 either once or twice per day as long as they are
      safely benefitting from therapy. Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled at
      progressively higher dose levels of LAM 003 using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design.
      Based on the pattern of dose-limiting toxicities observed in the first 4 weeks of therapy,
      escalation will proceed to define a recommended LAM-003 dosing regimen.
