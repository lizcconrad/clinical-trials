    <textblock>
      270 intramural hematoma patients with clinical and imaging follow up were retrospectively
      studied in present study. The primary endpoint was consisted of aortic disease-related death,
      aortic dissection, penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer , thickening of aorta hematoma
      and aortic complications requiring surgical or endovascular treatment.

        From February 2003 to May 2017, 1770 consecutive patients were diagnosed with AAS at the
        General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region, including 270 IMH patients, of which 123
        patients were retrospectively examined. Thirty-nine patients presented with type A aortic
        IMH, and 84 presented with type B aortic IMH
