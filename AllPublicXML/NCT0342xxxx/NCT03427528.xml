  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During this project the investigators will develop and pilot test a companion intervention
      for fathers (Fathers and Babies-FAB), to supplement the Mothers and Babies Course (MB) that
      provides stress and mood management tools for home visiting clients. Focus groups with prior
      study participants, their male partners, and home visiting staff will be used to develop the
      FAB curriculum and protocol. FAB text messages aim to improve the mental health of the male
      partner and help him support his partner's mental health. Feasibility, acceptability, and
      outcome measures will be supplemented with assessments of fathers' mental health and
      partners' relationships. Participant assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3 and 6
      months in this uncontrolled pilot study. The public health significance and innovation of
      this project is substantial. If the investigators are able to integrate MB-TXT and MB-DAD
      into home visiting programs and generate improved mental health outcomes for home visiting
      clients and their partners, the investigators will be prepared to replicate this intervention
      across home visiting programs nationally at a time when home visitation as a service delivery
      model for families with infants and young children is rapidly proliferating through federal
      funding.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enhancements to Mothers and Babies are warranted to address the mental health of both
      parents, via the home visitation service delivery model where many of the most at-risk
      families enter into provider-client relationships during their child's infancy and early
      childhood.

      Previous postpartum depression preventive interventions—including MB—have neglected to
      intervene with partners of pregnant women, despite the growing recognition that paternal
      depression also exerts influence on children's social-emotional development and occurs in a
      similar time-frame. Thus, in an otherwise successful intervention, these limitations—mixed
      success in improving hypothesized intervention mechanisms and limited engagement of
      fathers—may mitigate intervention efficacy. Paternal depression is hypothesized to mediate
      the relationship between MB modules and maternal mental health outcomes.

      This study addresses this limitation. The investigators will collaborate with 10-12 home
      visiting (HV) programs serving primarily low-income families. The investigators will recruit
      24 mother-father dyads for an uncontrolled pilot in which mothers will receive MB-TXT and
      fathers will receive FAB, a pilot curriculum developed using existing materials and data
      collected via qualitative research with home visiting clients, their partners, and home
      visiting staff.

      Aim 1. To develop and determine the feasibility and acceptability of a) conducting the MB-DAD
      intervention protocol and b) assessing paternal and dyadic outcomes across two home visiting
      programs. Focus groups with prior trial participants, their male partners, and home visiting
      staff will generate information on a) intervention content, b) frequency of contact, and c)
      relationship to MB materials received by their partner.

    <description>will be measured using the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (RDAS). The RDAS measures (a) consensus in decision-making, (b) satisfaction in relationship and (c) cohesion. It contains 14 items, each of which asks respondents to rate certain aspects of his/her relationship on a 5- or 6- point scale. Higher scores indicate greater relationship satisfaction.

    <measure>Change in Mood regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Intervention at 6 and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured using the Negative Mood Regulation Scale (NMRS).The NMRS assesses an individual's expectancy that some behavior or cognition will alleviate a negative mood state. For each question, respondents use a five-point scale from &quot;very much disagree&quot; to &quot;very much agree&quot; to indicate what they believe they can do when they are disappointed or experiencing a negative mood. The scale has demonstrated excellent internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and correlational evidence of both convergent and discriminant validity with constructs such as depressive symptoms and locus of control, respectively.</description>
