  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that there are genetic risk factors for several forms of
      glaucoma, such as glaucoma caused by pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF) and primary angle
      closure glaucoma (PACG). The aim of the present prospective, multi-center, case-control study
      is to identify susceptibility genes/loci for PXF and PACG using a whole genome association
      (WGA) approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As worldwide populations become older because of shifts in demography, PXF may become a
      matter of greater concern. The search for genes responsible for PXF may lead to the
      identification of key molecules in pathways critical to the normal functioning of the eye. A
      better understanding of normal eye function may in turn lead to more accurate diagnosis and
      prognosis of ocular development, and inevitably to the emergence of novel classifications
      based on knowledge of the molecular pathology. Such knowledge may lead to more rational
      disease classification, better diagnostic tests, and improved prognostic accuracy. This is of
      particular relevance to PXF since there is a shortage of early reliable diagnostic tests and
      much evidence that the early commencement of treatment can arrest progressive asymptomatic
      loss of vision due to PXF-related glaucoma.

    <description>To identify the genetic markers in a whole genome association screen which show very strong association with PXF and ACG. The genomic regions identified from the above analyses will be analyzed using high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips and/or sequencing of positional candidate genes to identify causal variants.</description>
