  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmias in clinical practice. Research
      investigating hospitalized patients have indicated there are deleterious effects of AF on
      patients besides the disease burden itself, including longer stay days for hospitalization,
      higher rates of frailty and increasing mortality rate after discharged in six months. In the
      community-dwelling research also found that elderly with AF have lower cognitive function,
      physical functional tests score and slower walking speed compared with the health ones.
      However, there is limited articles investigating the impact of AF on community-dwelling
      elderly, and the relationship between AF and frailty is also lack of discussion. According to
      the aged society and increasing prevalence of AF, the relationship between AF and frailty in
      community-dwelling elderly is warranting investigated.
