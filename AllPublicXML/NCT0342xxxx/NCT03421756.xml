  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study of matched-related donor allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation in adults with severe sickle cell disease using a matched-sibling PBSC graft
      with a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen (Alemtuzumab).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stem cell transplantation recipients will be given Alemtuzumab, which is a non-myeloablative
      pre-transplant conditioning regimen. This non-myeloablative therapy uses doses of
      chemotherapy and radiation to weaken (but not destroy) the patients bone marrow and immune
      system, while still allowing their body to accept the donor's stem cells. Alemtuzumab will be
      given 7 days prior to stem cell infusion at 0.03 mg/kg IV, 6 days prior to stem cell infusion
      at 0.1 mg/kg IV, and 5 thru 3 days prior to stem cell infusion at 0.3 mg/kg IV.

    <description>by evaluating reversal of Hb S % to that of the donor's phenotype, in recipients of HLA matched-sibling peripheral blood - hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with NMA conditioning regimen. Testing for treatment success will include Hb Electrophoresis. Recipients with donors AA should have nearly 0% Hb S. Recipients with donors AS should have similar Hb S % (approximately &lt; 60%) as the donor.

    <description>Acute GVHD will be diagnosed and graded using the clinical and laboratory criteria in Appendix A of the protocol. During the inpatient stay, clinical evaluations will occur daily. During the outpatient stay, each patient should be evaluated at least every other week until they are discharged from the transplant clinic. Subsequent evaluations will occur at roughly Days +30, +60, +90 and until +100 days. Clinical evaluations will be performed and grade will be assigned at the time of diagnosis by an attending physician. The decision to initiate GVHD therapy will be made by the attending physician. The statistical analysis plan will be calculated with a 90% exact confidence interval.</description>

Evaluation will be conducted by BMT team at day +100, +360 and yearly up to 2 years after HCT. The patient's sickle cell physician will conduct clinical assessments between these time points as required per institutional guidelines. This will be evaluate by: 1) The occurrence of chronic GHVD meeting NIH criteria and requiring systemic pharmacological immunosuppression 2) The use of additional immune suppressive agents other than first line therapy 3) Time to completion of prednisone, if required for treatment of acute GVHD 4) Time to completion of all immunosuppression 5) Requirement for immunosuppression at 1 year and 2 years after transplant.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Graft failure or Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years after HSCT</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse is defined by the presence of recipient's Hb SS on electrophoresis. Testing for recurrent disease will include Hb electrophoresis to determine recipient vs. donor Hb-type and peripheral blood chimerism to document loss of donor cell engraftment. Endpoints will include: time to relapse and status of compliance with immunosuppressive therapy. Primary graft failure defined as the absence of donor cells assessed by peripheral blood chimerism assays, by any lineage, on or after day +30. Secondary graft failure defined as the presence of &lt; 20% donor cells by peripheral blood chimerism assays in a patient with prior evidence of ≥ 20% of donor cells.

    <description>The time (in days) it takes to taper immunosuppressive therapy will be measured. Tapering will begin once 50% donor CD3 chimerism is achieved. To estimate the time to discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. The product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimate of the distribution of time to discontinuation will be calculated with a 90% confidence region. In an exploratory analysis, proportional hazards (Cox) regression will be applied to identify potential predictors of time to discontinuation.</description>
