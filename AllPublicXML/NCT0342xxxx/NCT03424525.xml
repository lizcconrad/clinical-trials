  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected bacterial infection at the time screening are eligible for this
      study. Patients may participate in this study if they are at least 18 years of age, and most
      participants will be receiving care at the clinical practices of the University of
      Pennsylvania. Up to 30 subjects will participate in two different imaging cohorts.

      The Biodistribution cohort will include up to 5 patients referred from orthopedics who will
      undergo a series of vertex to mid-thigh (or feet if indicated) biodistribution
      [11C]trimethoprim PET/CT scans over a period of approximately 2 ½ hours.

      The Dynamic cohort will include up to 25 patients who will undergo approximately 60 minutes
      of dynamic scanning followed by up to 2 static skull base to mid-thigh (or feet if indicated)
      scans imaging post injection of [11C]trimethoprim. Some subjects who may be selected
      clinically to undergo surgical or antibiotic treatment may undergo a second therapy may also
      undergo an optional second [11C]trimethoprim PET/CT after the initiation of therapy to
      collect pilot data on the changes in [11C]trimethoprim biodistribution and uptake with
      therapy, the timing of this scan may vary depending on the type of treatment the patient is
      receiving.

      Patients will also undergo baseline lab tests complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein
      (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and blood cultures. If these tests are done as
      part of clinical standard of care they will not need to be repeated for this study.

    <description>[11C]TMP is a radiolabeled imaging agent for positron emission tomography (PET/CT). Most relevant to this protocol, it is for imaging bacterial infection in human subjects. TMP is well-known, safe, broad-spectrum, synthetic, small molecule antibiotic that has been used clinically for over 50 years for the treatment of acute bacterial infection and has been combined with sulfa-based antibiotics (Bactrim/Septra) for bacterial infection prophylaxis especially in the lung and bladder.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Inclusion Criteria at least 18 years of age

          2. Known or suspected bacterial infection.

          3. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim within 48h of the baseline PET/CT scan.

          2. Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          3. Serious or unstable medical or psychological comorbidities that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the
             study.

          4. Females who are pregnant or breast feeding at the time of screening will not be
