  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether a targeted behavioral intervention can lead to
      both changes in early communication skills and in neural responses in toddlers and
      preschoolers with autism.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mirror neuron system (MNS) broadly refers to a network of brain regions that responds
      both when a person performs an action and when that person observes someone else performing
      the same action. This system emerges in infancy and develops over time to support more
      complex social abilities. It has been hypothesized that autism involves fundamental
      impairments to the MNS, which can explain the deficits in joint attention, imitation,
      communication and social cognition.

      This study investigates the MNS in 100 toddlers and preschoolers recently diagnosed with
      autism or with a suspected diagnosis of autism. First, children with (suspected) autism
      complete a battery of behavioral measures and MNS activity will be assessed using
      electrophysiology (EEG; event-related potentials) while the child participates in specific
      tasks. Then, the children with (suspected) autism will be randomly assigned to one of two
      behavioral intervention programs (i.e., targeted joint attention intervention or parent
      education intervention) that will be carried out by interventionists and parents for 10-12
      weeks. At the end of the intervention, these children will be re-evaluated on behavioral
      tasks and EEG to investigate changes as a result of the intervention.

      The investigators hypothesize that the joint attention intervention will lead to significant
      changes on both the neural and behavioral measures of MNS functioning.

    <measure>Change in joint attention measured with the Early Social and Communication scales (ESCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment occurs at week 1 and week 12, with an intervention in weeks 2-11</time_frame>
    <description>This behavioral assessment follows standardized guidelines to capture the full range of joint attention and behavior request skills (initiate and response). A child has a higher score on the ESCS when they demonstrate behavior requests (e.g. pointing to, or asking for, desired objects), or respond to behavior requests (e.g. giving objects to other people) and joint attention (e.g. three-point gaze). In the ESCS, a higher score would indicate higher social and communication abilities.</description>

    <description>Families in the joint attention intervention will receive 10 weeks of the JASPER (Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement Regulation) protocol. JASPER is a treatment approach based on a combination of developmental and behavioral principles developed by Dr. Connie Kasari at the Center for Autism Research and Treatment, at University of California, Los Angeles. Our research staff will be trained on the specific techniques of JASPER guided by Connie Kasari (consultant on project) and her colleagues The study's intervention involves 2 days/week of 60-minute sessions with a trained experimenter (which may take place in the lab or home, depending on the needs of the family). The primary goal for the intervention will be to increase the frequency and range/variety of joint attention and to advance the child to higher levels (e.g., from requesting to initiating joint attention acts).</description>

    <description>Families in the parent education intervention. Parent education will be provided in group sessions. During the sessions information is presented about ASD, how to deal with behavioral difficulties and available services, and parents are given an opportunity to share experiences. Parents will attend a weekly session for 10 weeks. 10 different topics will be discussed, which include: causes and symptoms of autism, diagnosis process, treatment options, enhancing communicative abilities in children with autism, emotion regulation, dealing with distress, correcting behavior difficulties, applying structure and routines.</description>
