  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll subjects with previously-treated advanced or inoperable gastric cancer
      who have responded to first line platinum therapy into two treatment arms. In Arm A subjects
      will receive BGB-290; in Arm B subjects will receive placebo. The purpose of this study is to
      show that BGB-290 (versus placebo) will improve progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects
      with advanced or inoperable gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized multicenter global phase 3 study
      comparing the efficacy and safety of single agent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
      inhibitor BGB-290 to placebo as maintenance therapy in subjects with advanced gastric cancer
      who have responded to first line platinum based chemotherapy. Subjects are randomized 1:1 to
      BGB-290 (Arm A) or placebo (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified by geography, biomarker
      status, and ECOG performance status.

      Patients will undergo tumor assessments at screening and then every 8 weeks, or as clinically
      indicated. Administration of BGB-290 or placebo will continue until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, death, or another discontinuation criterion is met.

      After end of treatment, long-term follow-up assessments include tumor imaging every 8 weeks
      for those patients without disease progression, survival status, and new anticancer therapy.
