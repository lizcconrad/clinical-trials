      A pilot study to determine the safety and efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cell
      (autologous T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing chimeric antigen receptor)
      personalized immunotherapy for patients with recurrent malignant gliomas based on the
      expression of tumor specific/associated antigens (EGFRVIII, IL13Rα2, Her-2, EphA2, CD133,
      GD2).
