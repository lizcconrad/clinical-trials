      This is a long term, safety follow up study of patients in the AVXS-101-CL-101 gene
      replacement therapy clinical trial for SMA Type 1 delivering AVXS 101. Patients will roll
      over from the parent study into this long-term study for continuous safety monitoring for up
      to 15 years.

      This is a long term, safety follow up study of patients in the AVXS-101-CL-101 gene
      replacement therapy clinical trial for SMA Type 1 delivering AVXS 101. Patients will roll
      over from the parent study into this long-term study for continuous safety monitoring for up
      to 15 years. The last visit of the parent study or early discontinuation from the parent
      study may serve as the visit at which the informed consent form process is conducted for the
      AVXS 101 LT-001 long term follow-up safety study. Patients will return annually for follow up
      study visits for five (5) years, and then will be contacted via phone annually for ten (10)
      years. Additionally, patient record transfers from their local physician and/or neurologist
      will be requested in conjunction with the annual study visits and phone contacts for review
      by the investigator.

      If the patient is unable to return to the original investigative site, the sponsor will
      arrange with the patients' local established physician to serve as an additional investigator
      to conduct the required assessments.
