    <textblock>
      This study will determine if HA dermal filler late occurring (&gt; 4 weeks and &lt;2 years) nodules
      are associated with bacterial contamination (independent of filler type) and to characterize
      the histological response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have only received HA fillers (no limitation on the brand(s)/product(s) of HA filler
             used; multiple product use is allowed).

          -  Present with an unresolved nodule (inflammatory or non-inflammatory) which was first
             observed &gt; 4 weeks and &gt; 2 years after most recent HA filler treatment and is
             determined to be greater than 3 millimeters (mm) in diameter by palpation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received non-HA fillers (e.g. polyacrylamide, calcium hydroxyapatite,
             poly-L-lactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, silicone, expanded
             polytetrafluoroethylene, collagen) including mixes with HA fillers anywhere in the
             face.

          -  Are currently enrolled in a dermal filler clinical trial or previously enrolled in a
             dermal filler clinical trial with randomized treatment in which the type of dermal
             filler is unknown (i.e. non-HA filler arm of study).

          -  Have history of keloid or hypertrophic scarring

          -  Have received intralesional intervention for the nodule (e.g. hyaluronidase,
             corticosteroids, antibiotics, 5-fluorouracil).

          -  Are pregnant
