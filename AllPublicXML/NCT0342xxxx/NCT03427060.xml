      Coversin in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with resistance to
      Eculizumab due to complement C5 polymorphisms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coversin, a small protein complement C5 inhibitor which prevents the cleavage of C5 by C5
      convertase into C5a and C5b, will be used in an open label, non-comparative clinical trial in
      patients with PNH and proven resistance to eculizumab due to C5 polymorphisms. Patients will
      be treated with Coversin by daily subcutaneous injection for 6 months in order to determine
      the safety and efficacy of the drug in these circumstances. If satisfactory control of the
      PNH is achieved, and at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), patients will have
      the option of remaining on Coversin and being entered into the long term follow-up study.

    <description>The FACIT Measurement System is a collection of quality of life questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness. Change in FACIT-F score, measured on a scale from 0 - 4 (0 = Not at all, 1 = A little bit, 2 = Some-what, 3 = Quite a bit, 4 = Very much).</description>

    <measure>Change in EuroQol 5 Dimensional 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive questionnaire comprises of five sections: Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each section has 5 levels: No problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that section. The digits for the five sections can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
