    <textblock>
      This study is designed to see if doing regular training on a spatial imagery task leads to
      improvements in the ability to do the trained spatial imagery task and in the ability to get
      around in everyday activities.

      The investigators will recruit 40 blind participants, randomized by the investigators' CVNR
      statistician into two groups. One group will undergo the experimental intervention (spatial
      cognitive training) and the other will undergo a control intervention involving letter-number
      matching. The participants will include women and minorities in proportion to the
      demographics of the Veteran population attending the Atlanta VA.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to perceive visual stimuli, i.e. no light perception, with stable visual
             loss over the past year

          -  The investigators anticipate that causes of blindness will be ocular, including:

               -  glaucoma

               -  diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration

               -  the most common causes of blindness in Veterans

               -  as well as possibly late-onset Leber's optic atrophy and ocular trauma (in the
                  absence of TBI)

          -  To minimize heterogeneity due to variations in age and the duration of visual loss,
             the investigators will restrict enrollment to Veterans and Non-Veterans over the age
             of 50 who lost light perception within the last 5 years, and who have completed
             standard O&amp;M training.

          -  From a practical standpoint, this also enables the investigators to focus on
             participants who can potentially benefit most from the proposed intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded if they have any neurological condition, such as:

               -  TBI

               -  history of blast exposure

               -  stroke

               -  brain tumors

               -  epilepsy, etc.

          -  Participants will also be excluded if MRI scanning is contra-indicated, e.g.:

               -  due to an implanted device such as a pacemaker

               -  or foreign bodies of ferromagnetic nature

          -  Cognitive screening will be performed using the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of
             Neuropsychological Status (RBANS, Randolph, 1998) and participants with cognitive
             impairment will be excluded based on a score of 1.5 SD below the mean for the Verbal
             Memory Index.

          -  The investigators will test participants' hearing using a validated screening
             questionnaire (Screening Version of the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly,
             HHIE-S, Wentry &amp; Weinstein, 1983, Lichtenstein et al., 1988) followed by assessment of
             audiometric pure tone (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 KHz) hearing thresholds in the CVNR sound
             booth.

          -  Participants with more than mild hearing loss (HHIE score &gt;8 or audiometric thresholds
             &gt;40dB) will be excluded (Wentry &amp; Weinstein, 1983; Wilson, 2009), given that the
             investigators are relying on audio cues.

          -  The investigators will also exclude visually impaired Veterans who are dependent on a
             wheelchair or scooter for mobility, as they will not be able to take part in the
             real-world task.
