  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, around 2 % of the population live with severe mental disease. People with severe
      mental disease live 15-20 years less than the general population. The majority of the years
      of life lost are a consequence of the excess mortality due to somatic disease. The high
      prevalence of somatic disease among people with severe mental disease can be largely
      attributed to physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and side effects from psychopharmacological
      drugs. Apart from the impacts of unhealthy lifestyle and medication side effects, research
      suggests that individuals with severe mental disease do not receive the same treatment for
      their somatic diseases as do the rest of the population. The inequality in diagnostics and
      treatment can be attributed to stigmatization from healthcare providers and patients' lacking
      awareness of symptoms and reluctance to seek medical care. Further, the increasing
      specialization within both somatic and psychiatric care has led to a division between these
      two treatment systems (8,9). Patients with severe mental disease who simultaneously have one
      or more somatic diseases need their treatment to be coordinated; such treatment should span
      general practice, the municipality and the psychiatric and somatic hospital. Accordingly, the
      following elements are necessary to create effective and coordinated treatment trajectories:
      detailed preparation, qualitative process evaluation as an integrated part of the courses of
      treatment, and involvement of all stakeholders from the start.

      The overall aim of the project is to optimize the detection of selected chronic somatic
      diseases, including cardiovascular disease (ischaemia and heart failure), diabetes,
      hypertension and high cholesterol, in individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder or bipolar disorder; to initiate medical treatment; and to ensure treatment
      compliance among patients.

      Accordingly, the project has the following objectives:

        -  To develop an intervention targeting individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective
           disorder or bipolar disorder that can optimize the detection of selected chronic somatic
           diseases, including cardiovascular disease (ischaemia and heart failure), diabetes,
           hypertension and high cholesterol

        -  To test whether the developed intervention can optimize the detection of cardiovascular
           disease (ischaemia and heart failure), diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol in
           individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder

      The project's hypotheses are that an interdisciplinary and intersectoral intervention
      targeting individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder can

        -  optimize detection of cardiovascular diseases (ischaemia and cardiac insufficiency),
           diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol by systematic screening in general practice

        -  lead to initiation and maintenance of relevant medical treatment. Moreover, we
           hypothesize that the complete intervention in a long-term perspective will lead to
           decreased mortality within the target group.

      Design, materials and methods:

      The project is divided in two phases. In Phase 1 the project's intervention is developed; in
      Phase 2 the intervention is tested. Phase 2 will be conducted as a feasibility study.

      Recruitment:

      Based on experience from previous studies, we know the target group can be difficult to
      recruit and maintain in a course of treatment. We expect that 10-15 patients belonging to
      each provider-number will meet the project's inclusion criteria. To obtain sufficient
      patients for the project, we aim to include 20 general practitioners (individual
      provider-numbers). Accordingly, it is realistic to assume that around 75 patients undergo
      screening in general practice.

      Recruitment of general practitioners will be done by sending written information about
      project participation and an invitation to participate. Only general practitioners who have
      one or several practice nurse(s) will be invited. The written invitation will be followed by
      a telephone call to all invitees to identify those practitioners wishing to participate.

      Intervention:

      Phase 1: Development of intervention:

      The aim of Phase 1 is to design an intervention based on the experiences and perspectives of
      the involved stakeholders regarding how to optimize detection and treatment of somatic
      disease among persons with severe mental disease. The project rests on the fundamental idea
      that it is crucial to involve all relevant stakeholders as early as in the development phase
      if the intervention is to be effective and feasible to implement in practice. This phase
      includes 1) meetings with key stakeholders in the field, 2) observations and interviews
      within the Mental Health Centre Copenhagen and Copenhagen Municipality, 3) multiple project
      meetings involving all sectors in the project as well as on-going monitoring by the project
      group.

      Phase 2: Testing of the intervention:

      The intervention is divided in two parts: a screening intervention and a treatment
      intervention. The testing of the interventions is conducted as a feasibility study.

      Evaluation:

      The evaluation is twofold:

        1. Evaluation of the effect of the intervention

        2. Evaluation of the implementation process
