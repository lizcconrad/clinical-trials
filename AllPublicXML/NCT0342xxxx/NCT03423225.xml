      This study's objective is to evaluate the incidence rate of acute rejection reactions after
      24 weeks treatment with ADVAGRAF® following 3 months treatment with tacrolimus in new liver
      transplant recipients.

      Treatment conversion will take place from twice daily tacrolimus to once daily tacrolimus
      (ADVAGRAF) 3 months after transplant in new liver transplant recipients.

      This is single center,open-label study with ADVAGRAF® Primary endpoint is Incidence rate of
      biopsy confirmed acute rejection reactions within 24 weeks following conversion+ Incidence
      rate of acute rejection reactions (%) = number of subjects with at least one acute rejection
      reaction 1)/total number of subjects in the relevant analysis set * 100 Only those acute
      rejection reactions confirmed by biopsy will be acceptable as acute rejection reactions.

      Administration method is following The total daily dose of tacrolimus will be converted to
      1:1 (mg:mg) and the total daily dose of ADVAGRAF® will be administered only once daily in the
      morning, starting from Day 1 (at least one hour before breakfast or 2 to 3 hours after
      breakfast).

        -  Dose adjustment after conversion On Day 1, the total dose will be converted to 1:1. It
           is recommended to check the blood concentration of tacrolimus at each visit and adjust
           the dose to achieve the blood concentration maintaining at 5~8ng/ml for 0 to 3 months
           and then at 5ng/ ml or below for 3 to 6 months of study treatment.

        -  Duration of treatment The investigational product will be administered for 24 weeks.
