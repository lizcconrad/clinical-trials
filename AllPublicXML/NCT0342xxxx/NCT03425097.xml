  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to study the effectiveness of Fexofenadine (an over the counter
      allergy pill) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in patients who still
      have symptoms despite being on a proton pump inhibitor. The investigators will do this by
      giving participants both Fexofenadine (an H1 blocker) for 2 weeks and placebo (sugar pill)
      for 2 weeks. The participants will not know which drug they are getting at a particular time.
      This will help the investigators better assess the true effectiveness of Fexofenadine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around 18-28% of North American adults have gastroesophageal reflux symptoms once per week.
      Of those patients up to 60% may have an inadequate response to proton pump inhibitors and
      have persistent symptoms. One possible explanation is that this group of patients has nerve
      related pain. It is thought that H1 receptor activation may sensitize the gastrointestinal
      tract and esophagus to pain. H1 blockers such as anti-histamines may play a role in treatment
      of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms that are refractory to proton pump inhibitors by reducing
      pain perception. The investigators wish to conduct a randomized control trial to test this
      hypothesis. The investigators will do this by giving participants both Fexofenadine (an H1
      blocker) for 2 weeks and placebo (sugar pill) for 2 weeks. The participants will not know
      which drug they are getting at a particular time. This will help the investigators better
      assess the true effectiveness of Fexofenadine.
