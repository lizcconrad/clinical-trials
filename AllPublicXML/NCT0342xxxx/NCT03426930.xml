  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that begins frequently in adolescence between the ages
      of 13 and 19, which affects girls with a sex ratio of 10:1, and the prevalence for females
      varies from 0,3% to 0,9%.

      The current therapeutic arsenal has a limited success in the treatment of anorexia nervosa
      with a long-term mortality rate and a 12-month relapse rate of up to 10% and 40%,
      respectively.

      One of the most difficult symptoms to treat is a body dysmorphic disorder, also called
      dysmorphophobia, the persistence of this symptom is a major negative prognostic factor.

      The main treatment of dysmorphophobia is currently cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In
      most protocols, the technique of progressive exposure face to the mirror is used with low
      efficiency. Adapted physical activity has recently been proposed in the literature as a tool
      to improve body perception.

      Face of complex management of this major symptom that is dysmorphophobia, some offer to use
      virtual reality.

      It is in this context that the study proposes to study the contribution of virtual reality in
      the treatment of the body dysmorphic disorder of adolescent patients hospitalized for
      anorexia nervosa in the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Salvator Hospital in
      Marseille.

      It will be compare the importance and the evolution of the dysmorphophobia between two groups
      of teenagers hospitalized in Space Arthur for anorexia nervosa: an experimental group
      receiving the treatment with the contribution of the virtual reality, and a control group
      receiving the reference treatment of dysmorphophobia used in our unit.

      It will be recruit 30 adolescent females with anorexia nervosa according to the diagnostic
      criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5. The subjects will
      be divided into 2 groups of 15 teenagers, according to a randomization list, a group with a
      classic protocol, a group with virtual reality. The subjects with virtual reality will have 5
      exposure sessions where they will be able to model their body in view in 1st person and 3rd
      person, via an Oculus Rift. It will be compare the following parameters: the different scores
      related to dysmorphophobia according to different questionnaires, the self-evaluation of the
      Body Mass Index (BMI), in order to observe the evolution of the symptom, then the anxiety
      relative to the exposure of a BMI higher in order to work the fear of getting fat, the choice
      of the most pleasant BMI, to evaluate skinny body addiction.

      At the end of the study, we hope to highlight the effectiveness of virtual reality to fight
      against dysmorphophobia, in order to have a better estimate of its body aspect, and to impact
      the evolution towards the cure in anorexia nervosa in teenage girls. In addition to
      increasing our knowledge, this could allow to consider new strategies in the management of
      anorexia nervosa, and why not democratize more virtual reality with adolescents followed in
      child and adolescent psychiatry.
