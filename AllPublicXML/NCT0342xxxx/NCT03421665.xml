      Evaluate clinical healing and radiographic maintenance of correction following an LCL
      procedure or medial cuneiform osteotomy (Cotton) at 6 months following the use of the TITAN
      3-D™ Wedge. Subjects who receive one or more TITAN 3-D™ Wedges will obtain satisfactory
      levels of clinical healing and radiographic maintenance of correction at 6 months.

    <description>Each subject will undergo an LCL procedure and/or medial cuneiform osteotomy with one or more TITAN 3-D™ Wedges. Ancillary fixation should be used in conjunction with each TITAN 3-D™ Wedge used. This surgical procedure will be performed as standard of care and is not part of the research procedures. Post-operative care and weight-bearing/activity restrictions will be at the discretion of the surgeon as part of their standard of care for the procedure.</description>

        The study population will include males and females of all ages. Furthermore, it is likely
        that the majority of subjects enrolled in this study suffer from a flatfoot deformity;
        however, this study will not be restricted to only those diagnosed with flatfoot.
