  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of Narcolepsy-cataplexy (NC) patients suffer from REM sleep behavior disorder
      (RBD), a parasomnia.

      A strong link was found between RBD and impulse control disorders (ICD) in Parkinson disease
      (PD) patients. ICD are thought to be related to a dysfunction of meso-cortico-limbic pathways
      which belong to the so called ''reward system''.

      A recent study in IRMf shows that RBD is associated with impaired reward system.

      A strong link was found between these two disorders and therefore we believe that RBD is
      associated with impaired reward system in NC

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate differences in brain activation between NC
      patients with and without RBD.

      The investigators hypothesize that NC patients with RBD have a more severe dysfunction of the
      reward system (hypoactivation of the meso-cortico-limbic pathway) than patients without RBD.

      Type of study: Prospective, case control study.

      Number of centers: 3 (Clermont-Ferrand, Vichy and Montlucon)

      Patients :

      The study will be performed in 66 subjects (22 PD patients with RBD, 22 PD patients without
      RBD and 22 healthy volunteers, age-and sex-matched without any contraindications to perform
      an MRI)

      Study Performance :

      During the first visit (Baseline, inclusion visit, 2 hours), each subject will perform a
      clinical and neurological examination and neuropsychological assessment (depression by the
      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); apathy by the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS), impulsivity
      by the Urgency, lack of Premeditation, lack of Perseverance, Sensation Seeking scale (UPPS))
      Eligible patients will be welcomed for a video Polysomnography in the sleep center, for one
      night (Month 1, 1 night) and in a subsequent visit at the MRI department for the functional
      MRI (Month 1, 1 hour). This session will be of about 45 minutes. The reward system will be
      explore using an experimental task during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The
      name of this task is the&quot;monetary incentive delay task&quot;.
