    <textblock>
      Base on enriched resources from the Metabolic Syndrome cohort in children, a long-term
      prospective cohort study will be carried out. This cohort is a unique biochemical and genetic
      database of Chinese population with large number of subjects in the world. By collecting
      information of disease history and lifestyle, measuring clinical and metabolic parameters,
      especially biomarkers which can reflect the underlying mechanism of insulin resistance and
      metabolic syndrome, we intend to sort out some unique biochemical and genetic markers for
      Chinese population.

      A representative sample of 19,593 school children, aged 6-18 years, were chosen from four of
      the eight urban districts and three of seven rural districts in the Beijing area between
      April and October, 2004. Among these children and adolescents, 4,500 were recognized as
      having risk factors defined by the presence of any one of the following: overweight, total
      cholesterol (TC) ≥ 5.2 mmol/L, triglyceride (TG) ≥ 1.7 mmol/L or fasting glucose (FG) ≥ 5.6
      mmol/L based on initial finger capillary blood tests. Moreover, all subjects at increased
      risk for metabolic syndrome, together with a parallel reference population of 1,095 children,
      were invited to undergo medical examinations for verification based on venipuncture blood
      samples. Clinical data, biomarkers including adipokines, and lifestyle factors such as
      physical activity and diet were measured and documented. Genetic variants previously reported
      from genome-wide association study (GWAS) of obesity and diabetes and DNA-methylation were
      also assessed. Further, high-throughput analysis of proteomics and metabolomics of the blood
      samples were conducted. Cross-sectional and follow-up evaluations will be undertaken. The
      unique biochemical and genetic markers for Chinese population will be identified in the BCAMS
      study. The biomarkers will build a solid foundation for progressive study on mechanism of
      metabolic diseases and lead to early prediction of these diseases.
