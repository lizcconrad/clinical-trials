  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Movement is important for overall health. Lack of movement has been shown to be associated
      with numerous diseases. This study will assess the validity and usefulness of two innovative
      low risk, non-invasive wellness devices, the Gentle Jogger® and the Gentle Jumper that
      passively simulate the physical activities of jogging and jumping, respectively. The study
      will evaluate whether or not each of the devices in different body postures (seated, lying
      down, slight recumbent and slight head down) produces changes in blood pressure, and indices
      of dilatation of blood vessels, in a younger (25-59yr) and older (&gt; 60 yrs.) subject
      population. Volunteers will be paid for their participation in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a significant risk for various cardiovascular diseases including
      hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. To address the sitting disease Sackner Wellness Products
      has patented 2 non-invasive methods for inducing passive movement while in seated or supine
      posture the Gentle Jogger® and Gentle Jumper®, each simulating the activities of jogging and
      jumping respectively. Passive simulation of jogging and jumping introduces pulses into the
      circulation as the feet strike a semi-rigid surface within the chassis of the device. These
      pulsations stimulate release of beneficial mediators which are important to cardiovascular
      health. The study will recruit healthy subjects in a younger age group (25-59 yrs ) and older
      age group (&gt; 60 yrs) in order to measure changes in blood pressure, cardiovascular indices of
      vasodilation, heart rate variability, and other non-invasively acquired biometric information
      in different postures [(1) supine, 2) semi-recumbent, 3) sitting, 4) Trendelenburg and 5)
      reverse Trendelenburg )], while at rest and during and after use of the GJogger and GJumper.
      Additionally, a subgroup of subjects will be asked to perform texting of a specified script
      in order to determine whether or not GJogger is a distraction during text messaging.
      Volunteers will be paid for their participation in the study The Gentle Jogger and Gentle
      Jumper are non-FDA regulated wellness devices (2016) in which, 1) GJogger and GJumper as part
      of a healthy lifestyle may help to prevent certain chronic diseases or conditions such as
      heart disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes and, 2) may help living well with
      certain chronic diseases or conditions such as s heart disease, high blood pressure, and type
      2 diabetes.
