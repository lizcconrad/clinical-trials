    <textblock>
      The first phase of this pilot study will assess changes in quality of life at the end of a
      16-week Mymee program in patients with moderate to severe SLE. The second phase will assess
      changes in healthcare utilization and cost over a one year period after program end.

      Intervention Group The Intervention Group will enter daily tasks into the Mymee app. After
      the first intake session, the subject will participate in weekly 20-30-minute coaching
      sessions with the Health Coach. At the second session, the Health Coach will review the
      symptoms and the free text entered by the subject to determine which dietary and
      environmental factors will be monitored in the Mymee app.

      Each subsequent week, the Health Coach will review and discuss with the subject the food
      diary and the data entered into the Mymee app during the previous week. Based on this
      discussion and the subject's medical records, the Health Coach will determine or revise which
      symptoms will continue to be monitored using the Mymee App.

      Control Group The Control Group subjects will receive no training, coaching, or other
      intervention services from Mymee. The Control Group subjects will complete the same battery
      of assessments at the same intervals as the Intervention Group subjects.

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, measured at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the intervention and then every 3 months for the 1 year following the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>BPI-SF is a 9-item questionnaire with two domains: pain severity and pain interference. The pain severity items have values which range from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;), and the pain interference items have values which range from 0 (&quot;does not interfere&quot;) to 10 (&quot;completely interferes&quot;). The pain severity and pain interference domain scores can be calculated as the mean of the scores of their component items.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline, measured at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the intervention and then every 3 months for the 1 year following the intervention]</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue Sale is a 13-item questionnaire assessing fatigue, where the items use a Likert-type scale (with values ranging from 0 to 4). The responses for each item are added to obtain a total score which ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline, measured at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the intervention and then every 3 months for the 1 year following the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>LupusQoL is a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) specific health-related quality of life measure. It is a 34-item questionnaire where each item uses a 5-point Likert-type scale (with values ranging from 0 to 4). Each item pertains to one of eight domains: physical health, pain, planning, intimate relationships, burden to others, emotional health, body image, and fatigue. Each domain of the LupusQoL is scored separately. The score for each domain is equal to the average of the domain's items scaled such that the range of possible scores is 0 (worst health-related quality of life) to 100 (best health-related quality of life).</description>
