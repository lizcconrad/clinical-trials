  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be preceded by a pilot phase study in 5 patients.

      This will then be followed by the randomized 1:1 phase II trial testing the utility of
      regional cryotherapy in preventing or reducing paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy
      compared to no treatment.

      It is hypothesized that cryotherapy causes regional blood vessel constriction and decreases
      the paclitaxel exposure to the distal epithelial nerve fibres, thus resulting in decreased
      nerve damage.
