    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of telotristat ethyl (TE) ( LP-778902 active moiety, metabolite),
      following administration of a single dose of TE 250 mg (1 x 250-mg tablet) compared to
      healthy, demographically-matched subjects with normal hepatic function.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male and female subjects ≥18 to ≤70 years of age, inclusive, at the time of
             Screening:

               1. Females of non-childbearing potential are to be surgically sterile (documented
                  hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) or
                  postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea). Females
                  of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception
                  during the study from clinical research unit (CRU) admission through Safety
                  Follow-up.

                  Adequate methods of contraception for subjects or partner include condom,
                  diaphragm, or cervical cap used in conjunction with spermicidal gel, foam, cream,
                  film, or suppository. Hormonal contraception is NOT acceptable in this study. If
                  necessary, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) results &gt;40 IU/L at Screening are
                  confirmatory in the absence of a clear postmenopausal history.

               2. Nonsterile male subjects with sexual partners of childbearing potential must
                  agree to use adequate methods of contraception from CRU admission through Safety
                  Follow-up. Adequate methods of contraception for subjects or partner include the
                  following: condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm with spermicidal gel, coil
                  (intrauterine device), surgical sterilization, vasectomy, oral contraceptive
                  pill, depo-progesterone injections, progesterone implant (ie, Implanon®),
                  NuvaRing®, Ortho Evra®; if a subject is not sexually active, but becomes active,
                  he or his partner should use medically accepted forms of contraception.

             the Investigator, Medical Monitor, and/or the Sponsor

          -  Abnormal laboratory values must be clinically acceptable, as judged by the
             Investigator, Medical Monitor, and/or the Sponsor.

          -  Additionally, for healthy matched control subjects with normal hepatic function:

          -  Each subject will be demographically matched to 1 of the subjects with severe hepatic
             impairment for sex, age (±10 years), and BMI (±20%).

          -  No clinically significant illness or disease as determined by medical history,
             including cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, biliary, gastrointestinal (GI), endocrinologic,
