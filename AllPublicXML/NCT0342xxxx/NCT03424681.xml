  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and more treatments
      are needed, especially pharmacotherapies. There are a variety of efficacious treatments for
      AUD, but effect sizes are small, and vary from study to study. Medications may be more
      effective if particular subgroups of AUD are targeted. Identifying the mechanisms of action
      of a particular medication will help identify the subtypes more likely to respond to therapy.
      Global impulse control is a rational treatment target, and improving it is a likely
      mechanisms by which some medications for AUD work, especially in subtypes of AUD with
      impaired impulse control at baseline. Modafinil is a medication that is FDA approved for the
      treatment of narcolepsy, and is relatively safe and tolerable. There is reason to believe it
      may improve impulse control, and underlying neural circuitry, and may work best to improve
      alcohol use outcomes in AUD with poor impulse control. The overall aim of this study is to
      investigate the effects of modafinil on task performance and the integrity of neural circuits
      mediating response inhibition in treatment-seeking AUD with poor response inhibition, to
      establish target engagement. Secondary aims are to measure whether target engagement mediates
      improvement in alcohol use outcomes, and to utilize machine learning to identify neural and
      behavioral markers which best predict treatment outcomes. Twenty-four individuals with AUD
      and impaired response inhibition will be enrolled in the study, randomized to modafinil or
      placebo, and treated for 6 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans during a
      response inhibition task and during rest will be obtained at baseline and 2 weeks. Aversive
      stimuli will be included in the response inhibition task to assure that efficacy generalizes
      to several conditions. Diffusion imaging and arterial spin labeling sequences will also be
      obtained. Investigators predict that modafinil will significantly increase brain activity in
      the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex during response inhibition, thereby establishing
      target engagement, and that it will improve alcohol use outcomes. Findings will provide
      information about whether or not a larger R01 trial investigating the efficacy of modafinil
      for individuals with AUD and impaired response inhibition is warranted.
