  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate the user friendliness of a newly designed leg compression
      stocking kit, the SOCKNLEG, compared to a standard leg compression stocking of the same
      compression strength, the SIGVARIS Cotton. The SOCKNLEG is not yet commercially available,
      whereas the SIGVARIS Cotton has been successfully commercialized for many years.

      After an initial screening visit, a computer generated list will allocate the participants in
      either the SOCKNLEG or the SIGVARIS Cotton group.

      All participants will try on both study stockings, in the order of their allocated group, and
      will rate their donning and doffing success with a questionnaire. The patients will then wear
      only the assigned study stocking of their allocated group, for a day and rate its comfort
      again at the end of the day. The donning and doffing success will also be rated by the study
      investigator. Leg volume measurements of the study leg will be taken at each visit to
      determine edema prevention.
