      A long-term observational registry in patients with atopic dermatitis initiating treatment
      with DUPIXENT® (dupilumab)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study conducted to (1) characterize the patients who
      receive DUPIXENT® for AD in a real world setting with respect to their medical history,
      socio-demographic and disease characteristics, and prior and concomitant treatments of AD;
      (2) characterize real world use patterns of DUPIXENT® for AD (eg, most commonly used regimens
      by line of therapy, reason for initiation of new treatments, concomitant therapies, treatment
      durations and reasons for discontinuation and/or switching); (3) assess the long-term
      effectiveness of DUPIXENT® in adult AD patients in a real world setting; (4) assess comorbid
      atopic conditions, patterns of use and effects of treatment in comorbid atopic conditions in
      adult patients who receive DUPIXENT® for AD; and (6) collect safety data on study
      participants

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Initiating treatment with DUPIXENT® for AD according to the country-specific
             prescribing information (Note: Participants will be screened when they received their
             initial prescription for DUPIXENT®)

          2. Willing and able to comply with the study-related activities

          3. Able to understand and complete study-related questionnaires

          4. Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have a contraindication to the drug according to the country-specific
             prescribing information label.

          2. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with patient's
             ability to participate in the study, such as short life expectancy, substance abuse,
             severe cognitive impairment, or other co-morbidities that can predictably prevent the
             patient from adequately completing the schedule of visits and assessments.
