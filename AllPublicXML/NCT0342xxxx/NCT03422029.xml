      The purpose of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide
      Therapy (PRRT) with 177Lu-Dotatate in patients with inoperable, progressive, somatostatin
      receptor-positive (SSTR+), neuroendocrine tumours of GEP-NEN

             hypertension, or pulmonary disease ( interstitial pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary
             disease or symptomatic bronchospasm);

          6. Prior long term steroid therapy (excluding short term steroid treatment which is
