      First-line treatment of locally advanced HNSCC with double checkpoint blockade and
      radiotherapy dependent on intratumoral CD8+ T cell Infiltration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, prospective, non-randomized Phase II clinical trial of
      locally advanced HNSCC with double checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy dependent on
      intratumoral CD8+ T cell Infiltration.

      All patients will initially be treated with the PD-L1 inhibitor Durvalumab and the CTLA-4
      Inhibitor Tremelimumab and one cycle with Cisplatin (30mg/m² d1-3) and Docetaxel (75mg/m²
      d1). Treatment response will be evaluated clinically by endoscopy with biopsy. Changes of the
      CD8+ T cell density in the second biopsy compared to the first one before therapy will be
      used for patient selection. Patients with a stable or decreased CD8+ tumor infiltrating
      immune cell density or clinical progressive disease will receive standard CRT outside the
      trial. For these patients toxicity will be monitored until the first dose of the subsequent
      standard CRT. Patients with an increased CD8+ tumor infiltrating immune cell density and at
      least clinically stable disease will receive radioimmunotherapy with the PD-L1 Inhibitor
      Durvalumab and the CTLA4-Inhibitor Tremelimumab (altogether 4 doses q4w including the
      induction dose) followed by maintenance therapy with Durvalumab (8 additional doses q4w). The
      primary endpoint is feasibility. Feasibility criteria are receiving the protocol treatment
      until cycle 6 of antibody treatment and absence of any of the DLT defined in the protocol. A
      feasibility rate of ≥80% is expected. The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy and predictive
      character of changes of CD8+ tumor infiltrating immune cells after induction
      chemo-immunotherapy are further endpoints. The follow up period will be two years after the
      completion of radiotherapy.
