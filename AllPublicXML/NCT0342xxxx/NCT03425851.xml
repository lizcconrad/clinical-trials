  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adverse effects of poverty at the individual, family, and community level on health
      outcomes for children are well-established. Material hardship, defined as difficulty meeting
      basic needs such as food, housing, and consumer goods, has been shown to have negative
      physical and emotional effects on both children and their parents. Diaper need, defined as a
      lack of sufficient supply of clean and dry diapers, is an example of a material hardship.

      Community-based studies of low-income families have demonstrated that between 30-50% of
      caregivers of young children expressed diaper need. Some of these caregivers with diaper need
      reported reducing diaper changes, a practice that is associated with diaper dermatitis and
      urinary tract infections (UTIs). These community-based studies have also shown that diaper
      need is associated with maternal depression and parental stress, even after adjusting for
      demographic factors and food insecurity. Diaper need may be a specific modifiable marker of
      caregiver stress and depression, beyond its role as an indicator of poverty. In this pilot,
      randomized controlled trial of low-income newborns and their caregivers the investigators
      will test the feasibility of supplying diapers as an intervention to infants in low-income
      families and assess if it can improve both a child's health and their caregiver's overall
      health.

    <textblock>
      Infants born at Boston Medical Center and their caregivers will be recruited at any scheduled
      visit at Boston Medical Center's primary care clinic between birth and 2 months of age.
      Eligible caregivers will complete a baseline survey and provide consent for the study
      investigators to perform a prospective chart review. The infant-caregiver pair will be
      randomized to the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will
      receive 600 diapers, distributed in packs of 200 to the families at the conclusion of the 2
      month, 4 month, and 6 month old well-child visits. The control group will receive resources
      of diaper banks in the greater Boston area.

      Surveys:

        -  Baseline: At the initial visit, the survey will obtain baseline data from the child's
           caregiver on prior history of diaper need, current employment and income, government
           benefits, and other material hardships. The survey will also include the Protective
           Factors Strength Level and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), both validated
           measures. The survey will take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. Baseline surveys
           will be completed in person.

        -  Follow-up: At the 2 month, 4 month, 6 month, and 9 month well-child visits (as
           applicable based on age of enrollment), all enrolled families will complete a survey
           repeating the measures of diaper need, the Protective Factors Strength Level, and PHQ-9.
           Additional questions will ask about episodes of diaper rashes and economic impact of
           diaper need. Families in the intervention group will be asked about acceptability of the
           intervention at the conclusion of the study.

      Chart review: After the completion of the 2 month, 4 month, 6 month, and 9 month well-child
      visits, study staff will review the medical record for attendance at planned well-child
      visits, adherence to the immunization schedule, number of urgent care and ED visits, and
      incidence of diaper dermatitis and urinary tract infections requiring treatment. Demographic
      information extracted will include sex, race/ethnicity, and confirmation of insurance status.

      All survey and chart review data will be de-identified and entered into REDCap with a unique
      study identification number.

    <description>The Parents' Assessment of Protective Factors Instrument is used to measure the presence and magnitude of self-reported beliefs and behaviors that are indicators of the Strengthening Families protective factors, which can be used to mitigate risk factors and actively enhance family well-being. The instrument contains 36 items with a total score (Protective Factors Strength Index) and subscale scores for parental resilience, social connections, concrete support in times of need, social emotional competence of children. PFSI scores and subscales can range from 0 to 4, higher scores are more favorable.
The change in PFSI scores compared to baseline score and immediately prior score at each time point will be measured.</description>

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9) is a multipurpose instrument for screening, measuring, and monitoring depressive symptoms. It contains 9 questions with response options referenced to the past 2 weeks from 0 to 3 where 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, 3=nearly every day. Scores can range form 0 to 27, lower scores are more favorable.
The change in PHQ 9 scores compared to baseline score and immediately prior score at each time point will be measured.</description>
