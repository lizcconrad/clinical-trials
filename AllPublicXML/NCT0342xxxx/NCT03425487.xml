  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess and compare the benefits of two psychological
      interventions added to the usual treatment of patients who come to mental health. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to the following conditions: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
      (MBSR), Attachment-Based Compassion Therapy (ABCT) and a Treatment As Usual (TAU) Group. The
      participants in the two psychological intervention groups will also receive usual
      psychological/psychiatric treatment managed by their specialist. Mindfulness and Compassion
      groups will be composed of 30 participants each, and TAU group will be composed of 60
      participants (total sample n = 120).

      The principal hypothesis is that Mindfulness- and Compassion-based therapy + TAU will be more
      effective than TAU alone for treating anxious and depressive symptoms in clinical population.
      Secondary hypothesis, are: 1) Clinical patients who participate in Mindfulness-based therapy
      will obtain more significant improvements in the psychological variables than patients who
      only perform TAU. 2) Clinical patients who participate in Compassion-based therapy will
      obtain more significant improvements in the psychological variables than patients who only
      perform TAU. 3) Mindfulness- and Compassion-based therapies will be more cost-effectiveness
      than TAU.

    <description>In the MBSR based intervention group. This scale is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items, divided into subscales with similar content. The range for each subescale is 0-21 (But this scores will need to be multiplied by 2 to calculate the final score). Finally, in each of the subscales a low result is considered to be a &quot;healthy&quot; state (&quot;depression&quot;: score range 0-9; &quot;anxiety&quot;: 0-7; and &quot;stress&quot;: 0-14 are interpreted as &quot;normal&quot;).</description>

    <description>In the MBSR based intervention group. This scale is currently the only self-report instrument to measure self-compassion. The SCS is divided into six subscales: 4-item Self-Kindness; 4-item Self-Judgment; 4-item Common Humanity; 4-item Isolation; 4-item Mindfulness; and 4-item Over-Identification. The items can be rated on a five-point likert scale with 1 indicating almost never and 5 indicating almost always. After reversing the negatively formulated items, a total score can be calculated, which may range from 24 to 120, with higher scores indicating greater self-compassion.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In the MBSR based intervention group. The EuroQol-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The construct &quot;health status&quot; is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self-care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in &quot;work, study, housework, family or leisure activities&quot;. In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level scale.</description>
