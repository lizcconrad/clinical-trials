      This randomized phase III trial studies short course vaginal cuff brachytherapy to see how
      well it works compared with standard of care vaginal cuff brachytherapy in treating patients
      with stage I-II endometrial cancer. Short course vaginal cuff brachytherapy, also known as
      internal radiation therapy, uses (over a shorter period) radioactive material placed directly
      into or near a tumor in the upper portion of the vagina to kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the non-inferiority of patient health related quality of life (HRQOL) using the
      Global Health Score from the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) in the 2 arms
      one month after treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare treatment-related symptoms on HRQOL using European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer Endometrial Cancer Module (EORTC EN24), question 48 between the two
      treatment arms.

      II. Compare cost effectiveness between the two treatment arms.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Report vaginal, bowel, and bladder symptoms on HRQOL using the EORTC EN24 the two
      treatment arms.

      II. Evaluate toxicities between the two treatment arms. III. Compare local recurrence and
      document patterns of recurrence between the two treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo short course vaginal cuff brachytherapy for 2 fractions with 1 week
      apart.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care vaginal cuff brachytherapy for 3-5 fractions over
      no more than 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months.

    <description>Scores determined from patient completed questionnaires will be compared between the two treatment arms one month after treatment completion. The primary analysis will be analysis of covariance with Global Health Score at one month post therapy as Gaussian response variable, treatment group as a fixed effect and baseline Global Health Score as a continuous adjustment variable.
The primary hypothesis is that the Global Health Score is non-inferior in the Experimental Arm compared to the Control Arm. Differences of 10 points or more in the global scales are widely viewed as being clinically significant when evaluating the results of randomized clinical trials and thus we will use a 10 point equivalence margin.

    <description>Scores determined from patient completed question, Have you felt less feminine due to your disease or treatment? will be compared between the two treatment arms. Ordinal logistic regression will be used to analyze this question, with one month value as outcome variable, treatment arm as primary predictor, and the baseline value as covariate. A non-inferiority analysis will be performed with equivalence margin equal to 6.1 points, which represents approximately 1/2 standard deviation. Additional exploratory logistic regression analyses will include the values at all time points (baseline, one</description>
