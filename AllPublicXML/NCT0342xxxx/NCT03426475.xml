  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previously,six measures were developed for a better collaboration of general practitioners
      and nurses in nursing homes in a qualitative multistep bottom-up process. These measures,
      summarised as the interprof ACT intervention, shall improve the flow of information and the
      communication between the involved parties and lead to more transparency and effectiveness
      regarding treatment decisions of nursing home residents.The major aim of this trial is to
      examine the clinical effectiveness of interprof ACT. The main hypothesis is that
      implementation of interprof ACT reduces the cumulative incidence of hospitalisations of
      nursing home residents within 12 months from 50% to 35% (15% absolute reduction).

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L consist of two self-rating components: the EQ-5D descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system measures HRQL on the five dimensions &quot;mobility&quot;, &quot;self-care&quot;, &quot;usual activities&quot;, &quot;pain / discomfort&quot; and &quot;anxiety / depression&quot;. On each dimension participants can rate either &quot;no problems&quot; (0), &quot;slight problems&quot; (1), &quot;moderate problems&quot; (2), &quot;severe problems&quot; (3) or &quot;extreme problems&quot; (4), resulting in a score ranging from 0 (best) to 4 (worst). The scores of the single dimensions can be combined to a sum score ranging from 0 (best) to 20 (worst). In addition, so called &quot;utility weights&quot; can be attached to any possible combination of answers on the EQ-5D descriptive system which results in a utility score ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (full HRQL), which is then used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The EQ VAS ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>
