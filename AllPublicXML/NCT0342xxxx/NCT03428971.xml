      It is suggested that P-wave terminal force (Ptf), a product of the amplitude (PAM) and the
      duration (PT) of the terminal phase of P-wave in lead V1, shows early delay in left atrial
      conduction, observed earlier that the dilatation of left atrium.

      The aim is to follow PT, PAM and Ptf changes during 5-year follow-up (5FU) and examine the
      relation of these changes to the number of AF episodes requiring hospitalisation (HOSP) for
      restoration of sinus rhythm (RSR).

      Background. It is suggested that P-wave terminal force (Ptf), a product of the amplitude
      (PAM) and the duration (PT) of the terminal phase of P-wave in lead V1, shows early delay in
      left atrial conduction, observed earlier that the dilatation of left atrium.

      Aim. We aim to follow PT, PAM and Ptf changes during 5-year follow-up (5FU) and examine the
      relation of these changes to the number of AF episodes requiring hospitalisation (HOSP) for
      restoration of sinus rhythm (RSR).

      We hypothesise that, in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF):

        1. the index parameters (PT, PAM, Ptf), characterising left atrial repolarization,
           correlates the number of future hospitalisations (HOSP) aimed for restoration of sinus
           rhythm (RSR) in 5-year follow-up (5FU)

        2. in 5FU the number of HOSP aimed for RSR correlates with the progression of left atrium
           electrical remodelling, expressed as PAM5,PT5, Ptf5 at 5FU.

    <description>All measurements based on ECG recording during sinus rhythm only.
&quot;P-wave time (PT)&quot; defined as time (measured in milliseconds, [ms]) of negative deflection of P wave in V1 lead of the standard 12-lead ECG;
&quot;P-wave amplitude (PAM)&quot; defined as maximum amplitude (measured in millivolts, [mV]) of negative deflection of P wave in V1 lead of the standard 12-lead ECG;
&quot;P-wave terminal force (Ptf)&quot; is a product of the amplitude and the duration of the terminal phase of P-wave in lead V1; Ptf = PT x PAM [ms x mV];
PT and PAM measured at index is defined as PT0 and PAM0, respectively
Calculated Ptf as a product of PT0 and PAM0 is defined as Ptf0;
PT and PAM measured at 5FU is defined as PT5 and PAM5, respectively;
Calculated Ptf as a product of PT5 and PAM5 is defined as Ptf5;
The change between PT0 and PT5 (PTC = PT5 - PT0) , PAM0 and PAM5 (PAMC = PAM5 - PAM0), Ptf0 and Ptf5 (PtfC = Ptf5 - Ptf0) will be calculated for each patient;</description>
