  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to explore the impact of combining laparoscopic greater curvature
      plication with a single gastro-ileal anastomosis in the same manner of single anastomosis
      sleeve ileal bypass on weight loss and postoperative complications. The objective of this
      combined procedure is to reduce the high intraluminal pressure that results after
      laparoscopic greater curvature plication owing to reduced intraluminal space which can lead
      to suture line leakage, vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Another objective is
      to add a malabsorptive element to the restrictive effect of laparoscopic greater curvature
      plication and to induce early satiety in patients by distention of the distal bowel with
      nutrients immediately after meals, similar to the way that single anastomosis sleeve ileal
      bypass works.

    <description>laparoscopic plication of the greater curvature of the stomach then the duodeno-jejunal junction is identified and 300 cm is measured downwards. The selected loop will be ascended without division of the greater omentum, and a stapled isoperistaltic side-to-side to the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach just 3 cm away from the pylorus with a linear stapler charged with a green cartridge, the diameter of ileal antrum anastomosis is not exceeding 3 cm in diameter. The staple defect is closed with a two-layer running 3/0 polyglactin suture</description>
