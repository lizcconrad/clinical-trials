  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial project to analyze the effectiveness of lumbar motor
      control exercises and lumbar resistance training on pain, functional, kinesiophobia and trunk
      strength in individual with chronic low back pain. The project has two parallel arms and will
      be supervised by physiotherapists (motor control exercises) and physical education
      professionals (resistance training). The participants will be Militaries of the Military Fire
      Department of the Federal District who presents in the recruitment regular low back pain more
      than 3 months. The two groups will be supervised in12 weeks of exercises in the Physical
      Activity Center of Military Fire Department of the Federal District. Our hypotheses is that
      the resistance training effects wil be superior to motor control exercises only for trunk
      strength (isokinetic flexion and extension).

    <measure>Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>In a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), patients are asked to circle the number between 0 and 10, 0 and 20 or 0 and 100 that fits best to their pain intensity. Zero usually represents 'no pain at all' whereas the upper limit represents 'the worst pain ever possible'.</description>

    <measure>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires to measure and monitor changes in functional outcome in patients with LBP. The RDQ evaluates 24 activity limitations due to LBP, while the ODI consists of 10 items assessing the level of pain interference with physical activities.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the excessive, irrational, and debilitating fear of movement and activity resulting from a feeling of vulnerability to painful injury or re-injury. Its a 17-item scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed by a isokinetic dynamometer. Today dynamometry routinely assesses muscle performance in healthy and symptomatic populations.</description>

    <description>A type of strength-building exercise program that requires the body muscle to exert a force against some form of resistance, such as weight, stretch bands, water, or immovable objects. Resistance exercise is a combination of static and dynamic contractions involving shortening and lengthening of skeletal muscles.</description>
