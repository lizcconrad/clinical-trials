  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced, resectable gastric or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma
      will receive a biopsy of the primary tumor, followed by standard-of care neoadjuvant systemic
      treatment; after neoadjuvant therapy tumor biopsies will be taken from different sites of the
      resection specimen.

        -  Organoid cultures of pre-treatment tumor biopsies will be established and exposed to the
           same chemotherapy as the corresponding patient; in vitro response to treatment will be
           correlated with the in vivo response of patients.

        -  Whole genome, methylome and RNA sequencing of tumors biopsies and organoids will be
           performed prior to as well as after systemic treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histologically confirmed, resectable adenocarcinoma of the GEJ (type I-III) or the stomach
        (cT2, cT3,cT4, any cN category, M0), or any cT cN+ M0 with the following specifications:

          -  ECOG-Score ≤ 2

          -  Patient is fit to undergo surgery (either subtotal or total gastrectomy, transhiatal
             or abdominothoracic esophagectomy)

          -  No preceding cytotoxic or targeted therapy

          -  No prior partial or complete tumor resection

          -  Exclusion of distant metastasis by CT or MRI of thorax and abdomen, and optionally
             bone scan (if osseous lesions are suspected due to clinical signs)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with distant metastasis

          -  Known hypersensitivity against components of the neoadjuvant systemic treatment

          -  Documented history of congestive heart failure NYHA ≥III, myocardial infarction within
             the past 3 months before the start of neoadjuvant treatment

          -  Uncontrollable high-risk cardiac arrhythmia, e.g. significant ventricular arrhythmia

          -  Past or current history of other malignancies not curatively treated and without
             evidence of disease for more than 5 years, except for curatively treated early stage
             cancers such as basal cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ carcinoma of the cervix
             or the bladder.
