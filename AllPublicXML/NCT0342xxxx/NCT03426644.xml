      Investigators seek to determine if an online behavioral economic based intervention can be
      developed to target increases in childhood time in bed (TIB). The primary objectives of this
      study are to determine if the behavioral economic strategy of compensatory effect leads to
      the middle time in bed (TIB) target to be most commonly selected, and if the behavioral
      economic strategies of normative feedback and loss-framed incentives lead to longer TIB and
      therefore longer total sleep time.Children aged 10-12 who sleep about 7-8 hours per night
      will wear a FitBit for 11 weeks in order to measure time in bed and total sleep time.
      Participants will have a time in bed goal to meet each night. Participants will be randomized
      to one of four study arms and receive text and/or email messaging from the study about sleep
      hygiene. Some study arms receive additional messaging. The study involves two visits to the
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Roberts Center for Pediatric Research.
