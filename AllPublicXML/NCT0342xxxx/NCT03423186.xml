  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MPS IIIA, also known as Sanfilippo A, is an inherited lysosomal storage disease (LSD). MPS
      IIIA is caused by a deficiency in sulfamidase, one of the enzymes involved in the lysosomal
      degradation of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate (HS). The natural course of MPS
      IIIA is characterized by devastating neurodegeneration with initially mild somatic
      involvement. The aims of the present study is to assess the dose related safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD of SOBI003, a chemically modified recombinant human (rh) Sulfamidase
      developed as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).

      This is an open-label, non-controlled, parallel, sequential ascending multiple-dose,
      multicenter study to assess the dose related safety, tolerability, PK and PD of SOBI003 in
      pediatric MPS IIIA patients. Patients between 1 and 6 years of age who have not received
      previous treatment for MPS IIIA with an ERT, gene- or stem cell therapy will be eligible to
      participate in the study. The study is planned to consist of 3 dose cohorts, each comprising
      3 patients. Treatment initiations will be staggered within each cohort in order to be able to
      observe, interpret and treat possible adverse reactions. SOBI003 is administered as weekly
      i.v. infusions over a period of 24 weeks. Upon completion of the 24-week treatment period
      with satisfactory tolerability, the patient is offered to receive continued SOBI003 treatment
      by participation in an extension study.
