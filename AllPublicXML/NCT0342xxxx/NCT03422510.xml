      of CXA-10 in subjects 18 to 70 years of age with primary FSGS.

      The study will be performed at approximately 20 study centers across the United States of
      America (USA). The recruitment period is anticipated to be up to approximately 12 months.
      Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized to ensure 26 subjects complete the study.

      Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized.

      Study participation for each subject will last up to 5 months. The study will consist of a
      screening period not to exceed 30 days (1 month), 90-day (3 month) treatment period, and an
      approximate 28-day (1 month) follow-up period after the last dose of study medication.

                  bilirubin is elevated, examination of direct and indirect bilirubin may be
                  conducted to evaluate for Rotor's/Gilbert's Syndrome. Subjects with
                  Rotor's/Gilbert's Syndrome may be enrolled.

         24. Any other condition and/or situation that causes the Investigator to deem a subject
             unsuitable for the study (e.g., due to expected study medication non-compliance,
             inability to medically tolerate the study procedures, or a subject's unwillingness to
             comply with study-related procedures).

         25. The subject has known hypersensitivity to CXA-10, its metabolites, or formulation
             excipients.

         26. The subject has had treatment with any investigational drug or device within 30 days
             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Screening (Visit 1) (this includes
