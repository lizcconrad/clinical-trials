  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study conducted
      at one study center in Switzerland.

      Four (4) panels (A, B, C and D) of 8 male subjects (6 active and 2 placebo) each undergoing 2
      investigation periods and receiving either single doses of PBTZ169 at increasing dose levels
      or a matching placebo.

      Subjects will participate in only one panel. Blocks of 4 subjects (3 under active treatment,
      1 under placebo) will be investigated in parallel. Panels A and B are interleaved.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial ECGs and serial blood samples will be
      collected for the safety and PK assessment of PBTZ169.

      Dose escalation will be allowed once the Trial Safety Board has determined that adequate
      safety and tolerability after panel B and panel C completion has been demonstrated to permit
      proceeding to the next panel.
