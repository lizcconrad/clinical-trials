  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Many people suffer from drug addiction. But currently, treatments are not very effective. One
      group of patients in this study are enrolled in addiction treatment through physician health
      programs (PHPs). About 70% of these patients are able to stop using drugs for extended
      periods of time. By studying this specific group of patients, researchers want to understand
      the difference between those who may or may not respond to treatment. They want to study the
      brain while people do thinking and feeling tasks and when they relax. They will study brain
      chemicals, a stress hormone, and certain genes. The results may help them understand the
      brain basis for addiction and recovery.

      Objectives:

      To use brain imaging to find differences between people with and without drug addiction. To
      see if these differences help predict addiction.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 25 65, enrolled in a physician health program or those with
      no history of addiction and with at least 16 years of education

      Design:

      Participants enrolled in a PHP will be screened under this study and participants with no
      history of addiction will be screened under another study.

      At the study visit, participants will:

      Have a routine check-up, including tests for pregnancy, drugs, and alcohol.

      Give 11 blood samples.

      Rate their cravings.

      Test their frustration with stressful situations by responding to questions on a screen.

      Practice the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tasks:

      Shock task. Two electrodes placed on a foot will deliver brief, low-strength electrical
      shocks that get gradually stronger, but not painful. Participants will see drug or neutral
      images. They will rate their discomfort.

      Thinking tasks. Participants will answer questions about pictures, numbers, and money. They
      will press buttons in response to things they see.

      Do the MRI tasks in 2 sessions (morning and afternoon) in the scanner. Participants will lie
      in an MRI machine which will take pictures of the brain while doing these tasks.

      Some participants will repeat the visit twice over a year at set intervals.

      Meals will be provided, and visits will include meal breaks and smoking breaks for those who
      smoke.

      Objective:

      Despite recent advance in addiction neuroscience, achieving a breakthrough in predicting
      addiction treatment outcome has been difficult and long-term abstinence success unacceptably
      low. The aim of this study is to create a biomarker using various neuroimaging metrics that
      can predict treatment outcome in opioid and alcohol use disorder patients.

      Study Population:

      The study population will include three hundred fifty (350) participants (50 per group) based
      on their addiction status (1) healthy, non-drug using control participants (CON) (2)
      Early-in-treatment, healthy prescription opioid use disorder participants currently enrolled
      in physician health program (PHP) within 2 month of starting treatment (POUD-E), (3)
      Long-term-in-treatment, healthy prescription opioid use disorder participants currently
      enrolled in PHP more than 2 months and less than 5 years (POUD-L), (4) Early-in-treatment,
      healthy alcohol use disorder participants currently enrolled in PHP within 2 month of
      starting treatment (AUD-E), (5) Long-term-in-treatment, healthy alcohol use disorder
      participants currently enrolled in PHP more than 2 months and less than 5 years (AUD-L), (6)
      Early-in-treatment, healthy dual prescription opioid and alcohol and use disorder
      participants currently enrolled in PHP within 2 month of starting treatment (POAUD-E), (7)
      Long-term-in-treatment, healthy dual prescription opioid and alcohol use disorder
      participants currently enrolled in PHP more than 2 months and less than 5 years (POAUD-L).

      Design: Two studies will run simultaneously:

        1. Cross-sectional study that will include all participants enrolled at a PHP over the past
           5 years and have been in treatment for more than 2 months. Three target groups, in
           addition to the control group, will be included in this study [POUD-L, AUD-L, and
           POAUD-L]. Each participant will complete a screening evaluation session (approximately
           3-4 hours) at the PHP through secure communication. The screening visit will include the
           consenting process and the administration of questionnaires to characterize clinical
           phenotype, and physical condition. Participants enrolled in the cross-sectional study
           will be invited to come to NIDA IRP for one imaging visit that will take approximately
           6-8 hours. The aim of the cross-sectional study is to identify imaging based brain
           differences between control group and drug using groups and to examine correlations
           between brain imaging markers at different stages of recovery and (1) severity of drug
           use (duration and quantity), (2) duration of abstinence, and (3) number of relapses in
           drug using groups. The primary outcome measure for the cross-sectional study will be
           differences in functional connectivity and BOLD signal activation in executive and
           impulsive neurobehavioral decision systems at various stages of sobriety in relation to
           controls.

        2. Longitudinal study that will include all participants enrolled at PHP within two months
           of starting treatment. Three groups, in addition to the control group, will be included
           in this study [POUD-E, AUDE, and POAUD-E]. Each participant will complete the screening
           evaluation session as described in the cross-sectional study and three imaging visits at
           NIDA; 1) baseline visit within 2 months from enrolling in the study, (2) mid-year visit
           within 4-8 months from baseline visit and (3) one-year visit within 10-14 months from
           baseline visit. Each imaging visit will take approximately 6-8 hours. The aim of the
           longitudinal study is to measure brain imaging changes over time in abstinent and
           relapsing addicts and to identify brain imaging markers that differentiate between
           abstinent and relapsing participants at 6 months and at 1 year. The rationale behind the
           mid-year visit is that most relapses take place early (within the first 6 months) during
           treatment and by one year some of those who relapsed earlier achieve abstinence and by
           including this visit, we will preclude a contaminated sample of both abstinent without
           early relapse and abstinent with early relapse which could confound our results. The
           primary outcome measure for the longitudinal study will be differences in baseline and
           changes over time in functional connectivity circuits, BOLD signal activation in
           executive and impulsive neurobehavioral decision systems between abstinent and relapsing
           addicts that can predict treatment response at 6 and 12 months.

      Secondary outcome measures for both studies will be phenotypic (performance on behavioral
      tasks, self-reported measures of cravings, impulsivity and personality traits), genotypic and
      imaging (structural and spectroscopy) differences between different addiction groups.
