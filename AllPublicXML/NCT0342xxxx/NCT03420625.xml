  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, four different devices which stimulate the blood in the lower extremities are
      used in ten healthy persons while measuring the blood flow with ultrasound. The aim is to
      study the haemodymamic effects in the lower extremities of each modality and also to compare
      those effects between the four modalities in order to identify those which most effective
      than the others.

    <textblock>
      Three Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) devices were selected: Foot-IPC, rapid
      Calf-IPC and a slow, sequential Calf-IPC. A Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES)
      device was also used in the calf. Blood flow measurements in the right popliteal vein of ten
      healthy individuals were performed using Doppler ultrasound before (control) and while using
      IPC or NMES. The blood flow parameters measured where: peak systolic velocity (cm/s),
      time-averaged mean velocity (cm/sec), volume flow (ml/min) and ejected volume per individual
      stimulus (ml). The tolerability of each device was also assessed using an analogue scale from
      zero to ten. Differences between modalities regarding the pattern as well as the absolute
      values of velocity and volume are being assessed. Power calculation: Recent studies showed
      that the peak venous velocity (PV) at baseline is around 11 cm/s and after applying foot-IPC
      the PV rises to 50 cm/s with a maximum standard deviation of 15 (Broderick et all, 2014).
      Thus, three patients per group would be required to detect a difference of 39 cm/s in PV
      (two-sided type-I error rate = 5%; power = 80%). To reach an even higher power we choose to
      include 10 patients in study, which resulted in a power of 99.7% for the above calculation.
