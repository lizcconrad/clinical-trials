    <textblock>
      This study is planned for investigating effect of downhill-uphill walking exercises on
      functional level and muscle strength in patients with knee arthroplasty. Patients who have
      had primary knee arthroplasty and has gone 3 months after surgery will be included in this
      study. The patients will be divided into two groups by randomization. Totally, 22 patients
      will be included in this study. Every patients will have same standart post-operative
      rehabilitation programme. In addition,group 1 will have downhill walking exercises with %10
      slope; group 2 uphill walking exercises on the treadmill with %10 slope. Assessments will be
      made before and after treatment.

      This study is planned for investigating effect of downhill-uphill walking exercises on
      functional level and muscle strength in patients with knee arthroplasty. Patients who have
      had primary knee arthroplasty and has gone 3 months after surgery will be included in this
      study. The patients will be divided into two groups by randomization. Totally, 22 patients
      will be included in this study. Every patients will have same standart post-operative
      rehabilitation programme. Assessments will be made before and after treatment. Rehabilitation
      programme after knee arthroplasty has included muscle strength and endurance, balance and
      proprioceptive sensation, increasing functional level and providing independence in daily
      life activities.For this purpose, a standard physiotherapy program will be implemented in
      accordance with the goals and objectives stated for all patients. In addition,group 1 will
      have downhill walking exercises with %10 slope; group 2 uphill walking exercises on the
      treadmill with %10 slope. It takes 30 minutes for one session.

      Exercise intensity was measured before treatment; will be determined using the Karvonen
      formula depending on the heart rate. Walking intensity during exercise; 55% of the maximum
      heart rate will be determined at the beginning of the treatment and 85% towards the end of
      the treatment. Walking exercise on the treadmill will be performed in conjunction with a
      qualified physiotherapist in this area for 4 weeks(3 session in 1 week).

      Within the scope of the assessments, patients' pain levels will be determined using the
      Numeric Pain Scale (NAS). For the knee joint, the normal range of motion will be determined
      by universal goniometer. For the determination of functional level, Iowa functional activity
      scale, Iowa ambulatory speed scale and Hospital For Special Surgery (HSS) knee scoring,
      10-meter walking speed, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, SF-12(12-Item Short Form Survey) quality
      of life scale will be used. Hand dynamometer will be used to evaluate muscle strength.These
      assessments will be made before and after treatment.

    <measure>Change of Iowa Level of Assistance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Patient's Functional Level at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test assesses the patient's ability to perform four functional activities, namely, supine to sitting on the edge of the bed,sitting on the edge of the bed to standing, walking 4.57 metres. The scoring of these activities is done as independent 6 points, observational aid 5 points, minimum help 4 points, medium help 3 points, maximum help 2 points, fail 1 point and untest 0 points. Higher values represent a better outcome.
Speed scoring is done by evaluating the walking speed at a distance of 13.4 meters (44 steps). 20 seconds (sec) and below are recorded as 0, 21-30 sec 1, 31-40 sec 2, 41-50 3, 51-60 sec 4, 61-70 sec 5 and 70 sec. Higher values represent a worse outcome</description>

    <description>Individual walks without assistance 10 meters and the time is measured for the intermediate 6 meters to allow for acceleration and deceleration, start timing when the toes of the leading foot crosses the 2-meter mark, stop timing when the toes of the leading foot crosses the 8-meter mark,assistive devices can be used but should be kept consistent and documented from test to test, if physical assistance is required to walk, this should not be performed can be performed at preferred walking speed or fastest speed possible documentation should include the speed tested (preferred vs. fast) collect three trials and calculate the average of the three trials</description>

    <description>To determine fall risk and measure the progress of balance, sit to stand, and walking.The patient starts in a seated position. The patient stands up upon therapist's command walks 3 meters, turns around, walks back to the chair and sits down. The time stops when the patient is seated. The subject is allowed to use an assistive device.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline SF-12 score Level at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 Health Survey is a shorter version of the SF-36 Health Survey that uses just 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The SF-12 is a practical, reliable and valid measure of physical and mental health and is particularly useful in large population health surveys or for applications that combine a generic and disease-specific health survey.</description>
