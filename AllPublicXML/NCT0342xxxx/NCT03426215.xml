      This observational study will assess the long-term course and effect of Korean medicine
      treatment in lumbar intervertebral disc herniation patients with a main complaint of
      radiating leg pain who received integrative Korean medicine treatment for 24 weeks at Jaseng
      Hospital of Korean Medicine (Gangnam main branch) as part of a previous clinical study which
      was conducted from November, 2006 to April, 2007, and give written informed consent to
      long-term follow-up assessment at 10 years.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of radiating leg pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference from baseline at 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) uses a 10cm line labeled at each end with scale anchors. In pain measurement using VAS, patients are asked to mark a point that represents their pain between the anchors of 'no pain (minimum score: 0)' and 'worst pain imaginable (maximum score: 100)'. Total scores are recorded in millimeters with a total range of 0-100 millimeters. Higher VAS values represent more severe pain, and a greater change from baseline (If baseline - follow up is a positive value) indicates a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of low back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) uses a 10cm line labeled at each end with scale anchors. In pain measurement using VAS, patients are asked to mark a point that represents their pain between the anchors of 'no pain (minimum score: 0)' and 'worst pain imaginable (maximum score: 100)'. Total scores are recorded in millimeters with a total range of 0-100 millimeters. Higher VAS values represent more severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of low back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>In pain measurement using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), patients are asked to rate their pain by selecting a number from 0 to 10 that best represents their pain severity between the anchors of 0 which indicates 'no pain', and 10 which indicates 'worst pain possible'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is a 10-item questionnaire developed to assess level of disability due to low back pain (LBP). Each item is graded into 6 levels, each representing a score of 0-5. Higher scores indicate greater limitation relating to LBP.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 consists of 36 items across 8 domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. SF-36 is used to rate functional health and well-being in patients and healthy individuals. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC grades the level of subjective improvement into 7 levels (1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, slightly improved; 4, no change; 5, slightly worse; 6, much worse; and 7, very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lumbar range of movement (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>ROM measurements are valid (r=0.97) and reliable (r=0.94), but not highly responsive (effect size=0.1-0.6). If ROM is uncheckable from pain, the angle will be recorded as 0°.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Straight leg raise (SLR) test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>While SLR measurements are reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.95), they are not very responsive (effect size=0.2). If SLR is uncheckable from pain, the angle will be recorded as 0°.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative questionnaire on 10 year course</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The qualitative questionnaire on 10 year course and outcome since receiving integrative Korean medicine treatment used in this study is a 14-item descriptive evaluation encompassing various items (a mixture of short-answer questions, multiple choices, and transcript of essay form answers) on the change before and after treatment over the course of 10 years (e.g. change in perception of surgery and non-surgical treatment, change in everyday life or habits, and treatment recommendation to others).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical history</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Physicians will rate the causal relationship of each treatment from the previous clinical study with the patient's medical history potentially associated with treatment on a 6-point scale (1, definitely related; 2, probably related; 3, possibly related; 4, probably not related; 5, definitely not related; and 6, unknown), and classify all medical history potentially associated with treatment with the Spilker classification, which has 3 grades (1, mild: no intervention needed and does not greatly impede normal activity (function) of patient; 2, moderate: significantly impedes normal activity (function) of patient, and may need intervention, with subsequent resolution; 3, severe: severe adverse event needing intensive intervention, leaving sequela).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
