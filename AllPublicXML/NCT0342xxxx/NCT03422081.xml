      Principal objective : Validation of a handy biochemical parameter, plasma concentration of
      Asymmetric DimethylArginine (ADMA), based on a recognize biochemical parameter, the dilation
      of the brachial artery, at ultrasound examination, after the deflation of a cushion to
      evaluate artery dysfunction (vascular suffering) in growth diseases, growth hormone
      deficiency (GHD) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Comparison of ADMA plasma concentrations with dose of matched healthy control children

        -  Investigation of the mechanisms of arterial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress
           and insulin resistance.
