      This is a single-arm, open label, Phase II study of Roflumilast in stable-state non-cystic
      fibrosis bronchiectasis subjects.

      Bronchiectasis refers to a suppurative lung condition characterized by pathological
      dilatation of bronchi. The predominant aetiology of bronchiectasis in the Western population
      is related to cystic fibrosis (CF), which is genetically determined. Bronchiectasis due to
      other causes are generally grouped under the term &quot;non-CF bronchiectasis&quot;, which accounts for
      practically all cases that are seen commonly in Hong Kong and many other Chinese populations.

      The main pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis involves airway inflammation, abnormal mucus
      clearance and bacterial colonization, resulting in progressive airway destruction and
      distortion. The current treatment strategies mainly focus on targeting the key elements in
      the pathogenesis of non-CF bronchiectasis.

      In patients with bronchiectasis, there is also neutrophilic inflammation as in COPD. It is
      hypothesized that roflumilast can improve airway inflammation, sputum volume and sputum
      inflammatory markers in patients with bronchiectasis.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of short-term (4-week) treatment with roflumilast
      on neutrophilic airway inflammation in stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apart from regular chest physiotherapy and postural drainage to help clearing mucus from
      bronchiectatic airways, inhalational and parenteral antibiotics have also been used to reduce
      the bacterial load in destroyed airways, thus controlling and preventing infective
      exacerbations. In recent years, accumulated evidence has suggested a central role of airway
      inflammation and immune dysregulation in the evolution of non-CF bronchiectasis. The
      classical type of airway inflammation is neutrophilic, with abundance of neutrophils in
      sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial biopsy from patients with non-CF
      bronchiectasis, even in clinically stable-state. The recruitment and trafficking of
      neutrophils to bronchiectatic airways are mediated via various pro-inflammatory cytokines
      like interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and leukotriene B4
      (LTB4). Investigators have also shown in an in vitro model that sputum from patients with
      non-CF bronchiectasis could stimulate IL-6 production from normal human bronchial epithelial
      cells, mediated via TNF-alpha. Recent data have suggested the involvement of Th17 immunity,
      in which Th17-polarized Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4) T cells can respond to bacteria
      (especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in bronchiectatic airways by elaboration of IL-17,
      leading to downstream IL-8 release from airway epithelial cells, neutrophil chemotaxis, mucus
      hypersecretion and formation of ectopic lymphoid follicles. This IL-17 driven pathway can
      further aggravate the vicious circle of key pathogenetic mechanisms in non-CF bronchiectasis.
      In previous studies, airway neutrophilic inflammation as indicated by sputum neutrophil count
      was inversely correlated with lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1) and
      directly with duration of disease and severity (Bronchiectasis Severity Score, BSI) in stable
      non-CF bronchiectasis. Investigators have also demonstrated that sputum elastase, released
      from airway neutrophils, significantly correlated with 24-hour sputum volume, number of
      bronchiectatic lobes, percent predicted FEV1, and sputum leukocyte count in stable-state
      bronchiectasis. Patients with non-CF bronchiectasis harbouring Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed
      greater sputum neutrophilia and volume, with lower FEV1 and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC)
      ratio in previous studies from our group and others.

      This study aims to investigate the extent of airway inflammation in non-CF bronchiectasis is
      indicated by sputum leukocyte density (primary outcome measure), pro-inflammatory cytokines
      (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-alpha, LTB4 and IL-17) and neutrophil elastase. Investigators hypothesize
      that 4-week treatment of roflumilast in stable-state non-CF bronchiectasis can result in: (1)
      reduction in sputum leukocyte density (primary hypothesis); (2) reduction in sputum
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-17) and LTB4; (3) reduction in
      sputum neutrophil elastase; (4) reduction in 24-h sputum volume; (5) no change in sputum
      bacterial colonization, load and microbiome.

    <description>Roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor is approved worldwide (including Hong Kong) for treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with frequent exacerbations. Roflumilast has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effect in patients with COPD, with significant reduction of sputum absolute neutrophil count, IL-8 and neutrophil elastase compared with placebo treatment. Roflumilast can also improve the lung function parameters in patients with COPD and reduce the rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations.</description>
