  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mastectomy is a major surgery that can have a profound effect on women's psychosocial
      wellbeing, including elevated depression and body image distress. Reconstructive breast
      surgery aims to improve patients' psychosocial adjustment to mastectomy, yet for some women
      substantial distress persists after reconstruction. However, very little is known about risk
      or protective factors for persistent depression or body image distress following mastectomy
      with reconstruction. The present study aims to address this critical gap. In women undergoing
      mastectomy with breast reconstruction, the investigators will assess risk and protective
      factors for post-surgery depression severity and body image distress.

    <description>The investigators will assess mental health history and self-reported psychosocial variables as hypothesized risk and protective factors for body image and depression severity in breast reconstruction patients, before and after their mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery. Mastectomy and breast reconstruction will be received in the context of routine medical care. Thus, this is not a psychological intervention, but rather observational measures assessed pre- and post routine care for breast reconstruction patients.</description>
