  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal builds upon the evaluation of Primary Palliative Care Education, Training, and
      Technical Support for Emergency Medicine (PRIM-ER) implemented in 33 Emergency Departments
      (EDs). This is a retrospective cohort study that seeks to measure the effect of PRIM-ER on
      older adults with serious illness on aspects of: 1) ED disposition to an acute setting; 2)
      healthcare utilization in the 6 months following the index ED visit; 3) survival following
      the index ED visit; and 4) determine site, provider, and patient-level characteristics that
      are associated with variation in impact of PRIM-ER across sites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must demonstrate one-year mortality of at least 30 percent (score &gt; 6)
             according to the Gagne Index, a validated instrument used to measure all cause
             one-year mortality in community-dwelling older adults, calculated based on their prior
             12 months before the index ED visit of Medicare claims.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ED patients transferred from a nursing home on the index ED visit will be excluded
             since prediction of mortality and disposition of such patients differs from
             community-dwelling adults.

          -  Patients currently receiving hospice at the time of the index ED visit will also be
             excluded since they have already received services.
