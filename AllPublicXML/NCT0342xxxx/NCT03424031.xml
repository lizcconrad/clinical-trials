  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional recovery is one of the main issues in the management of stroke and there are
      various ways in rehabilitation to promote this recovery.

      Verticalization is a technique whose benefits have been widely demonstrated, particularly in
      neurology. Although commonly used in the rehabilitation of stroke, evidence is still lacking
      as to its impact in this specific care.

      Verticalization is underutilized in two situations: in the hyper acute phase as well as in
      elderly and very deficient patients. It has, however, been shown that the precocity of the
      treatment allows a better functional recovery. Similarly, the re-education of the elderly is
      also debated since it has long been mentioned that age was a factor of poor prognosis, the
      objectives are sometimes underestimated. However, several studies have shown that with the
      same rehabilitation, elderly patients recover as much as younger patients. The differences
      found are at least in part due to &quot;less rehabilitation&quot; of older stroke patients.

      The different existing data lead us to the hypothesis that the verticalization of the elderly
      hemiplegic patient in acute phase would allow a better functional recovery.

    <intervention_name>Verticalization</intervention_name>
    <description>To allow the verticalization of hemiplegic patients, we will use a device commonly used in rehabilitation: the standing (or standing) brand Thera Trainer . This device makes it possible to keep the patient standing despite the motor and postural deficits thanks to knee, buttocks and an anterior support for the upper limbs. Verticalization with this device requires the presence of one or two caregivers (including at least one re-educator), depending on the possibilities of participation of the patient.</description>
