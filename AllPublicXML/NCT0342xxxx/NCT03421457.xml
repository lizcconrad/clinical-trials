  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to compare the efficiency of two uterus-preserving laparoscopic methods
      to treat uterine prolapse in a randomized controlled trial. Laparoscopic lateral suspension
      with mesh (LLSM) will be compared with laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy (LS). Both procedures
      are known as sufficient uterus preserving methods. LLSM was introduced to be an alternative
      to others with avoiding dissection of promontory and therefore being safer, faster and
      feasible technique.

      Patient with uterine prolapse can participate in this study. A total of 44 women will be
      included. At random 22 patients undergo laparoscopic lateral suspension with mesh operation
      and 22 patients undergo laparoscopic sacrohysteropexy operation. Evaluation will take place
      during the surgery, at the postoperative visit after 4 weeks, 6th months and 12th months.
      Quality of life, degree of vaginal prolapse, safety, operation time and complications will be
      evaluated.

      Subjective assessments will include Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Michigan
      Incontinence Severity Index (M-ISI), Prolapse Quality of Life questionnaire (PQoL), Pelvic
      Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP-SS) and Visual Analog Score (VAS).

      Objective assessments will include routine gynecologic sonography, Pelvic Organ Prolapse
      Quantification System (POP-Q) and pelvic floor biometry measured by transperineal sonography.

      Transperineal sonography will include those measurements:

      Urethral rotation, Pelvic organ descent, Hiatal Diameter and the Anatomical localization of
      apex.

    <time_frame>12 months for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>Validated into Turkish language form will be used to compare preoperative and postoperative period. The FSFI is a multiple-trait scoring, self-report document used to assess female sexual function. It consists of 19 items that encompass six separate domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The maximum score is 36 points and the minimum score is 2 points. After completion of the questionnaire, the total SF score was calculated as follows: no sexual dysfunction (SD) (≥ 30 points) , mild SD (between &lt;29 and &gt; 23 points), and severe SD (≤ 22 points).</description>

    <measure>Subjective Success - Change from baseline Michigan Incontinence Severity Index (M-ISI) to measure urinary incontinence at 12th month.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>Validated into Turkish language form will be used to compare preoperative and postoperative period. It has ten items, consisting of a total M-ISI domain (the sum of items 1-8) and a distinct Bother domain (the sum of items 9 and 10). The total M-ISI score consists of three subdomains (items 1-3 for stress urinary incontinence [SUI], items 4-6 for UUI, and items 7 and 8 for PU). The responses for each item range from 0 to 4 on a Likert-type scale, with higher values representing greater symptoms and greater bother. The total M-ISI domain ranges from 0 to 32, the Bother domain ranges from 0 to 8, the SUI and UUI subdomains range from 0 to 12, and the PU subdomain ranges from 0 to 8. Total domain and subdomain scores are obtained by simply adding the respective answers. The minimally important difference has been determined for the following domains/subdomains: total M-ISI (4 points), SUI (2 points), UUI (2 points), and PU (1 point).</description>

    <time_frame>12 months for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>Validated into Turkish language form will be used to compare preoperative and postoperative period. he questionnaire included 20 questions grouped in sections (domains) related to a particular aspect of quality of life. A total of nine domains covering general health, prolapse impact, role limitations, physical and social limitations, personal relationships, emotional problems, sleep/energy disturbance as well as severity symptoms measurements were defined. Questions regarding bladder, bowel and sexual function were also separately included and validated for reproducibility and internal consistency. Responses ranged from 'none/not at all', through 'slightly/a little' and 'moderately' to 'a lot' to produce a four-point scoring system for each item. Scores in each domain ranged between 0 and 100 with a high total score indicating a greater impairment of quality of life.</description>

    <description>Anterior or posterior colporrhaphy is performed initially by the conventional vaginal technique if it is necessary.The peritoneum over the sacral promontory is incised until the anterior longitudinal ligament is reached and ureters are identified. Peritoneal relaxing incision is made medial to the right ureter, down into the pelvis, posterior to the cervix and rectovaginal fascia, laterally to the rectum. The arm of the mesh is sutured to the posterior cervix by 2.0 prolene and fixated to the sacral promontory by either Tacker (Covidien) or 2.0 prolene as tension-free. Complete peritonisation of the mesh is performed.</description>
