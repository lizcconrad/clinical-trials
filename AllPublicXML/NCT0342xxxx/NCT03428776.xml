  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although coverage for primary childhood immunizations has improved, a significant proportion
      of young children and pregnant women living in low-resource settings remain inadequately
      immunized. While young children receive some primary vaccines, many are never fully
      vaccinated. Progressive decline in immunizations are in large part attributable to poor
      follow-up and compliance. Major challenges include maintaining immunization records linked to
      positive identification of the individual child, incentivizing follow-up and return
      immunizations and efficiently identifying and targeting non-compliant subjects. Mobile-phone
      costs have decreased dramatically in the developing world with rapid proliferation of web and
      mobile-phone connectivity. Novel approaches that integrate these modern technologies with
      existing resources in low and middle income countries can cost-effectively address these
      challenges. In this proposal, investigators will evaluate a novel software platform,
      utilizing biometric identification and of subjects, paired with intelligent and
      subject-aware, mobile-phone reminders and compliance-linked incentives to improve uptake and
      coverage of primary vaccinations in young children.

      A cloud-based, biometric-linked vaccination record, mobile-phone reminder and
      compliance-linked incentive software platform to provide robust and universal access of
      vaccinations. The investigators will implement this platform in a low-resource settings with
      the following features: a) Cloud-based for robust and universal access. b) Biometric-linked
      for positive identification. c) Digital storage and reporting for transparent view of program
      operations. d) Global Positioning System (GPS)-linked, allowing rapid assessment of
      vaccination status of communities. e) Increasing vaccination uptake and coverage by
      intelligent and subject-aware automated reminders and compliance-linked incentives.
