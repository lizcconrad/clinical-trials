  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster randomized controlled trial will test the effect of the promotion of vitamin
      A-rich orange flesh sweet potato (OFSP) production and nutrition education on vitamin A and
      energy intake, including any added value of the Healthy Baby Toolkit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child stunting and vitamin A deficiency are persistent public health problems in Ethiopia.

      Quality Diets for Better Health (QDBH) is a European Union-funded project led by the
      International Potato Center (CIP), in partnership with People in Need (PIN), Emory University
      and with support of governmental organizations and local universities. The 54 month-project
      strives to improve diet quality, primarily of women and young children, through the promotion
      of vitamin A-rich orange flesh sweetpotato (OFSP) production and nutrition education in 41
      kebeles (communities) in SNNPR, reaching an estimated 15000 households. In addition,
      households in a subset of communities will receive a Healthy Baby Toolkit, consisting of a
      marked bowl, slotted spoon, and illustrated counseling card. The Healthy Baby Toolkit is
      designed to promote optimal complementary feeding practices of infants and young children 6
      to 23 months, namely meal volume, meal frequency, and meal thickness.

      As part of this project, Emory University will conduct a longitudinal, cluster randomized
      controlled trial in 20 kebeles to test the effect of the project on vitamin A and energy
      intake, including any added value of the Healthy Baby Toolkit.

    <description>Support to farmers to grow and store OFSP in the form of agricultural extension, community based trainings and supplies, while simultaneously increasing community demand for OFSP through community-based Healthy Living Clubs. The Clubs promote OFSP, provide nutrition education, and conduct community mobilization events and social marketing of OFSP and OFSP-based processed products. Special emphasis is on women and children &lt; 2y; especially diet diversity and vitamin A intake.</description>

    <description>The toolkit consists of a demarcated bowl, a slotted spoon, and a counseling card. The demarcations on the bowl guide caregivers on age-specific meal volume and frequency. The slotted spoon promotes thicker food consistency - and therefore nutrient density - by cuing caregivers when food drips through the slots. The counseling card relies on images rather than text to reinforce messages of the previous two instruments, promote dietary diversity, and promote hygienic food preparation.</description>
