  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the neural and behavioral correlates of emotion regulation in
      adolescents engaging in binge eating and/or purging and healthy adolescents. Furthermore, it
      will look at the influence of executive function on emotion regulation in this population.
      This study will allow us to gain further understanding of the neural basis of emotion
      regulation in this age group. Moreover, this study supports the need to develop new treatment
      approaches based on a better understanding of the brain processes associated with eating
      disorders.
