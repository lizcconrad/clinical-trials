    <textblock>
      A study assessing glucose variability in subjects with Type 1 Diabetes who have had islet
      transplant.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who have an Islet Transplantation may have several outcomes including time when
      insulin is not required followed in some cases by additional insulin for glucose control as
      patients get further away from transplantation. It is unclear what role automated insulin
      delivery systems will have in addressing glucose variability in this group of patients who
      may have some amount of islet function. As a precursor to understanding ways in which
      automated insulin delivery systems may need to be adapted, we propose to gather data on
      glucose variability and insulin regimens in individuals who have undergone an islet
      transplantation.
