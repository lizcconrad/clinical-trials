  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether a neuroscience-inspired cognitive remediation
      video game (EVO) that targets the cognitive control network (CCN) will improve executive
      functioning (EF) and resilience to psychiatric symptoms in typically developing 6th grade
      students, unselected for specific psychiatric symptoms. The primary goals are to 1) determine
      if EVO will result in improved EF and lower internalizing (e.g., mood, anxiety) and
      externalizing (e.g., attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, AD/HD) psychiatric symptoms,
      2) evaluate whether the benefit experienced by youth changes depending on their level of life
      stress (e.g., academic or social difficulties), 3) determine if EVO will promote resilience
      to stress. We will measure EF, symptoms, and stress using self- and parent-report
      questionnaires. Other secondary outcomes include information on behavior in the classroom and
      academic performance (i.e., grades) that we will collect via school records. We hypothesize
      that engagement with EVO 20-minutes per day, 5-days a week across 4-weeks will improve EF,
      lower psychiatric symptoms, improve academic/behavioral functioning at school, and decrease
      maladaptive responses to stress.

    <description>EVO (formerly called Neuroracer) is a neuroscience-inspired plasticity trainings in the form of a video driving game that uses adaptive algorithms and dual-tasking paradigms to target the CCN. Work from our group (Project:EVO) recently showed that 4 weeks of EVO training is associated with increased neural recruitment in brain regions associated with CNN, superior improvement in cognitive control performance (i.e., working memory, sustained attention) when compared to an evidence-based psychotherapy (Problem-Solving Therapy), and improved depression outcomes similar to Problem-Solving Therapy among older adults (Are√°n, Hallgren, Jordan, Gazzaley, Atkins, Heagerty, &amp; Anguera, 2016; Journal of Medical Internet Research).</description>
