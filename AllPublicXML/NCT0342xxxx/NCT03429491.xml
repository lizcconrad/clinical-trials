  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of leucine-enriched protein supplementation, alone and in
      combination with long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), on muscle mass and
      function in older adults at risk of sarcopenia.

      We hypothesize that LC n-3 PUFA supplementation will further enhance the efficacy of the
      leucine-enriched protein.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with advancing age, termed
      sarcopenia, contributes substantially to disability, physical dependence, and mortality among
      older adults. Aging is associated with an attenuated muscle protein synthetic response to the
      ingestion of small to moderate protein doses compared to younger persons. Several studies
      have reported that the acute, postprandial muscle protein synthesis (MPS) response to a
      suboptimal protein dose is enhanced when the leucine content of the protein bolus is
      increased. This indicates that supplementing the lower-protein daily meals (i.e., breakfast
      and lunch) with leucine may represent a practical strategy to augment the MPS response to
      these meals and, subsequently, attenuate sarcopenic muscle mass loss over time. In addition,
      LC n-3 PUFA supplementation has been shown to enhance the MPS response to amino acid infusion
      older adults suggesting that combined leucine and LC n-3 PUFA supplementation be particularly
      effective for improving daily MPS, muscle mass and function in older adults.
