    <textblock>
      This is A Phase III, randomized, two-armed, patient-outcome assessor-data analyzer blinded,
      parallel active controlled non-Inferiority clinical trial study to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of AryoTrust™ (Aryogen Trastuzumab in comparison to Herceptin® (Genentech/Roche) in
      patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive breast cancer. The main
      objective is to verify the non-inferiority of AryoTrust™ (Aryogen trastuzumab) vs. Herceptin®
      (Genentech/Roche trastuzumab), both given concomitantly with docetaxel after doxorubicin plus
      cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological complete response (pCR)
      as primary objective and objective response (cOR), clinical complete response (cCR), clinical
      partial response (cPR), clinically no change (cNC), clinical progressive disease (cPD),
      breast conservation rate as Secondary objectives of this study. Evaluating the safety and
      immunogenicity of AryoTrust™ vs. Herceptin®, are also the other secondary outcomes. This
      study has two arms and 108 subjects will participate with a 1:1 allocation and receive
      mentioned treatment randomly.

      This is A Phase III, randomized, two-armed, patient-outcome assessor-data analyzer blinded,
      parallel active controlled non-Inferiority clinical trial study to evaluate efficacy and
      safety of AryoTrust™ (Aryogen Trastuzumab) in comparison to Herceptin® (Genentech/Roche) in
      patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Positive breast cancer. Patients who
      met the following criteria will be recruited. The inclusion criteria are: 18-65 years old
      female patients, Patients with newly diagnosed stage III (locally advanced) or in-operable
      stage II (due to sizes larger than 5 cm or high tumor to breast ratio) tumors are candidates
      for participation, Willing and able to sign an informed consent, Pathological diagnosis of
      adenocarcinoma of the breast, ECOG status of 0-1, With any ER/PR status, HER2 positive
      (Immunohistochemical (IHC) 3+ intensity, amplification of the HER2 gene on fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH+ ) or HER2 positive results of Chromogenic in situ hybridization
      (CISH)). Exclusion criteria are: Clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease,
      History of any other malignancy including previous breast cancer, second non-breast malignant
      disease, History of previous chemotherapy, Left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &lt;55%
      confirmed by echo cardiogram within 3 months before registration, Any prior myocardial
      infarction, History of documented congestive heart failure (CHF),Any prior history of
      arrhythmia or cardiac valvular disease requiring medications or clinically significant,
      Current use of medications for treatment of angina pectoris, Current uncontrolled
      hypertension (diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg or systolic &gt; 200 mmHg), A severe conduction abnormality
      (having pacemaker or diagnosed by the ECG) and any other significant cardiovascular disease,
      Hematologic abnormalities including baseline Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) of ≤1,500/µL or
      platelet count ≤ 100,000/µL, Liver dysfunction including (baseline) Alanine amino transferase
      (ALT) and/or aspartate amino transferase (AST) ≥ 3 Upper Limit Normal (ULN), Alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) ≥3 ͯ ULN, serum total, bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN, Renal dysfunction, defined as
      serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dL, Pregnant, lactating women or women of childbearing potential who
      are not willing to use adequate contraception, Current Corneal abrasion and ulcer.

      The main objective is to verify the non-inferiority of AryoTrust™ (Aryogen trastuzumab) vs.
      Herceptin® (Genentech/Roche trastuzumab), both given concomitantly with docetaxel after
      doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological,
      clinical response and immunogenicity assay in patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor 2-Positive breast cancer. The primary objective of this study is to verify the
      non-inferiority of AryoTrust™ vs. Herceptin®, given concomitantly with docetaxel after
      doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological
      complete response (pCR) rate. The secondary objectives are to verify the non-inferiority of
      AryoTrust™ vs. Herceptin®, given concomitantly with docetaxel after doxorubicin plus
      cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to clinical objective response (cOR),
      clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), clinically no change
      (cNC), clinical progressive disease (cPD), breast conservation rate. Evaluating the safety
      and immunogenicity of AryoTrust™ vs. Herceptin®, are also the other secondary outcomes. This
      study has two arms and 108 subjects will participate with a 1:1 allocation and receive
      AryoTrust™ vs. Herceptin® randomly given concomitantly with docetaxel (for 4 21-day cycles)
      after four 14-day cycles of Doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide For primary outcome analysis,
      Treatment differences in proportions will be calculated. A 95% two-sided confidence interval
      will be constructed and the lower bound to determine non-inferiority with a 2.5% significance
      level will be used. We will use the lower bound of a 95% two-sided confidence interval to
      determine non-inferiority with a 2.5% significance level for all secondary efficacy endpoints
      include clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), clinically stable
      disease (cSD), clinical progressive disease (cPD), clinical objective response (cOR), breast
      conservation rate. All safety data will be analyzed descriptively by each treatment group.
      same protocol and procedures have been implemented by using same SOPs. Regular and strict
      monitoring visits have been provided to ensure all processes will be carried out in
      accordance with GCP. Probable variation of eligibility criteria and evaluation criteria are
      resolved through investigator meetings.
