  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center observational study will prospectively collect data from patients who have
      an indication for servo ventilation therapy. This registry is intended to characterize the
      patient populations that may benefit from DreamStation BiPAP autoSV therapy (PR DS-autoSV,
      Philips Respironics, Monroeville, PA) in real life settings. In addition, this registry will
      assess adherence to the PR DS-autoSV therapy, the therapeutic benefits, collect morbidity and
      mortality data of servo ventilation in patients with central sleep apnea (CSA) and complex
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).

    <description>European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire EQ 5D- 5L) is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health related quality of life. This tools scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more problems across five dimensions (5D) which comprise mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression</description>

    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This test consists of eight questions of daily life activities with a number from 0 (not at all likely to fall asleep) to 3 (very likely to fall asleep) which yields a score of 0 to 24, and subjectively quantify sleepiness.25 An ESS score ranging from 0 to 10 is interpreted as normal, scores of 11 to 24 is considered to be abnormal and indicative of increasing levels of excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>
