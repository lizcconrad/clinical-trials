  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery wounds are typically closed with combination of absorbable stitches placed under the
      skin and non-absorbable stitched placed at the skin surface. Absorbable sutures can produce
      unwanted side effects when the body produces a reaction to them. The investigators are
      conducting a study to determine if absorbable stitches can be replaced but tissue glue
      applied on the surface of the skin. If participants enroll in the study, the investigators
      will close one half of the participants wound with absorbable stitches placed under the skin
      and non-absorbable stitches on the surface. The other half of the wound will be closed with
      non-absorbable stitches and tissue glue. The appearance of the scar (if any) will then be
      evaluated at 3- and 6-month follow-ups by two dermatologists (either board-certified
      dermatologists or dermatology residents) and the patient.

    <intervention_model_description>Wounds halves will be labeled as A (left/superior) or B (right/inferior), the halves will be randomized to receive either tissue glue or deep sutures. The nurse will refer to the randomization list and inform the surgeon which side of the wound will receive tissue glue and which side will receive deep sutures. Following common practice of wound labeling, side A will always be left or superior from the surgeon's perspective, whereas side B will always be right or inferior from the surgeon's perspective.
Per randomization, half of the wound will be closed with deep absorbable sutures followed by superficial non-absorbable sutures. The other half of the wound will be closed with superficial non-absorbable sutures followed by tissue glue (Dermabond). Tissue glue will be spread to cover an area extending one cm from the wound margin on both sides.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The efficacy of intervention methods will be assessed at the 3 month and 6 month follow-ups by having the patient and two blinded observers rate the healing progression of the wound using the POSAS. The observers will be either dermatology faculty or dermatology. The POSAS is a standard metric in measuring wound healing in cutaneous surgery studies since it does not require training but takes into account the scar assessment of the patient and observers. Subsequently, the height and width of the scar will be measured and compared to the surrounding unaffected skin. The assessments of the two blind observers will be averaged.</masking_description>
