  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard in the diagnosis and treatment colorectal disease, but due
      to the uncomfortable or even painful procedure, a part of people unwilling to undergoing the
      examination and giving analgesic agents were recommended in several guidelines. However, use
      of analgesic agents have their own drawbacks, and nearly 70% patients felt no pain or only
      mild discomfort with the unsedated colonoscopy, routine administration of sedative or
      analgesic agents to all patients was considered as unnecessary. However, unsedated
      colonoscopy was thought to be an option for some but not for all, therefore a method to
      identify which patients at high risk for painful colonoscopy in preoperational stage is
      necessary.
