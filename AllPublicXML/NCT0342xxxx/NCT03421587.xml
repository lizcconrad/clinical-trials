  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with altered processing of sensory
      stimuli. The clinical phenotype of PTSD has predominantly been described for the visual and
      auditory sensory modalities. However, PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories are often
      evoked by olfactory and tactile cues in the environment. The purpose of this study is to
      compare trauma-exposed subjects who developed PTSD and trauma-exposed subjects who did not
      develop PTSD with non-exposed controls in the processing of olfactory and tactile stimuli.
      This sensory characterizations hold potential to identify potential biomarkers for the course
      of PTSD and to inform trauma therapies focusing on sensory integration.

        The study population will consist of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder,
        trauma-exposed healthy controls and healthy controls without trauma-exposure. In the planed
        study, the trauma type of all subjects will be assessed and participants with intentional
        and accidental trauma will be compared. Patients and healthy controls will be recruited
        from the Bonn area.
