  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to study the long-term safety of macitentan and to provide continued
      treatment with macitentan to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who were
      previously treated with macitentan in clinical studies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide continued treatment with macitentan to subjects with
      PAH who participated or participate in &quot;parent studies&quot; in France and to continue to accrue
      long-term safety data. &quot;Parent study/studies&quot; refer to a number of clinical studies with
      macitentan that are conducted in different clinical classification of PAH (NCT00667823,
      NCT02112487, NCT02310672, NCT02968901, NCT02558231) and may be completed before the
      participating subjects have access to commercial macitentan in their country of residence.
      The &quot;parent studies&quot; are fully or partially running in France where no access to commercial
      macitentan is expected in the near future.
