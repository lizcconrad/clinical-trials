      To research the use of a novel set of intraoral tools called the Easy Stretch Toolkit for the
      therapeutic management of facial burns and other facial disorders.

    <textblock>
      In this initial pilot study, the investigators will recruit 20 adult patients who have
      sustained facial burns to complete the 12 week treatment. The device creators chose 20
      patients based on the investigators' experience of the available patients seen from the
      consult service. Participants will need to be able to attend a weekly session with the device
      creators and complete the entire 3 month prescriptive program. Participants will be
      outpatient. For the purpose of this study, facial burns will be defined as a burn injury to
      the midface or lower half of the face and may be unilateral or bilateral. Chronic burns are
      defined as those burns that are not in the acute healing phase, ie., there are no concerns
      for injury to new or healing skin or wound dehiscence.

    <measure>UTMB Facial Range of Motion Measurement Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>once per week for duration of the 12 week study</time_frame>
    <description>Facial measurements taken during select facial movements/expressions assessed by software program created at UTMB specifically for this project. The degree of change in facial movements will be assessed with 9 facial postures (face at rest, nose wrinkle, gentle smile, broad smile with lips closed, broad smile with teeth together, voice &quot;eee&quot;, voice &quot;ooo&quot;, pucker lips and open mouth wide), which will be photographed weekly. The facial measurements are based on a calibration from pupil distance. Two examples of the facial landmarks to be plotted and measured during each of the above expressions include right pupil to outside of right nare and length of philtrum, with the goal of measuring change over time with use of the Easy Stretch devices. Each of these measurements will produce a length in millimeters. These will be compared over time to determine changes in facial range of motion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>completed at week 1 and at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Facial Disability Index is the name of a quality of life questionnaire which will be used for this study. It consists of 10 questions, with a scale of 0-5 for each question. 5 questions relate to physical function and 5 questions relate to social well being and function. The combined score provides an overall facial disability index score.</description>
