  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the relative bioavailability of naproxen sodium/diphenhydramine hydrochloride
      (DHP HCL) 220/25 mg soft capsules (Test) versus naproxen sodium/DPH HCl 220/25 mg tablets
      (Reference) after a single oral administration (2 x naproxen sodium 220 mg and DPH HCl 25 mg
      combination product) under fed conditions in healthy adult subjects.

      To assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational products in terms of adverse
      events (AEs) and clinical parameters (systolic/diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, physical
      examination, clinical and laboratory testing).
