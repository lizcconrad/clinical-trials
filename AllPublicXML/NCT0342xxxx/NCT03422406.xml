  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore main cause and health impact of iodine excess during pregnancy, we performed
      iodine evaluation for 390 consecutive pregnant women from January 1st, 2016 to December 31st,
      2016. Among them, 18 women (4.62%) with apparently elevated urinary iodine concentration
      (UIC) were enrolled onto this study for subsequent follow-up. History of high iodine exposure
      was collected from all participants. Parameters about iodine status were monitors until
      termination of pregnancy, and dietary iodine intake condition and thyroid function were also
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective follow-up was arranged for the 18 pregnant women with excessive iodine status.
      History of iodine exposure (including hysterosalpingography (HSG) using an oil-soluble
      iodinated contrast medium, examination by computed tomography scan with contrast,
      administration of amiodarone, history of receiving radioiodine therapy, etc.) was collected
      from all participants. Evaluation of dietary iodine intake was performed through a 72-hour
      dietary recall.The serum iodine concentration (SIC) and urinary iodine concentration (UIC)
      were monitored continuously in the whole course of pregnancy. All subjects with excessive
      iodine load were recommended by nutritionists to have their dietary iodine intake restricted,
      and resume iodine-containing supplements and foods until the UIC＜250 μg/L and SIC≤90 μg/L.
      After delivery, maternal colostrum iodine concentration and neonatal iodine status (including
      neonatal UIC, condition of congenital hypothyroidism screening tests, and thyroid physical
      examination) were also assessed.
