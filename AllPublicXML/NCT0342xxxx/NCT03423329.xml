  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Randomized study was designed to assess and compare the effect of two analgesic
      premedications (Ibuprofen BP 100 mg/5 ml and Paracetamol 200 mg/5ml.) on the anesthetic
      efficacy of buccal infiltration in vital pulpotomy of primary mandibular molars in children .
      A multivitamin with the same color as the twp tested medications will be administered to
      children in the control group. Parents of eligible children will be informed about the nature
      of the procedure, the purpose of the study, any possible discomfort or risks and a signed
      informed consent will be obtained from them prior to enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 healthy children will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Pediatric
      Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University.

      Inclusion Criteria include: age group 7-9 years Without systemic or mental disorders. Who
      could be categorized as cooperative according to Wright's classification for child behavior
      Ability of child to understand the use of pain scales; Having at least one lower second
      primary molar with deep caries indicated for pulpotomy; Absence of any periapical or
      furcation radiolucency on radiographs, Absence of any signs of internal or external
      resorption on radiographs, A vital coronal pulp on access opening.

      . Patients who had taken analgesics within 12 hours before administration of the study drugs
      or those having active pain, pulpitis or abscess related to the designated mandibular molar
      will not be included.

      To ensure randomization and allocation concealment, children will be randomly assigned to the
      three groups using computer-generated numbers.

      One operator will do pulpotomy for all participants and to ensure blinding, another author (
      will give the premedication to children.Pain during pulpotomy will be assessed using Wong
      Baker FACES pain assessment tool.
