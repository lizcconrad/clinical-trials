      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

          -  5. Subject must have adequate tumor burden at a safely accessible site for biopsy by
             either bronchoscopy or imaging guidance. NOTE: If sites chosen for biopsy were
             previously irradiated, there must be evidence of tumor growth/viable tumor as assessed
             by the investigator.

          -  6. At least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) v1.1

          -  7. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          -  8. Adequate Organ Function Laboratory Values System Laboratory Value Hematological
             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,250/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL
             or ≥5.6 mmol/L Renal Serum creatinine OR ≤1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR
             Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (GFR can also be used ≥50 mL/min for
             subject with creatinine levels in place of creatinine or CrCl) &gt; 1.5 X institutional
             ULN Creatinine clearance should be calculated per institutional standard. Hepatic
             Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total
             bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for
             subjects with liver metastases

          -  9. Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable birth control
             methods.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Sensitizing mutations in Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic
             lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1 proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1)
             translocations

          -  2. Currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or anticipated use of an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose
             of study treatment.

             meningitis.

             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to enrollment. (Nasal or
             oral inhalers are permissible). Patients on physiologic replacement doses of steroids
             (mineralocorticoid or less than or equal to a prednisone 10 mg daily dose) will also
             be permitted to enroll.

          -  6. Prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to enrollment, or individuals who
             have not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  8. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months
             prior to enrollment. Subjects that require intermittent use of steroid-containing
             bronchodilators or local steroid injections or topical steroid medications are not
             excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjogren's syndrome are not excluded from the study.

          -  9. Interstitial lung disease or history of pneumonitis that has required oral or IV
             steroids

          -  10. Active infection requiring systemic therapy with IV antibiotics

          -  11. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  12. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  13. Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  14. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or

          -  16. Known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg positive or HBV DNA detectable) or Hepatitis
             C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).

          -  17. Anticipated receipt of any live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment.
