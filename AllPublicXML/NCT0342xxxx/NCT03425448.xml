  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis catheter related bacterial infections represent a major cause of mortality and
      morbidity in the hemodialysis population. Several locking agents had been tried with variable
      degree of success but not without side effects.

      Neutrolin catheter locking agent comprises of heparin,citrate and trauolidine that had been
      studied in a prospective study in Germany, and it demonstrated a very good result in terms of
      reducing the catheter related infections and thrombosis.

      This study is a multi-center, double-blind RCT comparing the hemodialysis catheter locking
      solution Neutrolin with heparin in reducing the rate of catheter related bacterial infection
      and thrombosis.
