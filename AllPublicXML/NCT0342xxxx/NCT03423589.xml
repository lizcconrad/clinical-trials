  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to further the understanding of environmental factors that underlie the
      progression to Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Dysbiosis, defined as alterations in intestinal
      microbiota composition and function, has been hypothesized to increase the risk of developing
      T1D in those with genetic susceptibility. Dysbiosis may result from modern dietary habits,
      such as broad consumption of the highly processed Western Diet, or by widespread use of
      antibiotics. Here, investigators propose to examine the impact of dysbiosis on the endogenous
      innate inflammation known to exist within families affected by T1D and if probiotic
      supplementation may beneficially modulate this inflammatory state.

      Participants will be asked to take the probiotic VSL#3 daily for six weeks. Stool and blood
      samples will be analyzed before and after the six week course of probiotics.

    <description>Participants will be given the probiotic supplement VSL#3, a commercially available product. VSL#3 is taken by mouth, either once or twice daily, and is dispensed in sachets, each containing 450 billion colony forming units of bacterial strains. Participants will undergo a screening visit. They will be asked to provide a stool sample by the next visit. Within 3 weeks they will return with a stool sample and receive the VSL#3 sachets as well as another stool collection kit. After 6 weeks of taking VSL#3, they will return for their final visit, with their stool sample. Blood will be drawn at the second and third visits.</description>

    <description>VSL#3 is a commercially available probiotic supplement manufactured and distributed by Alfasigma USA, Inc of Covington, Louisiana, USA. As with other probiotics, VSL#3 is considered a supplement and is not FDA-approved or regulated. VSL#3 contains eight probiotic strains: bifidobacteria (B. longum, B. infantis, and B. breve), lactobacilli (L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. bulgaricus, and L. plantarum) and Strepococcus thermophiles.</description>

          1. Presence of severe/active disease that interferes with dietary intake

          2. Chronic use of medications known to affect gastrointestinal function, such as stool
             softeners or laxatives

          3. Diagnosis of celiac disease and/or following a gluten-free diet

          4. Presence of significant and sustained gastrointestinal symptoms within the prior 6

             nausea +/- vomiting)

          5. Chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disease with the exception of well-controlled
             hypothyroidism or intermittent or mild persistent asthma not requiring the use of
             daily inhaled steroids

          6. Use of any medications that could affect intestinal microbiota within the previous 3
             months (e.g., antibiotics, prebiotics, or probiotics)

          7. Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, may compromise study participation
             or may confound the interpretation of the study results

          8. Female participants of child-bearing age must not be pregnant
