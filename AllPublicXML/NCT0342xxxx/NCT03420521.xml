  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open-label design study looking at Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab in patients
      with Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors. Patients will be dosed Nivoluma 240mg IV over 60 minutes
      every 2 weeks and Ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV over 30 minutes every 6 weeks. Once cycle will include
      3 doses of Nivolumab and 1 dose of Ipilimumab. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      objective response rate of combination nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced,
      well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Durability of response, and PFS will also be
      described.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with histologically confirmed advanced, progressive, well-differentiated
             nonfunctional NET of the pancreas, lung or gastrointestinal (GI) tract per the 7th
             International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification (IASLC) or the
             American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Handbook, 7th edition.

               -  Measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix 3);
                  radiographic tumor assessment performed within 28 days before treatment. Target
                  lesions may be located in a previously irradiated field if there is documented
                  (radiographic) disease progression in that site after the completion of radiation
                  therapy.

               -  Prior therapy, including everolimus, octreotide, surgery, chemoradiation, is all
                  permitted after being properly noted. This prior therapy must have been completed
                  at least 28 days prior to study enrollment.

               -  Previously untreated patients who decline standard therapy for their cancer are
                  allowed to enroll.

               -  Subjects are to have tumor tissue sample available at central lab for PD -L1 IHC
                  testing during the screening period. Subjects can initiate therapy before the
                  result of IHC testing. The tumor tissue sample must be a core needle biopsy,
                  excisional or incisional biopsy. It may be fresh or archival if obtained within 6
                  months prior to enrollment, and there can have been no systemic therapy (e.g.,
                  adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy) given after the sample was obtained.

               -  (Stage 2 only) Subjects must be willing to undergo 2 sets of core needle biopsies
                  (pre-treatment and at 6-8 weeks on therapy) if there are lesions amenable to
                  biopsy. Subjects without a lesion amendable to biopsy will still be permitted to
                  enroll provided they have an archival tumor sample for PD-L1 IHC testing. An
                  optional core biopsy will be requested at progression.

               -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1 (see Appendix 1)

               -  Prior palliative radiotherapy to non-CNS lesions must have been completed at
                  least 2 weeks prior to treatment. Subjects with symptomatic tumor lesions at
                  baseline that may require palliative radiotherapy within 4 weeks of first
                  treatment are strongly encouraged to receive palliative radiotherapy prior to
                  treatment.
