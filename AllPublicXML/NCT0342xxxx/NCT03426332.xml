      The management of adrenal crisis is often problematic and the time to adequate treatment is
      frequently delayed.The aim of the study is to evaluate the management of adrenal emergencies
      requiring parenteral glucocorticoid treatment by a prospective multicenter study in patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite established hormone replacement therapy, patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency
      (AI) are at risk of suffering from adrenal crisis (AC). Further data suggests that the
      management of AC is often problematic and the time to adequate treatment is frequently
      delayed.The aim of the study is to evaluate the management of adrenal emergencies (AE)
      requiring parenteral glucocorticoid (GC) treatment by a prospective multicenter study.

      Patients with chronic AI receive a questionnaire on the management of emergency situations,
      which had to be completed and sent back in case of an emergency requiring parenteral GC
      administration. Furthermore, patients were contacted by phone in case of a missing response
      every six months.
