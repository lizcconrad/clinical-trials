  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 16-week supplementation with a
      polyphenol-rich extract, Fiit-ns®, on improvement of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL)
      of overweight and obese volunteers, as compared to placebo. Previous beneficial results from
      a pilot study showed that the supplementation may improve quality of life as well as body
      composition. Based on such results, this pivotal study is statistically powered to detect
      significant differences in HR-QOL assessed with the Short Form-36 Health survey (SF-36)
      between baseline (Week 1, W1) and end of the supplementation period (Week 16, W16).
