    <textblock>
      Some of the most common side effects of the multiple sclerosis drug Plegridy (pegylated
      interferon beta-1a) include flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions. Physicians often
      advise patients to take Tylenol or aspirin prior to injection, but in this study the
      investigators evaluated whether using a low dose of oral steroid in combination with Tylenol
      reduced flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by demyelination of
      the brain and spine. Currently, there are several treatments designed to decrease the
      frequency of attacks and delay disease progression. One of these treatments, interferon beta,
      has shown the potential to decrease relapse rates by approximately 30%, but because the body
      quickly clears these proteins, patients require more frequent dosing. Another interferon
      therapy called pegylated interferon beta-1a (Plegridy) was released and it was shown to last
      longer in the body than interferon beta-1a. This is why Plegridy can be take by an injection
      into tissue under the skin once every 14 days. However, some of the most common side effects
      of interferon beta therapy include flu-like symptoms and injection skin reactions, which can
      often cause patients to want to stop treatment. Clinical practitioners often advise patients
      to take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin before the injection in order to prevent the onset
      or decrease the severity of flu-like symptoms. A previous study with patients taking
      interferon beta-1a showed that taking a low dose oral steroid (prednisone) in addiction to a
      medication like Tylenol reduced flu-like symptoms compared to just taking Tylenol by itself.
      Because Plegridy lasts longer in the body and has more convenient dosing for patients,
      researchers in this study decided to investigate whether taking prednisone in addition to
      acetaminophen before the injection would help decrease or prevent the occurrence of flu-like
      symptoms and injection site reactions in patients taking the therapy.

    <description>Reduced injection site reactions from Plegridy injections due to taking both Tylenol and Prednisone prior to injection. Injection site reactions are reported to a clinical research assistant approximately one week after injection. If present, patients must record their injection site reactions using a Holy Name administered tape measurer in centimeters, as well as descriptive characteristics of the injection (location on body, swelling, redness, itching, and pain). The clinical research assistant records all of the data on an injection site reaction form.</description>

    <description>Members in this group have been previously titrated and are currently taking the pegylated interferon beta-1 (Plegridy) injection once every two weeks. These patients will complete a total of six study injections of Plegridy (125 micrograms) totaling a 12 week study duration. Subjects must take two 325mg tablets of Tylenol 1 hour prior to each study injection, and one 20mg Prednisone tablet 4-5 hours prior to injections two through six only.</description>

    <description>Members in this group have never taken the pegylated interferon beta-1a (Plegridy) injection, and so they must first by titrated by injecting with a 63 and 94 microgram Plegridy dose. Titrations, along with full dose injections (125 micrograms) occur every two weeks. Patients must take two 325mg tablets of Tylenol prior to each titration injection. The third study dosage involves subjects taking the full 125 microgram Plegridy dosage with two 325mg Tylenol tablets prior to injection. The final five study injections (four through eight) require patients to take two 325mg Tylenol tablets 1 hour prior to injection, and one 20mg Prednisone tablet 4-5 hours prior to injection.</description>
