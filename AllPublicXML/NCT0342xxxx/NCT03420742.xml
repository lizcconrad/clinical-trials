  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of repeat-dose administration of
      brigatinib 180 milligram (mg) once daily (QD) on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      midazolam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll approximately 20 participants to achieve approximately 15 PK-evaluable
      participants for assessment. This study will consist of 2 parts: Part A of the study will
      evaluate the effect of repeat-dose administration of brigatinib on the single-dose PK of
      midazolam. Part B of the study is exploratory and will allow participants to continue
      brigatinib until disease progression (PD). All participants will receive study drug via the
      oral route. Participants will be assigned to: Midazolam 3 mg + Brigatinib 90 mg.

      The overall time to participate in this study is 26 months. Participants will have a 28-day
      PK cycle in Part A and a maximum of 23 cycles in Part B, and a 30-day follow-up period after
      end of treatment.

    <description>Midazolam 3 mg, orally, once on Day 1, followed by brigatinib 90 mg, orally, once daily on Days 2 to 8, further followed by brigatinib 180 mg, orally, once daily on Days 9 to 28 in Part A Cycle 1 (28 days treatment cycle). Participants escalating to brigatinib 180 mg once daily will also receive midazolam 3 mg, orally, once on Day 21 of Part A Cycle 1. After completion of Part A, participants will continue into Part B. Participants in Part B will receive brigatinib up to 180 mg (or at the highest tolerated dose in Part A), orally, once daily in a 28 day treatment cycle, up to a maximum of 23 cycles or until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who meet 1 of the following 4 criteria:

               -  With locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC who have progressed on or
                  are intolerant to treatment with at least 1 other ALK inhibitor.

               -  With ALK-positive nonlung solid tumors that are locally advanced or metastatic
                  and for whom no standard, nonexperimental therapy is available.

               -  With locally advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC who have progressed on
                  crizotinib therapy or are intolerant to crizotinib, or

               -  With ROS1-positive nonlung solid tumors that are locally advanced or metastatic
                  and for whom no standard, nonexperimental therapy is available.
