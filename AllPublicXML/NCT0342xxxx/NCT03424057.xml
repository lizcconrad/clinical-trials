  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to reduce the residual dead-space volume with a modification
      following the standard Karydakis procedure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients were operated in the jack-knife position under spinal anesthesia (SA). The
      gluteal parts of the patients were stretched in both directions with bandage and intergluteal
      cleft was opened. Methylen blue was administered from the sinus openings in the gluteal
      region. Then, total sinus excision was performed, including the entire sinus tracts by
      passing the skin, subcutaneous tissues up to the presacral fascia.

      In patients operated with standard Karydakis procedure, a flap (Karydakis flap) extending
      along the incision was prepared, with the medial side of the wound to be 1 cm deep and 2-3 cm
      inward. The prepared flap was shifted to medial and sutured to the presacral fascia with 2/0
      vicryl.

      In patients who were operated with the Asymmetric Primary Closure with Skin Excision
      Technique, after the Karydakis flap was formed, 5-10 mm skin was excised along the incision
      from the side of the flap to reduce the volume of the dead-space laterally.

      In both groups, subcutaneous tissue was approximated with 2/0 vicryl. The skin was sutured
      with mattress technique using 2/0 Prolene. No drains were used in patients from either group.

      Patients were followed up for wound leakage, seroma and hematoma formation, skin dehiscence
      and recurrence.

    <description>Group 1 were treated with the new technique (Asymmetric Primary Closure and Additional Skin Excision).
In this new technique, following total sinus excision, the excision defect was closed with the standard Karydakis method, but an advancement tissue flap was performed using additional skin excision, in order to reduce the dead-space volume.</description>
