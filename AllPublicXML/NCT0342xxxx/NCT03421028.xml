      This study evaluates beneficial effects of biofeedback therapy in reducing pain and increased
      tension of masticatory muscles occurring in patients with sleep bruxism.

      During the study two functions of Biofeedback will be used: Functional Electro Stimulation
      (FES) delivering stimulation to relax masseter muscles and Electromyography Biofeedback
      (EMG-Biofeedback)- assisted training lowering the masseter muscle tension. The experimental
      group consists of adult subjects with sleep bruxism and masticatory muscles pain will be join
      to 8 meetings of FES and EMG-Biofeedback - assisted training and than compared to the control
      group consists of randomly enrolled adult subjects .

      1. The Aim:

           The aim of the study is to evaluate beneficial effects of biofeedback therapy in
           reducing pain, increased tension of masticatory muscles occurring in patients with sleep
           bruxism and intensity of sleep bruxism episodes.

        2. Patients:

             1. Control group - randomly selected healthy adult patients. The Group will include
                between 20-30 adults.

             2. Experimental group - patients with diagnosed sleep bruxism and masticatory muscle
                pain. The group will include approximately 30 adults.

        3. Methods:

      All patients taking part in the study will be examined according to the Diagnostic Criteria
      for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) to find the masticatory muscles disorders.

      Based on the guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (ICD 10- CM), a preliminary
      diagnosis of sleep bruxism will be made. Bruxoff device will be used to performed objective
      confirmation of the initial diagnosis and severity of bruxism - number of bruxism episodes
      per hour of sleep (Bruxism Episodes Index). Bruxoff is a sleep monitor which measures the
      activity of masticatory muscles and rhythm of the patient's heart during sleep.

      Intensity of pain in the masticatory muscle muscles will be define using the Numerical Rating
      Scale (NRS) and the Graded Chronic Pain Scale. Sleep quality will be assessed with Pittsburgh
      Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and insomnia symptoms with Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS).

      People participating in the study (experimental group) will undergo a cycle of FES delivering
      stimulation to relax masseter muscles and EMG-Biofeedback- assisted training decreasing the
      masseter muscle tension (1 cycle equals 8 meetings, 1 meeting per week).

      In the next stage, the bruxism episodes index will be re-evaluated using the Bruxoff device
      and pain intensity with the NRS scale and the Graded Chronic Pain Scale. Also sleep quality
      and insomnia symptoms will be re-assessed using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and
      Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS).

    <description>This effect will be assessed by comparing Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) questionnaires pre- and post- biofeedback therapy. The The NRS is a numeric scale in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. Higher values post therapy indicate worse outcome and lower better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in masticatory muscles pain and disability assessed by Graded Chronic Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>before the treatment and up to 10 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>This effect will be assessed by comparing the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) questionnaires pre- and post- biofeedback therapy. GCPS is a scale assessing pain and disability related to Temporomandibular Disorders in prior 6 months. Subscale scores for pain intensity and disability are combined to calculate a chronic pain grade that enables classification of chronic pain patients into 5 hierarchical categories: grades 0 (no pain) to IV (high disability-severely limiting). Higher values post therapy indicate worse outcome and lower better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in sleep quality assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>before the treatment and up to 10 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>This effect will be assessed by comparing Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires pre- and post- biofeedback therapy. PSQI contains 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions rated by the bed partner or roommate (if on is available). 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven &quot;componet&quot; scores, each of whih has a range of 0-3 points. In all cases, a score of &quot;0&quot; indicates no difficulty, while a score of &quot;3&quot; indicates severe difficulty. The scores are then added to yield one &quot;global&quot; score, with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas. Higher values post therapy indicate worse outcome and lower better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in sleep disorders assessed by Athens Insomnia Scale questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>before the treatment and up to 10 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>This effect will be assessed by comparing Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) questionnaires pre- and post- biofeedback therapy. AIS consist of eight questions,amongst which first five factors are related to nocturnal sleep and last three factors are related to daytime dysfunction.These are rated on a 0-3 scale, where &quot;0&quot; means no problem or normal and &quot;3&quot; means did not sleep at all or very decreased. Finally scores from each question are summed giving total score. A cut-off score of ≥6 on the AIS is used to establish the diagnosis of insomnia. Higher values post therapy indicate worse outcome and lower better outcome.</description>

    <description>EMG-Biofeedback- assisted training is a method in which electrodes situated on the surface of the skin detect small voltage changes which arise from the working muscles (in this case masseter muscles). The voltage is transformed into a visual or sound time-variable signal which gives the patient feedback as he willingly tries to change the muscle tension (in this case to lower the excessive masseter tension)</description>
