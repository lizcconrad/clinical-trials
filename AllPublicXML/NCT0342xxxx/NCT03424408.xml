  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some aspirin-treated patients have a blunted pharmacological response predisposing to
      clinical failure. The investigators hypothesize that the blunted response often results from
      increased rate of platelet production and some failures will be prevented by administering
      aspirin twice daily. The overall objective is to develop a valid method to quantify platelet
      production (without the use of radioactive isotopes) in order to examine the hypothesis that
      enhanced platelet production is a common cause of poor aspirin responsiveness in patients
      with atherothrombosis.

      The specific objective of this study is to validate the Cayman Chemical serum thromboxane
      immunoassay as a measure of platelet production in healthy subjects who are treated with
      aspirin by demonstrating that the recovery of their serum thromboxane B2 levels occurs at a
      rate of about 10% per day after aspirin cessation.
