  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative symptoms in cancer in palliative care, such as pain, can lead to a withdrawal that
      can lead to a form of social exclusion. Maintaining pre-illness relationships is often
      difficult for the patient, especially since he is often not available to relationships.

      Art therapy defined as the exploitation of artistic potential in a therapeutic and
      humanitarian aim can contribute to the reduction of symptoms, to adaptation and to
      well-being. A recent review shows that positive affective states and meaningful social
      connections are important factors contributing to more effective adaptation to pain. Study
      hypothesis is that art therapy could play on these two factors.

      The objective of the qualitative study is to measure, using a questionnaire, the indirect
      impact of art therapy sessions on parents, during support and after death, from a relational
      and emotional point of view.
