  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The short-term advantages of minimally invasive colon resection have been well established in
      several randomized trials. A major factor in the development of morbidity is the surgical
      stress response with subsequent increased demand on the patient's reserves and immune
      competence. Although the advantage in term of stress response of laparoscopic surgery over
      open surgery has been widely reported, little is known about the role of Intracorporeal
      anastomosis.

      In an attempt to evaluate the surgical stress response after totally laparoscopic right
      colectomy a comparative study has been designed.

      Two surgical procedures will be evaluated:

        -  Totally laparoscopic right colectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis (Experimental
           group)

        -  Laparoscopic assisted right colectomy with extracorporeal anastomosis (Control group).
