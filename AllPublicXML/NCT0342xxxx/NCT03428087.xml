      Impedance-based analysis could provide an adequate response to the need to identify a safe
      and reliable tool alternative to bioptic diagnosis. Patients who are candidates for prostate
      biopsy as suffering from urinary symptoms accompanied by clinical suspicions such as high
      total PSA value and / or presence of prostate nodule and / or evidence of obvious lesion to
      available imaging methods will be subjected to impedance measurement. Aim of this study is to
      be able to structure a bivariate analysis of the distribution of impedances detected in
      patients with neoplasia in order to detect test median reference values.

        In order to build a two-pronged analysis of areas of confidence and tolerance, it is
        necessary to examine a fair number of potentially ill subjects and compare them with
        healthy subjects (controls). Past experiences indicate that about 100 measurements in each
        grop can create a sufficiently dense and significant cluster to be able to trace besides
        the &quot;boundries&quot; of 50%, 75%, and 95% even a 95% confidence center of small size suitable to
        establish an adequate significance.
