    <textblock>
      There is long-standing recognition that people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have
      difficulty imitating others' actions; some investigators have highlighted impaired imitation
      as being a core contributor to the development of autism. What is yet unknown is precisely
      how imitation in children with ASD differs from that of typically developing peers.The
      investigators have identified a task parameter that separates preserved from impaired gesture
      imitation in ASD: children with ASD have difficulty imitating when the task requires two
      separate movement elements be coordinated simultaneously. By contrast, imitation is
      relatively preserved when movement elements are performed serially. The coordination of
      simultaneous movements is a hallmark of actions performed in the real world. With an eye to
      optimizing common therapies that depend heavily on imitation, the next step is to tease apart
      where, in the chain from perception to action, the capacity limitation in simultaneous
      processing lies. This study will be conducted in about two days and will involve imitating
      gestures that are presented via video. In addition, an EEG will record the brain's electrical
      activity during certain tasks to assess how the brain responds when the imitation task is
      more or less difficult. Several other clinical and behavioral measures will also be used.

      Visuo-motor imitation (VMI) impairments are central to the pathogenesis and affect the
      treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Therapies most commonly used to enhance social,
      communicative, academic, adaptive and occupational function in individuals with ASD rely on
      imitation, and impairments in VMI represent a bottleneck to the efficiency and efficacy of
      these therapies. Furthermore, an influential psychological account suggests that imitation
      impairments lead to the development of the ASD phenotype. By studying precisely how VMI is
      impaired in ASD, it is possible both to enhance widespread therapies and possibly to alter
      the course of the disorder itself. Unfortunately, researchers currently know little about the
      precise nature of imitation impairments in ASD. Our laboratory has recently identified a
      promising specific task parameter that separates preserved from impaired gesture imitation in
      ASD: children with ASD have difficulty imitating when the task requires two separate movement
      elements be coordinated simultaneously. By contrast, imitation is relatively preserved when
      movement elements are performed serially. This finding has been subsequently validated in a
      published study and again replicated in preliminary data. Coordination of simultaneous
      movements is a hallmark of skills performed in the real world (shoe tying, eating with
      knife-and-fork, driving, communicating with simultaneous verbal and gestural language). In
      order to optimize common adaptive and social-communicative skill therapies, the next step is
      to tease apart where, in the chain from perception to action, the capacity limitation in
      simultaneous processing lies. To do this, the investigators propose a rigorous research plan
      that encompasses three complementary experimental approaches: systematic psychophysics,
      neuropsychological testing and EEG. The goal is to specifically dissect the contribution to
      the simultaneity bottleneck in perceptual vs. motor processes using psychophysical control
      experiments. Under the hypothesis that some children with ASD may have more perceptual
      limitations and others may have more motor limitations, the investigators will assess
      heterogeneity explicitly. It is then possible to relate perceptual and motor aspects of
      simultaneous gesture VMI to validated neuropsychological tests of known clinical attentional
      and perceptual deficits in ASD. Finally, in Aim 3, the investigators will directly
      interrogate visual and motor networks. EEG measures of task-related activation are sensitive
      to task load and can be differentially assessed in visual and motor networks. By assessing
      deficient event-related modulation of EEG activity in visual or motor networks to
      simultaneous (high-load) vs. serial (low-load) conditions, the investigators can pinpoint the
      bottleneck. In addition to providing an approach that is complementary to the behavioral
      measures of Aims 1 and 2, the results of the EEG study can pave the way for future biomarkers
      and neurostimulation therapies.

        Presence of a significant visual impairment (corrected vision at distance worse than 20/40)

        History of alcohol/substance abuse or dependency

        Excessive tactile sensitivity of the scalp

        Contact sensitivity to skin care products or cosmetics (due to possibility for irritation
        from the EEG electrodes/paste)

        be removed

        Chronic tics or other significant movement disorders

        Pregnancy (because of potential and unknown effects on brain function with respect to the
        measures of this study).

        Children will be excluded if they are in foster care. Parents may be the biological or
        adoptive parent as long as they are the child's legal guardian.

        Parents of children in the study may not have a diagnosis of autism.

        Additional eligibility criteria for each group are contained in the following sections:

        Specific Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for ASD Group:

        Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will be made conservatively using the Autism
        Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,
        Second Edition (ADOS-2). The ADOS-2 will be performed by a psychology associate trained in
        its administration and scoring. Children must meet diagnostic thresholds on both of these
        instruments, and the diagnosis will be confirmed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
        Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), by a neurologist.

        Children may not have a history of known etiology for autism (e.g., fragile X syndrome,
        Tuberous Sclerosis, phenylketonuria, congenital rubella) or history of documented
        prenatal/perinatal insult, and they will show no evidence of meeting criteria for
        additional psychiatric diagnoses including major depression, bipolar disorder, conduct
        disorder, or adjustment disorder, based on maternal and child responses from the Kiddie
        Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS).
        Subjects with comorbid anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder,
        separation anxiety disorder, simple and social phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder
        (OCD), will be allowed to participate since anxiety is common in ASD, and similar
        repetitive repertoires resembling &quot;obsessive-compulsive behavior&quot; are components of the
        diagnostic criteria for ASD.

        Children with a comorbid diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) will
        also be included due to the frequent rates of comorbidity with ASD. Children on stimulant
        medication will have the medication held on the day of testing.

        Specific Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for Typically Developing (TD) Controls

        Children will be included in the typically developing (TD) control group if they: (1) Do
        not meet published cutoff criteria for ASD on the Social Responsiveness Scale, second
        edition (SRS-2), (2) do not have a history of a developmental disorder or a psychiatric
        disorder based on maternal and child responses from the K-SADS (excluding simple or social
        phobia); and (3) are free of immediate family members (sibling, parent) with autism or
        other pervasive developmental disorder.
