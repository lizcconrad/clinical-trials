  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is one of the most prevalent spinal deformity that may
      progress sharply during growth. It is recommended that the physiotherapeutic
      scoliosis-specific exercises should be the first step to treat idiopathic scoliosis to
      prevent/limit progression of the deformity. Three-dimensionally integrated exercise for
      scoliosis is based the theory of physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises, and consists
      of patient education, 3-dimension self-correction, stabilization of the corrected posture and
      training activity of daily living, combined with neuro-motor control, proprioceptive
      training, balance training, etc., forming the individual exercise approach for each patient.
      Nevertheless, the evidence concerning three-dimensionally integrated exercise for scoliosis
      is inadequate. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the effect of
      three-dimensionally integrated exercise intervention on the Cobb angle, angle of trunk
      rotation(ATR), sagittal profile, and quality of life, compared to standard care for patients
      with mild AIS.

      Informed consent will be obtained from each patient and one of their parents prior to
      inclusion. Eligible subjects will be randomized by a 1:1 allocation ratio by computer either
      to the experimental group, in which they will perform three-dimensionally integrated exercise
      for scoliosis, or the control group, in which they will receive the standard of care with
      observation according to the Scoliosis Research Society criteria.Blinded assessments at
      baseline and immediately post 6-month intervention will include radiographic measurement,
      trunk rotation, sagittal profile and health related quality-of-life.

      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is one of the most prevalent spinal deformity that may
      progress sharply during growth. According to the severity of the curve, the major treatment
      approaches for patient with AIS include exercises, bracing and surgery, to correct, prevent
      or stop the progression of the deformity.In North America, Scoliosis Research Society (SRS)
      has been published the standard of care for AIS: patients with curves between 10 and 25°
      should be observation who are still growing. While in the Europe, the International
      Scientific Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) has
      recommended that the physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises should be the first step
      to treat idiopathic scoliosis to prevent/limit progression of the deformity.
      Three-dimensionally integrated exercise for scoliosis is based the theory of
      physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises, and consists of patient education,
      3-dimension self-correction, stabilization of the corrected posture and training activity of
      daily living, combined with neuro-motor control, proprioceptive training, balance training,
      etc., forming the individual exercise approach for each patient. Nevertheless, the evidence
      concerning three-dimensionally integrated exercise for scoliosis is inadequate. Therefore,
      the objective of this study is to determine the effect of three-dimensionally integrated
      exercise intervention on the Cobb angle, angle of trunk rotation(ATR), sagittal profile, and
      quality of life, compared to standard care for patients with mild AIS.

      The present study is a single-center prospective randomised controlled trial conducted at the
      department of rehabilitation medicine, Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong
      University School of Medicine. The demographic data (height, weight), menarche status for the
      girls, family history, will be recorded by the physician.

      Informed consent will be obtained from each patient and one of their parents prior to
      inclusion. Eligible subjects will be randomized by a 1:1 allocation ratio by computer either
      to the experimental group, in which they will perform three-dimensionally integrated exercise
      for scoliosis, or the control group, in which they will receive the standard of care with
      observation according to the Scoliosis Research Society criteria. Blinded assessments at
      baseline and immediately post 6-month intervention will include radiographic measurement,
      trunk rotation, sagittal profile and health related quality-of-life.

    <description>Experimental group will receive a modified physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises ——the three-dimensionally integrated exercise for scoliosis program, which include auto-correction in 3D, postural correction, breathing training, resistance training, muscle fascia releasing, functional activities, balance training, core stability training, proprioceptive input exercises and patient education. Auto-correction exercise in 3D will combine with specific breathing mode, isometric training to correct abnormal spinal physiological curvatures in sagittal plane, and accompany with wedge pad to modify humpback, waist asymmetry, pelvic rotation in horizontal. While in coronal plane, longitudinal axial stretching, pelvic adjustments will be conducted to reduce the lateral curvature.</description>
