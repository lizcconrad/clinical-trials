  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase 1 study, two target dose levels of VLA1601, a purified, inactivated, whole Zika
      virus (ZIKV) vaccine candidate adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide (alum) will be evaluated: 6
      antigen units (AU) and 3 AU of inactivated ZIKV vaccine. Each dose will be administered
      intramuscularly (i.m.) in the deltoid muscle on Days 0 and 28. In addition, an accelerated
      2-dose vaccination schedule on Days 0 and 7 will be assessed for both doses.

             an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or device within 30 days prior to study
             enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IMP
             or investigational device during the course of this study;

         16. Subject has plans to become pregnant during the course of the study, or is pregnant
             (positive serum pregnancy test at screening) or lactating at the time of study
             enrollment;

         17. Subject has a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse as determined by
