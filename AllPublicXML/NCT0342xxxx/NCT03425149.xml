    <textblock>
      In this Phase 1 study, two target dose levels of VLA1601, a purified, inactivated, whole Zika
      virus (ZIKV) vaccine candidate adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide (alum) will be evaluated: 6
      antigen units (AU) and 3 AU of inactivated ZIKV vaccine. Each dose will be administered
      intramuscularly (i.m.) in the deltoid muscle on Days 0 and 28. In addition, an accelerated
      2-dose vaccination schedule on Days 0 and 7 will be assessed for both doses.

             Investigator, at screening (Visit 0);

          7. Subject tests positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus (HCV);

             (including asthma), metabolic, neurological (including Guillain-Barré syndrome),
             hepatic, rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological, gastrointestinal or renal disorder;

          9. Subject has a disease or is undergoing a form of treatment or was undergoing a form of
             treatment within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment (i.e. subject randomized) that can
             be expected to influence immune response. Such treatment includes, but is not limited

             equivalent) corticosteroids, radiation treatment or other immunosuppressive or
             cytotoxic drugs (use of inhaled (low dose), intranasal or topical steroids is
             permitted);

         10. Subject has a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis;

         11. Subject has a history of any vaccine related contraindicating event (e.g.,

         15. Subject is currently enrolled or has participated in another clinical study involving
             an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or device within 30 days prior to study
             enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IMP
             or investigational device during the course of this study;

         16. Subject has plans to become pregnant during the course of the study, or is pregnant
             (positive serum pregnancy test at screening) or lactating at the time of study
             enrollment;

         17. Subject has a known or suspected problem with alcohol or drug abuse as determined by
             the Investigator;
