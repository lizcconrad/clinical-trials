  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live microorganisms exhibiting multiple properties beneficial to health. An
      increasing body of evidence indicates that probiotics may support healthy brain function and
      may relieve stress. Recent research in this area has examined lactic acid bacteria in detail,
      but little is known about the stress-relieving effects of Saccharomyces, a yeast with
      probiotic properties.

      Psychological stress is a factor that allows people to successfully cope with various daily
      life situations. On the other hand, excessive stress may lead to bodily harm and decrease
      performance, e.g. academic achievements. Probiotics may help manage stress, but little is
      known whether probiotics improve performance under stress.

      The aim of this trial is to examine whether the healthy medical students may demonstrate
      better performance in academic examinations when supplementing their diet with a yeast
      probiotic strain Saccharomyces boulardii (CNCM I-1079) or bacterial probiotic strain
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103). The secondary aim of the trial is to evaluate the
      potential effects of this supplementation on state anxiety as well as on biochemical and
      physiological stress markers.
