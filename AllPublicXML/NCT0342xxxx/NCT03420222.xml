          -  At least 3 IED days (at least 1 IED episode each day, as recorded by the participant
             using the IED Daily Diary) per week for the 2 consecutive weeks directly preceding
             baseline with 70% compliance during that time frame, as assessed by the investigator

          -  Score ≥ 12 on the Life History of Aggression scale at screening

             screening and baseline

          -  Score ≥ 4 on the modified Clinical Global Impression of Severity (mCGI-S) for IED at
             screening and baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of major depressive disorder within 6 months of screening

          -  Significant symptoms of a depressive disorder or a Patient Health Questionnaire-9
