    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies multi-modality imaging and collection of biospecimen
      samples in understanding bone marrow changes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      undergoing total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy. Using mutli-modality imaging and
      collecting biospecimen samples may help doctors know more about how TBI and chemotherapy can
      change the bone marrow.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Temporal assessment of treatment impact on bone marrow. II. Relative assessment of bone
      marrow status between total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) and conventional TBI.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlation of dual energy computed tomography (DECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      imaging with biological samples for cellularity/adiposity.

      II. Relative assessment of chimerism engraftment kinetics between TMLI and TBI. III. Relative
      assessment of circulating cytokines between TMLI and TBI. IV. Feasibility of fluorothymidine
      F-18 (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging biomarker as a predictor of treatment
      response.

      V. Correlation of FLT PET imaging with biological correlate for leukemia. VI. Characterize
      relative distribution of leukemia in bone marrow (BM) environment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

      COHORT I (TLMI+FLT): Patients may undergo optional fluorothymidine F-18 PET scan over 2 hours
      at baseline, and on days -1, 30, and 60. Patients undergo DECT and water-fat MRI scan over 30
      minutes at baseline, on days -1, 30, 60, and 180, and at years 1 and 2. Patients also undergo
      collection of bone marrow and blood samples at baseline, on days -4, -1, 30, 60,100, and 180,
      and at years 1 and 2.

      COHORT II (TMLI): Patients undergo fluorothymidine F-18 PET, DECT, water-fat MRI, and
      collection of bone marrow and blood samples as in Cohort I.

      COHORT III (TBI): Patients undergo DECT and water-fat MRI scan over 30 minutes at baseline
      and 1 year. Patients undergo collection of bone marrow and blood samples at baseline, on days
      30 and 100, and at 1 year.

Cellularity is the same as percent of red marrow and adipocyte is the same as percent of yellow marrow. The primary outcome is the change in cellularity (the percent of red marrow and it is unitless), which will be measured on days -1, 30, 60, and 180, and at years 1 and 2 for TMLI+FLT/TMLI group. And adipocyte is 1-cellularity. Patients in TBI group undergo collection of bone marrow and blood samples at baseline, on days 30 and 100, and at 1 year.</description>
