      The purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic effects of four non-pharmacological
      interventions: skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, oral sucrose and nonnutritive sucking in
      newborns receiving a heel lance procedure.

      This is an randomized control clinical study. study population is healthy term
      newborns.Patients were identified by chart review and consent was received by nurse
      researcher. Newborns were randomized into either the control group who received no pain
      intervention or the intervention group who received one of four non-pharmacological pain
      interventions: skin to skin contact, breastfeeding, oral sucrose, and nonnutritive sucking.

      A heel lance for newborn screen blood sampling was selected as a study procedure and
      performed by a hospital technician following standard protocol. Pain scoring was assessed by
      two research nurses after the hell lance and through the procedure. Neonatal Pain, Agitation
      and Sedation Scale (NPASS) was selected as a pain assessment tool for this study.

      The average pain score from two research nurses were used for statistical analysis.

    <description>Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale (NPASS) measures both behavioral and physiological components of pain by evaluating five key elements, and scores pain from 0-10 (Patricia A. Hummel, 2004). The assessment criteria are crying irritability, behavior state, facial expression, extremities tone, and vital signs.</description>
