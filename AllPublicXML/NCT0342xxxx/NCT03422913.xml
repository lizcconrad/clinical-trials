    <textblock>
      Hepatectomy is the preferred method for the treatment of liver tumors. Since the liver is a
      double blood supply organ, massive hemorrhage during hepatectomy may lead to hemodynamic
      instability, prolonged portal vein occlusion and increased ischemia-reperfusion injury. In
      addition, bleeding during hepatectomy, intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusion are
      the main causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, bleeding control during
      liver resection is a critical technique. Based on the fact that liver is more tolerant to
      warm ischemia and hypoxia, a variety of techniques have been widely used for hepatic blood
      flow occlusion.

      With the prevalence of laparoscopy, more patients received laparoscopic resection of liver
      cancer. Bleeding has become a major constraint, so how to reduce the bleeding and preserve
      liver function has always been surgeons' concern.As conventional hepatic portal blood flow
      blocking technology is more mature, the risk of bleeding during laparoscopic liver resection
      mainly comes from hepatic veins in the process of hepatic parenchymal isolation. Although
      Ultrasound scalpel and Ligasure have been widely accepted in the treatment of laparoscopic
      hepatectomy, due to the thin hepatic vein and the high intraluminal pressure, it is also
      difficult to control the bleeding during surgery. How to prevent hepatic venous hemorrhage
      has become the key to reduce the bleeding . As sinusoidal pressure is affected by
      intrahepatic pressure, which is directly related to central venous pressure (CVP), reducing
      CVP can reduce the pressure in the hepatic veins and sinusoids hence reducing bleeding when
      the hepatic parenchyma is severed. That is the rationale of controlled low central venous
      pressure CLCVP) to reduce the risk of hepatectomy, which have been used maturely in open
      hepatectomy. Due to the low risk of hepatic and renal insufficiency and gas embolism in liver
      surgery, there is a potential risk of laparoscopic pneumoperitoneum and the risk of
      laparoscopic pneumoperitoneum is further increased. Therefore, how to implement CLCVP in
      laparoscopic surgery to reduce the risk of bleeding, also avoiding complications such as
      bleeding gas embolism, is a clinical problem to be solved, is rarely reported. A prospective
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be performed for laparoscopic hepatectomy in patients
      combine intraoperative combined hilar intermittent (Pringle method) with or without CLCVP to
      reduce the bleeding. This study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of CLCVP in
      combination with intermittent Pringle.

    <description>Anesthesiologists will control the amount of fluid input and the use of composite intravenous anesthesia to make CVP at 0~5cm H2O, if CVP is still &gt;5cm H2O, intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin will be used to reduce CVP. Maintaining arterial systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 90 mmHg, urine output more than 1ml/kg/h, and CVP was continuously monitored. Arterial pressure, pulse oxygen saturation ( SPO2), PaCO2 and electrocardiogram (II and V5 leads) were continuously monitored by radial artery cannulation. CVP will Returned to normal level (6 ~ 12 cmH2O) after resection to observe the wound if active bleeding still exist. Intraoperative hepatic blood flow blocking intermittent Pringle block method also required during surgery, 10-15 minutes for once, and more than 5 minutes interval can be repeated.</description>
