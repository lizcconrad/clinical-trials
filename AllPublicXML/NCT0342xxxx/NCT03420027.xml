  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A seven-item simplified score (the MACOCHA score) has been validated to predict difficult
      tracheal intubation in intensive care unit patients. In the prehospital or in the emergency
      department settings, no such validated predictive score is available yet. The aim of the
      present study is to assess the feasibility the quick calculation of the MACOCHA score before
      emergent intubation, in the prehospital and emergency department contexts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who will have to undergo emergent tracheal intubation for any reason in the
      prehospital context or at the emergency department at a single 1100-bed regional and teaching
      hospital in France, will be included in this observational, prospective study, provided that
      neither the patient him/herself, if capable, or next-of-kin if present have declined
      participation.

      Items of the MACOCHA score will be recorded before intubation by investigators, who are all
      certified emergency physicians skilled with urgent tracheal intubation.

      For any intubation procedure, either in the out-of-hospital context or in the Emergency
      Department, one of these emergency physicians is always present.

      The feasibility the quick MACOCHA score calculation before urgent intubation will be assessed
      by the number and percentages of patients for whom all the seven items of the score have been
      collected.

    <description>The MACOCHA score is a predictive score of difficult intubation in intensive care to anticipate and prepare the appropriate equipment, possibly use an alternative strategy of intubation and call for help to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality.
The MACOCHA score involves various simple assessment items: a Mallampati III or IV, a sleep apnea syndrome, a decrease in cervical mobility, a mouth opening &lt;3cm, a coma defined by a Glasgow score &lt;8, severe hypoxemia, and if the practitioner is not anesthetist.
Missing items are defined as those for which relevant information cannot be collected before intubation.</description>

        Patients will be adult patients requiring emergent tracheal intubation for acute
        respiratory failure, coma, or shock, while cared for by an Emergency Physician either in
        the prehospital setting or in the hospital Emergency Department.
