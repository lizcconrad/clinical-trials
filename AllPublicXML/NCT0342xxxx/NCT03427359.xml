  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively evaluate the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with
      cisplatin and capecitabine followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the treatment
      of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients received 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy:cisplatin 80mg/m2, day 1; oral
      capecitabine 1000mg/m2 twice daily from day1-14, repeated every 3 weeks followed by
      concomitant cisplatin (100mg/m2,day1,every 3 weeks) for a total of 2 cycles with
      radiotherapy. Intensity‑modified radiotherapy (IMRT) were used in all patients with the total
      dose and dose/fraction (Fr) as follows: PTV (planned target volume)_1:70 grays (Gy) at 2 Gy/
      Fr, PTV_2:63 Gy at 1.8 Gy/ Fr, PTV_3:56 Gy at 1.6 Gy/ Fr;5 fractions per week. Tumor response
      was evaluated after 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy and 16 weeks following completion of
      CCRT according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST1.1). All
      toxicities were gauged based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version
      4.03 (CTCAE 4.03).
