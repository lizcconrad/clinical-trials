      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single-dose
      escalation Phase I study in healthy adults in China, conducted in one center.

      The objectives are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics
      and immunogenicity of denosumab injection (code name:LY06006).

      Subjects would be sequentially enrolled in one of three cohorts. Eight subjects in the first
      cohort would receive a single 18 mg subcutaneous injection of LY06006. If the safety and
      tolerability were confirmed at Day 56, the other 16 subjects would be enrolled in the second
      cohort to receive a single 60 mg subcutaneous injection of LY06006. If the safety and
      tolerability were confirmed at Day 56 in 60-mg group, the last 8 subjects would be enrolled
      in the third cohort to receive a single 120 mg subcutaneous injection of LY06006.
