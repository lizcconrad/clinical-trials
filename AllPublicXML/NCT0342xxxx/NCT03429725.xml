    <textblock>
      An online survey is conducted on MTurk populations from India and USA. Participants were
      assigned either a condition with primes of individualism or one with primes of collectivism,
      before responding to a scale on culture and indicating details of their demographics.

    <description>Individualism and collectivism levels will be measured by Triandis &amp; Gelfand (1998)'s &quot;Culture Orientation Scale&quot;. This is a 16-item scale designed to measure: 1) Vertical Collectivism (VC) - seeing the self as a part of a collective and accepting hierarchy and inequality within that collective; 2) Vertical Individualism (VI) - seeing the self as fully autonomous, but recognizing and accepting the existence of inequality; 3) Horizontal Collectivism (HC) - seeing the self as part of a collective but viewing all the members of that collective as equal counterparts; and 4) Horizontal Individualism (HI) - seeing the self as fully autonomous, and believing in equality amongst individuals.
All items are answered on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1= never or definitely no and 5 = always or definitely yes. Each dimension's items are summed up separately to create a VC, VI, HC, and HI score to reflect the level of collectivism and individualism in the sampled group.</description>
