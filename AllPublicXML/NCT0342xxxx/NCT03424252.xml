  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two parts, two periods, crossover study with part 2 is optional. In both parts, subjects will
      be randomized to sequentially receive both sublingual and oral formulations of FDL169.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label study on healthy volunteers. The study will consist of up
      to 2 parts; the decision to proceed to the optional second part will be made following review
      of Part 1 data. Part 1 and optional Part 2 have randomized, 2 period crossover designs.
      Subjects will randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences in order to receive 2 single doses of
      FDL169 on separate occasions, one as a sublingual administration and one as an oral
      administration. There will be a minimum washout period of 10 days between FDL169
      administrations. The duration of each part is approximately 7 weeks from screening to follow
      up.

          9. Clinically significant abnormal biochemistry, haematology, coagulation or urinalysis
             as judged by the investigator (laboratory parameters are listed in)

         10. Positive drugs of abuse test result

         11. Positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) or
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results

         12. History of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, chronic respiratory
             or gastrointestinal disease, neurological or psychiatric disorder, as judged by the
             investigator
