      To investigate the effect of patient mood and cigarette smoking before spinal anesthesia on
      post spinal puncture headache and backache
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before spinal anesthesia patients will be asked about cigarette smoking. Anxiety and
      depression mood will recorded with Beck anxiety and Beck depression scale fifteen minute
      before spinal anesthesia.Seven days after surgery post spinal puncture headache and backache
      will assess by a telephonic interview

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>post spinal puncture headache (PDPH)</measure>
    <time_frame>one week after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>For assessing PDPH, patients will ask whether they experienced headache through the use of a dichotomous scale (yes or no answer). The severity of PDPH will be assessed by the Dittmann's scale. This PDPH specific scale was composed of 4 levels of severity. Level 1 indicated minimal PDPH with no use of medications to manage PDPH with the patient able to participate in daily living activities without any inferences. Level 2 indicated mild PDPH that required the use of analgesics with patients still able to engage in daily living activities. Level 3 indicated moderate PDPH where analgesic administration was required to control the level of pain. Level 4 indicated severe PDPH with an epidural blood patch recommended.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>fifteen minutes before spinal anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will evaluated by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), which consists of 21 questions about how the individual has felt in the preceding week regarding common anxiety symptoms, such as sweating, tremor, fear, and feelings of distress. The cutoff point for anxiety is 12, and scores between 1 and 11 are considered subsyndromal anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>depression</measure>
    <time_frame>fifteen minutes before spinal anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will assess by beck depression scale. The Beck Depression Scale (BDS) uses a 3-point Likert type response scale to 21 questions. In the scale, a total of 0-13 points are considered 'normal', 14-25 points to indicate 'depression', and 26-63 points to indicate'severe depression'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>tobacco use</measure>
    <time_frame>at preoperative visit</time_frame>
    <description>tobacco using will ask before surgery by use of a dichotomous scale(yes or no answer)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>post spinal puncture backache (PDPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>one week after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of backache will asses by using visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients will familiarized with 10 cm marked VAS for assessment of back pain, where 0 cm defines no pain, and 10 cm defines the maximum intolerable pain</description>
