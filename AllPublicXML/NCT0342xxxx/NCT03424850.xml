    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of early stage prostate cancer.

          -  Must be considered either low-risk (T1-T2a, Gleason ≤ 6, PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL) or favorable
             intermediate-risk (Gleason 3 +4 = 7, percentage of positive biopsy cores &lt; 50%, no
             more than one NCCN intermediate risk factor).

          -  Prior androgen deprivation therapy is allowed and may have been initiated up to 6
             months prior to the date of the HDR implant. The complete duration of androgen
             deprivation therapy can range from 4 months to 36 months provided it has been
             initiated no more than 6 months prior to the date of the HDR implant.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the prostate or lower pelvis encompassing the prostate.

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          -  Unable to undergo general, spinal or local anesthesia.

          -  Prior TURP
