  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines whether the ability to extract statistical properties from the
      environment among treatment-seeking patients with social anxiety disorder can predict
      therapeutic response to attention bias modification (ABM), namely, reduction in symptoms of
      social anxiety following ABM therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants received 6 sessions of ABM therapy away from threat. At baseline
      participants also completed a gold standard statistical learning task aimed to assess
      participants' capacity for the extraction of statistical regularity from the environment. The
      aim of the study is to determine whether the basic ability to extract rules from the
      environment at baseline could predict clinical improvement of social anxiety symptoms.

    <measure>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) - Diagnostic Interview scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale is a clinician-rated inventory consisting of 24 items describing socially relevant situations. Each situation is rated in relation to the past week on two sub-scales ranging 0-3: level of fear and level of avoidance experienced in response to these situations. Item scores are summed to a total score ranging 0-144</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Social Phobia Inventory scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Phobia Inventory is a self-reported questionnaire comprised of 17 items on a 5-point scale depicting social worries and problems. Participants rate to what extent these situations have bothered them in the past week. Item scores are summed to a total score ranging 0-68.</description>
