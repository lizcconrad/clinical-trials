  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.All the
      participants will be randomized into three groups, high-dose UC-MSCs, low-dose UC-MSCs, or
      methotrexate group.This study is designed to prove that UC-MSCs is safe and effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, incurable, immune-mediated dermatological disease, and it is
      considered that immune system dysregulation is the important cause of the disease.Umbilical
      cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) have be proven safe and effective for the
      treatment of various intractable autoimmune and inflammatory disorders because of their
      distinct immunomodulatory properties.

      Patients will be randomized into three groups.In one group patients will be treated with
      1x10^6 cells/kg in 0,1,2,3,5,7 week, in the second group patients will be treated with 3x10^6
      cells/kg in 0,1,2,3,5,7 week,in the third group patients will be treated with 5-25mg
      Methotrexate from 0 to 15 week In this study, researchers will determine the safety of
      UC-MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing side effects. Moreover researchers will
      also be assess the efficacy and sustainability of UC-MSCs in 52 weeks.
