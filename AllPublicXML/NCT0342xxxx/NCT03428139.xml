    <textblock>
      In this study, we try to evaluate the effect of using ALA as an adjuvant treatment in
      patients scheduled for pulsed radiofrequency treatment (PRFT) of the affected dorsal root
      ganglion (DRG) for treatment of Lumbo-Sacral radicular pain.

      Study design: The study is prospective, randomized, and open label started in August 2013 and
      was completed in March 2017 at Assiut University Hospital, Pain Unit after local ethical
      committee approval. All patients were informed verbally and in writing about the study, and
      they signed a detailed written informed consent about the procedure and the nature of the
      study.
