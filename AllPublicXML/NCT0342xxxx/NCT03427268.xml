  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy of PM060184 in terms of progression-free survival at 12
      weeks (PFS3) in advanced or metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC) patients with any KRAS
      mutation status (wild- type; mutated; or unknown status) progressing after standard
      treatments (fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin).

      Patients in this trial will receive PM060184 at a dose of 9.3 mg/m2 as a 30-minute
      intravenous (i.v.) infusion on Days 1 and 8 q3wk.
