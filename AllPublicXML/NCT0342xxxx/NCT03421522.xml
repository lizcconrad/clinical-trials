  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sacrifice of the intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) during surgery is associated with
      development of persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP), which affects up to 60% of breast cancer
      surgery patients. A large, definitive trial is needed to establish whether nerve preservation
      techniques are effective in reducing post-surgical pain after breast cancer surgery. If the
      effect of ICBN preservation is consistent with observational studies, the absolute reduction
      of rates of persistent pain would be considerable.The primary objective is to determine the
      effect of ICBN preservation, versus usual care, on the prevalence and intensity of PPSP at
      one year after breast cancer surgery involving axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 2016 systematic review that included 30 observational studies (n= 19,813 patients) found
      high quality evidence that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is associated with a 21%
      absolute risk increase of PPSP (95% CI = 13% to 29%). In many cases of breast cancer, surgery
      involves axillary approaches; however, preliminary evidence suggests that preservation of the
      intercostobrachial nerves (ICBN) may reduce the incidence of PPSP after axillary clearance. A
      2014 systematic review found 3 small, single-center randomized controlled trials (RCTs), that
      enrolled a total of 309 patients, and explored the effect of ICBN preservation versus
      sacrifice during breast cancer surgery. This review found that division of the ICBN was
      associated with higher risk of sensory deficits, and that nerve preservation techniques
      increased the median operating time by 5 minutes. Due to limitations of existing evidence,
      clinical practice guidelines currently provide no recommendations on whether the ICBN should
      be preserved during axillary lymph node dissection.A large, definitive trial is needed to
      establish whether nerve preservation techniques are effective in reducing PPSP after breast
      cancer surgery involving ALND. If all the apparent effect of axillary dissection is
      associated with lack of ICBN preservation, the absolute reduction of rates of PPSP would be
      considerable. Furthermore, nerve sparing requires no specialized equipment, suggesting that
      scalability will be highly feasible.

    <masking_description>Eligible participants will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: 1) ICBN preservation, or 2) usual surgical technique (ICBN sacrifice). Due to the nature of the intervention, it will not be feasible to blind the treating surgeons or the study personnel. The patients, data analysts, and those interpreting the study results will be blinded to treatment allocation.To ensure concealed allocation, eligible patients will be randomized using the randomization function within the REDCap Cloud electronic data capture system. Treatment allocation will be stratified by clinical site to account for systematic differences in surgeons and peri-operative care. To avoid crossover between treatment allocation, randomization will take place in the operating room after the surgeon has confirmed that the participant is a candidate for ICBN preservation.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females aged 18 years and older.

          2. Known or suspected invasive breast cancer.

          3. Planned ALND (not sentinel lymph node biopsy) either alone or with planned mastectomy
             or breast conserving surgery.

          4. The ICBN is preservable (as confirmed in the OR)

          5. Cognitive ability and language skills required to complete the outcome measures.

          6. Provision of informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has chronic pain or a chronic pain syndrome for which they have received
             daily medication (i.e. opioid, anti-convulsant, anti-spasmodic, anti-depressant,
             anti-inflammatory) or routine pain intervention (i.e. nerve blocks) during the past 3
             months.

             Note: Chronic pain refers to known chronic pain disorder (i.e. post-herpetic
             neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy,
             post-stroke pain, etc.). The diagnosis for a 'chronic pain syndrome' is outlined by
             the use of pain medications and interventions. The pain medication must be used by the
             patient to treat pain. For a pain intervention to be considered routine, it must be
             given in its prescribed frequency during the past three months (e.g. a patient that
             has been prescribed to receive a nerve block once a month, received three nerve blocks
             in the past three months).

          2. The patient has a prior history of completing ALND on the ipsilateral side.

          3. Detectable metastatic disease at the time of initial diagnosis.

          4. Planned bilateral ALND.

          5. History of shoulder trauma or pathology on the same side as their breast cancer.

          6. Preservation of the ICBN is not possible, in the judgement of the attending surgeon
             (as confirmed in the OR).

          7. Anticipated problems with the patient being available for follow-up.

          8. Incarceration.

          9. The patient is or may be enrolled in a competing trial.

         10. Other reason to exclude the patient, as specified.
