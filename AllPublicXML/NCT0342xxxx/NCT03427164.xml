  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this project is to determine if acute monitoring of shunt patency via
      ultrasound elastography measurements of splenic stiffness before and after TIPS placement
      results in reduced morbidity and mortality from shunt failure.

    <textblock>
      Portal hypertension is a condition that is caused by various disorders of the liver,
      including cirrhosis, hepatitis, portal vein thrombosis, or Budd-Chiari Disease. Portal
      hypertension can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, called ascites, or put
      patients at risk for bleeding of the esophagus, stomach, and bowel. In certain patients,
      portal hypertension is treated by placement of a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic
      Shunt (TIPS).

      Elastography is a newer exam which measures the consistency, or softness/stiffness, of
      various organs in the body. It is performed with ultrasound by sliding a transducer across
      the abdomen. Elastography is most commonly used to evaluate the liver, as disorders that
      cause damage to the liver result in stiffer liver tissue. The spleen has also been shown to
      get stiffer in the setting of portal hypertension.
