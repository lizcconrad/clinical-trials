  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Department of Health recommends using equipment which prevents wrong route drug
      administration. However, the epidural blood patch requires equipment that connects to the
      intravenous and epidural route. To comply with these recommendations a non-Luer butterfly
      needle with one-way valve has been produced. The one-way valve and length of tubing has the
      potential to activate the clotting cascade. This could reduce the time clinicians have to
      utilise the blood in the syringe. Also any alteration in clotting could affect the
      therapeutic value of the epidural blood patch. The primary objective of this research was to
      determine if phlebotomy using this new 21G needle altered blood clotting, determined by
      thromboelastograph analysis, compared to a standard 21G hypodermic needle.
