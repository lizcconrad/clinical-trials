  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), that is designed to be short, concise and user friendly
      is compared to applied relaxation techniques as treatment for insomnia comorbid with chronic
      pain. Both treatments are administered via internet and participants are randomized to ether
      treatment arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Internet treatment with therapist support means that measurements are collected through the
      Internet. Participants are recruited from a specialized pain clinic for chronic pain. All
      patients with sleep complaints (Insomnia Severity Index &gt; 14) at their first visit through
      2016-01-01 to 2017-07-31 are asked for participation via mail. Volunteers sign informed
      consent and undergo a online screening. If matching the inclusion criteria, they are
      contacted for a telephone interview. Subjects are assessed according to the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criterion for insomnia
      disorder, M.I.N.I. (screening for psychiatric comorbidity) and the other inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. The treatment, that is designed to be short, concise and user friendly as it is
      meant to be usable as an adjunct treatment to other main interventions for chronic pain. The
      treatment lasts for five weeks and focuses on the most potent CBT technics for insomnia;
      sleep restriction and stimulus control.

      Randomization is conducted by university staff not otherwise involved in this study.
      Participants have equal chance to be allocated to ether CBT or applied relaxation techniques
      (active controls). The relaxation treatment lasts for the same amount of time (five weeks)
      and is designed to require similar weekly effort. Both groups fill in sleep diaries every
      week and weekly feedback is provided by master students supervised by clinical psychologists.

      The overall hypothesis is that CBT leads to greater symptom reduction (according to the
      Insomnia Severity Index) compared to applied relaxation techniques.
