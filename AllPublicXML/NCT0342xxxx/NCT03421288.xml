      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label study comparing perioperative
      atezolizumab with FLOT chemotherapy versus FLOT alone in patients with locally advanced,
      operable adenocarcinoma of the stomach or GEJ.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study treatment regimens. The study
      includes an evaluation of rate of immune cell infiltration into the esophagogastric tumor
      tissue following two and four cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. Potential study participants
      will be assessed for eligibility during a 28-day screening period that includes central
      verification of clinical stage and eligibility. Eligible patients will be enrolled and
      randomized to perioperative treatment with either atezolizumab with FLOT (Arm A) or FLOT
      alone (Arm B). Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by clinical nodal
      stage (N+ vs. N-), location of the primary (GEJ type I vs. GEJ type II/III vs. stomach), and
      MSI-status (MSI-high vs. MSI-low/MSI-stable). Quantitative PDL-1 mRNA expression [high vs.
      intermediate vs. low] will be performed but not used as stratification factor. Following
      randomization, study patients will enter the study treatment period which will last
      approximately 22 to 52 weeks depending on treatment arm and timing of surgery.

      Arm A: FLOT with Atezolizumab:

      Patients randomized to treatment Arm A will receive atezolizumab + FLOT in four 2-week
      treatment cycles as described below prior to undergoing surgery. Following surgery, patients
      will receive four further 2-week cycles of atezolizumab + FLOT followed by 8 additional
      3-week treatment cycles with atezolizumab alone.

      Arm B: FLOT alone:

      Patients randomized to Arm B will receive FLOT alone for four 2-week treatment cycles prior
      to surgery. Following surgery, patients will receive four further 2-week cycles of
      chemotherapy alone.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have provided written informed consent

          2. In the investigator's judgement, is willing and able to comply with the study protocol
             including the planned surgical treatment

          3. Female and male patients* ≥ 18 years of age

          4. Diagnosed with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the GEJ (Type I-III) or the
             stomach (cT2, cT3, cT4, any N category,

             M0), or (any T, N+, M0) that:

               1. is not infiltrating any adjacent organs or structures by CT or MRI evaluation

               2. does not involve peritoneal carcinomatosis

               3. is considered medically and technically resectable Note: the absence of distant
                  metastases must be confirmed by CT or MRI of the thorax and abdomen, and, if
                  there is clinical suspicion of osseous lesions, a bone scan. If peritoneal
                  carcinomatosis is suspected clinically, its absence must be confirmed by
                  laparoscopy. Diagnostic laparoscopy is mandatory in patients with T3 or T4 tumors
                  of the diffuse type histology in the stomach.

          5. No prior cytotoxic or targeted therapy

          6. No prior partial or complete esophagogastric tumor resection

          7. ECOG ≤ 1

          8. Availability of a representative tumor specimen that is suitable for determination of
             PD-L1 and MSI status via central testing; PD-L1 and MSI assessment will be performed
             prior to randomization. The analysis requires paraffin embedded biopsy samples.
             Patients are included in the trial upon available results only.

          9. Females of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate
             of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last
             study treatment. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is
             postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (has not had ≥12 continuous
             months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not
             undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of
             contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include tubal ligation,
             male sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of combined oral or
             injected hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices. Alternatively, two
             methods (e.g., two barrier methods such as a condom and a cervical cap) may be
             combined to achieve a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year. Barrier methods must always be
             supplemented with the use of a spermicide. The reliability of sexual abstinence should
             be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and
             usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

         10. Males must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures, and agree to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:

             a. With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men
             must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that
             together result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for
             at least 3 months after the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo.
             Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. Men with a pregnant
             partner must agree to remain abstinent or to use a condom for the duration of the
             pregnancy.

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal, or glomerular filtration rate &gt;
                  45 ml/min (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)

               -  For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR or aPTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN;
                  for patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen
                  *There are no data that indicate special gender distribution. Therefore patients
                  will be enrolled in the study gender-independently.
