  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the real-world performance of the
      CoreValve Evolut PRO transcatheter aortic valve, including leaflet function, in a prospective
      observational registry.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CoreValve Evolut PRO transcatheter aortic valve was approved by the FDA in March 2017 to
      treat patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis at high or extreme risk for open heart
      surgery, and in July 2017 for intermediate risk patients. This latest generation device
      features an outer wrap to improve annular sealing and reduce paravalvular leak.

      In this observational study, baseline demographic and imaging characteristics, procedural
      details and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement
      with the CoreValve Evolut PRO will be prospectively collected into a registry database. The
      institutional Heart Team will select patients according to standard practice.

        This study is a prospective registry of subjects with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis
        undergoing TAVR with a commercially-approved self-expanding transcatheter heart valve. A
        subgroup of subjects will undergo additional research contrast-enhanced 4D CT at 30-60 days
        after TAVR. Otherwise, all additional test and TAVR implantation procedures are as per
        standard of care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis

          2. Intermediate, high or extreme surgical risk

          3. The institutional Heart Team determines that transcatheter aortic valve replacement
             with an Evolut Pro device is appropriate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject unable or unwilling to give informed consent

          2. For subjects in the CT arm only, renal function precluding the administration of
             iodinated contrast for cardiac CT (eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2). An exception to this
             exclusion criterion is made if the subject is established on renal replacement therapy
             and is therefore able to receive intravenous iodinated contrast media.

          3. Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant prior to completion of all protocol follow-up
             procedures
