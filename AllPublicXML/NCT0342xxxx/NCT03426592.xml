  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV persists despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is associated with chronic
      inflammation. This inflammation is thought to prevent an effective immune response against
      the virus and is mediated at least in part by gut epithelial permeability and microbial
      translocation. HIV accumulates preferentially within Th17 cells with time on ART; these
      memory CD4+ T cells are highly susceptible to HIV infection and are concentrated within the
      gut. Vitamin D promotes gut epithelial integrity in animal models and exerts
      anti-inflammatory effects on the human immune system including down-modulation of Th17 cell
      frequency. This study will evaluate whether high dose vitamin D is able to reduce immune
      activation and Th17 cell frequency, to improve gut barrier integrity and the gut microbiome
      and reduce HIV persistence in participants on long-term suppressive ART.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major barrier to a cure for HIV infection is the persistence of latently infected CD4+ T
      cells on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV is concentrated in vivo in Th17 cells in blood and
      the gastrointestinal tract. Th17 cells are critical mediators of mucosal immunity against
      bacteria and fungi and are rapidly depleted in the gut following HIV acquisition with
      subsequent gut epithelial permeability, microbial translocation and ensuing chronic
      inflammation which is not completely reversed on ART. Such inflammation may contribute to HIV
      persistence by potentiating T cell proliferation and thereby clonal expansion of infected
      cells, by exacerbating CD8+ T cell exhaustion and potentially by promoting viral replication
      despite ART.

      Vitamin D has pleiotropic effects on the immune system including directing na√Øve CD4+ T cells
      away from the Th17 phenotype toward an anti-inflammatory regulatory T cell phenotype. It may
      also have beneficial effects on dendritic cell and CD8+ T cell immunity. Furthermore, vitamin
      D has been shown in animal models to strengthen gut epithelial integrity and in healthy
      volunteers to promote a more diverse gut microbiome.

      The investigators plan to perform a pilot randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of
      high dose vitamin D supplementation in HIV-infected participants on suppressive ART and to
      determine its effect on immune activation, Th17 cell frequency, gut barrier integrity, the
      gut microbiome and HIV persistence.
