      Medical device study for efficacy and tolerability of a HA gel in the management of teething
      symptoms

  <detailed_description>

      Due to the potential toxicity that can result from the use of topical anesthetics to relieve
      the symptoms associated with gingival inflammatory conditions or gums trauma in infant,
      recently, products containing Hyaluronic Acid (HA) have been marketed in Europe. In
      particular, Bioplax Limited is developing several high molecular weight HA medical devices
      characterized by the absence of preservatives, alcohol and dyes; therefore, the
      administration of these products in infants is safe and can help creating a natural
      protective layer on the gingival tissue. In previous clinical trials with these high
      molecular weight HA medical devices it was noted a periodontal tissue/fluid balance with
      accelerated healing and repair properties that could be of interest either for accelerating
      the wound healing process or for treating the complex physical symptoms (i.e. soreness and
      swelling of gums, crying, sleeplessness) related to the teething in infants. These data were
      confirmed by a recent pilot study on 18 infants suffering by teething where the two
      formulation of the tested high molecular weight HA medical device evidenced, at the end of
      treatment period, a statistically significant reduction of pain, swelling, gingival rush,
      hyper-salivation and redness, from baseline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female infants aged between 3 and 36 months.

          2. Teething diagnosed by the presence of at least 3 of the following clinical symptoms:

               -  pain

               -  swelling

               -  hyper-salivation

               -  redness

               -  abnormal teeth depth.

          3. At the moment of inclusion no subcutaneous mucosal laceration must be yet appeared.

          4. Infants and parents who are in a general position to follow all study requirements.

          5. Informed consent form signed by parents or legal representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Infants in hospitalization and/or immobilization and/or confinement to bed.

          2. Infants with known history of severe renal insufficiency and/or known history of
             severe cardiac dysfunction and/or liver problems.

          3. Use of topical oral Lidocaine, other topical oral anesthetic products and/or topical
             Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) within one day before inclusion.

          4. Use of systemic NSAIDs within 3 days before inclusion and/or use of systemic
             anesthetics within 10 days before.

          5. Concomitant use during the period of study of NSAIDs and/or any other anesthetics
             (except DentinoxÂ®-Gel N, for subjects allocated to group II of treatment).

          6. Subjects with known family history of allergic or adverse reactions to drugs or
             substances.

          7. Infants whose parents suffer from any form of psychiatric disorder or other condition
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might invalidate the required prescription
             and/or observation or complicate communication with the subject.

          8. Infants simultaneously participating or having participated in the last month before
             Visit 1 in another clinical trial.
