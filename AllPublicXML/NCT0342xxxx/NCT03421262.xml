  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate differences in pregnancy outcomes and medical costs
      depending on gestational diabetes diagnostic criteria used (one vs two-step approach).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes study results, a new gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) diagnostic criteria was defined using a one-step approach (75-g oral glucose
      tolerance test -OGTT-).

      However, not all scientific societies have accepted and have implanted this new diagnostic
      criteria. The lowest glycemia cut-off of this criteria regarding the two-step approach
      entails an increase in GDM incidence with discordant studies about its cost-effectivity.

      It will be assessed if pregnancy outcomes and medical costs are different depending on
      diagnostic criteria used.
