  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, non-randomised, open, controlled, single-center
      post-market clinical follow whereby study patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will
      have bilateral implantation of monofocal intraocular lenses Micropure 1.2.3. (PhysIOL, Liège,
      Belgium)

      The study purpose is to obtain clinical data on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity on
      patients implanted with Micropure 1.2.3.

      The device under investigation (Micropure 1.2.3.) is a monofocal glistening-free hydrophobic
      acrylic intraocular lens (IOL) manufactured by the sponsor of this study PhysIOL sa/nv. The
      IOL will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients suffering from
      cataract development.

      In total 50 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and receive a bilateral
      implantation of Micropure 1.2.3. intraocular lens.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 6 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 3 postoperative) over a period of 3 months.
