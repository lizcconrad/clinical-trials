  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will be randomly distributed into 3 experimental groups: training with basic
      global electrostimulation (WB-EMS-SRT), training with specific global electrostimulation for
      runners (WB-EMS-WT) and control group (CG).

      Initially and at the end of the intervention period, which will consist of six weeks, the
      subjects will undergo a series of tests: (1) Maximum incremental effort test in tapestry to
      exhaustion to determine cardiorespiratory capacity (VO2max) and thresholds (aerobic and
      anaerobic). (2) Submaximal carpet test at constant speed to determine race economy (EC). (3)
      Lower train power test (CMJ and Abalakov). (4) Weight, size and waist circumference. The
      aforementioned tests will be carried out on different days to avoid the effect of fatigue on
      performance with a break of more than 48 hours between tests.

      The participants in the control group will maintain the volume and intensity of the training
      prior to the intervention study and the subjects of the WB-EMS and WB-EMS-AC groups will
      substitute one conventional training day for one with global electrostimulation for six
      weeks; the training of the first group will be non-specific and that of the second specific
      for runners and the duration of both will be 20 minutes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial design was applied following CONSORT statements. After baseline
      measurements, participants were randomized into two groups: (i) WB-EMS group and (ii) Control
      Group (CG). Participants in the WB-EMS group were instructed to reduce their running training
      program volume, whereas the CG continued with their running training in term of volume and
      intensity: two or three times per week (45-60 minutes per day) at an intensity of 60-70%
      hearth rate reserve, which was controlled by heart rate monitor (Polar RS300X, POLAR,
      Kempele, Finland), and with 24-48 hours of rest between sessions

    <description>The WB-EMS training program consisted of six WB-EMS training sessions (one per week) and six running training sessions (also one per week).
This intervention programme followed a within-day undulating periodization model. The training sessions were divided into four parts: warm up (A), strength (B), high intensity interval power training (c), and high intensity interval training (HIIT) (D).</description>
