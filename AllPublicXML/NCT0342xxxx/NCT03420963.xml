      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      NK cells are specialized immune cells in the body that have been shown to kill tumor cells
      (including solid tumor cells) in the laboratory. Previous studies of NK cells in some cancer
      patients have suggested that they can be given without severe side effects and may help in
      controlling tumors.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the recommended dose of donated natural
      killer cells that can be given to pediatric cancer patients with solid tumors after receiving
      chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and etoposide). The safety of the NK cells given after
      chemotherapy will also be studied.

      In this study, the NK cells being used have already been donated/collected from cord blood
      (blood collected at birth from the afterbirth of healthy babies). They are then &quot;expanded,&quot;
      or grown, so that more NK cells can be made from a small sample and given to a patient.

      Cyclophosphamide and etoposide are standard chemotherapy drugs that are used in the treatment
      of pediatric solid tumors. In this study, the drugs are being given both to fight the cancer
      cells and also to help prevent your body from rejecting the NK cells.

      This is an investigational study. NK cell transplants are not FDA approved or commercially
      available. Cyclophosphamide and etoposide are FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment being used on this study. The use of NK cell transplants in combination with this
      chemotherapy is investigational.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs and NK cells are designed to work.

      Up to 32 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of NK cells based on when you join this study. Up to 2 dose levels of NK cells will be
      tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. A second group will receive a higher dose,
      if no intolerable side effects were seen.

      After the recommended dose is found, an additional 14 participants may be enrolled in an
      &quot;Expansion Phase&quot; and receive that dose of NK cells.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of standard chemotherapy.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1-5. You will also
      receive etoposide by vein over about 60 minutes on Days 1-5. You will then rest (not receive
      anything) on Days 6 and 7. You will then receive the NK cells by vein. The nurse and study
      doctor will determine the length of the infusion based on volume that they get from the lab.
      It should take no more than 1 hour.

      You will be admitted to the hospital within 24 hours before you begin receiving chemotherapy
      to receive it as an inpatient. You will stay in the hospital for all the chemotherapy and not
      be discharged until after you have received the NK cell infusion and the doctor thinks that
      it is safe for you to go home.

      You will also receive mesna to help prevent side effects to the bladder. Mesna is given by
      vein over a short amount of time at 3 different time points. When and how long you receive it
      will depend on what the study doctor thinks is in your best interest. This will be discussed
      with you.

      You will be given standard drugs and fluids to help decrease the risk of side effects. You
      may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive the NK cells 1 time. You will then have study visits until 30 days after you
      receive the NK cells. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      Within 72 hours before you begin receiving chemotherapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for the presence
           of donor cells in your blood, and research tests to check the effects of the NK cells.
           Some of these tests are being done before you receive the donor cells to compare to
           samples that are taken after you receive them.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Urine will be collected for routine tests every time you urinate while you are in the
      hospital receiving chemotherapy.

      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests 2 times each week from the time
      you started chemotherapy until your blood cell counts recover from chemotherapy. This may
      continue to be done after you leave the hospital.

      Within 24 hours before you receive the NK cells, 3-4 days after you receive the NK cells, and
      then every week until 30 days after you receive the NK cells and then at Months 3, 6, and 12:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check for the presence
           of donor cells in your blood, and research tests to check the effects of the NK cells.
           The research blood draws will continue only until Day 38.

        -  Depending on the type of disease that you have, blood (about 1 teaspoon) may be drawn
           for tumor marker testing.

      At the last of these visits, you will have MRI and/or CT scans to check the status of the
      disease around 4 weeks after infusion. If the doctor thinks it is needed, this will be
      repeated at 8 weeks after your NK cell infusion to check for pseudoprogression.
      Pseudoprogression is when the tumor may appear to be getting worse soon after cell infusion
      because the body is mounting an immune response to the tumor. But really either the tumor is
      stable (has not changed) or is getting better. Depending on the type of disease that you
      have, you may need to have additional studies that include MIBG, FDG-PET, bone marrow
      aspiration and biopsy, tumor marker, and tissue biopsy at these visits to check the status of
      the disease.

      After the last visit, you will continue to be followed by your regular cancer doctor per the
      standard of care. Information about how you are doing and the disease will be shared with the
      study doctor for 1 year after the infusion of NK cells. Follow-up may continue after that if
      you have any ongoing complications or side effects related to the infusion.
