  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and tolerability of the combination
      treatment of the investigational drugs vorinostat and pembrolizumab, in combination with
      chemotherapy (temozolomide), and radiotherapy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      has approved pembrolizumab for use to treat a deadly skin cancer called melanoma and lung
      cancer and vorinostat to treat some forms of blood and lymph node cancers. However, both
      vorinostat and pembrolizumab are considered investigational drugs in this study because they
      are not approved for treatment of glioblastoma.

      There are 2 parts to this study:

      Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). The main purpose of Part 1 is
      Dose-Escalation. &quot;Dose-Escalation&quot; means that different dose levels will be tested at
      different times during the study to find the best dose level that is safe and well tolerated
      in participants. In this study investigators will determine the best dose of Vorinostat that
      can be given with pembrolizumab, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The dose of temozolomide and
      radiotherapy will be the same as standard treatment.

      Part 2 (Dose Expansion), all participants will receive the same dose of vorinostat with
      pembrolizumab, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      Maintenance Phase: During the maintenance phase, participants will receive Temozolomide (for
      the first 6 months), vorinostat (for 12 months), and pembrolizumab (for 12 months).

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
