  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      40 specimens were prepared from fresh-extracted human molars and further embedded using the
      acrylic resin. Specimens were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the treatment
      before in vivo erosion (n=20): CPP-ACP for 3 min (CPP-ACP group) and deionized water for 3
      min (control group). 10 healthy volunteers were recruited and customized maxillary appliance
      containing 4 specimens (2 from CPP-ACP group and 2 from control group) was fabricated for
      each volunteer. Participants were instructed to drink 150 ml cola in 5 min using the gargling
      method after placing appliances intraorally for 2 h. The in vivo attacks were performed 4 X 5
      min with 1-h interval daily over 7 d. The surface microhardness and surface microstructure of
      the specimens were evaluated at the baseline and after the treatment. The data were
      statistically analyzed using three-way ANOVA and post hoc tests. Data were considered
      statistically significant at a level of P &lt;0.05.
