  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sensory recovery of the breast remains an undervalued aspect of breast reconstruction and
      surgical reinnervation is not regarded as a priority by most reconstructive surgeons. A
      prospective study was conducted of all patients who underwent either innervated or
      non-innervated DIEP flap breast reconstruction in Maastricht University Medical Center and
      returned for follow-up between September 2015 and July 2017. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments
      were used for sensory testing of the breast. This study showed that nerve coaptation in DIEP
      flap breast reconstruction resulted in a significantly improved sensation of the
      reconstructed breast compared to non-innervated flaps.

    <description>The sensory recovery of the breast to touch was tested at different follow-up moments after the initial surgery. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were used for sensory testing. Nine areas of the breast, indicating native skin and flap skin, were tested. Mean monofilament values were calculated for each area and compared between groups.</description>

    <description>A recipient sensory nerve of the abdomen was reattached to a donor nerve in the chest area. The sensory branch of usually the 11th intercostal nerve was used as recipient nerve for nerve coaptation and the anterior cutaneous branch of the third intercostal nerve was used as donor nerve. Direct, end-to-end nerve coaptation was performed with two stitches.</description>

        In this prospective study, patients who underwent an innervated or non-innervated DIEP flap
        breast reconstruction between January 2010 and July 2016 at Maastricht University Medical
        Center in the Netherlands were included if they returned for follow-up between September
        2015 and July 2017.
