      Background:

      Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from porcine intestinal
      mucosa that enhances the inhibitory activity of the natural anticoagulant antithrombin
      towards most activated clotting factors (F), particularly FXa and FIIa (thrombin) . Despite
      the growing interest for low molecular weight derivatives (LMWH), UFH is still widely used
      for different indications including the treatment of acute thrombosis including venous
      thromboembolism, coronary syndromes (ACS), and other thrombotic diseases. UFH is administered
      by parenteral route either intravenous (IV) or sub-cutaneous (SC).Actually, there is evidence
      that the risk of recurrence of thrombosis is increased when heparin levels fells below the
      lower limit of the therapeutic range, while the hemorrhagic risk increases with heparin
      levels above the upper limit of the therapeutic range. Moreover, the anticoagulant response
      to UFH is highly variable for one individual to another. As the clinical efficacy of heparin
      is dependent on maintaining an anticoagulant effect above a minimum level, careful laboratory
      monitoring of UFH treatment is mandatory. For that purpose, two options are offered to the
      clinicians: i) to evaluate either the prolongation of a global clotting assay, the activated
      partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and ii) to measure the heparin-enhanced inhibitory
      activity of AT toward purified activated factors such as FIIa and FXa using chromogenic
      substrate-based assays. UFH therapy is still widely monitored by the aPTT, a global clotting
      assay, that reflects the ability of heparin to enhance the inhibitory activity of AT against
      FIIa, FXa, and other activated factors. The therapeutic range of aPTT prolongation is highly
      dependent on the reagent and analyzer used. As the consequence, it must be defined by each
      laboratory in its own technical conditions (for each reagent batch) to correlate with heparin
      levels between 0.20 and 0.40 U/mL (protamine sulfate titration), corresponding to anti-FXa
      activity between 0.30 and 0.70 IU/mL. In that connection, the prolongation of aPTT
      corresponding to antiFXa activity between 0.30 - 0.70 IU/mL is highly variable depending of
      the reagents e.g.between 1.6 - 2.7 x control for weakly sensitive reagents and between 3.7 -
      6.2 x control for highly sensitive reagents. The use of aPTT has advantages as it is
      easy-to-perform, quick, inexpensive but faces numerous challenges due to the significant
      influence of the technical conditions (reagent/instrument) on the test result, to lot-lot
      variation in reagent sensitivity, to the need of studies to evaluate the therapeutic range,
      to limited therapeutic range, and also to non-specific prolongation in the case of lupus
      anticoagulant, factors deficiency, inhibitors or shortening in the case of high factor
      levels, particularly FVIII.In contrast, the use of chromogenic anti-Xa assays has many
      advantages particularly a published therapeutic range for UFH i.e. between 0.30 and 0.70
      IU/mL, a specificity to its interaction with AT (no Heparin Cofactor II interference by using
      bovine FIIa or short incubation time) and faces few challenges such as limited availability
      in some area and a cost that is slightly higher than that of aPTT. In addition, anti-Xa
      assays allow accurate measurement of all heparin(s) derivatives and particularly LMWHs and
      fondaparinux.

      Since the first reports in the mid-eighties, some small sized studies have compared the two
      monitoring strategies mainly retrospectively designed (7-11). Even though, one single
      prospective randomized management study evaluated the comparison between the two monitoring
      strategies with clinical end-points i.e. recurrence of thrombosis and bleeding complication
      in a cohort of 131 patients with VTE . All concluded to a trend toward higher, or at least
      similar, safety/efficacy/efficiency when patients were monitored using antiXa activity vs.
      aPTT. Even though differences were not significant due to the lack of power of these studies.

      Aim of the study Based on available data, a randomized trial aimed at comparing the efficacy
      and safety of monitoring UFH treatments using aPTT and anti-FXa activity in patients treated
      with fulldoses of UFH could validly be carried out.

      Study design

        -  Primary objectives: safety and efficacy

        -  Secondary objectives: efficiency and cost effectiveness

        -  Primary evaluation criteria: bleeding complications (n, %) and thrombotic complications

        -  Secondary evaluation criteria: percentage of test results within the therapeutic
           range,number of tests perfomed per day, number of daily dose adjustments, total dosage
           of heparin given to the patients, mean time to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation,
           transfusion rates, health economics analysis (total treatment cost)

        -  Calculation of number of patients to be evaluated:

      According to the only randomized study published to date (A), the bleeding rate was 1.5%
      (n=1/65) in the group of patients monitored using Anti-FXa activity vs. 6.1% (n=4/66) in
      theaPTT group. The difference was not significant (p=0.36) due to the lack of power of the
      study (n=131 patients). Taking into account these bleeding risks and 0.05 as the alpha risk
      and 0.20 (0.05) as the beta risk, the number of patients to be included would be 323 (506) in
      each treatment arm.

      Description of the two monitoring strategies

      Patients should be randomized to be monitored using either:

        -  Anti-Xa activity (heparin levels) with the therapeutic range between 0.30 and 0.70IU/mL
           (corresponding to 0.2 to 0.4 protamine sulfate titration assay) (3).

        -  aPTT wIth the usual therapeutic range of 1.5 to 2.5 fold the control time, which was the
           usually used therapeutic range in the institution.

      Example of nomogram for heparin dose-adjustment when monitored using aPTT or anti-Xa activity
      (12)Practical considerations

        -  Mechanism of randomization: electronic

        -  After randomization, the patients must be monitored using either anti-Xa activity or
           aPTT.

      Only that specific test should be prescribed by the ward, and only that the corresponding
      test result be given by the laboratory.

        -  Ideally, fresh patients samples should be evaluated for both Anti-Xa activity and aPTT,
           data being recorded, but only the prescribed test should be given to the ward. In
           addition, it would be necessary to store aliquots (0.5-1.0 mL each) of plasmas samples
           frozen at -70°C for control purpose.

        -  Patients must be follow-up at 3-months

        -  Data to be collected:

      Patients demographical data (sex, age), indication of UFH therapy (VTE, ACS,
      other…),comorbidity (cancer, pregnancy, postoperative period, other…), concomitant therapy
      (medication such as oral contraceptive…) , previous history of thrombosis (DVT, ACS,stroke,
      other…) Duration (in hours) and total dosage (IU) of heparin therapy before randomization (if
      any) Route of administration (IV, SC), daily heparin dosage (IU), duration of treatment, time
      to achieve therapeutic range, number of dosage change per day, laboratory test results
      (anti-Xa activity or aPTT) Outcome: death (any cause (to be recorded), description of any
      bleeding complication (when, localization, classification as major or minor…) or recurrence
      of thrombosis (when,localization…) while on UFH therapy and within the 3-month follow-up.
