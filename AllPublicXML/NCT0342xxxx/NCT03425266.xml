  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to understand the preferences, goals, and perspectives of patients
      with chronic pain and their health care providers (HCPs) to create a patient-centered
      decision support tool. This tool, aimed at patients and HCPs, should improve patient-provider
      communication and chronic pain management. The investigators' long-term goal is to improve
      the quality of life of patients with chronic pain. The investigators target adults with
      chronic unremitting pain and HCPs who manage patients with chronic pain, including primary
      care providers and pain specialists.

      A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) will measure the impact of a new online tool that
      the investigators developed (Pain-APP) in a representative sample of adults with chronic
      pain, including approximately 50 patients and 4-15 HCPs. Eligible patients will be enrolled
      online, and after informed consent and eliciting baseline socio-demographic information,
      randomized online to either Pain-APP or the control group, which will consist of online
      educational materials at the ACPA website (https://theacpa.org/Communication-Tools). Patients
      in both groups will be assessed online before, just after viewing the intervention materials,
      just after the index clinic visit, and 1 month later. Patient-reported outcomes include
      patient-provider communication, pain intensity and interference, attitudes towards and use of
      opioid medication.

      Having completed our formative work, development and refinement of PainApp, the investigators
      will evaluate it in a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a representative
      sample of patients with chronic pain and their HCPs.

      The investigators will conduct a small RCT, including up to 50 patients and 5-15 HCPs.
      Eligible patients will be enrolled online. After informed consent, they will be randomized to
      either Pain-APP or the control group, which will consist of online educational materials
      (TheACPA.org). Patients in both groups will be assessed before, immediately after viewing the
      tool, shortly after the index clinic visit, and 1 month later. Patient-reported outcomes
      include patient-provider communication, pain intensity and interference, physical function,
      and depression (See Table 3). The investigators also include qualitative patient evaluations
      on a sampling (&lt;20%) of patients to capture the full range of its impact and to explore
      potential mechanisms of action. Structured phone interviews, including open-ended questions,
      will assess patient perceptions of the platform, perceptions about how it affected
      communication and decisions making about treatments, trust in their HCP, and self-efficacy.

      HCPs will be surveyed shortly after the patient encounter to assess acceptability of the
      tool, its perceived utility, and its impact on clinical efficiency. Additionally, quality of
      the patient encounter, ease of assessing patients with pain and of making decisions regarding
      treatments to manage that patient's pain will be evaluated using previously developed
      instruments.

      The Study's Main Hypothesis: Compared to control, patients assigned to Pain-APP will have
      better patient-HCP communication.

      Phase I data analyses plan: Multidimensional scaling was used to analyze the Nominal Group
      Technique (NGT) and card sort data. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify
      subgroups of homogeneous strategies. Cognitive maps reflecting different patterns of goals
      and shared decision making (SDM) strategies were developed for patients and HCPs. These
      analyses helped the investigators understand how goals/strategies are viewed and organized by
      our stakeholders, which informed the design of PainApp.

      Phase II data analysis plan: For the RCT, the primary outcomes analyzed will be
      patient-provider communication (COMM), pain (PAIN), and interference (FUNCTION), all of which
      will be treated as continuous.

      The investigators will compare Pain-APP and the control intervention. The investigators will
      adhere to accepted standards. Analysis will be done in 4 stages: The investigators will
      examine 1) whether variables meet expected distributional assumptions; 2) bivariate
      associations between treatment arms and each outcome, and between covariates and outcomes; 3)
      unadjusted measures of effect and potential confounders; 4) exploratory multivariable
      analyses. Patients who are lost to follow-up will be treated according to their assigned
      group (intent to treat analysis). The investigators will use analysis of covariance to assess
      differences in outcomes between assigned groups, adjusting for any baseline differences
      between the randomized comparison groups. Covariates will include baseline health status,
      moderators listed in Table 3, and prescriber characteristics. The investigators will use
      linear mixed-effects models, treating scores at different points in time as repeated measures
      to account for inter-correlation between these measurements. The investigators will control
      for patient- and HCP-level factors by including them as covariates.

      ii) Quantify the amount of change expected: The investigators expect to find, at minimum, a
      20% improvement in communication, comparing the difference in communication pre- post-
      intervention in the Pain-APP group to that of the control group. Power analysis: The
      investigators expect a mean of 70 and a SD of 20. With the proposed sample size of 50 (25 in
      each arm), the investigators estimate having an 80% chance of detecting a 20% improvement on
      the primary outcome COMM at time=T1, with a type-I error rate of 0.05.

    <measure>The 10-item satisfaction with communication subscale of the COMRADE scale</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 days of seeing their HCP</time_frame>
    <description>The the Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision Making Effectiveness (COMRADE ) (Edwards 2003) is a 20 item patient-based outcome measure, with two sub-scales for 'risk communication' and 'confidence in decision'. It is a self-reported measure of patient-provider communication. Scores from the satisfaction with communication subscale are summed to produce a total score for that subscale. A higher score corresponds to higher satisfaction. Maximum score on the subscale is 20, minimum is 0.</description>

    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured using the Decision Self-Efficacy Scale and is a continuous variable. This scale measures self-confidence or belief in one's abilities in decision making, including shared decision making. We use the version with 5 response categories (0=not at all confident), 4=very confident). All items are summed, divided by 11, then multiplied by 25. Scores range from 0 (not at all confident) to 100 (very confident). Higher scores (corresponding to more confidence) is considered to be better.</description>

    <measure>The Control Preference Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after viewing the intervention, just after seeing their HCP</time_frame>
    <description>The control preferences construct is defined as &quot;the degree of control an individual wants to assume when decisions are being made about medical treatment.&quot; It is self-report, using 1-item question. These roles range from the individual making the treatment decisions, through the individual making the decisions jointly with the physician, to the physician making the decisions. Collaborative roles are generally considered preferable to the physician or patient making the decisions alone. The numerical scoring itself is not considered relevant; it is a categorical scale.</description>
