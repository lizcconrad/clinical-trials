  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B(CHB) is a common infectious disease affecting up to 2 billion people
      worldwide. Around 650 thousand people died of liver failure, cirrhosis and primary liver
      cancer caused by chronic hepatitis B every year. Age is the main factor affecting the
      chronicity of hepatitis B, while 90% and 25% to 30% of hepatitis b virus(HBV) infection in
      perinatal and infant period will develop into chronic infection respectively. Whereas the
      proportion in patients above 5 years old is only 5% to 10%. Intestinal microbiota plays an
      important role in maintaining normal physiological function of the intestine and the immune
      function of the body. It has been found that the disorder of intestinal microbiota is
      associated with numerous intestinal and parenteral diseases. Intestinal microbiota
      transplantation(IMT) is a significant method to reconstruct intestinal flora. Recently, the
      relationship between immune response and intestinal microbiota has been claimed. In a
      previous study using IMT to treat HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B patients combined with
      antiviral therapy, 80% of them has reached HBeAg clearance. The investigators propose a
      randomised trial of IMT in patients with chronic hepatitis B combined with antiviral therapy.
      The investigators will assess the serum HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-hepatitis B
      core antigen, the relief of gastrointestinal symptoms, and the fecal microbiota before and
      after IMT. Patients will be randomized to either antiviral therapy or IMT combined antiviral
      therapy over a 26 weeks period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A group of 60 chronic hepatitis B patients combined with antiviral therapy will be recruited
      for study, which involved a 6 times IMT with gastroduodenoscopy and the time interval is
      generally 2 weeks. All participants will keep their present antiviral therapy. All
      participants will be assessed at baseline, after 1 months, 3 months, 6 months from baseline
      in order to evaluate the possible changes in:(1)Decrease of serum hepatitis B virus surface
      antigen(HBsAg) levels(as measured in IU/mL) and hepatitis B virus e antigen(HBeAg) levels(as
      measured in S/CO); (2)Appearance of serum anti-hepatitis B virus surface antigen(anti-HBs)
      and anti-hepatitis B virus e antigen(anti-HBe); (3)Relief of gastrointestinal symptoms:The
      onset and duration of gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed by &quot;Evaluation Score Table
      of Gastrointestinal Symptoms&quot;; (4)Changes of gut microbiota: The changes of gut microbiota
      will be assessed by High-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA) in fecal samples from recruited
      patients before and after IMT.
