  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from evaluating prostate cancer (PCa) biopsy tissue from AA and white patients has led
      to the discovery of alternative splicing as a novel molecular mechanism underlying more
      aggressive PCa in AA men. Coded archival radical prostatectomy tissue specimens and annotated
      clinical data, questionnaire data, and ancestral genotyping data will be obtained from the
      racially diverse and federally funded North Carolina-Louisiana PCa Project (NC-LA PCaP). We
      will use 33 tissue specimens from each of the following 6 groups (n=198 total): white low
      aggressive, white intermediate aggressive, white high aggressive, AA low aggressive, AA
      intermediate aggressive and AA high aggressive. The aforementioned tissues will first be
      screened for tumor content and Gleason grade by a genitourinary pathologist. To identify
      race-related splice variants, RNA will be isolated for targeted sequencing of prioritized
      race-related alternatively spliced genes using the NimbleGen SeqCap Target Enrichment, SeqCap
      RNA System to capture regions of interest and the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform to
      sequence these regions at a depth and coverage sufficient to accurately call alternative
      splicing events.

        The study population includes AA and white male patients having confirmed prostate cancer
        and enrolled in NC-LA PCaP, a population-based, case-only study of prostate cancer in AA
        and white men in NC and LA. Radical prostatectomy specimens will be selected from AA and
        white patients who have consented to NC-LA PCaP and have adequate tumor specimens of
        appropriate aggressiveness banked.
