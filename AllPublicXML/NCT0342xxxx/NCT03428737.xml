  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The weaning of mechanical ventilation is difficult period. This period is particularly
      difficult for patient with obstructive chronic respiratory disease and a long mechanical
      ventilation is associated with an increased risk of infectious complication, cardiac
      dysfunction, muscular weakness or barotromatism. No guideline is available on the ventilator
      mode to use during the night. In weaning period, some studies have demonstrated that
      nocturnal control ventilation during the weaning period improved the quality and the quantity
      of sleep. The hypothesis is that use of nocturnal controlled mechanical ventilation could
      decrease the weaning period duration and the ventilation weaning failure because of a sleep
      improvement.

      The main objective is to compare mechanical ventilation weaning period duration according to
      the nocturnal ventilator mode (pressure controlled ventilation versus pressure support
      ventilation) in patients with an obstructive respiratory disease. A secondary objective is to
      evaluate the rate of weaning failure after the first extubation according to the nocturnal
      ventilator mode and to evaluate the sleep during the weaning period according to the
      nocturnal ventilator mode.
