  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use multilevel multivariable regression analysis to measure the
      association of sex with provision of guideline-based perioperative care for hip fracture
      surgery in Ontario.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2013, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Longterm Care published a 'Quality Based
      Procedures' guideline for care of hip fracture patients. The adjusted association of sex with
      receipt of 5 perioperative processes of care that can be accurately measured in health
      administrative data within this guideline will be investigated.
