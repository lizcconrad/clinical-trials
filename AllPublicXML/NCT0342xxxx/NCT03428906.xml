  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether and how intranasal oxytocin of 8IU treatment will alter the topology
      of functional brain network in resting-state and multiple tasks in healthy males.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo controlled design, healthy male volunteers
      receive intranasal oxytocin or placebo prior to functional magnetic resonance
      imaging.Subjects will then go through a decision making task, a emotion judgement task and an
      eight-minute resting-state scan in MRI scanner to investigate whether and how intranasal
      oxytocin alter the topology of functional brain network in resting-state and multiple tasks
      in healthy males. State anxiety and mood are measured before and after experiment as
      covariates to be controlled.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional network organization alterations in brain under resting state fMRI after drug administration</measure>
    <time_frame>70~85 minutes after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Using seed-based and network level functional connectivity analysis, as well as graph theory analysis , functional network organization in brain under eight minutes resting state will be detected and compared between oxytocin and placebo group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior,brain activities and representation patterns in the emotional judgement task after drug administration</measure>
    <time_frame>60~75 minutes after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Friend or Foe Task is used to measure the verbal versus nonverbal emotional judgement of subjects. Both the response of subjects and the brain activity are recorded in the task. How oxytocin influences the relationship between subjects' behavior and representation pattern of emotional judgement will be investigated through RSA(representation similarity analysis) of brain pattern.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior, dynamics brain activities and networks in the model-based decision making task after drug administration</measure>
    <time_frame>35~60 minutes after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Two-Stage Decision Making Task is used to measure the model-based and model-free decision making process of subjects. The degree of model-based will be calculated by Computational modelling of Subjects' decision making process, and entering as modulation parameter in the OT effect on dynamic brain seed-based and network-based connectivity pattern.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relationship of functional network organization in brain across resting state and task-based fMRI after drug administration</measure>
    <time_frame>60~85 minutes after drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The functional brain activity in resting state, emotional judgement and decision making task will be compared. Both the functional segregation and integration will be measured using graph theory and network connectivity analysis to discover the OT effect on brain network organization across multiple cognitive states.</description>
