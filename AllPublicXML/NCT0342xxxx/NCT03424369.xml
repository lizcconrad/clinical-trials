  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The regular opening of the eustachian tube plays an important role in maintaining normal
      pressure in middle ear cavity, hearing function and preventing the occurrence of middle ear
      inflammation. The current evaluation of Eustachian tube function mainly depends on the
      patient's history of auricular distention, occlusion, physical examination (Valsalva),
      acoustic impedance test. However, these tests can not accurately assess the eustachian tube
      function, the lack of quantitative analysis of eustachian tube function. Currently, surgical
      treatment of patients with chronic otitis media is one of the most important treatment
      methods. However, the current results show that some patients can not reconstruct the
      gas-containing structure of the middle ear after operation, which brings about the treatment
      of diseases and the recovery of auditory function Difficulties. Although domestic and foreign
      scholars believe that eustachian tube function in tympanoplasty in the reconstruction of the
      middle ear with air cavity plays an important role, but due to the lack of a reliable
      quantitative evaluation of eustachian tube function, eustachian tube function in the
      occurrence of chronic otitis media , There is a lack of reliable evidence-based medicine in
      the assessment of the value of development and prognosis. In recent years, a new eustachian
      tube function evaluation method - Eustachian tube manometry technique, began a quantitative
      objective assessment of Eustachian tube function, combined with physical examination and
      subjective symptom scales to conduct a comprehensive assessment of eustachian tube function .
      This study wants to evaluate the eustachian tube function preoperatively and postoperatively
      in patients with chronic otitis media who underwent surgery. Regular postoperative follow-ups
      were used to understand the importance of eustachian tube function in the prognosis of
      chronic otitis media surgery , In order to further improve the eustachian tube function and
      improve the surgical curative effect of chronic otitis media.

        According to the results of Eustachian tube manometry, the patients were divided into two
        groups: Eustachian tube function state and Eustachian tube dysfunction group. The prognosis
        of tympanoplasty was compared, and the eustachian tube function state was defined in
        tympanic cavity of chronic otitis media The value of postoperative recovery.
