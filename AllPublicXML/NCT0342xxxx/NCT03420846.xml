  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Interventional Randomised Controlled study is intended to establish that presurgical
      margin mapping of BCCs with OCT results in a reduction of the number of MMS surgery stages
      without adversely impacting clinical outcome, resulting in shorter patient stays and more
      efficient use of surgical and operating room resources.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignancy in humans. Its incidence is
      continuously increasing. The head and neck areas are most commonly affected due to their
      increased lifetime exposure to sun compared to other body parts. BCC is often treated by
      surgical excision which has high cure rate compared to other treatment modalities, but leaves
      a visible scar which can affect the quality of life of the patient, depending on the location
      and size of the excision. Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) was developed to minimize the size
      of the surgical excision whilst maintaining very high cure rate. The main drawback of MMS is
      that repeated surgery procedures are usually required to eliminate all of the tumour using
      specialist resources located at the clinic.

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) allows non-invasive in-vivo imaging of superficial skin
      lesions. It is in routine clinical use for diagnosis of BCCs, and the diagnostic sensitivity
      and specificity is well established in published multi-centre trials. A further potential
      application of OCT is the pre-surgical mapping of the lateral margins of BCC. If the margins
      of a BCC were accurately known prior to commencing an MMS treatment, the treatment could be
      performed much more quickly, resulting in shorter patient stays and more efficient use of
      surgical and operating room resources. Previously published research has already shown that
      OCT mapping of BCC margins is more accurate than clinical assessment; the objective of the
      present study is to demonstrate that pre-surgical mapping of BCC margins with OCT is also
      more efficient.
