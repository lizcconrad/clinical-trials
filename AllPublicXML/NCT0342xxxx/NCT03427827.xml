      This trial is aimed to investigate whether adjuvant PD-1 antibody treatment could improve
      survival in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this multicenter, randomised controlled, phase 3 trial, patients with stage III-IVA
      (AJCC/UICC 8th system, except T3-4N0 and T3N1) non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to recieve PD-1 antibody for 12 months or observation after
      curative chemoradiation.

             alopecia) will be allowed to enroll.

          -  Has a known history of interstitial lung disease, or (non-infective) pneumonia that
             had required oral or intravenous corticosteroid.

          -  Has any condition that requires long-term systemic corticosteroid (equivalent to
             prednisone &gt; 10mg/d) or immunosuppressive therapy. Inhale or topical use of
             corticosteroid will be allowed.

          -  Prior malignancy except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cervical
             cancer, and papillary thyroid carcinoma.

          -  Has known allergy to large molecule protein products or any compound of study therapy.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy

          -  Has psychiatric drug or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Any other condition, including mental illness or domestic/social factors, deemed by
             the investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed
             consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interferes with the interpretation
             of the results.
