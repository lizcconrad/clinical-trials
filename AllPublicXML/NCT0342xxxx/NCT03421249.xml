    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial using a blind evaluator. Fifty-one
      volunteers were selected from 50 years to 70 years, obeying the following criteria: diagnosis
      of knee OA grade II and III through the radiographic classification of Kellgreen and Lawrence
      1955, Body mass index (BMI) less than 40 kg / m², volunteers should have had knee pain for at
      least six months. All are from the Rehabilitation Sector of Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São
      Paulo (ISCMSP). The subjects were evaluated through a questionnaire developed by the authors
      of the study (Annex I), the Visual Analogue Scale (EVA) (Annex II), then applied to the Lower
      Extremity Functional Scale LEFS (Appendix III) and the Activities of daily living scale ADLs
      (Annex IV). In addition, the evaluation of muscular strength was through dynamometry using
      the Lafayete dynamometer model 01163, which was performed by a blind evaluator regarding the
      group that will belong to each candidate. The muscles tested were: quadriceps, ischiostibial
      and gluteus maximus. The randomization was through 60 brown envelopes divided into A, B, C
      and D, designating the randomness of the sample.

      In addition to the initial evaluation, an evaluation was performed at the end of the tenth
      session and after 3 months of treatment.

      The volunteers underwent a five-week treatment program, totaling 10 sessions, divided into
      four groups, group A - Intervention (INT) underwent knee and hip muscle strengthening
      exercises and electromagnetic field therapy with (Meditea - ARG) using the coplanar
      technique, group B - Exercises (EXE) carried out exercises to strengthen the hip and knee
      muscles in the C - Placebo group (PLA). hip and knee and electromagnetic field therapy with
      the Magnetron® coplanar technique, but with the device switched off and group D - Apparatus
      (APA) only use electromagnetic field therapy with the magnetron® coplanar technique. In the
      present study, there were no significant differences between groups regarding pain, function
      and muscle strength. However, group A obtained better results in the evaluated criteria,
      tending that the combination PEMF and exercises, is an indicated treatment for OA knee.
