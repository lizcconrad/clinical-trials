  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Japanese male healthy volunteers will receive NPF-08. The efficacy of NPF-08 will be assessed
      by intestinal cleaning degree. The safety of NPF-08 will be evaluated based on adverse events
      and adverse drug reactions observed from the date of administration to 7 days after
      administration.
