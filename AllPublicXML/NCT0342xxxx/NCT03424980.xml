  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a real-world non-interventional observational study. The study was designed to
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of clinical treatments in the patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) complicated with brain metastases in clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a real-world non-interventional observational study that focuses to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the patients of advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases diagnosed by medical imaging
      methods. The patients with core medical health records who were enrolled in the clinics from
      2014 to 2017 and were administered with TKIs only or combination therapies of TKIs will be
      included in the study. All the treatments followed real-world clinical practices and
      experiences of clinical physicians.

      The effectiveness will be measured by the treatment effects on brain metastases (objective
      remission rate) and overall survival/progress-free survival. The safety will be evaluated by
      adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital sign, and
      physical examination. The mutation status of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the
      type of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) will be assessed. All the study procedures will be
      in compliance with International Clinical Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP),
      standard operation procedures (SOPs), and regulatory policies/regulations.

          -  The patients with advanced (Clinical stage: Phase IV) non-small cell lung cancer who
             have complete core health medical records (HMRs);

          -  The patients who are observed with brain metastases diagnosed by imaging methods;

          -  The patients who have complete clinical data for diagnosis time of brain metastases,
