  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical care for patients with home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is challenging. Among other
      aspects, the transition from the inpatient to the outpatient setting (discharge management),
      the organization of HPN at home or in a care facility (care management), the expertise
      required to care for patients with HPN and consistent compliance with standards are key to
      the quality of care for patients requiring HPN.

      Hospital patients on parenteral nutrition (PN) to be continued at home are often discharged
      at very short notice. A good interlocking of all players is required to collect and
      distribute the relevant information, to secure proper training for those involved and to have
      all utilities and equipment at hand when the patient arrives.

      This study collects nutritional and clinical parameters (including patient-reported
      parameters) along the continuum of care of HPN patients to evaluate the impact of the quality
      of care of HPN patients on their quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HPN management will be evaluated by using a self-developed patient and a standardized
      quality of life questionnaire.

      Patients will be recruited at the participating hospital by their treating physician before
      discharge and will continue their study participation after discharge.

      The documentation period for the individual patients will be 3 months.

      The questions of the patient´s questionnaire cover areas of interest like: satisfaction with
      discharge management, nutrition, satisfaction with HPN.
