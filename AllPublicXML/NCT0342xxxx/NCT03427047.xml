      Randomized study comparing surgical and economic parameter of Total Knee Arthroplasty
      performed using two different specific surgical techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized 1: ratio study comparing Medacta MyKnee surgical technique using Efficiency single
      use instruments versus Stryker Navigation surgical techniques performed with conventional
      instruments. MyKnee surgical technique patients will receive a CT scan of the surgical knee
      which enables custom manufacturing of the MyKnee cutting blocks. Stryker Navigational
      surgical technique patients will not require a CT scan. Both groups of patients will undergo
      total knee arthroplasty.
