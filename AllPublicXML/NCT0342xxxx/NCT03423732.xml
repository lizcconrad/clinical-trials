  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the CIRCULATE project is to compare the clinical outcomes of CardioCell
      administration in treatment of ischemic damages of cardiovascular system with control group,
      who will be treated by the administration of placebo during the sham procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to enroll 105 patients into N-O CLI trial with randomization into active
      (CardioCell) therapy and sham procedure/placebo administration with 2:1 ratio.

      The primary research question of this project is to check if the administration of CardioCell
      could improve the clinical outcomes in patients with N-O CLI.

      There are several secondary questions, defined by secondary endpoints, e.g.: if the
      investigated treatment is possible to administered, if the investigated treatment is safe in
      each studied indication and way of CardioCell administration, if it is possible to define any
      selected subgroup in which the treatment results are significantly different than in whole
      group.

    <intervention_model_description>The N-O CLI trial will enroll 105 patients with randomization into active and sham therapy with 2:1 ratio.
Additional 5-10 subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive, in a non-blinded fashion, labelled CardioCell to determine the early uptake and retention of IMP in the target ischemic tissues.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be blinded at project start, but may request unblinding if necessary to accommodate effective review of data.
Other than the DSMB (if necessary), the only other &quot;un-blinded parties&quot;, meaning that they will have knowledge as to the patient's treatment assignment, will be the PBTiK UJ CM employee who participates in randomization utilizing randomization lists and investigational medication preparation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in ABI score</measure>
    <time_frame>45 days, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year FU</time_frame>
    <description>Change in ABI score at each trial evaluation point.
The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of the blood pressure at the ankle to the blood pressure in the upper arm and is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure at the ankle by the systolic blood pressure in the arm.
An ABI between and including 0.9 and 1.2 is considered normal, while a lesser than 0.9 indicates peripheral arterial disease. An ABI value of 1.3 or greater is also considered abnormal, and suggests calcification of the walls of the arteries and incompressible vessels. ABI score progression towards the normal range is considered as a better outcome.</description>
