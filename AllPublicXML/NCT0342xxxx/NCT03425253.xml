  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of sequential treatment
      with BELKYRA® (for the treatment of convexity and fullness associated with submental fat) and
      VOLUMA™ (to restore volume along the mandibular border) to enhance the overall contour of the
      jawline.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects may be treated with up to 6 treatments with Belkyra, followed by treatment with
      Voluma. Subjects will have opportunity to participation in a skin biopsy sub-study.

    <measure>Change from baseline to final study visit for CR (Clinician-Reported) Submental Fat Rating Scale (SMFRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The CR-SMFRS score is based on the investigator's clinical evaluation of the participant, where submental fullness is scored on a 5-point ordinal scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = extreme). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to final study visit for PR (Patient-Reported) Submental Fat Rating Scale (SMFRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>The PR-SMFRS is based on the participant's response to the question &quot;How much fat do you have under your chin right now?&quot; and answered on a 5-point ordinal scale (0 = no chin fat at all, 1 = a slight amount of chin fat, 2 = a moderate amount of chin fat, 3 = a large amount of chin fat, and 4 = a very large amount of chin fat). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to final study visit for Submental Skin Laxity Grade (SMSLG) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 58</time_frame>
    <description>SMSLG scale incorporates 3 features: skin wrinkling, adherence to underlying neck structures, and redundancy with 1=none, 2=mild, 3=Moderate and 4=severe.</description>
