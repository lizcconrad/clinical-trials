    <textblock>
      The trial is a multi-centre real-world non-interventional observational study to evaluate
      effectiveness of the surgeries and adjuvant therapies after surgeries in the patients with
      lung malignant tumors via a retrospectively review method on the study data on patient
      demographic/tumor biological characteristics and clinical treatments.
