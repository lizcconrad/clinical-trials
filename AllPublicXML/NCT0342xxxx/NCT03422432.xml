  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators hypothesize that prophylactic HIPEC is feasible and well tolerated in
      patients with colorectal cancers with high-risk of developing peritoneal recurrence.

      The aim of the pilot study is to test the feasibility of performing prophylactic HIPEC for
      colorectal cancer patients at high-risk of developing peritoneal recurrence in our
      institution, and determine the morbidity associated with such a procedure.

      Patients with high-risk of developing peritoneal recurrence are defined as patients with

        1. tumours involving the serosa and adjacent viscera (i.e. T4 cancers)

        2. krukenburg tumours (i.e. ovarian metastases)

        3. perforated tumours

        4. positive peritoneal fluid cytology

        5. minimal synchronous PC (nodules &lt;1cm in the omentum and/or close to the primary tumour).

      The study investigators plan to assess feasibility according to

        1. The number of patients completing the treatment

        2. Time to adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, to evaluate if there is delay to adjuvant
           treatment

      Morbidity will be measured according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification, and graded
      according to low versus high grade morbidity.

      If prophylactic HIPEC is shown to be feasible, with acceptable morbidity, the investigators
      aim to carry out a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of prophylactic
      HIPEC in preventing the development of peritoneal metastases in patients with colorectal
      cancer at high risk of peritoneal recurrence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Two groups of patients may be enrolled:

        Group 1 patients are identified pre-operatively on radiological imaging, while Group 2
        patients are identified post-operative based on histological findings.

        All patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum, and either one of the
        five following risk factors for peritoneal metastases will be considered for inclusion:

          1. T4 tumours - in Group 1, this would consist of obvious clinical T4 stage based on
             preoperative imaging, and in Group 2, this would be on pathological confirmation of a
             T4 tumour.

          2. Krukenburg tumours - Unilateral or bilateral ovarian masses seen on preoperative
             imaging

          3. Perforated tumours - in Group 1, this would consist of patients presenting with
             perforation on preoperative imaging, and undergoing curative resection, and in Group
             2, this would be on pathological or intra-operative confirmation of a perforated
             tumour.

          4. Limited synchronous peritoneal metastases (peritoneal nodules &lt;1cm in the omentum
             and/or close to the tumour). Patients with limited peritoneal disease in close
             proximity to the primary tumour, that may be removed enbloc with the primary resection
             can be included, but patients with more extensive peritoneal disease and those with
             extra-peritoneal metastases i.e. liver and/or lung metastases will be excluded from
             the study.

          5. Positive cytology in Group 2 patients

        Other inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients must be between the ages of 21 and 75 years

          2. Patients must be in a stable clinical condition to undergo simultaneous HIPEC after
             the primary curative colorectal resection

          3. Patients must have an ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          4. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

        i. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L ii. Platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L iii. Haemoglobin &gt;
        9.0g/dl iv. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN v. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt; 3 X institutional ULN vi.
        Creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR vii. Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min for
        patients with creatinine levels &gt;1.5 x institutional UL e. Patients must have a normal
        coagulation profile f. Patients must give written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are not fit to give consent for the procedure

          2. Patients who are not fit to undergo surgery

          3. Patients who are pregnant

          4. Patients who have extensive synchronous peritoneal disease
