      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal conbercept after vitrectomy for the
      management of early-stage proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

      Hypothesis: intravitreal conbercept therapy may promote functional and anatomic recovery from
      PDR. intravitreal conbercept therapy may be a useful and safe method for improving visual
      outcomes of surgery for early-stage PDR.

    <textblock>
      The drug conbercept (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factors) was recently made available
      for management of early prolific diabetic retinopathy, but its safety and efficacy still
      require study. Therefore, the aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal
      conbercept after vitrectomy for the management of early proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy.The patients were randomly assigned (25 eyes each group) to either treatment
      group and control after they provided informed consent. The treatment group received
      intravitreal conbercept (10 mg/mL, 0.5 mg) immediately after surgery, while the control group
      did not.

      At the time of study enrollment, physical examinations, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),
      intraocular pressure and central retinal thickness will be measured and fundoscopy be
      performed.

      The patients are going to be followed up for at least 6 months via BCVA measurement,
      fundoscopy, OCT, physical examinations and postoperative complications

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. We enrolled 50 eyes from 50 patients that were affected by VH as a consequence of
             early active PDR.

          2. Patients with non-clearing VH and fibrocellular proliferation without TRD who
             underwent PPV at Tianjin Medical University Eye Hospital were included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of previous PPV;

          2. Severe intraoperative complications

          3. Postoperative silicone oil tamponade;

          4. Menstruation;
