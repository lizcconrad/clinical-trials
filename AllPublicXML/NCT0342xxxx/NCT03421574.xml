  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of MRgFUS for patients with
      treatment-refractory MDD. This study is designed as a prospective, single arm, nonrandomized
      study. Assessments will be made before and after MRgFUS for adverse events related to
      treatment, for clinical symptom relief, and quality of life (QoL). The target in the brain
      chosen for ablation will be the anterior limb of the internal capsule (i.e 'capsulotomy').

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Safety of the ExAblate transcranial treatment will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of procedure related complications from the treatment day visit through the 12-month post-treatment time point. All events that are not procedure related will also be captured and recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life will be measured using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Q-LES-Q) is a self-report measure designed to enable investigators to easily obtain sensitive measures of the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning. The minimum raw score on the Q-LES-Q-SF is 14, and the maximum score is 70.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical efficacy will be measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD is designed to rate the severity of depression in patients. 0-7 = Normal 8-13 = Mild Depression 14-18 = Moderate Depression 19-22 = Severe Depression
≥ 23 = Very Severe Depression</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical efficacy will be measured using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item clinician-administered scale, designed to be particularly sensitive to antidepressant treatment effects in patients with major depression. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Ratings can be added to form an overall score (range 0 to 50); no weights are used. Cut-off points include: 0 to 6 - symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 30 to 34 - moderate, 35 to 60 - severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical efficacy will be measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>BDI is a self-rated depression scale. 1-10:These ups and downs are considered normal;11-16: Mild mood disturbance; 17-20: Borderline clinical depression; 21-30: Moderate depression; 31-40: Severe depression; over 40: Extreme depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical efficacy will be measured using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation rating scale created by researchers at Columbia University to evaluate suicidality in children ages 12 and up.[1] It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot;</description>

    <description>Focused Ultrasound allows for non-invasive thermal ablation of soft tissue virtually anywhere in the body. Treatment begins by acquiring a series of magnetic resonance (MR) images of the target tissue. The physician then reviews the images on the system workstation, identifies the target, delineates treatment contours, and reviews the treatment plan. Therapy planning software calculates the parameters required to effectively treat (e.g. ablate) the defined region. During treatment, the patient wears a helmet equipped with multiple sources of ultrasound which generate a point of focused energy, called a sonication. The sonication raises the tissue temperature within a well-defined region, causing a thermal coagulation effect.</description>
