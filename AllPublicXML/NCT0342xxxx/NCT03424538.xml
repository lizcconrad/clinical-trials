      Abstract Introduction: Postural control disorders are the most common motor disorder
      associated with multiple sclerosis.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the potential for improvement of postural
      control, motion performance and quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis who are
      performing a special neurorevolutionary balancing program.

      Intervention: The treated group (n = 15) performed five times a week for the treatment we
      defined. (60 minutes per day). The experimental group performed movements using the Xbox 360
      and Kinect consoles. The study team participated in 25 sessions, five times a week. The
      duration of treatment was 5 weeks.The MStp group (n=14) participated in a 5-week
      physiotherapy course. The general treatment consisted of strengthening, stretching and
      walking correction. During the 5-week period, 25 patients attended training. One treatment
      takes 60 minutes. Sensory Organisation Test / Body Sway at the end of the baseline and
      treatment protocol is used to evaluate each patient. The quality of life mapping was measured
      by subjective tests (EQ-5D-5L, ADL). To assess the depressive state, a Beck depression
      questionnaire was used. Balance and motion performance were used by the Berg Balance Test and
      6Minutes Walk Test. The results were compared with the control group results (n = 14) and
      showed improvement in overall balance and motion performance.

    <intervention_model_description>The single-arm, 5-week intervention is monitor every day on the effect of postural control on walking performance, balance and quality of life. The intervention team (n = 15) takes 25 training sessions for 5 weeks. Every move takes 60 minutes to continuously increase the load intensity of the X-box program. Before each intervention started, the patients perform a 10 minute warm-up and the drainage exercises are 15 minutes stretching exercises. The MStp group (n=14) participated in a 5-week physiotherapy course. The general treatment consisted of strengthening, stretching and walking correction. During the 5-week period, 25 patients attended training. One treatment takes 60 minutes. The control group (n = 14) did not receive physiotherapeutic treatment outside the medication.</intervention_model_description>
