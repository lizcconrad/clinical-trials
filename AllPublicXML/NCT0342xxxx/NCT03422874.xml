      This is an open label, dose escalation, phase I study of the combination of MLN9708 MLN9708
      plus Nelfinavir. It will use a 3+3 cohort design to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      the combination, which will be defined as the highest dose cohort where &lt; 1/6 patients
      develop a dose limiting toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose cohort will be expanded to have
      at least 6 patients with biopsiable tumors who undergo pretreatment and post treatment tumor
      biopsies for molecular pharmacodynamic markers.

    <time_frame>Approximately 1 year to establish MTD</time_frame>
    <description>If 0/3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity, 3 patients will be treated at the next dose level. If dose limiting toxicity attributable to the study drug(s) is experienced in exactly 1/3 patients, 3 more patients (for a total of 6) will be treated at that dose level. If no additional dose limiting toxicity is observed at the expanded dose level (i.e. 1/6 with dose limiting toxicity), the dose will be escalated. Escalation will terminate as soon as two or more patients experience any dose limiting toxicity attributable to the study drug(s), at a given dose level. If 2 or more dose limiting toxicities are observed in any cohort, no further escalation will take place, and the Maximum Tolerated Dose will have been exceeded.</description>

    <description>Both Nelfinavir and MLN9708 will be given orally (by mouth). MLN9708 will be given as 3 mg orally twice weekly. Study drugs will be administered on 21-day treatment cycles. All cycles are 21 days.
During the first cycle of MLN9708 only will initially be administered orally at a fixed dose of 3mg twice weekly for 2 weeks, on Mondays and Thursdays during this treatment cycle. During the third week there will be no study combination drug therapy(for Cycle 1 only). During Cycles 2 and 3, MLN9708 administered twice weekly on Mondays and Thursdays for the first 2 weeks of Cycles 2 and 3. Nelfinavir (escalating cohorts [1250mg, 1875mg, 2500mg, 3125mg]) will be administered orally twice daily in the dose cohorts listed.</description>

    <description>Nelfinavir is an oral HIV protease inhibitor approved by FDA in 1997, now available in generic form. It has a well established safety profile in HIV patients when administered at the recommended dose of 1250 mg PO BID. Nelfinavir was shown to induce ER stress in cancer cell lines and xenograft tumors leading to apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition.</description>
