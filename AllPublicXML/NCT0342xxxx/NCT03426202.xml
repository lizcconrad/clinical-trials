  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine whether a single dose of modafinil (200mg, p.o.) can affect
      feedback-based learning and interference processing in healthy male subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on previous animal and human research suggesting a catecholamine-mediated, potentially
      pro-cognitive, mechanism of action of modafinil, the present study seeks to explore effects
      of modafinil on feedback-based learning and interference processing in healthy subjects. To
      this end, the present randomized double-blind, between-subject, placebo-controlled
      pharmaco-fMRI experiment plans to determine the behavioral and neural effects of a single
      dose of p.o.modafinil (200mg) versus placebo on validated feedback-based learning and
      emotional/non-emotional cognitive conflict paradigms. To control for potential effects of
      pre-medication personality traits as well as effects of modafinil on subjective task
      performance, subjects will be administered pre-treatment assessing relevant personality
      traits and post-treatment assessments of meta-cognitive confidence estimation.
