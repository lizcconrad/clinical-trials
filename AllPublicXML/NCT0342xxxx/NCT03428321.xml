  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous thermoablation in an effective local curative treatment in patients with
      cirrhosis and HCC smaller than 3 cm in diameter (BCLC 0-A).

      Around 30% of HCC patients referred for percutaneous ablation were regarded as non-feasible
      because of a difficult-at risk location or undetectable nodules.

      We used percutaneous thermoablation to treat HCC on high risk locations (subcapsular or liver
      dome) with or without lipiodol marked (for undetectable HCC).

      No clinical study has been published so far to compare percutaneous thermoablation of HCC on
      liver dome CT guided with artificial pneumothorax and lipiodol marked, and percutaneous
      thermoablation of HCC guided by ultrasonography (non subcapsular, distent form diaphragm).

      This retrospective study evaluate the overall survival, the local tumor progression or
      distant liver progression after percutaneous ablation for HCC and determine prognostic
      factors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed 245 percutaneous thermoablations on 150 patients for HCC between January 2015
      and September 2017.

      All thermoablation procedures were performed percutaneously under ultrasound or CT guidance,
      with ou without artificial pneumothorax or ascites, with ou without lipiodol marked.

      Purposes:

        -  Tumor response upon mRECIST criteria

        -  Progression-free survival

        -  Overall survival

        -  Local tumor progression

        -  Distent liver progression

        -  Prognostic factors
