  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural killer (NK) cells are leukocytes of the innate immune system and play a central role
      in the control of cancer metastases. NK cells and other innate immune cells often do not
      function well in patients with cancer and are also profoundly suppressed after cancer
      surgery. Dr. Auer's Lab and others have shown that NK cells are critically important in the
      clearance of tumor metastases and that their impairment can be recovered with immune therapy
      augmenting the innate immune system. Several studies suggest that cancer patients have
      depressed NK cell cytotoxicity as compared to healthy controls but that following resection
      of the cancer, NK cell cytotoxicity returns to normal levels. In this observational study,
      the investigators will measure NK cell cytotoxicity by the gold standard method (51Cr, a
      chromium51 release assay) and by a new interferon-ɣ (IFN-ɣ) based assay (NK-Vue™) in healthy
      humans and colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery patients seen a The Ottawa Hospital. The results
      of this study will determine if the NK-Vue™ is able to discriminate between healthy human
      volunteers and newly diagnosed cancer patients and is sufficiently sensitive to detect
      transient NK cell suppression immediately following surgery.

      Rationale:

      The purpose of this program is to obtain consent for and to outline the process for
      collection of fresh blood sample from healthy humans and colorectal cancer patients before
      and after surgical resection.

      Procurement of fresh human blood is required for the following:

        -  To compare NK cell function, measured by two different assays, in healthy humans and
           newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients at the Ottawa Hospital.

        -  To compare NK cell function, measure by two different assays in colorectal surgery
           patients preoperatively and at various time points postoperatively.

      Patient and healthy donor blood was drawn at indicated time points into BD Vacutainer Sodium
      Heparin coated tubes (~30mL/blood draw) and processed within 4 hrs. 1 mL of whole blood was
      aliquoted into vacutainer tubes containing PromocoaTM and from the remaining whole blood
      sample peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll density
      centrifugation prior to cryopreservation in freezing media (10% DMSO and 90% FBS).
