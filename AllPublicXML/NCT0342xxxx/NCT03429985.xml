    <textblock>
      While existing teen pregnancy prevention efforts have contributed to significant declines in
      the overall U.S. teen pregnancy rate, teen pregnancy prevention programs specifically
      targeting adolescent males are limited and sorely needed. The primary aim of the proposed
      research is to further develop, evaluate, and disseminate a teen pregnancy prevention program
      specifically designed for adolescent males to enhance the current scientific evidence and
      intervention options available for broad public health implementation. The proposed
      intervention Fathers Raising Responsible Men (FRRM) focuses on the adolescent male component
      of teen pregnancy by identifying and addressing adolescent risk and paternal protective
      behaviors specific to adolescent males that have not been fully addressed in previous
      prevention efforts. This study strives to reduce adolescent male sexual risk behavior through
      targeting African American and Latino adolescent males aged 15-19 and their fathers residing
      in the South Bronx, specifically Mott Haven and surrounding areas in three phases. Phase I is
      a pilot study consisting of eight dyads (fathers and sons) to test and refine the
      intervention and technical and training assistance needs. Phase II is the Randomized Control
      Trial (RCT) comprised of 500 dyads to rigorously evaluate the intervention. Finally, in Phase
      III the intervention will be refined and the intervention materials will be available to the
      general public, while findings will be widely disseminated. These three phases allow for the
      successful implementation and evaluation of FRRM in conjunction with the refinement and
      provision of all training and technical assistance necessary for the intervention. If
      successful, the proposed project will further develop the current scientific evidence and
      intervention options targeted specifically to the teen pregnancy prevention needs of African
      American and Latino adolescent males.

    <textblock>
      FRRM is a male-focused intervention designed to reduce adolescent male sexual risk behavior
      through supporting father-son communication about sex and condoms. The goals of the program
      are to reduce the number of unprotected sex acts among adolescent males through (1) improved
      knowledge about correct and consistent condom use, (2) increased sexually transmitted
      infection (STI) testing, and (3) increased utilization of sexual and reproductive health
      services.

      The program consists of two 60 to 90 minute intervention sessions delivered to the father by
      project staff. Both intervention sessions should happen within the first month following the
      baseline interview. The first intervention session focuses on motivating fathers to
      communicate with their sons about sex and condom use, and the second session provides fathers
      with the skills and knowledge necessary to teach their sons about correct condom use. In
      addition, fathers receive guidance on effective adolescent monitoring and supervision and
      strengthening their relationship quality with their adolescent son. Intervention staff
      provide fathers with a FRRM Workbook and Toolkit, as well as a condom demonstration video
      that outlines the important steps for correct and consistent condom use. Fathers will use
      these materials to communicate with their adolescent sons as well as teach correct condom use
      and how best to access sexual and reproductive health services.
