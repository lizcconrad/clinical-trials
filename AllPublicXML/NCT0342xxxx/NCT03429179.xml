  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremities surgery in orthopedics mostly adopt spinal anesthesia, it is characterized
      by fewer complications in central nervous system, good analgesic effect, less drug use and
      the exact effect of anesthesia. And it is especially suitable for the elder patients with
      complicated preoperative complications, poor tolerance to narcotic drugs, and narrow range of
      tolerating circulation fluctuations. But because the patients are awake during the operation,
      the surgical stimulation and psychological stress can aggravate the fear and anxiety of the
      preoperative anxiety patients which would make patients suffer from postoperative sleep
      disorder and a variety of complications. The purpose of this paper is to observe after using
      butorphanol for sedation in the operation, the correlation between the degree of preoperative
      anxiety and the time of achieving satisfactory sedation during the operation and meanwhile
      observe the correlation between the degree of preoperative anxiety and postoperative sleep
      quality of patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 cases of patients undergoing spinal anesthesia during lower extremities surgery in
      orthopedics American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status Ⅰ-Ⅱ, male or female,
      age between 18 and 80 years old. The Amsterdam preoperative anxiety and information scale
      (APAIS) and The Athens Insomnia Scale(AIS) are used evaluate the preoperative anxiety and
      sleep quality of the patients. After the completion of spinal anesthesia puncture operation,
      an load dose infusion butorphanol 15μg/kg was infused and 7.5μg/kg/h to maintain, the time
      when Ramsay sedation score reach 4 ,total dose of butorphanol , sedative effects and
      intraoperative adverse reactions were recorded. And reassess postoperative sleep quality of
      patients 24 hours after the operation.
