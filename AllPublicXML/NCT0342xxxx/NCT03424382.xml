  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study occurs in two phases. Phase 1 involves initial item development and measurement
      validation of a new tool for identifying hospitalized patients at high risk for preventable
      readmission. Primary tasks include item construction and content validation, data collection,
      analysis, and instrument refinement. Phase 2 involves administering the refined instrument to
      a new group of patients to determine final item content for the instrument, its factor
      structure, and its predictive validity.

      Participants will complete the instrument on an electronic device provided by research staff
      in the hospital room. If an individual is unable to complete the instrument, the participant
      may have another individual input answers on the electronic device. Hospitalized patients (n
      = 1240: 620 in Phase 1 and 620 in Phase 2) with a variety of chronic diseases will be
      recruited into the study. Study coordinators will recruit participants with the following
      diagnoses: heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute myocardial infarction,
      coronary artery bypass graft, pneumonia, total knee or hip replacement, and stroke. These
      diagnoses were chosen because of the frequency with which patients are readmitted after
      discharge.
