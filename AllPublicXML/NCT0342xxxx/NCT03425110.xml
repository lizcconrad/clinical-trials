      The Modified Ketogenic Diet for the Treatment of Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy in Adults: an
      Observational Cohort Study

    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a common neurological condition. Unfortunately, just over 30% of patients with
      epilepsy (PWE) do not become seizure free with anti-epileptic drugs. Some patients may be
      suitable for epilepsy surgery. Alternative established treatments include vagal nerve
      stimulation and the ketogenic diet in children. The evidence base for the use of ketogenic
      diet in adults is limited. There are a few prospective studies and no randomised control
      trial to date.

      This study is a prospective observational cohort study for adult patients with drug resistant
      epilepsy who are not suitable for resective epilepsy surgery. The intervention is a modified
      ketogenic diet. The carbohydrate load will be between 20-30gm per day. Blood ketones and
      blood sugars will be monitored. The primary outcome measure is seizure frequency at 12
      months. There are a number of secondary outcome measures including tolerability, seizure
      severity, quality of life, lipid profiles and health care utilisation.

        The study will have no formal inclusion/exclusion criteria as it is purely observational
        and it will be the clinical team's decision as to whether or not people are seen by the
        dietary clinic based on established dietary clinic protocols.
