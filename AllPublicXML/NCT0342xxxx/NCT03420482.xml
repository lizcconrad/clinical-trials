  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common complication of advanced liver disease is a condition called hepatic encephalopathy,
      which leads to confusion. The current treatment options cause side effects, are costly, and
      do not always work. An abnormal population of bacteria in the intestines may be causing this
      condition, and transplanting bacteria from the colon of a healthy person may treat it. In
      this research study, the investigators will first find two healthy stool donors whose stool
      donation improves the gut bacteria of patients with advanced liver disease and helps them
      think more clearly. Then, in a randomized controlled trial, the investigators will compare
      the ability of stool donation from these two best donors versus a placebo to improve the
      neurological function of patients with advanced liver disease. If the investigators find the
      expected results, there will be a new effective therapy for patients with advanced liver
      disease and the very troublesome complication of hepatic encephalopathy.

    <textblock>
      Decades of investigation demonstrate that hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a common complication
      of cirrhosis characterized by impaired cognition, develops as a consequence of intestinal
      microbial products reaching the brain. Recent investigation has found that cirrhotic
      patients, especially those who have developed HE, have intestinal dysbiosis compared to
      normal controls. Several plausible mechanisms explain how intestinal dysbiosis could lead to
      HE. There is limited prior literature on the efficacy of FMT in cirrhosis. The largest
      documented study of 10 cirrhotic patients receiving a single FMT enema found no significant
      change in microbiome diversity as assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The investigators
      hypothesize that aggressive manipulation of the microbial composition with fecal microbiota
      transplant (FMT) will improve neurological function in patients with a history of cirrhosis
      and HE. The investigators additionally hypothesize that five oral FMT capsule administrations
      from a previously efficacious stool donor will significantly change the intestinal microbiome
      composition of a cirrhotic patient. The study will consist of a 10-patient open-label pilot
      study to identify efficacious stool donors, defined as donors who precipitate the largest
      improvement in recipient neurological function and microbiome composition. The two most
      efficacious pilot study stool donors will be selected to donate stool for the randomized
      controlled trial (RCT). The 20-patient RCT will investigate the effect of FMT on neurological
      outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and a history of HE. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive 5 doses of oral FMT capsules or placebo capsules over 21 days. Cognitive testing and
      stool collections will occur at 4 time points, to assess for changes in neurological function
      and microbiome composition. The primary outcome is change in neurological function after FMT.
      The main secondary outcome is change in microbiome composition after FMT. This study could
      provide valuable information about the ability of FMT to improve intestinal dysbiosis in
      cirrhosis and treat HE.

    <time_frame>Before the first administration of FMT (day 0) and one week after the last administration of FMT (day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHES is a validated assessment tool specifically designed for HE trials to test cognitive and psychomotor processing speed and visuomotor coordination. The PHES is a battery of 5 pencil-paper tests, completed in 15-20 minutes. The primary outcome is the change in PHES score from immediately before FMT to 1 week after the last dose of FMT.</description>

    <time_frame>Adverse event reporting will take place on day 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, then 1, 4 weeks after the last FMT administration.</time_frame>

    <description>The Stroop Test evaluates psychomotor speed and cognitive flexibility by the interference between recognition reaction time to a colored field and a written color name. A smartphone application software called &quot;EncephalApp Stroop Test&quot; will be used, validated to identify cognitive dysfunction in cirrhosis and screen for covert hepatic encephalopathy.</description>

    <time_frame>Before the first administration of FMT (day 0) and one week after the last administration of FMT (day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a highly utilized quality of life questionnaire. There are 8 health concepts assessed by the survey, which includes physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. Each of these health concepts is scored on a scale from 0 to 100. 0 is considered the worst outcome and 100 is considered the most favorable health state on each subscale. There will be no total or summed score.</description>
