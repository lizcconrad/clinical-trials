  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective was to conduct a 5 year; multi-center, observational follow-up study
      enrolling infants born to mothers who participated in the MOTOR clinical trial to determine
      the effects of maternal periodontal therapy during pregnancy on neonatal morbidity and
      mortality and whether this will result in lower incidence of functional neurological
      impairment.

      A total of 525 infants where planned to be enrolled at the 3 performance sites. The number of
      infants enrolled at each site depended on past Motor recruitment rates, and the observed
      delivery rate of high risk babies at that site. Infants were enrolled from both the high risk
      and low risk groups. The intended sample size was fixed, over sampling among the low risk
      group and was used to assure the sample size.

      The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) identified and provided each clinical site with
      participant listings of all MOTOR high risk births and a randomly ordered sample of low risk
      births for enrollment into the study.

      Mothers where approached by MOTOR or MOTORkids personnel to ascertain participant interest in
      enrolling their infant. Once consent was obtained, infants were followed and tracked until
      scheduled for the follow-up exams at age 24 months +/- 2 months adjusted age.

        A total of 525 infants are planned to be enrolled at the 3 performance sites. The number of
        infants enrolled at each site will depend on their past Motor recruitment rates, and the
        observed delivery rate of high risk babies at that site. Infants will be enrolled from both
        the high risk and low risk group. This rate of enrollment is expected to vary by 10% to 20%
        across the sites. It is expected that sites will enroll 3-6 infants a month over a 3 year
        period. The intended sample size is fixed, over sampling among the low risk group will be
        used to assure the sample size.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All infants born to mothers enrolled to MOTOR study prior to 35 weeks gestational age,

          -  All small for gestational age (SGA) infants and all infants born after 37 weeks
             gestation and who were appropriate for gestational age are eligible for enrollment.

          -  All infants born &lt; 34 weeks gestation and all SGA infants will be considered a high
             risk infant and will be recruited for enrollment.

          -  Appropriate weight for gestational age infants born after 37 weeks will be considered
             low risk infants and a random sample of these infants will be recruited for
             enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Only a random sample of the low risk group will be recruited.
