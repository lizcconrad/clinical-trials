  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is going to research the hypothesis that to strengthen the comprehensive treatment
      of perioperative anesthesia is possible to improve the prognosis of patients with hip
      fracture and reduce mortality. This is a randomized controlled pilot study aimed to elderly
      patients with hip fracture on one side and needing surgical treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of perioperative anesthesia care bundle on prognosis in elderly
      undergoing hip fracture surgery; to assess the levels of compliance that current anesthesia
      management strategy of our hospital against the new &quot;guidelines&quot;; and to analyze the defects
      in the current anesthesia management strategy and collect data for further multi-center
      research, this single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted. The central
      stochastic system was adopted to determined the stratification factors by age, POSSUM score,
      whether there was tracheal intubation or laryngeal mask auxiliary ventilation. Therefore,
      there are two groups including the new version of &quot;guidelines&quot; anesthesia strategy group and
      existing anesthesia strategy group at a ratio of 1:1. The mortality is the primary indicator
      will be collected in 1,6,12 months after surgery. And VAS score, MMSE, length of hospital
      stay and so forth, which would be collected as the secondary indicators.
