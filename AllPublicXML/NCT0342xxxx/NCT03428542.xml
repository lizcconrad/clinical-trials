  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the benefits of yoga as a 'mind-body' practice, by measuring it's
      effects on health-related psychological and physiological variables. The study also aims to
      investigate whether an association exists between subjective (psychological) and objective
      (physiological) measures, with a particular focus on stress as the primary outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress and worry in everyday life are common features of Western society. Stress is a
      biological mechanism tapping the fight-or-flight-response via activation of the sympathetic
      nervous system. When exposed to stress during prolonged periods of time, the immune system is
      affected, leading to physiological as well as psychosocial problems. The consequences of
      untreated high stress can not only turn into reduced job capacity, and work roles conflicts,
      but also into cardiovascular disease, and mental illness such as an anxiety disorder or/and
      depression.

      One common and recommended strategy to manage stress is to exercise regularly. Yoga is an
      umbrella term for a wide variety of physical, mental, and spiritual practices with its roots
      in ancient India. Most previous research on the health effects of yoga has demonstrated
      benefits on psychological health factors including mental stress, anxiety, depression and
      sleep problems.

      The aim of the study is thus to investigate the effects of two types of yoga intervention on
      psychological and physiological health.
