  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole as an adjunctive treatment with mood
      stabilizer for the treatment of patients (outpatients or inpatients) with type I or II
      bipolar disorder accompanied by major depressive episode, without any psychotropic features.

      This study involves patients who are considered by the investigator not to have a proper
      improvement, despite receiving a mood stabilizer (lithium or valproic acid) for a sufficient
      (≥ 28 days) period of time during the current depressive episode.
