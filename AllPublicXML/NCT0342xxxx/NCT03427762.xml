  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness and specificity of agility and
      cycling exercise training on balance and mobility outcomes in PD and age and gender matched
      healthy controls. The hypothesis is that due to being profoundly deconditioned, agility and
      cycling will be similarly effective in PD but agility will be more effective then cycling in
      healthy old adults, in improving mobility and balance.
