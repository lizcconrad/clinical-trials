  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial the investigators will evaluate an alternate treatment option, which
      was developed for teeth with incomplete roots, called Regenerative Endodontic Procedure
      (REP). This treatment works by harnessing the blood clot formed within the root canal from
      tissues surrounding the root as a scaffold for stem cells. These cells could help to increase
      the thickness and length of the root canal walls resulting in root end maturation.

      Results from the 50 participants who will receive the REP treatment will be compared with
      findings with historical data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will be prospectively assigned to the REP treatment group. Results from the
      treatment group will be compared to historical controls of all subjects treated by Ca(OH)2 or
      MTA apexification in the last 10 years (2007-2017) at the Boston University Henry M Goldman
      School of Dental Medicine.

      All materials used in this protocol are FDA approved and commercially available for similar
      applications. This study does not seek a new use or application of any materials, instead
      recommendations of the American Association of Endodontists (AAE) will be followed to
      evaluate outcomes associated with the REP compare to the standard of care Ca(OH)2 or MTA
      apexification.

      The overall objective for this research is the elimination of any clinical symptoms and the
      evidence of bony healing as examined by radiographs.

      Other objectives include increased root wall thickness and/or increased root length and
      positive response to vitality testing, which if achieved, could indicate a more organized
      vital pulp tissue.

    <description>All participants in this single arm study will receive Regenerative Endodontic Procedure (REP). It regenerates the root tip on recently erupted permanent teeth that did not complete root development due to pulp infection and necrosis by allowing cells to migrate from the surrounding periapical tissue and enter the pulp space. Cells contained within the intentional bleeding create at the root tip help in root completion as well as increasing the thickness of the canal walls over up to two years following the procedure.</description>

    <description>Regenerative Endodontic Procedure (REP) involves disinfection of the root canal with the use of acombination of three antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, minocycline. At the second visit, the patient is evaluated for resolution of signs or symptoms of an acute infection and if none then bleeding is induced, the site covered with a plug and the patient is evaluated at follow up.</description>
