  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial with dose-escalation stage and dose-expansion stage is the first-in-human
      study of FCN-411, a drug being developed for treatment of advanced cancers. The initial
      purpose of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FCN-411 monotherapy in EGFR-positive mutation non-small cell lung
      cancer chinese patients. The study will also provide early information on how the body
      handles the drug (pharmacokinetics) and on the anti-tumor activities of FCN-411.
