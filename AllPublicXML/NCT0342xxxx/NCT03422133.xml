  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people have inpatient surgery each day. Most people will have no complications but some
      will have minor or serious complications. The risk of having complications can vary from one
      person to another depending on personal factors such as; age, medical conditions such as
      diabetes and whether someone smokes or takes certain medications.

      The Investigators have learned that people want more information about their surgeries, both
      the general information about the risk for complications, but also more specific information
      about whether they are personally more or less likely to have complications. Patients are
      also interested in practical information such as how long they might stay in the hospital and
      what the recovery period will be like for them. Receiving more information can help decrease
      a person's level of anxiety about their surgery.

      The Investigators are doing this study with the assistance of the mHealth Lab at The Ottawa
      Hospital (a team that develops simple technologies for managing health information). The
      Investigators will implement and evaluate a novel, innovative tablet-based, patient-oriented
      risk communication application to evaluate patient knowledge of their own surgical risk
      before and after their visit to the Pre-Admission Unit (PAU). The Investigators will also be
      exploring any potential levels of anxiety before and after the PAU visit, in addition to
      patient satisfaction with their PAU visit.

      The Investigators hypothesize that it will: improve patient knowledge and experience, not
      increase anxiety, be acceptable to patients and clinicians, and will improve care efficiency
      for TOH surgical patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One and a half million Canadians have inpatient surgery every year, and many experience
      serious complications. Research shows that patient-specific risks are not routinely or
      effectively communicated to patients before surgery, despite the requirement for such
      information to be included as part of the informed consent process, and clear recommendations
      from best practice guidelines.

      Mobile health technology can address this gap by engaging and empowering patients to provide
      their own health data to generate personalized risk estimates. Using a tablet-based platform,
      these risk estimates can then be communicated to patients in a format that is appealing and
      understandable. However, such an application and process do not exist.

      The Investigators will address this knowledge gap through the development, implementation,
      and evaluation of a novel patient-oriented personalized preoperative risk communication
      eHealth application to empower patients, support shared decision making, and improve
      patient-centered outcomes. Development of this eHealth application will lead to an
      inclusively designed product tailored to the technology needs of elective surgery patients,
      who are typically older, and have limited technological expertise and comfort. The
      application will also be useful, in that it will communicate personalized risk estimates in a
      format consistent with best practices for risk communication to patients, and provide tools
      to engage shared discussions between patients and clinicians. Through implementation of the
      eHealth app, the Investigators will evaluate the effectiveness and value of personalized
      preoperative risk communication in improving knowledge, and satisfaction. The Investigators
      will also measure the acceptability of this process to patients and clinicians. Finally, the
      Investigators will test the feasibility of having a patient-oriented personalized risk
      communication application connect to the perioperative health system to identify high
      resource use patients prior to hospital admission.

    <description>The application features simple and consistent design, large well-lit buttons that tolerate tremor, and simple language. The process will be applied in preoperative clinics at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH), where patients will be asked to provide their personal health history through a series of questions already used on our TOH preoperative health screener. These values will then populate the NSQIP Universal Risk Calculator, which we have calibrated to TOH data, to generate personalized risks of mortality, serious complications, and hospital length of stay. These risk estimates will be communicated directly to the patient using absolute risk estimates represented pictorially (best practice for risk communication to patients). Risk estimates will also be provided to the patient's clinician.</description>
