  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prebiotics have been linked to increased calcium absorption in animal and human studies
      (particularly in adolescents and in premenopausal women). Similarly, probiotics have been
      found to benefit calcium homeostasis in pregnant women, and to promote bio-mineralization in
      animal models. The effect of symbiotic on calcium absorption has been tested in rats, but not
      in human studies. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of daily
      consumption of a functional symbiotic yogurt containing inulin and Lactobacillus rhamnosus
      compared to a control yogurt, on calcium absorption in young adult women. A secondary
      objective is to relate changes in calcium absorption following yogurt consumption, with
      calcium metabolism, vitamin D status, bone mass, calcium intake and overall composition of
      habitual diet.

      A potential strategy to reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life is to promote optimal
      bone mass during early adulthood by including in the diet functional foods that maximize the
      efficiency of calcium absorption. This approach is specially important in women because of
      their greater risk for osteoporosis than men. In this study, we hypothesized that the daily
      consumption of a yogurt containing inulin and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (symbiotic yogurt)
      increases the efficiency of calcium absorption in young adult women when compared to daily
      consumption of a yogurt of similar composition but without prebiotic or probiotic (control
      yogurt). Subjects in this study will be randomly assigned to consume daily the symbiotic
      yogurt or the control yogurt during two 3-week periods with a wash-out period of 3-weeks, in
      a cross-over design. Calcium absorption will be measured by stable calcium isotope
      methodology. Bone mass (BMD, BMC) will be measured by dual-Y ray absorptiometry. Serum intact
      parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and dietary intake will be measured by conventional
      methods.
