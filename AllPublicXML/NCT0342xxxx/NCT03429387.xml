  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute leukaemia requiring induction or consolidation chemotherapy and those
      requiring a haematopoietic stem cell transplant are at high risk of fever and infection when
      they have low white cell counts (neutropenic fever). The causes of neutropenic fever are
      frequently unknown and patients are treated with broad antibiotics, without a clear target to
      what is being treated.

      This study will prospectively enroll patients who are receiving chemotherapy for acute
      leukaemia or for a stem cell transplant and compare the diagnostic utility of bacterial and
      fungal PCR performed directly off blood drawn, to the standard blood culture. Patients who
      have persistent fever after 72 hours of antibiotics will then be randomized to have either
      the interventional scan (PET/CT) or the conventional scan (standard CT) to look for a source
      of infection. Diagnostic yield, change in management and outcomes will be compared between
      arms.
