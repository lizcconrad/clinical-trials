      A Prospective, observational, single center diagnostic study to investigate the the
      diagnostic agreement between QFR and the pressure wire-based iFR in a real world setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During coronary angiography, intermediate stenoses can not be adequately assessed by visual
      assessment alone. It is necessary to evaluate the functional significance to guide their
      treatment.

      Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is the current gold standard for determining this functional
      significance but its adoption in clinical practice remains low. The instantaneous wave-free
      ratio (iFR) is an alternative way to determine the flow-limiting characteristics of a
      coronary stenosis with a pressure wire but without the need to induce hyperemia. Large
      randomised trials have confirmed the non-inferiority of iFR in respect to FFR in terms of
      outcome.

      Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR) is another new method for evaluating the functional
      significance of coronary stenosis It is a software-based analysis of conventional
      angiographic images to estimate the pressure drop caused by a coronary stenosis. The
      diagnostic agreement with FFR seemed promising in the FAVOR Pilot Study and a larger trial is
      enrolling for confirmation.

      A stepwise approach of QFR and iFR could make the functional assessment of intermediate
      stenoses more practical and cost-effective. However before being used as a combination in
      daily practice, QFR has to be validated in respect to iFR.

      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the diagnostic agreement between QFR and
      the pressure wire-based iFR in a real world setting

    <description>iFR® (CE-Marked) is a pressure-derived, hyperemia-free index for the assessment of coronary stenosis relevance. This option consists of an FFR-iFR® specific patient interface module (PIM-FFR) which can be connected to the Volcano system - VOLCANO s5 or s5i™ platform equipped with iFR® option.
QFR® (CE-Marked) is an angio-based FFR estimation using the analytical Software QAngio XA 3D from Medis medical imaging B.V., The Netherland</description>

        Patients that undergo angiography because of symptoms of myocardial ischemia and angina or
        angina equivalent (chest pain, abnormal stress testing or abnormal noninvasive testing) and
        in whom hemodynamic evaluation of an intermediate stenosis is indicated should be screened
        and considered for participation in the trial

        The trial design is set up to be representative for the patient population that under
        current guidelines should be evaluated with FFR. Therefore the exclusion criteria are
        limited to the contraindications for adenosine and previous CABG which would not allow
        accurate evaluation by FFR and QFR respectively.
