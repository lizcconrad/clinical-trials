      This is a research study to find out what the side effects are of certain drugs that are
      commonly used for pain (hydromorphone) and to put people to sleep for surgery (ketamine). The
      researchers also want to know how the drug is broken down in the body. Participants will be
      given these drugs as they are prescribed by their regular doctor. As part of the
      participant's standard of care, doctors will perform tests, ask questions, review medical
      information and measure vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, etc). The researchers will
      collect information that doctors have already written in the medical records. The research
      study team will collect blood from participants at certain time points depending on when the
      participant was first given the drug (up to 5 samples over the course of 10 to 48 hours).
      Parents will complete questionnaires about the study participant. Parents will continue to
      complete those same questionnaires for up to 12 months after the participant was first given
      the drug.

        Approximately 60 participants will be enrolled to each of the study drug of interests (DOI)
        cohorts. Participants who satisfy eligibility criteria and are receiving one or more DOIs
        per standard of care will be consented into the study and assigned to the corresponding DOI
        cohort. DOI cohort assignments will be at the discretion of the treating physician based on
        the DOIs that are administered per standard of care. Participants will be selected from a
        variety of centers including but not limited to trauma and intensive care units.
        Participants will not be randomized. Participants may count towards 1 or more DOIs within
        the same 90-day period.
