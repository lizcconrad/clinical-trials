      Head and neck cancer refers to the skull base to the supraclavicular, cervical spine within
      the scope of all malignant tumors is more common in China's malignant tumors. Head and neck
      cancer mainly surgery and radiotherapy, chemotherapy alone or in combination therapy, common
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma chemotherapy programs are: PF regimen (cisplatin +
      5-fluorouracil), PLF program (cisplatin + carboplatin +5 - fluorouracil), TPF program
      (cisplatin + 5 - fluorouracil + paclitaxel) and so on. The researcher consider to add
      apatinib,a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF,to the therapy of these patients.
