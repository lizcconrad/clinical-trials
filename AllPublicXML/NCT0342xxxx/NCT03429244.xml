  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this Early Phase Clinical Trial is to begin defining the accuracy of
      68Ga-PSMA-11 for detecting the location and size of clinically significant prostate cancer
      lesions in low and intermediate risk disease.

      A molecularly-targeted probe (68Ga-PSMA-11), coupled with an advanced clinical imaging system
      (PET-MRI), will improve accuracy during biopsy and staging. We propose detailed intra-lesion
      whole-mount pathologic analysis as the gold standard for critically assessing PSMA PET
      accuracy in patients undergoing surgery, and blinded PSMA PET-MRI comparison with standard
      multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for patients having biopsy on active surveillance. This
      intensive testing of the accuracy and value of PSMA-based tracers requires our unique
      collaboration of surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, and imaging scientists with decades of
      experience and innovation.

      This is a prospective, single arm, phase 2 clinical trial. This patient population will have
      low (1 = Gleason 3 + 3) or intermediate risk (2 = 3 + 4; 3 = 4 + 3) prostate cancer. Patients
      will be scheduled for a (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of routine care for either
      surgical planning or for further biopsy. Following the informed consent process, patients who
      enroll in the study will receive a PSMA (positron emission tomography (PET) study along with
      their standard of care (SOC) MRI on an integrated PET-MRI. If integrated PET-MRI is not
      available, a PET-CT and SOC MRI can be done with registration of PET and MRI done using
      software to generate the PET-MRI images. Patients receiving SOC MRI guided biopsy will
      receive additional PET guided biopsies as indicated. The sensitivity and specificity will be
      evaluated along with the ability of the tracer to inform the treatment planning. Patients
      receiving surgical removal of the prostate will have a slice-by-slice whole mount analysis to
      assess the sensitivity and specificity the PSMA PET.

      Primary Objectives Define the accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-MRI for detecting the location and
      size of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions in low and intermediate risk disease.

      Secondary Objectives Evaluate how knowledge of the PSMA-PET might inform treatment planning.

      Exploratory Objectives Generate pilot data for future larger clinical trials
