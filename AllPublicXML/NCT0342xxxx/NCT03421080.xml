  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hazardous alcohol consumption is common among people suffering from depression. There are
      effective Internet interventions that target hazardous alcohol consumption or depression
      separately but none that combine these online interventions without the involvement of a
      therapist. This study aims to evaluate the effects of combining an Internet intervention
      targeting hazardous alcohol consumption with one for depression on drinking and depressive
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial will be used. Participants with
      current depression who also drink in a hazardous fashion (N=986) will be recruited for a
      study to 'help improve an online intervention for depression.' Participants will be assigned,
      by chance, to receive MoodGYM or to receive MoodGYM plus a brief Internet intervention for
      hazardous alcohol consumption - Check Your Drinking (CYD). Participants will be contacted 3-
      and 6-months after receiving the interventions to assess changes in drinking and depression
      status. It is predicted that participants receiving the CYD intervention in addition to
      MoodGYM will reduce their alcohol consumption to a greater extent than those who just
      received MoodGYM. Further predictions include the impact of receiving Check Your Drinking on
      improvements in depressive symptoms.

    <description>The MoodGYM only Internet intervention will consist of a popular, automated, self-help cognitive behavioral therapy program for depression comprising five modules to be completed over five weeks and an online workbook incorporating 29 exercises. A series of published research trials has shown MoodGYM to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in users in a range of settings (e.g., schools, universities, Lifeline suicide prevention, U.K. NHS Choices online), for different aspects of the mental health service spectrum (e.g., prevention vs treatment), and different age groups (adults, adolescents).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The MoodGYM + CYD intervention condition will consist of the MoodGYM only intervention and an online intervention providing feedback on quantity and frequency of drinking, severity of hazardous drinking, and provides recommendations for safe levels of alcohol consumption (Check Your Drinking - CYD). The CYD Final Report will be provided as part of the participant's MoodDYM dashboard.</description>

    <description>The MoodGYM Internet intervention will employ the latest version of MoodGYM (Mark 4) which has been updated to support mobile devices. The core design and function of the program has not been altered. A major focus of this intervention is to provide individuals with behavioral and cognitive strategies to improve depression symptoms.</description>
