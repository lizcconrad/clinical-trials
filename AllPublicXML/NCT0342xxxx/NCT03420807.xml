  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project concerns the evaluation of the Metabolic Hyperspectral Retinal Camera
      (MHRC), a novel medical instrument from Optina Diagnostics, for the detection of beta-amyloid
      plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in the retina. The experimental device,
      produces multiple images of the retina when subjected to light in very specific colors
      (90-100 specific colors typically) and may be used to identify specific biomarkers based on
      their unique spectral signature. The retina is an extension of the brain and is the only
      optically accessible nervous tissue. The MHRC could represent a simple and non-invasive tool
      to facilitate the diagnosis of AD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment
      and a suspected dementia syndrome, is the most common type of dementia (&gt;50% of all cases),
      affecting millions worldwide, with no cure available at this time. Definite AD diagnosis
      currently relies on the post-mortem observation of the hallmarks β-amyloid peptides (Aβ)
      extracellular aggregates, Aβ plaques, and protein tau intracellular twisted strands
      (neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs). Earlier diagnosis could dramatically transform the design
      and execution of clinical trials to test new treatments. The eye offers a natural window to
      the brain as the retina, the light sensitive layer lining the interior of the eye is an
      extension of the brain. The presence of Aβ plaques in the retina of AD mice models and humans
      was recently reported opening the possibility of detecting this AD hallmark though a simple
      non-invasive eye scan. The proposed research aims to explore this avenue with the development
      of a spectrally-resolved optical retinal imaging platform to detect Aβ plaques in the retina
      of AD subjects and validate the method against brain Aβ plaques seen on amyloid PET imaging.
      The novel imaging platform is expected to help aid the early detection of AD and assist in
      monitoring efficacy of possible future therapeutic agents that target relevant molecular
      pathways.
