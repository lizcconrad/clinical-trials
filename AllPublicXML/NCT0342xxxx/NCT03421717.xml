  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis is defined as inflammation in the mucosa surrounding an oral implant with
      loss of supporting bone. The goals of peri-implantitis treatment are to resolve inflammation
      and to arrest the progression of disease. It is important to systematically gather
      information on the effect of surgical peri-implant treatment and to assess different
      protocols regarding chair-side maintenance of peri-implant tissue after surgery

      The aims of this clinical investigation are to evaluate the clinical, microbiological and
      radiographic outcomes of surgical treatment of peri-implantitis and to evaluate the efficacy
      of 2 supportive treatment protocols based on the use of titanium cyrettes or by the use of a
      flexible, biodegradable chitosan brush. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of this therapy
      on selected biochemical markers associated with chronic inflammation and bone tissue
      destruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the effect of chair-side maintenance of dental implants after
      peri-implantitits surgery. Traditionally, the maintenance has been performed by titanium
      curettes to remove microbiological deposits from the submucosal area.

      The Labrida biodegradable brush is a novel debridement device intended for use on dental
      implants. The concept of using a biodegradable material is related to the suggested problems
      with leaving remnants on the treated implant surface which would be negative from a bone
      regenerative aspect. The use of a flexible brush relates to the access problems when treating
      dental implants both related to the threads as well as due to the prosthetic supra
      construction hindering access for debridement with regular instruments developed for teeth.
      The material used in the brush will be Chitosan which is a natural polysaccharide, chitosan
      (poly-N-acetyl glucosaminoglycan), which is a nontoxic and bioabsorbable (REK-approval
      2012/791 polymer).

      H0: It is possible to maintain peri-implant health after surgical peri-implantitis treatment.
      There is no short- or long term clinical or radiographical differences between patients
      surgically treated for peri-implantitis maintained by the use of titanium cyrettes or with
      the Labrida brush in chair-side supportive care
