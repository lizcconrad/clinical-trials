  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that chronic supplementation with
      a dairy-based beverage containing a mixture of blueberry, green tea, and cocoa flavonoids
      (non-nutritive natural plant compounds) will ameliorate exercise-related changes in gut
      permeability and inflammation. In a previous feeding study in humans, (NCT02728570) a high
      flavonoid diet (flavonoids at 340 mg/1000kcal) was effective in mitigating gut permeability
      and inflammation in overweight and obese adults compared to a low flavonoid diet (10mg/1000
      kcal). To test this hypothesis, 20 trained cyclists will complete a randomized crossover
      study with supplementation for 2 weeks with a dairy-based sports beverage containing either a
      high flavonoid (approximately 620 mg) or low flavonoid (approximately 5mg) beverage. After
      the two week intervention, cyclists will complete a 1 hour cycling trial (45 min at 65% VO2
      max then 15 minute time trial). The primary endpoints will be gut permeability as measured by
      plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) and the differential sugar test.
      Secondary endpoints will include gut inflammation (measured via fecal calprotectin), plasma
      cytokines (IL-6, IL-10 and TNFÎ±) and plasma LPS. In addition, the distance completed in the
      time trial is a secondary endpoint.
