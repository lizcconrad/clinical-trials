      The trial is a multi-centre real-world non-interventional observational study. The study was
      designed to compare effectiveness and safety of the minimally invasive surgeries of
      Ivor-Lewis and Mckeown in the Chinese patients with IA-IIIB esophageal cancer via a
      retrospectively review method based on the study data on patient demographic/tumor biological
      characteristics and clinical treatments.
