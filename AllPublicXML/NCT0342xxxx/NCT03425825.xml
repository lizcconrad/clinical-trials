    <textblock>
      Non-interventional, retrospective study of advanced SCLC patients in 4 European countries
      (France, Germany, Italy, and United Kingdom [UK]) with the aim to produce evidence across
      different SCLC treatment lines to characterize the clinical and economic burden of the
      disease in Europe.
