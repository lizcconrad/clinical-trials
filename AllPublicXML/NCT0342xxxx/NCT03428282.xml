  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different audiovisual
      distraction techniques (Audio Video eyeglasses &quot;VR BOX&quot;/ Tablet) in the management of anxious
      pediatric patients during inferior alveolar nerve block

      Group A (Control group): IAN will be administrated with basic behavior guidance techniques
      and without using any type of distraction aids.

      Group B: IAN will be administrated with using AV eyeglasses &quot;VR BOX&quot; and wireless headphone.

      Group C: IAN will be administrated with using tablet device and wireless headphone

      All of the children who experienced an inferior alveolar block with/without distraction will
      be assessed by using a combination of measures: Wong-Baker FACES (self-report), pulse rate
      (physiological) and behavior (using FLACC behavior rating scale &quot;external evaluator

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two types of distraction aids that contain
      video using (tablet device or VR BOX eyeglasses) and audio distraction using wireless
      headphone. pain and anxiety will be evaluated during inferior alveolar nerve block using
      three behavioral scales, Wong-Baker FACES (self-report), pulse rate (physiological) and
      behavior (using FLACC behavior rating scale &quot;external evaluator&quot;.

      The first measure of heart pulse rate will be recorded directly when the patient seated
      comfortably on the dental chair, after anesthesia, the second heart pulse rate will be taken
      and the child patients will ask to choose a face that describe their status from one of the
      Wong Baker faces scale.

      For each child patient, all of the body responses will be recorded during the whole procedure
      and then will be evaluated by an external assessor to determine the children behavioral score
      according to FLACC scale.
