  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a common and serious complication of medical care that affects 10% of older
      Emergency Department (ED) patients, which unfortunately is unrecognized in up to 75% of ED
      patients.Studies have shown that 26 - 42% of patient with delirium are sent home. And 80% of
      patients sent home with unrecognized delirium are re-hospitalized within 4 days. Unrecognized
      delirium also has grave consequences for patient care - Kakuma showed that patient with
      unrecognized delirium who were sent home had 3-8x the mortality rate of patients with
      recognized delirium at 6 months.

      Fluctuating severity over time is a key clinical characteristics of delirium, making its
      diagnosis challenging. Regardless of cause, failure to recognize delirium means that ED staff
      cannot meet their patient‟s needs. For example, ED staff may miss serious medical conditions
      associated with delirium, may not provide understandable discharge instructions or ensure a
      caregiver can supervise and assist a patient with delirium who is discharged. These care
      adaptations require staff to recognize the presence of delirium. Thus it is not surprising
      that unrecognized delirium has such grave consequences for patients.

      Thus recognition of delirium is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing repeat ED
      visits. Patients with delirium may appear to have normal mental status at times, making its
      diagnosis challenging. High levels of service demand in the ED, plus the competing demands of
      numerous other initiatives to improve quality and reduce waiting times may explain why
      delirium continue to go unrecognized despite guidelines promoting routine delirium screening
      as a top priority in the ED. To address this care gap, the investigators developed an
      innovative solution. Rather than adding tasks to overburdened ED staff, our solution takes
      advantage of the long waiting times clients have in the ED for their initial assessments and
      between interactions with clinical staff. During these times, patients will use the PrEDICT
      &quot;serious game&quot; - similar to the Whack-a-Mole carnival game. The investigators have developed
      an algorithm based on participants‟ performance on this simple but serious game that can
      identify patients at high risk for delirium.

      The investigators propose to conduct a prospective, multi-center randomized clinical trial in
      4 provinces. The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of our tablet
      technology on the recognition of delirium by ED staff. All eligible patients who agree to
      participate will be treated in the same manner and will play the PrEDICT tablet based game.
      The investigators will randomly assign half of patients to have their test performance shared
      with clinical staff. Patients assigned to the control condition will be treated using the
      current standard of care, clinical assessments, to identify delirium.

      This project will allow us to solidly advance this technology from a working prototype (TRL7)
      to a commercially ready product demonstrated effective in multiple &quot;real-world&quot; environments
      under expected operational conditions (TRL8). Also it will provide evidence that the PrEDICT
      tablet app is clinically, technically, commercially and operationally feasible.

    <masking_description>To prevent outcome assessment bias, research staff will be masked as to the randomization status of participants until after they have completed and recorded gold-standard delirium assessments of delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method .
Similarly, ED physicians will be blinded to the gold standard assessments of delirium made by research assistants as well as the results of the PrEDICT test scores when they make their baseline clinical assessments of delirium. ED Physicians will also remain masked until they have recorded their discharge plan. The intervention focuses on the impact of revealing the result of the PrEDICT game scores on ED physicians' recognition of delirium, so randomization status must be revealed to them.</masking_description>
