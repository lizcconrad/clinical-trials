      The research about the target effect-site concentration of remifentanil, inhibiting stress
      reaction of the perineal prostate puncture when Dexmedetomidine being continuous pumping

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who were scheduled to undergo transperineal prostate puncture and biopsy were
      recruited into our study. In all patients, dexmedetomidine was injected at a bolus of 0.6
      mg/kg and then continuously infused at 0.6 ug/kg/h using the conventional continuous
      microinfusion pump. the target Effect-site concentration of remifentanil was determined by
      sequential method. The first target effect-site concentration of remifentanil was set to
      4.5ng/ml, the difference of adjacent target concentration was 0.5 ng/ml. Cardiovascular
      positive reaction was defined as the changes of heart rate or systolic blood pressure was
      more than 15% compared with baseline values, or body movement observed. The adjacent target
      concentration difference was adjusted to 0.2 ng/ml after 3 negative and positive reaction
      cycles. If the first had a cardiovascular positive reaction, the target concentration of
      remifentanil increased by a concentration gradient. Conversely, the target concentration of
      remifentanil decreased by a concentration gradient.
