  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A reduced content of FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides,
      and polyols) in the diet may be beneficial for patients with IBS diarrheal variant, but so
      far few randomized trials have reported data in favor of the effective therapeutic
      superiority of a low-FODMAPs diet compared to specific IBS dietary advice. On this basis, the
      present study is aimed, in a multidisciplinary perspective, at investigating possible changes
      in the symptom profile and intestinal permeability, GI peptides concentrations, metabolic and
      lipidomic profiles induced by these different diets in patients with IBS diarrheal variant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disease (GI) affecting 10%
      -20% of the population and is composed of abdominal pain/discomfort, in combination with
      alterations of the stool habit. This is a functional disorder prevalent in Italy with double
      percentages in urban areas (13.7%) compared to rural ones (5.9%). IBS is still one of the
      main reasons for patients to seek for gastroenterological advice. The diagnosis of IBS is
      mainly based on the evaluation of symptom profiles by using different scales of assessment
      and also taking into account non-GI symptoms (e.g. insomnia, anxiety, and depression), as
      well as the characteristics of the stools. IBS is classified in different subtypes, namely:
      IBS diarrheal variant (IBS-D), IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS mixed variant (IBS-M) and
      non-classifiable. The pathophysiology is only partially understood and an abnormal motility,
      together with alterations in gut-brain communication, a low-grade inflammation, and
      psychosocial factors, have been variously involved. On the other hand, the therapeutic
      choices are still scarce. The majority of IBS subjects believe that some foods are
      responsible for their symptoms, tending to exclude them without, however, compromising their
      nutritional status [14]. Many dietary approaches have been proposed, but only a few
      controlled studies have been performed in this field. Recent evidence suggests that the
      intake of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs)
      may trigger GI symptoms in patients with IBS. These carbohydrates are poorly absorbed in the
      small intestine and can pass intact in the colon, where they increase the endoluminal water
      through the osmotic activity and induce the production of gas due to their fermentation by
      intestinal bacterial flora. This, in turn, can cause abdominal distension and diarrhea. Data
      in the literature suggest that a diet with a reduced content in FODMAPs may be beneficial for
      patients with IBS and diarrhea, but so far few randomized trials have reported data in favor
      of the effective superiority of a low-FODMAPs diet compared to the specific dietary advice
      for patients with IBS. On this basis, the present study is aimed at comparing these two diets
      in a randomized, single-blind clinical trial in IBS patients with diarrhea.

    <time_frame>Time frame: Before the start of the study (time 0) and after 90 days of treatment (time 90).</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-SSS contains 5 specific questions with instructions on how to score them. Each of the five questions (pain severity, pain frequency, abdominal distension severity, bowel movement satisfaction, quality of life) ranges from 0 to a maximum score of 100 using a visual analog scale (VAS), leading to a total possible score of 500.
The primary outcome corresponds to a change in the total score of the IBS-SSS questionnaire at the end of the treatment period compared to baseline, and the proportion of patients who will achieve a difference in the total symptom score of IBS-SSS ≥50 after diet. Such difference is considered a significant clinical improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Time frame: Before the start of the study (time 0) and after 90 days of treatment (time 90).</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of intestinal permeability, a test solution is prepared with 40 g sucrose (Su), 10 g lactulose (La) and 5 g mannitol (Ma) dissolved in 100 ml of water.
The participants drink the test solution in the morning after an overnight fast and all urine samples are collected for the subsequent 5 h. Urine samples were stored at -80°C until analysis. The detection and measurement of the three sugar probes, Su, La, and Ma, in urine are performed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography coupled with pulsed amperometric detection.</description>

    <description>To evaluate GI peptide, blood samples are collected in ice chilled tubes containing Aprotinin and EDTA. The separated plasma are stored at -70 °C until assay. Plasma levels of spexin, copeptin, meteorin, somatostatin and serotonin, are measured by enzyme immunoassay technique using commercial kits before and after the dietary interventions</description>

    <time_frame>Time frame: Before the start of the study (time 0) and after 90 days of treatment (time 90).</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the lipidomic, profile blood samples are collected in vacutainer tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The erythrocytes are separated from the plasma by centrifugation, suspended in pure water, vortexed and subsequently centrifuged to isolate the membrane pellets. Lipid extraction and lipid transesterification to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) are performed using an automated protocol. Phospholipidsare will be trans-esterified to FAMEs by treatment with a potassium hydroxide (KOH)/methyl alcohol (MeOH) solution and are extracted using n-hexane. Fatty acids quantification will be performed by using a gas chromatography equipment. Quantification of fatty acid methyl esters is performed using a mixture of standards. The amount of each fatty acid is calculated before and after the dietary interventions, as a percentage of the total fatty acid content (relative %).</description>
