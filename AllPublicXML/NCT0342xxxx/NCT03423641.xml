  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess whether patients with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) who are
      prescribed direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medications experience higher rates of adverse
      events than patients with HCV who are untreated. The investigators hypothesize that patients
      receiving DAAs do not experience higher rates of adverse events compared to patients who have
      not received DAAs. The study population is adults between the ages of 18 and 88 with any
      indication of a diagnosis of HCV. An intervention group (those receiving a DAA) and
      comparison group (those who are not treated) will be created using medication dispensing
      data. Eligibility for the study will be determined from January 1, 2011 through December 31,
      2017. Covariates will be collected from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2017. Individual
      study sites may have access to historical data prior to 2011 that can be used as covariates
      or to identify individuals with HCV. The primary outcomes of interest include acute
      myocardial infarction, neurological outcomes (e.g. acute stroke, intracranial bleed), acute
      kidney failure, acute on chronic liver failure, hepatic decompensation, multiple organ
      dysfunction syndrome, cancer, bradyarrhythmia, and death. The secondary outcomes include
      decompensated cirrhosis, hospitalization, emergency department visit, and arrhythmia.
      Outcomes will be assessed from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2017. The investigators
      will use two different analytic approaches to answer the question of interest: a Poisson
      regression model and marginal structural modeling (MSM). The simpler Poisson model is an
      extension of tabular rate of event analysis. The more complicated MSM model incorporates
      modeling of the treatment decision to more flexibly control for confounding by indication.
      For each outcome, the investigators will only record the first date an outcome occurs. Each
      outcome will be modeled separately.
