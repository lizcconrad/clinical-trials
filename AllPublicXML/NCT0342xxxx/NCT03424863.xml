  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an aortic stent graft are recommended to do muscle strengthening exercise as
      part of their rehabilitation. But, as excess blood pressure pose a risk to the integrity of
      the stent graft, high intensity muscle strengthening exercise may potentially be detrimental,
      and hence moderate intensity muscle strengthening is recommended. However, the blood pressure
      changes during moderate intensity strengthening exercises are unknown, and this study aims to
      quantify these among patients and compare them to those of healthy volunteers.

      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the increase in blood pressure during quadriceps
      muscle strength training in patients with aortic stent graft.

      Methods:

      Patients with aortic stent graft will be included. The participants are investigated once.
      During the investigation, the blood pressure increase during a single strength training
      exercise (leg press) is measured. The strength training exercise is done at 60% of maximal
      strength (moderate intensity) corresponding to 15 Repitition Maximum (RM) (a load that can be
      lifted exactly 15 times).
