      This randomized pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-SEMA4D
      monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 when given together with nivolumab or ipilimumab in treating
      patients with stage III or IV melanoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-SEMA4D monoclonal
      antibody VX15/2503, nivolumab, and ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of anti-SEMA4D monoclonal
      antibody VX15/2503 (anti-SEMA4D VX15/2503) with nivolumab, or ipilimumab, in melanoma
      patients who have progressed on anti-PD1/L1 based checkpoint inhibitors.

      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule of the combination of anti-SEMA4D
      VX15/2503 with nivolumab, or ipilimumab, in melanoma patients who have progressed on
      anti-PD1/L1 based checkpoint inhibitors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the adverse event profile for the agent combinations and determine attribution
      (i.e. drug related adverse events [AEs]); II. To evaluate clinical response of patients
      treated with maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of the
      combination of anti-SEMA4D with nivolumab, or ipilimumab.

      III. To evaluate whether adding anti-SEMA4D to PD1 or CTLA-4 blockade can increase T-cell
      infiltration into tumors and whether change in T-cell infiltration is associated with
      response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 28 days for up to 12 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and
      ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes every 21 days for courses 1-4, then receive anti-SEMA4D
      monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 every 28 days for subsequent courses for up to 12 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.
