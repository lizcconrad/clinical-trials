      The intent of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of two forms of Talazoparib
      therapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumors . After an enrollment period, patients
      will randomized to receive oral Talazoparib (1 mg, one times a day ) or subcutaneously
      Talazoparib (1 mg by subcutaneous injection with NovoPen / Autopen) one times a day in the
      appropriate volume
