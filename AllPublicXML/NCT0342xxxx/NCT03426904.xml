  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main cause of recurrence after surgical treatment of colon cancer is distant metastasis.
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has potential benefits of improving the effectiveness of
      chemotherapy. Preoperative chemotherapy may eradicate microscopic metastatic cancer cells
      earlier than adjuvant chemotherapy, reduce cancer cell spillage during surgery, and lessen
      the invasiveness of surgical resection. This randomized multicenter phase III trial is
      assessing whether preoperative chemotherapy improves oncologic outcomes of patients with
      locally advanced colon cancer.
