  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate correlations between brain reactivity (as assessed via
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) following 24-h abstinence) and the amount of
      smoking in a specific location. The investigators will use ecological momentary assessment
      (EMA) to ask smokers to rate their exposure to, and smoking in, specific personal smoking
      environment cues (PSEs) over the course of 2 weeks before quitting smoking and 2 weeks after
      quitting smoking. The investigators propose to identify 48 regular cigarette smokers who will
      complete 8 visits (1 screening visit, 1 training visit, 1 camera turn-in visit, 1 fMRI
      session and 4 post-quit medication check sessions). Multiple methods will be used to test
      hypotheses about brain functioning during cue-reactivity (CR). The investigators will examine
      correlation between brain responses to smoking environments (minus non-smoking environments)
      and smoking cessation outcomes (i.e. days to lapse, days to relapse). Our EMA+Global
      Positioning System (GPS) analysis will primarily focus on locations where smokers smoke
      before and after quitting smoking. The investigators will evaluate whether EMA-assessed
      smoking intensity values are correlated with brain responses to these personal smoking
      environments.
