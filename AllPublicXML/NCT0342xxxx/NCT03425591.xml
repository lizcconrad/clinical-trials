    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the effectiveness of ibrutinib and to provide a
      description of ibrutinib therapy and the first non-ibrutinib subsequent therapy for chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL).

    <time_frame>Approximately up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Mantle-Cell Lymphoma (MCL) participants will be determined. PFS is defined as the time from start of ibrutinib therapy to Progressive Disease (PD) or death from any cause. PD is defined as any new lesions or increase by greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) of previously involved sites from nadir.</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR observed in CLL and MCL participants will be reported. ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with at least an objective response (that is, complete response or partial response, or partial response with lymphocytosis for CLL participants) as assessed by the participating physician.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival in CLL and MCL participants will be reported. Overall survival will be measured from start of ibrutinib therapy to the date of death (all-cause mortality); and from diagnosis to the date of death.</description>
