  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, three doses,
      placebo-controlled, exploratory efficacy and safety study. The objective of this study is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of a single intrathecal injection of Paracetamol 3% (30
      mg/mL) administered at 3 doses to 3 active treatment groups, as compared to placebo, for
      post-operative analgesia in knee procedures up to 40 min duration performed under spinal
      anaesthesia with Chloroprocaine HCl 1%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients undergoing elective short-duration knee procedures up to 40 min duration
      will be randomised into 4 treatment groups (15 patients per group) to receive either one of
      the 3 single doses of Paracetamol 3% (D1: 30 mg, D2: 60 mg, D3: 90 mg) or the placebo
      solution (P: 0.9% saline solution) by intrathecal injection (IT), according to the
      randomised, parallel-group design.

      Immediately after IT paracetamol or placebo administration, all patients will receive a
      single IT dose of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (Non-investigational medicinal product, NIMP)
      according to the Summary of Product Characteristics indications. The time interval between
      paracetamol IT and chloroprocaine IT injections should not exceed 2 min.

      The study will include a screening phase (Visit 1, Day -21/-1), a treatment phase (IMP IT
      administration, anaesthesia and surgical procedure: Visit 2, Day 1) and a follow-up phase
      including an observation period (Visit 3), a final visit and two follow-ups (24 h post-dose
      and day 7±1).
