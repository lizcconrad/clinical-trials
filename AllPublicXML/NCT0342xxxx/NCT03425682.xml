      Assess clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients who undergo anterior cervical
      discectomy fusion (ACDF), transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) or posterior lumbar
      interbody fusion (PLIF) using ViBone.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center study to evaluate the clinical and radiographic
      outcomes of ViBone in patients undergoing ACDF or lumbar spine fusion. Data will be gathered
      for a minimum of 25 subjects undergoing ACDF surgery and a minimum of 100 subjects undergoing
      TLIF or PLIF surgery using ViBone. Total enrollment is expected to be approximately 200
      subjects. The purpose of this study is to assess clinical and radiographic outcomes in
      patients who undergo 1- or 2-level ACDF, TLIF or PLIF surgery using ViBone. Subjects will be
      followed for 12 months following surgery.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Male and female patients, 18-80 years of age undergoing 1- or 2-level anterior cervical
        discectomy fusion (ACDF), transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) or posterior lumbar
        interbody fusion (PLIF) using ViBone.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18-80 years of age

          -  For cervical cases - ACDF surgery at 1 or 2 adjacent levels between C2-C7

          -  For lumbar cases - TLIF or PLIF surgery at 1 or 2 adjacent levels between L1-S1

          -  Patient signed Consent Form

          -  Patient signed HIPAA Authorization

          -  Appropriate candidate for surgery

          -  Patient will adhere to the scheduled follow-up visits and requirements of the protocol
             including routine patient exams - pre-operative, operative, and at least two post-
             operative visits (6 and 12 months post-surgery). Pre-operative and post-operative
             visits include X-ray (required) and CT scan (if available).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Long term use of medications that are known to inhibit fusion or bone metabolism or
             immune suppressants 6 months prior to surgery (i.e., steroids, chemotherapy, DMARDs,
             etc.)

          -  Treatment with radiotherapy

          -  Severe osteoporosis

          -  Acute or chronic systemic or localized spinal infections

          -  Instability associated with major reconstructive surgery for primary tumors or
             metastatic malignant tumors of the cervical (for ACDF patients) or lumbar (for TLIF
             and PLIF patients) spine

          -  Previous pseudoarthrosis at any level of the cervical (for ACDF patients) or lumbar
             (for

          -  TLIF and PLIF patients) spine

          -  Nursing mothers or women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the time
             of the study

          -  Current or recent history of malignancy or infectious disease. Patients with current
             or recent history of basal cell carcinoma are eligible.

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Rapid joint disease, bone absorption, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and/or osteoporosis.

          -  Osteoporosis or osteopenia are relative contraindications, since this condition may
             limit the degree of obtainable correction and/or the amount of mechanical fixation.

          -  Other medical or surgical conditions which would preclude the potential benefit of
             surgery, such as congenital abnormalities, immunosuppressive disease, elevation of
             sedimentation rate unexplained by other diseases, elevation of white blood count
             (WBC), or marked left shift in the WBC differential count.

          -  Active local or systemic infection or is undergoing adjunctive treatment for local or
             systemic infection.
