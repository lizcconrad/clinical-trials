  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify the safety and tolerability of bile acid supplementation in
      patients with progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Participants will also be assessed for an
      impact of the bile acid on their immune system and gut microbiome. Half of the participants
      will receive the bile acid tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and half will receive placebo.
      The investigators believe participants who take TUDCA will have normalization of blood bile
      acid levels, a normalization of abnormal immune response and a normalization of the gut
      microbiome.

    <description>Change in physical and mental health scores as assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) instrument. This 54-item instrument generates 12 subscales along with two summary scores, and two additional single-item measures. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - are derived from a weighted combination of scale scores. Higher scores suggest a better quality of life.</description>
