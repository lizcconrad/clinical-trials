  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study the investigators want to test which is the best medical treatment for
      symptomatic uterine fibroid, mostly abnormal uterine bleeding, between Ulipristal acetate
      versus Aromatase inhibitor plus GnRH analog, in term of uterine and fibroid volume reduction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently it has been introduced the Ulipristal acetate as medical treatment for symptomatic
      uterine fibroid. The investigators used in the past for the treatment of other benign
      gynecological diseases such as endometriosis and adenomyosis a combined therapy with
      Aromatase inhibitor plus GnRH analog. The investigators also used this combined treatment in
      selected cases of symptomatic uterine fibroids. With this study the investigators want
      evaluate which is the best way to treat uterine fibroid, in order to obtain symptoms
      disappearance other than a fast and long lasting reduction of uterine and fibroid volume. For
      these reasons the investigators set this controlled trial between Ulipristal acetate
      (5.0mg/day for 3 months) and GnRH analog plus Aromatase Inhibitor (3.6 mg monthly of
      Goserelin plus 1.0mg day of Anastrazole for 3 months) and after the treatment patients will
      be followed up for 12 months
