  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B7451015 is a Phase 3 study to evaluate PF-04965842 with or without Topical Medications in
      patients aged 12 years and older with a minimum body weight of 40 kg who have moderate to
      severe atopic dermatitis and have completed a qualifying Phase 3 study. The efficacy and
      safety of two dosage strengths of PF-04965842, 100 mg and 200 mg taken orally once daily,
      will be evaluated over approximately two years of study participation. Patients who meet
      safety step-down criteria will have their dose reduced once, from 200 mg QD to 100 mg QD, or
      from 100 mg QD to placebo.

               2. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective
                  method of contraception for the duration of the active treatment period and for
                  at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational product.

                  6. Female subjects of non childbearing potential must meet at least 1 of the
                  following criteria:

               1. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

                  physiological cause and have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level
                  confirming the postmenopausal state.

                  All other female subjects (including female subjects with tubal ligations) are
                  considered to be of childbearing potential.

                  7. Must agree to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and not to use tanning
                  booths, sun lamps or other ultraviolet light sources during the study.

                  the study.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

                       (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory
                       abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation
                       or investigational product administration or may interfere with the
                       interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator,
                       would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.

                    2. Currently have active forms of other inflammatory skin diseases, ie, not
                       atopic dermatitis.

                    3. Have evidence of skin conditions (eg, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis,
                       Lupus) at the time of Day 0 that would interfere with evaluation of atopic
                       dermatitis or response to treatment.

                    4. Discontinued from treatment (or rescue treatment period, if applicable)
                       early in a qualifying Phase 3 study OR triggered discontinuation criteria at

                       the qualifying Phase 3 study.

                    5. Ongoing adverse event in the qualifying Phase 3 study which in the opinion
                       of the investigator, or sponsor, is an ongoing safety concern OR the subject
                       is currently triggering safety monitoring criteria in the qualifying Phase 3
                       study.

                    6. Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the
                       study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by
                       the investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their
