      A prospective, non-randomized, multi-center early feasibility study. The study will enroll up
      to 65 subjects to be enrolled and treated with the Optilume BPH Prostatic DCB Dilation
      Catheter System at up to 15 clinical sites. Subjects will be followed up post-treatment at
      Foley removal, and up to 1 year. The subjects may choose to be followed-up annually for 5
      years or until study close, whichever comes first.

      Study device is Optilume™ BPH Prostatic Drug Coated Balloon Dilation Catheter System.

      Study primarily outcome are measured by 1). Change in IPSS score; 2).Major Device or
      Procedure Related Complications at 3-month follow-up visit post study procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male subject &gt; 50 years of age who has moderate-to-severe LUTS (IPSS score of ≥ 13)
             and is a candidate for interventional therapy

          2. LUTS felt to be secondary to an enlarged prostate (henceforth termed LUTS/BPH)

          3. Peak urinary flow rate (Qmax) ≥ 5 mL/sec and ≤ 15 ml/sec with minimum voided volume of
             ≥ 125 ml

          4. Post-void residual (PVR) ≤ 250 ml

          5. Prostate volume 20 - 80 gm as determined by TRUS

          6. Prostate length is 35 - 55 mm as determined by TRUS

          7. Able to complete the study protocol in the opinion of the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

             to treatment

         14. Use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitor within 6 months prior to treatment

         15. Incidence of spontaneous urinary retention within 6 months prior to baseline

         21. History of cancer in non-genitourinary system which is not considered cured (except
             basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin). A potential participant is
             considered cured if there has been no evidence of cancer within five years

         22. History of clinically significant comorbidities or presence of unstable conditions
             (e.g. cardiovascular, lung, renal [serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl], hepatic, bleeding
             disorders, or metabolic impairment) that may confound the results of the study or have
             a risk to subject per investigator's opinion

         23. Any cognitive disorder that interferes with or precludes direct and accurate
             communication with the study investigator regarding the study

         24. Expected life expectancy &lt; one year

         25. Unable or unwilling to sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and/or comply with all the
