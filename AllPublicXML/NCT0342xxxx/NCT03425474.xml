    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, ,parallel-group, single blind study using Remimazolam or propofol for
      sedation in patients undergoing diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.Subjects are randomized to
      different treatment groups (including 1 for Remimazolam Tosilate and 1 for propofol).
      Fentanyl are permitted during a diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.Efficacy and safety profiles of
      Remimazolam Tosilate are to be evaluated.
