      Open-label, Prospective, Study to Evaluate the Cutera excel V laser at 532 nm in a low
      fluence, high repetition rate mode and the Micro-Lens Array attachment used with excel V
      laser at 1064 nm and 532 nm for the improvement of skin quality.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, study in approximately 60 male or female subjects, age 18
      to 65 years who desire laser treatment for the improvement of rhytides, lentigines,
      pigmentation, erythema, telangiectasia, pore size and skin texture. Subjects may undergo a
      2mm punch biopsy a treatment area up to 72 hours post treatment and at a designated follow-up
      period per Investigator discretion. Subjects will receive up to 6 laser treatments, spaced 6
      weeks (± 4 weeks) apart. Subjects will be contacted by phone 7 days (± 2 days) after their
      first treatment for follow-up. Subjects will return to the site after final study treatment
      for two follow-up visits: 6 and 12 weeks (± 4 weeks).
