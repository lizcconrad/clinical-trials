  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis are the most seen problems in children with chronic
      pulmonary diseases. İt is a genetic, chronic system disease that reduces life expectancy, and
      life quality as well. Chronic lung disease , malnutrition, and reduced activity, caused by
      disease lead to postural disorders. Muscle force, endurance, activity of Daily living are
      adversely affected. İn the treatment pulmonary rehabilitation are using. Airway clearance
      technique, pulmonary exercises, upper extremity ergometer, dumbbells, elastic bands,
      proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique are applying. Resistance training using
      elastic bands has become an increasingly common intervention aiming to improve function by
      increasing muscular strength. İn one study indicated that muscle strength can be improved
      through three dimensional spiral large scale resistive exercises using proprioceptive
      neuromuscular facilitation. İn the literature there isn't any research , uses elastic bands
      with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation for the upper extremity and evaluating
      pulmonary functions, posture, quality of life, muscle force.

      The aim of this study is giving exercises programme with proprioceptive neuromuscular
      facilitation and elastic bands and to evaluate pulmonary muscle force, pulmonary functions,
      posture, activity of daily living, quality of life, functional capacity. And to evaluate the
      effect of treatment programme on these parameters.

      The subjects were divided in two groups. An experimental group three times a week for 12
      weeks will perform proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises with elastic bands,
      and pulmonary exercises. The control group will apply only pulmonary exercises at home
      programme.

      Participants: All participants with chronic respiratory disease were recruited from a
      Istanbul University Medical Faculty, Allergy Department. All treatments were performed in the
      same hospital.

      Sample Size: Sample size was calculated with power analysis. Pass 11 Home programme was used.
      α=0,05, β=0,6, 1- β=0,94 was determined. İf Sample size was defined 20 experimental and 20
      control group the power obtained %95. Using two-sided two sample t-test with alpha 0,05
      standard deviations were 5,0 and 4,0.

      Procedure: Forty chronic respiratory disease patient were assessed between the age of 10-18
      years old. The patients were found to be suitable for inclusion criteria of the
      study.Randomisation was performed by using randomisation function of Microsoft Office Excel
      programme by another researcher (ARO). Random number generator of Microsoft Office Excel
      Software gave a random number between 0 and 1 to the each treatment columns which were
      created by ARO. Sorting the random number row from the largest to the smallest number was
      performed by the sort and filter menu.After the randomisation,assessments at baseline and the
      patients were divided two groups. The experimental group was treated one by one with one
      physical therapist three times a week during a session for 30-45 minutes.

    <description>Plonk image measurement system is a posture analysis method evaluated on the computer software programme. We place the markers on the anatomic points of the body. We take a Picture with the camera. There is a 3 meter distance with the camera and the child. We take a Picture three times on the sagittal, frontal and lateral side.</description>

    <measure>6 Minutes Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test was used to evaluate functional capacity. They are walking during six minutes on the corridor of 30 m. İf there is a fatigue they can have a rest. And they can continue to walk. We have to measure the distance of walking during six minutes. Before and after the test we have to measure the dyspnea and level of fatigue with perceived exertion scale.</description>

    <description>İt measures functional capacity on the upper extremities of the body. Briefly, subjects were asked to move as many rings (each ring weighed 50 g; Zhan et al had used rings weighing half an ounce) as possible in 6 minutes, and the score was the number of rings moved during the 6-minute period. Pulse oxygen saturation was measured during the test. Scores for dyspnea were evaluated using a modified perceived exertion scale (0-10)13 immediately after the test.</description>

    <description>In this test the patient reports the activities that promote discomfort during daily living activities. During its execution, functional capacity is evaluated by the time spent to perform a circuit that consists of global activities as walking, climbing up-and-down stairs, and trunk and upper limbs movements. The lower time spent the better is the functional condition. This test will measure functional capacity and easy to use.</description>
