  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe traumatic experiences such as falling victim to assault, torture, or rape have
      deleterious effects. Clinical manifestations include intrusions, avoidance behavior, and
      hyperarousal, which are associated, at a circuit level, with hyperfunction of the amygdala
      and hypofunction of prefrontal cortex (PFC) subregions. In up to 50 % of the cases,
      resilience is not sufficient and trauma-exposed individuals develop posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). Oxytocin (OXT) is a hypothalamic peptide hormone that exerts anxiolytic
      effects. Recent clinical trials provide preliminary evidence that post-trauma administration
      of OXT could be effective as a preventive intervention for PTSD in a subsample of individuals
      exhibiting early PTSD symptoms prior to the onset of the disorder. However, the underlying
      neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, the rationale of the present project is to
      expose a sample of healthy participants to experimental trauma in order to explore the
      circuit mechanisms by which OXT influences, and interferes with, traumatic experience.
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be employed in order to elucidate the
      long-term effects of intranasal OXT on trauma-induced intrusions, amygdala and PFC responses
      during an emotional face matching task and resting state functional connectivity.

      Participants will be exposed to an experimental trauma (i.e. a highly aversive movie) at days
      1 and 4 of the study. After the first experimental trauma and after the first functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurement, the participants will receive intranasal OXT
      or placebo in three different groups (1. OXT for six days, 2. OXT for three days and then
      placebo for three days, 3. placebo for six days). The same fMRI tasks will be used after the
      first and second trauma exposure (i.e. one measurement before the treatment and one
      measurement after three days of treatment).

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be performed to measure blood-oxygen-level dependent signal in response to emotional face stimuli. The investigators specifically plan to investigate amygdala responses to emotional faces, because pilot data indicate that neural responses to emotional faces in these regions are associated with the total number of intrusions.</description>
