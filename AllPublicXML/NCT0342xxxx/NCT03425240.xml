      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of electrical stimulation of nerves
      responsible for erectile function to evoke penile erection after surgery to remove the
      prostate (prostatectomy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the main cancer in men. However, the survival rate for clinically
      localized prostate cancer is prominent mainly due to radical prostatectomy (RP), the gold
      standard treatment for non-metastatic cancers. Unfortunately, despite providing optimal
      cancer control, RP often lead to neuropraxia and persistent erectile dysfunction in
      approximately 80% of men 1 year after prostatectomy. Various erectile rehabilitation
      strategies have not been able to prove a beneficial action yet. However, electrical
      stimulation has been demonstrated to favour neuroregeneration and the functional recovery of
      neuromuscular systems and has been shown to induce and maintain penile erection in animals
      and humans. Therefore, electrical stimulation of the pelvic plexus nerves during radical
      prostatectomy is being investigated for its potential development into a treatment aimed at
      improving recovery of erectile function after prostatectomy.

      The primary objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using a neurostimulation
      device post radical prostatectomy as a method for neurogenic erectile dysfunction treatment.
      During standard open radical prostatectomy, the pelvic plexus nerves will be electrically
      stimulated intraoperatively and the modification of penile circumference will be recorded.

      The secondary objective is to assess proper placement of the stimulation electrodes and
      stimulation parameters needed to achieve maximal change in penile circumference.
