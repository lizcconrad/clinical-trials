  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tubal ligation is an everyday procedure for permanent female sterilization. It is usually
      performed after a vaginal delivery. Minilaparotomy is generally performed by doing small
      incision at infraumbilical area. This minimal access surgery requires adequate operative
      field exposure. Bowel interference, which obscures visualization of the operative field has
      been recognized as one of the major obstacles during this procedure. We found problems while
      doing surgery in small space and one of them is bowel interferance which obscures vision.
      This could lead to prolonged operation and complications. Simethicone is an antifoaming agent
      that use in bowel preparation prior to various procedures including laparoscopy, colonoscopy,
      endoscopy, and open major abdominal operations. Simethicone is proven to break the bubble and
      reduce intraluminal gas. This effect could result in reduction of bowel dilatation that
      interfere with the proper identification of the adnexal area. Benefit of taking simethicone
      prior to do minilaparotomy for tubal resection has not been examined.

      Objectives: To examine the effect of simethicone on reducing bowel interference during
      minilaparotomy for tubal resection.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial in women, age 20-45 years, undergoing postpartum
      sterilization after vaginal delivery at Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University hospital.
      The participants will be randomly assigned into one of two study groups: intervention (taking
      simethicone) and control (not taking simethicone). For the intervention group, each woman
      will take simethicone (80 mg) 2 tablet chewing with water 50 ml at 2-8 hours before surgery.
      Fasting at least 6 hours before surgery. For the control group, the women will receive the
      same standard perioperative care without taking simethicone. The primary outcome measure will
      be surgeon-rated operative difficulty score, which is a visual analog scale based on assess
      from exposure of to the operative field in visual analog scale by surgeon. The secondary
      outcome will be operative time and incidence of intraoperative and postoperative
      complications.
