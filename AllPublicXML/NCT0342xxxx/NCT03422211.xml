  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There was a study titled &quot;A prospective evaluation of opioid utilization after upper
      extremity surgical procedures: Identifying consumption patterns and determining prescribing
      guidelines&quot; by Dr. Matzon and team from Thomas Jefferson University that came up with a
      simple set of opioid guidelines post-surgically. These guidelines are helping to guide
      surgeon's prescribing patterns and ideally limit the number of prescribed pain medicines. We
      plan to identify typical narcotic analgesic usage post sports orthopaedic surgery. We hope to
      identify the number of narcotic pain pills to prescribe to patients undergoing orthopaedic
      sports surgery in the future.

      1, Consent patients undergoing sports orthopaedic surgery in clinic or in pre-operative
      holding area and also administer first questionnaire, opioid risk tool, and pain
      catastrophizing scale(research) 2. Sports orthopaedic surgery (standard of care) 3. Post-op
      pain control regimen (standard of care) 4. Call or email patient with questionnaire every day
      for a week followed by weekly for 7 more weeks. The children's questionnaire will be child
      specific and the parent will assist the child. Will also use a picture of Wong-Baker Faces to
      help children identify where their pain scale is which will be given to the patient the same
      day that the consent is obtained to use at home(research). Questionnaire should take less
      than 5 minutes and will include questions about how well their pain is controlled, how many
      analgesic medications they have taken, and if they have tried anything else for pain.
      (Research) 5. Patient will continue to go to post-operative appointments as scheduled.
      (standard of care) 6. Will store the data from the phone calls on the secured T drive.
