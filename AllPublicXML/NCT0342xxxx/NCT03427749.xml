      Patients will be recruited from those referred to the local site's Diagnostic Imaging
      Department for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) ,who have an intermediate to high
      pre-test likelihood of disease (Diamond-Forrester criteria ≥ 30%) and are clinically
      indicated to have an MBF study.

      Patients will be recruited from those referred to the local site's Diagnostic Imaging
      Department for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), who have an intermediate to high
      pre-test likelihood of disease (Diamond-Forrester criteria ≥ 30%) and are clinically
      indicated to have an MBF study. Research imaging will consist of a SPECT acquisition at the
      time of rest and stress radiotracer injection in addition to the standard (delayed) clinical
      stress/rest SPECT scan with 99mTc-tetrofosmin. This is an observational study; patients will
      be managed according to the standard clinical care of the local site. Where available, a CT
      scan will also be acquired for attenuation and/or scatter correction. Studies may be one day
      (rest/stress or stress/rest) or two day (rest and stress on separate days) All studies will
      be analyzed locally but the raw data will also be anonymized and forwarded to the core
      facility for reprocessing. Central processing will allow comparison between sites and the
      repeat processing will provide an estimate of inter-operator variability in the measurements.
      The core lab will also compare the relative perfusion from immediate and delayed imaging for
      image quality and diagnostic accuracy (visual and quantitative).
