  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep, specifically deep sleep, plays a central role in healthy brain function,
      cardio-vascular processes, mood and quality of life. Auditory stimulation during one night of
      sleep has previously been shown to improve deep sleep and along with memory formation in both
      young and older adults. Yet, it remains unclear whether long-term auditory stimulation
      considerably improves sleep quality over longer time periods and how it affects daytime
      functioning such as cognition, mood, quality of life and peripheral functions (e.g.
      cardio-vascular). Due to the importance of deep sleep for brain and body and the presence of
      many conditions that involve reduced deep sleep (e.g. ageing) assessing the beneficial impact
      of long-term sleep enhancement and its consequences is of central interest.This study will
      assess the effect of auditory stimulation over two weeks (interleaved with a two weeks
      washout period) in a cohort of healthy young and older adults using portable recording and
      stimulation devices.

    <description>Objective information about sleep macro- and microstructure will be assessed including measures like sleep architecture, amount of slow wave activity (SWA), amount of spindles, awakenings during sleep, and sleep fragmentation. In addition, subjective sleep quality will be obtained by questionnaires every morning over the intervention period. These measures will show whether auditory stimulation enhanced overall sleep quality compared to sham.</description>
