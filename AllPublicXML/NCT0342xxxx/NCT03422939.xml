    <textblock>
      During the last update of the French FBDG, a survey with a representative sample of
      dieticians investigated 1) how to communicate portion sizes and 2) the most relevant time
      frame when delivering dietary guidelines. The objective was to determine how to express
      portion sizes and time frame for Food Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDG) using the feedback of
      dietitians. Data were obtained from an internet-based survey of 441 French dieticians
      (collected from November 24, 2013 through January 2, 2014).

      Background: Food Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDG) need to accessible and understandable to
      consumers. During the last update of the French FBDG, a survey with a representative sample
      of dieticians investigated 1) how to communicate portion sizes and 2) the most relevant time
      frame when delivering dietary guidelines.

      Objective: To determine how to express portion sizes and time frame for Food Based Dietary
      Guidelines (FBDG) using the feedback of dietitians.

      Design: Data were obtained from an internet-based survey of 441 French dieticians (collected
      from November 24, 2013 through January 2, 2014).

    <description>There was no intervention, but we conducted separate analyses to identify differences according to the level of experience of the dietician. We used the median number of years of professional experience (median=8) to split the sample and create two subgroups: 1) less experienced dieticians (less than 9 years of experience; n= 225)</description>

        Most participants were female (96%), were under age 45, were working in a health
        institution and/or had a private practice, and had, on average, 12.5 years of professional
        experience. Seventy-five percent received mainly adults in their practice and 62.5%
        received mainly patients with a health condition.
