    <textblock>
      This study comparatively evaluate the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in smoker vs non-smoker
      chronic periodontitis patients as well as periodontally healthy subjects. the hypothesis of
      this study was that smoking may interfere with periodontal disease by effecting MMP-2 and
      MMP-9 expressions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smokers have greater risk for developing periodontal disease and smoking is highly correlated
      with greater marginal bone loss. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play a major role in
      periodontal tissue destruction. MMP-2 and MMP-9, called gelatinases, are one of the major
      MMPs that plays important roles in periodontitis. To date, several studies showed the
      increased levels of gelatinases in periodontal disease and only a limited number of study
      investigated the effect of smoking on gelatinases. However, no previous study has directly
      investigated the possible relationship between smoking and gingival tissue gelatinases
      expressions (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in chronic periodontitis (CP) patients relative to
      periodontally healthy subjects.

      Therefore this study is conducted to comparatively evaluate the expressions of MMP-2 and
      MMP-9 in smoker vs non-smoker chronic periodontitis patients as well as periodontally healthy
      subjects. the of this study hypothesis was that smoking may interfere with periodontal
      disease by effecting MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions.

    <description>In chronic periodontitis group, after recording the clinical parameters, gingival tissues were harvested from the deepest periodontal pocket. Whereas in periodontally healthy group, gingival tissues were collected during crown-lengthening surgery or during an extraction of a teeth for orthodontic reasons. In both groups the samples include both sulcus/pocket epithelium and underlying connective tissues. The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 is measured immunohistochemically</description>
