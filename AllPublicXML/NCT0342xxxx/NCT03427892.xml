  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an 8-week, non-randomized, open-label study of brexpiprazole
      in 20 persons with bipolar I or II disorder, depressed mood state. Primary aim will be to
      assess if brexpiprazole is associated with a reduction in depressive symptom severity using
      the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary aims will include an
      assessment of the following in patients with bipolar disorder taking brexpiprazole: manic
      symptoms, cognition, safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole, and quality of life.

      Subjects will be discontinued from the study if any of the following conditions occurs:
      change in diagnosis to other than bipolar I or II disorder, development of active suicidal or
      homicidal ideation with plan and intent, worsening of mood symptoms, that in the opinion of
      the investigators requires discontinuation, pregnancy, development of severe life-threatening
      medical condition, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization or incarceration.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale is used to assess depressive symptom severity. There are 10 items and each item is rated from 0 to 6 (increasing severity) based on the assessment of symptoms within the past 7 days. Scoring is assisted by descriptive anchors that serve as useful guides at 0,2,4, 8. Odd numbers (1,3,5) between the descriptive anchors are also meant to be scored. Highest possible MADRS score is 60. Lowest possible MADRS score is 0. MADRS is scored by taking the sum of the scores for each item. A higher score is indicative of more acute depressive symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Young Mania Rating Scale is an observer-rated measure of mania symptomatology. It has 11 items and each items has 5 defined anchor points with increasing severity that describe the symptom characteristics. YMRS is scored by taking sum of the scores for the 11 items. A higher score indicative of more acute manic symptoms. Seven of the items are scored between 0 and 4. Four items allow for schoring between anchor points (ranging 1 to 8). Maximum score is 60 and minimum score is 0.</description>

    <measure>Rey Auditoy Verbal Learning Test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RAVLT evaluates a wide diversity of functions, including short-term auditory-verbal memory, and retention of information. A list of 15 words are read out loud in 5 trials and participants are asked to recall the words read after each trial. Each trial recall is scored from 0-15 (0 minimum-15 maximum, 1 point per correctly recalled word). Total Score is sum of scores from trial 1-5. 3 more trials of word recall are done and scored in the same way. Then, participants are asked to identify words from an earlier list of words. The number of correct words recalled is the Hits score (0 min. score - 15 max. score, 1 point per word) and sum of incorrectly recalled words are the false positive error score (score range: 0-35). A discrimination score is derived by subtracting False Positive Error from Hits (score range -35 to 15). Higher score denotes better recall.</description>

    <measure>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is an assessment of movements to determine any long-term drug induced movement disorders.There are 10 items on the scale with scores ranging from 0-4 (0 None/Normal, 1 minimal, 2 mild, 3 moderate,4 severe). 4 items assess facial and oral movements, 2 items measure extremity movements, 1 item measures trunk movements, and 3 items measure global judgments regarding symptoms assessed. A total score is the sum of scores for items assessing facial and oral movements, extremity movements, and trunk movement (scores ranging from 0-28), with 0 being the lowest score, and 28 being the highest score. A higher score is indicative of a higher severity in symptomatology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barnes Akathisia Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) is an assessment of movements to determine any short-term drug-induced movement disorders. There are 5 items.Items 1-3 are rated from a scale of 0-3 with 0 indicating the least severity, and 3 indicating the highest severity of symptoms. Item 4 is a global assessment of symptoms assessed and the severity is assessed on a scale of 0-5, with 0 indication least severity and 5 indicating the most severity.The total score is the sum of all the item scores (scores ranging from 0-14).</description>

There are 10 items with each items scored on a scale of 0-4, and indicates the severity of symptoms assessed (0=least severe, 4=most severe). The total score is the sum of all 10 items.</description>
