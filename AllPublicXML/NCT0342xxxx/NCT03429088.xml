  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a pilot study to determine if telephone counseling, in a health
      care setting that routinely assesses physical activity of its members, is a feasible approach
      to improve physical activity among patients with diabetes and prediabetes. The investigators
      built on an existing innovation at Kaiser Permanente, in which physical activity is assessed
      at every outpatient visit. The primary aims were to (1) pilot study elements, including
      database identification of patients; recruitment, training and engagement of health care
      providers; patient recruitment; data collection procedures; and a 24-week intervention, and
      (2) to assess feasibility and obtain feedback from key stakeholders on the approach.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of identifying and recruiting sufficient number of participants into a telephone-based physical activity intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>The intervention lasted 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who met eligibility criteria and who were scheduled for an outpatient visit with their primary care provider were invited to participate in the study. Feasibility was assessed by the investigators' ability to recruit 60 participants into the pilot trial.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessments were made a baseline and approximately 24 weeks after baseline assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were mailed an Actigraph model 7185 accelerometer and asked to wear it over their right hip for 7 consecutive days and return the monitor through the mail. Data were analyzed to assess daily moderate to vigorous physical activity using the Freedson cutpoints.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation for Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants completed the survey at baseline and approximately 24 weeks after baseline assessments.</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-item Motivation for Physical Activities Measure was used to measure motivation for physical activity. The scale has 5 factors: interest/enjoyment, competence, appearance, fitness, and social motivations. A mean score for each factor was determined for each participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Self-Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants completed the survey at baseline and approximately 24 weeks after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 16-item scale with the following factors: external regulation, introjected regulation, identified regulation, and intrinsic regulation. A Relative Autonomy Index is formed from the factors, with the higher scores indicating greater autonomy toward physical activity.</description>
