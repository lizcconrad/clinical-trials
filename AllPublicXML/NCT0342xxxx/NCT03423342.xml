  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in heart failure (HF), and is associated with
      an imbalance in intracellular ratio of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to
      oxidized nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD), or the NADH/NAD ratio. In mouse models of
      HF, we have found that normalization of the NADH/NAD, through supplementation with NAD+
      precursors, is associated with improvement in cardiac function. This Study will randomize
      participants with systolic HF (ejection fraction ≤40%) to treatment with the NAD precursor,
      nicotinamide riboside (NR) or matching placebo, uptitrated to a final oral dose of 1000mg
      twice daily, to determine the safety and tolerability of NR in participants with systolic HF.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: Determine the safety and tolerability of NR in patients with clinically stable,
      systolic heart failure (LVEF &lt;40%). To accomplish this Aim:

      A) a total of 30 participants with clinically stable, systolic heart failure (LVEF &lt;40%) will
      undergo 2:1 randomization to NR 250mg PO twice daily or matching placebo B) NR (or matching
      placebo), will be increased weekly by 250mg/dose (500mg/day) to a final dose of 1000mg PO
      twice daily. Clinic visits with labs bi-weekly during dose escalation will assess HF symptoms
      and monitor labs [B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), complete blood count (CBC), glycosylated
      hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), insulin/glucose, uric acid,
      electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr).

      C) to ensure intermediate-term safety and tolerability, participants will continue on their
      maximum tolerated dose (of NR or placebo) through Study Week 12

      Aim 2: Determine whether, at the doses employed, NR and NAD are detectable in whole blood.

      Aim 3 (Exploratory): Assess the range of potential effect sizes of NR on HF surrogate
      endpoints using:

      A) Six-minute walk tests (6MWTs) at each visit (including Screening) to assess functional
      capacity B) Echocardiography at Baseline and Week 12 to assess LV systolic function (by
      real-time, 3D echocardiography) and diastolic function (by integrated Doppler and tissue
      Doppler imaging)
