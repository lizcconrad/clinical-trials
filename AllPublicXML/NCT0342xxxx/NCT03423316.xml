  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators propose to use high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) to measure blood perfusion in different groups of calf muscle. This imaging approach is
      standard of care for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD), and has never been
      successfully applied to PAD. Preliminary results show distinct patterns of muscle perfusion
      between healthy and PAD patients, and thus great promise of the technique. The investigators
      will first verify the reproducibility of the technique, and then compare the calf muscle
      perfusion measures in PAD patients against healthy age-matched controls. This comparison will
      test the feasibility of detecting functional abnormality in PAD patients. After the baseline
      scans, the PAD patients will opt to undergo a 12-week supervised exercise therapy, and then a
      post-therapy MRI scan. Comparison of the pre- and post-therapy measurements will indicate how
      the therapy improves the calf-muscle perfusion, and how this perfusion change correlates with
      increases in patient's walking ability.

      The long term goals of this project are to develop an improved diagnostic test for patients
      with PAD to predict who will benefit from therapeutic intervention. The MRI perfusion studies
      of calf muscle can be performed in conjunction with routine peripheral MR angiography to
      assess the functional significance of vascular stenosis.

    <description>The therapy will be conducted three times each week for 12 weeks. Each session takes 1 hour, consisting of 5 minutes of warmup activities, 50 minutes of intermittent exercise, and 5 minutes of cool-down activities. Exercise consists of walking on a treadmill initiated at 2 mph and 0% grade, until claudication pain becomes moderately severe. After claudication pain subsides, the subject will restart the walk. At the end of the session, the total exercise duration will be recorded. After a patient is able to walk 8-10 minutes at the initial workload, the grade is increased by 1-2%, or the speed is increased by 0.5 mph as tolerated.</description>
