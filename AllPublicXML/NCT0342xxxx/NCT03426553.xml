      Assumed scope of study:

      The study will include 70 patients: 35 patients to the test group, who will get transfusions
      with pathogen-inactivated red blood cell suspension; 35 patients to the control group, who
      will get transfusions with irradiated red blood cell suspension.

      Methods:

        -  Selection of patients suitable to participate in the study.

        -  A few days before the assumed transfusion date, select/prepare a red blood cell
           suspension corresponding to ABO and Rh systems, with no more than 14 days of storage.
           Conduct direct antiglobuline test (DAT), indirect antiglobuline test (IAT) and test for
           individual compatibility with the patient's serum.

        -  Before performing transfusion (on the day of transfusion), determine the initial indices
           of the patient (Hb, Hct, Haptoglobin). Determine the red blood cell suspension indices
           (Hb, Hct, extracellular potassium, free hemoglobin, hemolysis percentage).

        -  Perform transfusion. Evaluate the presence and severity of post-transfusion reactions
           and complications.

        -  Measure the patient's Hb, Hct, potassium and haptoglobin levels the next day after the
           transfusion.

        -  Perform DAT 3 to 5 five days after the transfusion.

        -  Perform IAT 2 to 3 weeks after the transfusion.

        -  Evaluate the need for transfusions over the follow-up period (30 days).
