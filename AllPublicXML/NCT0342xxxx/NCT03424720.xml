      The aim of this comparative analysis is to evaluate the reliability of PLE value as an
      anesthetic depth indicator

  <detailed_description>

      1. To evaluate the reliability of PLE value as an anesthetic depth indicator, the
           investigators compare PLE value with BIS score during induction and emergence of general
           anesthesia using propofol target controlled infusion.

        2. In addition, the investigators verify whether or not the facial nerve integrity
           monitoring affects the efficacy for PLE and BIS values as an anesthetic depth indicator.

    <description>Investigators measure the PLE value as an anesthetic depth indicator before the injection of propofol, at the time point of no response to verbal command, before and after intubation, and at the time point of response to verbal command during emergence of anesthesia.
The PLE value will be reported in a score ranging from 0 (burst suppression or deep sedated) to 100 (full awake).</description>
