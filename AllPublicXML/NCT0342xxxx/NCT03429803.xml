    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug TAK-580 (MLN2480) as a possible treatment a low-grade
      glioma that has not responded to other treatments.

      The name of the study drug involved in this study is:

      • TAK-580 (MLN2480)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an
      investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved TAK-580 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      This is the first time that TAK-580 will be given to children. There is limited experience
      with TAK-580 in humans.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety TAK-580 in children and adolescent
      participants with brain tumors. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or
      bad, it has on participants and the participant's brain tumor, and find the dose of TAK-580
      that is tolerated by participants without too many side effects to use in Phase II of the
      study.

      Research in the laboratory has shown that TAK-580 may have activity against cancer cells.
      TAK-580 belongs to a group of drugs called type II BRAF inhibitors. BRAF abnormalities are
      found in cancer cells. There are no type II BRAF inhibitors approved by the FDA for humans at
      the time of this study's start. TAK-580 functions by locking the mutant BRAF molecule and the
      next molecule in the activation chain together so that the signal that tells the tumor cell
      to divide is blocked.

                       patients of child-bearing or child-fathering potential, respectively.

          -  Exclusion Criteria: Patients with any of the following characteristics will NOT be
             eligible:

               -  Patients with clinical progression but without radiographically recurrent or
                  radiographically progressive disease.

               -  History of any major disease that might interfere with safe protocol
                  participation, as determined by the investigator

               -  Patients with a history or current evidence of central serous retinopathy (CSR),
                  retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or ophthalmopathy present at baseline that would be
                  considered a risk factor for CSR or RVO

               -  Laboratory values:

                    -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤ 1000/μL

                    -  Platelet count ≤ 75,000/μL (transfusion independent)

                    -  Hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL (hemoglobin may be supported by transfusion,
                       erythropoietin, or other approved hematopoietic growth factors)

                    -  Serum bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or ³ 2 ´ ULN if patient
                       is known to have Gilbert's Disease as the only underlying hepatic disorder

                    -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 2.5 ×
                       ULN. AST and ALT ≥ 5 × ULN for patients with liver metastasis

                    -  Serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL

               -  Current enrollment in any other investigational treatment study

               -  Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including but not
                  limited to clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure,
                  angina, or myocardial infarction, within the past 6 months

               -  Active hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus infection

               -  Active bacterial or viral infection

               -  Female patients who are pregnant or currently breastfeeding. Female patients of
                  childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
                  enrollment.

               -  Major surgery within 28 days of Day 1 (does not include central venous access or
                  shunts)

               -  Inability to comply with study requirements

               -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption, or significant bowel or stomach
                  resection that would preclude adequate absorption of TAK-580

               -  Treatment with any of the strong CYP2C inducers within 14 days before the first
                  dose of TAK-580 (see Appendix H).

               -  Treatment with gemfibrozil (strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) within 14 days before the
                  first dose of TAK-580.

               -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the investigator, make the
                  patient unsuitable for enrollment.

               -  Important note: The eligibility criteria listed above are interpreted literally
                  and cannot be waived.
