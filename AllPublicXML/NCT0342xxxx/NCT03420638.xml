    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the United States.
      The primary indications for tonsillectomy in the adult population include recurrent
      pharyngitis, chronic tonsillitis, and obstructive pathology. Tonsillectomy is often
      associated with severe postoperative pain, which can result in prolonged poor oral intake,
      dehydration, and the need for high dose narcotics. In severely dehydrated patients,
      epithelial shedding and necrosis of soft tissues at the surgical site can lead to
      postoperative complications such as bleeding, delayed healing, and severe pain. The goal for
      this study is to explore the use of a long acting local anesthetic bupivacaine liposome
      injectable suspension (Exparel) to manage pain experienced by adult patients after
      tonsillectomy. The proposed investigation will examine whether Exparel (bupivacaine liposome
      injectable suspension 1.3%—13.3 mg/mL) when used as a post-excision adjunct to the standard
      of care bupivacaine HCl 0.25% (2.5 mg/mL) with Epinephrine (5mcg/mL), will decrease the
      patient's post-tonsillectomy experience of pain intensity, especially for the first three
      days after surgery, and correspondingly reduce the requirement for pain medications and
      improve outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension 1.3% is a non-narcotic long acting local
      anesthetic agent that is also used to produce postsurgical analgesia after infiltration into
      the surgical site. The bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension drug delivery system allows
      slow release of the 1.3% bupivacaine suspension which extends its analgesic effect up to 96
      hours. The objective for this proposed study is to evaluate the use of bupivacaine liposome
      injectable suspension as an adjunct to the standard of care medication bupivacaine
      hydrochloride (HCl) 0.25% (2.5 mg/mL) with epinephrine (5 mcg/mL) to manage pain experienced
      by adult patients after bilateral palatine tonsillectomy.

      Tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the United States.
      In 2006, there were approximately 680,000 ambulatory surgery visits for chronic diseases of
      the tonsils and adenoids in children and adults. Indications for tonsillectomy in the adult
      population include recurrent pharyngitis, chronic tonsillitis, and obstructive pathology.
      Tonsillectomy is often associated with severe postoperative pain, which can result in
      prolonged poor oral intake, dehydration, and the need for high dose narcotics. In severely
      dehydrated patients, epithelial shedding and necrosis of soft tissues at the surgical site
      can lead to postoperative complications such as bleeding, delayed healing, and severe pain.

      Increasingly, the quality of surgical care is evaluated by examining readmission and
      complication rates. In a cross-sectional analysis of ambulatory surgery and hospital
      databases from New York, Florida, Iowa, and California for 2010, investigators identified a
      revisit rate of 11.3% in 7,748 adult patients who underwent bilateral tonsillectomy.
      Additionally, the investigators noted the primary diagnoses at first revisit were bleeding
      (41.3%), acute pain (22.1%), and fever/dehydration (13.2%). Improving pain control after
      tonsillectomy has the potential to decrease patient morbidity and the financial burden to the
      health care system.

      Investigators have examined a number of methods to reduce postoperative pain, including
      variation of surgical technique; preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative medications;
      and pre-incisional or post-excisional injections of local anesthetics. Several studies have
      demonstrated short-term improvement in pain control with local infiltration of bupivacaine
      into the surgical site. Pre-incisional and/or post-excisional injection of bupivacaine HCl is
      now commonly used for pain management in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. However, one of
      the limitations of local anesthetics such as bupivacaine HCl is the relatively short duration
      of action, about 3 - 6 hours.

      Pharmaceutical companies have recently developed new technologies for drug delivery, such as
      long acting carriers of local anesthetic using multi-vesicular liposomes to increase drug
      duration of action. One such formulation is bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension with
      an average duration of action of 72 hours. In a clinical review of the literature, Tong,
      Kaye, and Urman noted that use of liposomal bupivacaine decreased narcotic requirements and
      improved pain ratings in patients who underwent mammoplasty, knee arthroplasty,
      hemorrhoidectomy, and inguinal hernia repair.

      Currently to investigators' best knowledge, there is no study in published literature that
      evaluated the use of bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension for pain management in adults
      after tonsillectomy. At present, there are two completed clinical trials registered in the
      National Clinical Trials database. One small scale study was done to characterize the
      pharmacokinetic profile of single dose bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension infused
      intraoperatively for prolonged analgesia in 12 adults undergoing tonsillectomy. In another
      study, the investigator examined post-operative use of liposomal bupivacaine for pain
      management compared to no post-operative treatment in 33 adult patients. Preliminary results
      from the randomized control trial indicated that there was a significant difference in pain
      ratings between the bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension active comparator and the no
      treatment group on the day of surgery.

      For this proposed study, the aim is to evaluate the use of bupivacaine liposome injectable
      suspension to manage pain experienced by adult patients after tonsillectomy. In this study
      the investigators will examine whether Exparel (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension
      1.3%—13.3 mg/mL) when used as a post-excision adjunct to the standard of care bupivacaine HCl
      0.25% (2.5 mg/mL) with Epinephrine (5mcg/mL), will decrease the patient's post-tonsillectomy
      experience of pain intensity, especially for the first three days after surgery, and
      correspondingly reduce the requirement for pain medications.
