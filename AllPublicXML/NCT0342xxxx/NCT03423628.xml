      This study will test an investigational drug called AZD1390 in combination with radiation
      therapy for the treatment of brain tumors. This is the first time AZD1390 is being given to
      patients. This study will test safety, tolerability and PK (how the drug is absorbed,
      distributed and eliminated) of ascending doses of AZD1390 in combination with distinct
      regimens of radiation therapy.

      This first time-in patients (FTIP), open-label, multicentre study of AZD1390 will be
      conducted in the United States and in the United Kingdom, and it consists of three treatment
      arms: Arm A, B, C. This Phase 1 study will assess safety and tolerability of AZD1390 in
      combination with radiation therapy (RT) in brain malignancies. The combination cohorts have
      been designed to assess escalating cumulative doses of AZD1390 in settings with 3 different
      radiation treatment regimens:

        -  Arm A: 35 Gy over 2 weeks with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in patients
           with recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)

        -  Arms B: 30 Gy over two weeks with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with
           brain metastases

        -  Arm C: 60 Gy over 6 weeks (IMRT) in patients with primary GBM Each arm provides standard
           of care RT for the disease setting indicated with the experimental agent being
           administered in dose escalating cohorts.

    <intervention_model_description>AZD1390 will be administered to patients in three different Arms (A, B and C), with each arm receiving standard of care radiation therapy (RT) for their disease setting. In each arm, AZD1390 will be administered in three cycles; Cycle 0 (before RT), Cycle 1 (during RT) and Cycle 2 (after RT). Within each arm, AZD1390 will be administered in dose escalating cohorts, first in an intermittent and then in a consecutive fashion, to achieve daily administration prior to RT.</intervention_model_description>
