  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an open-label, non-controlled, multicenter, pilot clinical trial of inhaled
      molgramostim (recombinant human Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor; rhGM-CSF)
      in subjects with persistent pulmonary Nontuberculous Mycobacterial (NTM) infection. Subject
      will be treated for 24-weeks with inhaled molgramostim and will be followed up for 12-weeks
      after end of treatment. The primary aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy of
      inhaled molgramostim on NTM sputum culture conversion to negative.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will comprise a Screening Visit, Baseline Visit, a 24-week treatment period and a
      12-week follow up period. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) will be conducted up to 10 weeks
      prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) to determine eligibility. Adult subjects with a history
      of chronic Nontuberculous Mycobacterial (NTM) infection with at least 2 positive cultures in
      the prior two years, of which at least one is within the last 6 months prior to Screening,
      will be considered for enrollment. Subjects should provide a positive NTM sputum culture at
      Screening to be eligible.

      Two subgroups of subjects will be recruited:

        -  Group 1: Subjects who remain sputum culture positive while currently on a multidrug NTM
           guideline based antimycobacterial regimen, which has been ongoing for at least 6 months
           prior to the Baseline Visit.

        -  Group 2: Subjects who remain sputum culture positive but have either stopped a multidrug
           NTM guideline based antimycobacterial regimen at least 28 days prior to Screening due to
           lack of response or intolerance, or never started such treatment.

      The study will include 30 subjects.

             anticipated during the study period.

          8. Pulmonary tuberculosis requiring treatment or treated within 2 years prior to

         12. Treatment with any investigational medicinal product within 3 months of Screening.

         13. Previous experience of severe and unexplained side-effects during aerosol delivery of
             any kind of medicinal product

         14. Any other serious medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator would
             make the subject unsuitable for the trial.
