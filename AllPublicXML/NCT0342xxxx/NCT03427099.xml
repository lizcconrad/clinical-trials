  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the current rehabilitation pathway with the implementation of a newly developed
      rehabilitation pathway for patients with a single level lumbar arthrodesis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This involves a prospective interventional study with a one year follow-up. The investigators
      will compare the outcomes of the current rehabilitation pathway with a newly developed (based
      on systematic review and delphi study) rehabilitation pathway for patients with a single
      level lumbar arthrodesis. The usual care group (n= 30) will be compared with the intervention
      group (n= 30).

Assessing disability and change on individual patients: a report of a patient specific measure. Physiotherapy Canada, 47, 258-263.&quot; Three to five activities are scored on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 ('not able to perform activity') to 10 ('can perform activity without any problems'). Lower scores indicate a worse outcome on function. The total score is the sum of the VAS scores of the 3 to 5 activities.</description>
