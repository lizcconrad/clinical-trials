  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will study the effect of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) on baroreflex sensitivity in
      participants with well controlled type 2 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are admitted for two days and two nights to an inpatient clinical research
      center for performance of study procedures. On Day 1, two hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic (50
      mg/dl) clamps are performed - an AM clamp from about 9 to 11 am and a PM clamp from about 1
      to 3 pm.. Modified Oxford procedures are performed in duplicate at five time points -- before
      the AM clamp, during the AM clamp, before the PM clamp, during the PM clamp, and the morning
      of Day 2 (about 16 hrs after completion of the the PM clamp). The Modified Oxford procedure
      involves the sequential intravenous administration of nitroprusside and phenylephrine with
      assessment of blood pressure and heart rate by finapress. Baroreflex sensitivity is the
      relationship of changes in heart rate to changes in blood pressure. .

    <ipd_description>The data collected will comply with the NIH requirements for timely release and data sharing. Data will be shared in the form of publications and presentations in scientific forums. As the NIH has noted, the investigators reserve the right to keep the data restricted in order to perform the initial analyses for this grant proposal and will continue to use the data for further, but not prolonged, exclusive use. Of note, the sharing of this data will be limited by at least the following issues, some unique to this proposal and some not unique. Some of the data obtained in this study is defined to be sensitive in nature, which may restrict its ability to be shared. Data may only be shared with the approval of our IRB and is limited by HIPPA and any other regulations that may be promulgated during the course of this proposal.</ipd_description>
