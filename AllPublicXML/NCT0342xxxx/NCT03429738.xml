      Evaluation of the comparative bioavailability between two oral formulations containing
      ibuprofen 200 mg and pseudoephedrine 30 mg after a single dose in healthy subjects under
      fasting conditions.

      Ibuprofen is one of the most often used non steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAR) in the
      management of mild to moderate pain and inflammation. Combined with the sympathomimetic
      pseudoephedrine as decongestant it is widely used in colds or fever. The purpose of this
      phase-I-study was to evaluate the comparative bioavailability between a combination of 200 mg
      ibuprofen and 30 mg pseudoephedrine film-coated tablets to the reference formulation
      RhinAdvil Rhume® 200 mg/30 mg (Wyeth Santé Familiale, France).
