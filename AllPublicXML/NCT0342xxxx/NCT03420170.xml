  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blind randomized controlled trial study which will conducted on people with
      paraplegia wheelchair users. The objectives of this study is to investigates the effects of
      16 weeks of 'Graded Exercise Integrated Education' over conventional physical therapy on
      physical fitness, exercise self-efficacy and the level of physical activity. There will be a
      significant difference between the experimental and control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study protocol will be a single blinded randomised controlled trial. 40 subjects with
      diagnosed of paraplegia (T1 and below) and dependent with wheelchair will be randomly
      assigned into 2 groups, Graded exercise (n=20) or Conventional Physical Therapy (n=20). In 8
      weeks, the graded exercise group will receive strengthening and aerobic exercise for 2 times
      a week, and the controlled group will continue their normal routine. The strengthening
      exercise will consist of strength training for major upper limb muscles in the multigym
      station and free weights dumbbell whereas the aerobic exercise will perform by using arm
      ergometry, boxing and wheelchair wheeling. The exercise will be graded and progressed for
      each week in 8 weeks. The graded exercise group also will receive educational intervention to
      increase the exercise self-efficacy and physical activity level which will conduct in face to
      face for 2 times a week in 8 weeks during in-rehabilitation program and once on every 4 weeks
      in 8 weeks after discharge from in-rehabilitation program. The outcomes are the strength and
      endurance of upper limb which will be measure by using a BIODEX® Isokinetic Machine and hand
      grip strength by JAMAR® Hand-held dynamometry. The cardiovascular endurance will be measure
      by using 6 minute wheelchair push test (6MWPT). The exercise self-efficacy and physical
      activity level will be measure by using 'Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES)' and 'Physical
      Activity Scale for Individual with Disability (PASIPD)'. The outcome measure will be
      evaluated at the baseline level, week 4th, week 8th, week 12th, and 16th. Statistical
      analysis will be carried out using the SPSS 21.0 program for Windows and a significant level
      of p ≤ 0.05 will be used for all tests.
