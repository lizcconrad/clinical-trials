      The purpose of this cluster-randomized stepped wedge design is to test the effectiveness of
      primary palliative care education, training, and technical support for emergency medicine
      (PRIM-ER) in 35 Emergency Departments (EDs). PRIM-ER includes four core components: 1)
      evidence-based multidisciplinary primary palliative care education, 2) simulation-based
      workshops on communication in serious illness, 3) clinical decision support, and 4) provider
      audit and feedback.

      The specific aims of this study are divided into a UG3 phase and a UH3 phase.

      In the UG3 phase, investigator will: 1) tailor PRIM-ER to the emergency provider workforce
      and a more diverse ED context using an agile implementation framework approach; and 2) pilot
      test PRIM-ER at two sites for feasibility, fidelity, and usability.

      In the UH3 phase, investigators will: 3) implement PRIM-ER in a cluster-randomized, stepped
      wedge design in the remaining 33 EDs.
