  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to develop and test a web-based decision aid (DA) to
      support patients with Hepatitis C and Chronic Kidney Disease during decisions about whether,
      when, and how to treat each illness. Patients will have the opportunity to learn about their
      hepatitis C and kidney disease, initiate thought about what matters most to them and choose a
      treatment plan for their liver and kidney disease that works best for them. Investigators
      will evaluate the tool's efficacy, usability, and the likelihood of using it in clinical
      practice. There are three (3) primary aims of this project: (1) to develop the DA; (2) to
      pilot-test the DA to determine efficacy, usability and likelihood of using it in routine
      practice; (3) to explore stakeholders feedback on the usefulness of the DA and likelihood of
      implementing the tool.

  <detailed_description>

      First, for Aim 1, Investigators along with direction from a diverse expert advisory group of
      nephrologists, hepatologists, and patient partners developed a decision aid based upon
      International Patient Decision Aids Standards guidelines, literature reviews, and expert
      advisory reviews. It includes plain language education, interactive learning modules
      personalized tailored information to help individuals use and consider information
      appropriate to their values and needs, and guidance on discussions with clinicians about
      treatment goals. Second, for Aim 2, Investigators will pilot-test the decision aid with 70
      individuals in a pre-post within-subjects study design to evaluate the tool's efficacy,
      usability, and the likelihood of using it in clinical practice. Lastly, for Aim 3,
      Investigators will conduct 30 semi-structured qualitative interviews with both clinicians and
      participants after the pilot evaluation of the decision aid to gather feedback about
      implementing the tool into clinical practice.

    <description>The validated, 4-item SURE Test for clinical practice will be used. This scale measures whether individuals feel they have enough information to make a choice, are clear about their values for risks and benefits of their choice, and feel they have enough support to make a choice.</description>

    <measure>Change in Decision Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after viewing the intervention, within 30 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The validated decision self-efficacy scale will be used. This 11-item scale measures an individual's self-confidence or belief in their ability to make a decision. Individuals will be asked to rate how confident they feel taking actions involved in making an informed choice (e.g., gathering information, asking questions, and expressing opinions).</description>
