  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this traumatic brain injury (TBI) study are:

        1. to evaluate the short and long-term efficacy of two structured outpatient intervention
           programs, Resilience and Adjustment Intervention (RAI) vs. RAI with follow up booster
           sessions (RAI+) on resilience

        2. to evaluate the short and long-term impact of intervention on emotional well-being and
           postinjury adjustment with the RAI vs. the RAI+

        3. to evaluate the short and long-term impact of the RAI and the RAI+ on abilities
           including problem solving, communication, and stress management

        4. to determine if demographic, lifestyle, injury, or treatment response information can
           predict maintenance of gains

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be assigned to either of two treatment groups: (1) Resilience and
      Adjustment Intervention (RAI), or (2) RAI+. After randomization, a second appointment will be
      scheduled. All participants will begin the 7-session treatment during their second
      appointment. The intervention consists of seven 60-minute sessions scheduled over seven weeks
      (see attached RAI Implementation Manual). During the first session, participants will receive
      an empty loose leaf binder to store and organize completed self-assessments, reading
      materials, and homework assignments from each session. They will be asked to review materials
      and complete worksheets between sessions. The intervention will be implemented by
      experienced, licensed therapists (Ph.D. level Interventionists). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the therapists.

      The RAI and RAI+ groups will both complete the post-treatment measures immediately after the
      seventh treatment session and then 3, 4, and 9 months later. Data collection at 3, 4, and 9
      months post-treatment will be completed in-person, unless the participant requests to
      complete via phone.

      Furthermore, the RAI+ group will complete 3 booster sessions, spaced approximately 7-10 days
      apart, beginning 3 months after completion of the seventh treatment session (booster sessions
      will occur between the 3 and 4 month data collection described above).

      Data will be analyzed to identify any therapist effects, as well as treatment effects. For
      the RAI and RAI+ groups, demographic, injury severity, and history information will be
      collected at intake using standard procedures and protocols. All participants will complete
      the 4 outcome measures (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC; Mayo Portland Adaptability
      Inventory-4, MPAI-4; 13 Item Stress Test; and Brief Symptom Inventory-18, BSI-18) at 5 time
      points (intake, post-treatment, and 3, 4 and 9 month follow-up).

    <measure>Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Follow-Up (11 months after Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>During the past decade, researchers have developed resilience measurement scales, and a recent review suggested that Connor and Davidson have been most successful. The authors first developed a 25 item scale (CD-RISC) reflecting resilience characteristics identified by Kobasa and Rutter. Normative studies including factor analyses indicated that the CD-RISC is reliable, valid, and sensitive to treatment effects. More recently, a 10-item version was developed using exploratory and confirmatory factors analyses. Respondents are presented with a series of descriptors (e.g., &quot;I am able to adapt and change,&quot; &quot;Coping with stress can strengthen me&quot;) and rate themselves on a 0 - 4 scale ranging from rarely true (0) to true nearly all the time (4). Campbell-Sills and colleagues have characterized the 10-item version, used in the present study, as demonstrating excellent psychometric properties, namely reliability, internal consistency, and construct validity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mayo Portland Adaptability Inventory-4 (MPAI-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Follow-Up (11 months after Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The MPAI-4 is comprised of 30 items rated from 0 - 4 with higher scores indicating greater problem severity. Items are subdivided into three subscales reflecting emotional and behavioral self-regulation (Adjustment Index), cognitive and physical abilities (Ability Index), and community integration (Participation Index). T-scores are obtained based on norms derived from a brain injury sample. The present investigation focuses on the former two subscales. Adjustment Index items relate to anxiety, depression, irritability, anger, social interaction, and self-awareness. The Ability Index includes items relating to verbal and nonverbal communication and problem solving ability. Research has provided evidence of good concurrent, construct, and predictive validity as well as satisfactory internal consistency. Sensitivity to treatment-related change has also been substantiated.</description>

    <measure>Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Follow-Up (11 months after Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This 18-item self-report instrument was developed to quantify psychological distress in the general population. A number of investigators have used the measure to quantify distress after TBI. In particular, researchers have used the BSI to monitor change in psychological status in response to treatment and general change in status over time. The BSI-18 is often used because of its sound psychometric properties, brevity, ease of administration, and global assessment of psychological issues commonly found in individuals with TBI. Frequency ratings for items in three primary symptom dimensions (Somatization, Depression, and Anxiety) are added to yield the Global Severity Index (GSI). T-scores are calculated based on community norms. The GSI score reflects the overall distress level and is the focus of the present investigation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>13 Item Stress Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Follow-Up (11 months after Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This self-report measure was developed more than a decade ago for clinical research studies on stress management with survivors and caregiving family members. Sample items include, &quot;I have more to do than I can handle,&quot; &quot;I'm pushing myself too hard,&quot; and &quot;I can't stand living like this.&quot; Items are rated as True (+1) or False (0) with higher scores indicating higher stress levels. The measure has been shown to be sensitive to family intervention after TBI.63,64 The Total Score is the measure of interest in the present investigation.</description>

    <description>Intervention to promote resilience and adjustment (RAI) - The RAI was developed based upon considerable clinical experience and research review. The RAI is a structured approach to helping individuals after traumatic brain injury address issues related to resilience and adjustment to injury. The RAI is implemented in seven, 60-minute, in-person sessions.</description>
