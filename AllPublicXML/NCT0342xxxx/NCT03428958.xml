  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study of NUC-3373 administered every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion,
      in separate combinations with leucovorin, oxaliplatin, oxaliplatin + bevacizumab, oxaliplatin
      + panitumumab, irinotecan, and irinotecan + cetuximab. The primary objective is to identify a
      recommended dose for NUC-3373 when combined with these agents.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 2-part study of NUC-3373 administered every 2 weeks as an IV infusion, in separate combinations with folinic acid (leucovorin, LV), oxaliplatin, oxaliplatin + bevacizumab, oxaliplatin + panitumumab and irinotecan, and irinotecan + cetuximab.
A minimum of 12 patients will be enrolled in Part 1 (LV cohorts only) and a minimum of 6 patients per cohort will be enrolled in Part 2. Additional patients may be enrolled in Part 1 or 2 to replace patients who withdraw prior to completing the 28-day safety evaluation in cycle 1 in order to complete a minimum of 12 patients in Part 1 and 6 patients per cohort in Part 2. If the DSMC determines that an increased number of patients are required to evaluate alternate doses within a cohort, enrolment in a cohort may be expanded. The maximum enrolment in Part 1 is estimated to be 18 patients. The maximum enrolment in each cohort in Part 2 is estimated to be approximately 12 patients.</intervention_model_description>

             pox.

          8. Presence of any serious uncontrolled concomitant illness, serious illness, medical
             condition, or other medical history, including laboratory results, which, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would be likely to interfere with their participation in the
             study, or with the interpretation of the results.

          9. Known HIV positive or known active hepatitis B or C.

         10. Any condition (e.g. known or suspected poor compliance, psychological instability,
             geographical location, etc.) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may affect the
             patient's ability to sign the informed consent and undergo study procedures.

         11. Currently pregnant, lactating or breastfeeding.

         12. QTc interval &gt;450 milliseconds for males and &gt;470 milliseconds for females.

         13. Concomitant use of drugs known to prolong QT/QTc interval.

         14. Have received a live vaccination within four weeks of first planned dose of study
             medication.
