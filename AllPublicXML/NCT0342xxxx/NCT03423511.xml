  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare MiStent to either the Xience or Promus stents.with the primary objective being to
      assess the safety and efficacy of the MiStent in a patient population requiring
      revascularization of de novo obstructive lesions of coronary arteries in patients with stable
      and unstable coronary artery disease (CAD) including non ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction
      (NSTEMI)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CRYSTAL study is a prospective, multi-center, randomized (1:1), single-blinded and
      controlled, investigational device exemption trial to test the non-inferiority of MiStent to
      commercially available &quot;everolimus&quot; drug eluting stents (Xience and Promus stents).

      Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) that qualify for percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) with stenting will be screened per the protocol inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.
