  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic, prospective, randomized controlled trial will be conducted in patients with
      axial spondyloarthritis who are NSAID inadequate responders. Patients will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to either receive standard rheumatological care or a Traditional Chinese Medicine
      physician involved collaborative model of care (i.e. NSAIDs with acupuncture). Primary
      end-point was spinal pain score at week 6 with secondary end-points being evaluated week 24.
      Through this study, we hope to assess a novel model of care in AxSpA and be used as a
      reference to improve the management of other chronic diseases in Singapore.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the clinical effectiveness, safety and
      cost-effectiveness of a new model of care in the management of Spondyloarthritis (AxSpA)
      using a pragmatic trial approach. In this study, we define TCM physician involved
      collaborative model of care (TCMCMC) as TCM physician delivered acupuncture as well as TCM
      physician's history taking, physical examination, non-pharmacological advice and
      communications with rheumatologists in addition to the usual rheumatological care. The TCMCMC
      involves TCM physicians diagnosing patients based on TCM clinical syndromes and prescribing
      standardised acupuncture treatment. The patient population will still receive their standard
      of care (drug therapy and physiotherapy) as background therapy. The proposed study will not
      be investigating any therapeutic or medicinal products (drugs).

      Our primary hypothesis is that novel TCMCMC in patients with AxSpA will result in better pain
      control as compared the usual rheumatological care. Secondary hypothesis is that TCMCMC will
      have greater improvements in other clinical, quality of life, and economic outcomes as
      compared with those under the usual rheumatological care.
