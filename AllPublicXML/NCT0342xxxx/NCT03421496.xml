  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Cannabidiol Oral Solution
      as adjunctive therapy with vigabatrin as initial therapy in treating participants with
      Infantile Spasms. The secondary objectives for this study are to evaluate the continued
      efficacy of Cannabidiol Oral Solution after the 14-day treatment with vigabatrin or
      vigabatrin plus Cannabidiol Oral Solution is complete and to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of Cannabidiol Oral Solution as adjunctive therapy with vigabatrin as initial
      therapy in treating participants with infantile spasms.
