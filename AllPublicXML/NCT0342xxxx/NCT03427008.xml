  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in whether or not the use of a mobile health (mHealth)
      application increases the rate of immunosuppression medication adherence among adult kidney
      transplant recipients. The investigators aim to test this by randomly assigning transplant
      recipients to the intervention (use of an mHealth app to manage and track their
      immunosuppression regimen) or control arm (standard of care) upon discharge from their
      initial transplant hospitalization, and tracking medication adherence over time. The study
      population will be approximately 50 adult kidney transplant recipients at the Johns Hopkins
      Hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adult kidney transplant recipients, the leading predictor of rejection, kidney loss, and
      death is immunosuppressive medication nonadherence. An estimated one-third of kidney
      transplant recipients reportedly experience medication nonadherence, and even minor
      deviations from the required protocol have been shown to have negative effects. However, due
      to the lack of systematic measurements of adherence, the direct relationship between the
      level of immunosuppressive medication adherence and poor outcomes is not well understood.
      Therefore, the investigators believe that mHealth technologies could be a feasible way to
      allow clinicians and researchers to better understand baseline adherence measurements, and
      increase immunosuppression adherence among kidney transplant recipients.

      emocha Mobile Health Inc. has developed an application that enables users to track
      dose-by-dose medication adherence through asynchronous, video directly observed therapy
      (DOT). This helps patients take their medication as prescribed and gives providers the
      assurance that their patients are supported and successful in treatment. DOT is the practice
      of watching a patient take every dose of medicine in-person, and has typically only been done
      in extreme cases because it can be both costly and burdensome: DOT is the standard of care
      for Tuberculosis treatment and has proven high-adherence rates. Through mHealth technology,
      DOT can be used more broadly and without added burden; emocha's technology allows this
      through enabling patients to use their mobile application to view their regimen, record
      themselves taking every dose of their medication, report side effects or symptoms, visualize
      their treatment progress, access educational content, and track appointments. This
      information is encrypted and transmitted to a HIPAA-secure web portal for providers to
      review. The aim of this study is to conduct a randomized control trial to compare medication
      adherence between patients who use the mHealth system against controls who do not.
