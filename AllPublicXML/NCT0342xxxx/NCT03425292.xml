  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of nivolumab or nivolumab
      plus ipilimumab when used following surgery and before standard therapy with radiation and
      temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

      Additional aims of the study are to:

        -  Find out side effects (good and bad) of nivolumab and ipilimumab.

        -  Evaluate any preliminary evidence of anticancer activity of nivolumab and ipilimumab.

        -  Evaluate tumor characteristics by collecting brain tumor tissue samples.

        -  Measure the amount of nivolumab and ipilimumab in biospecimens.

        -  Look at biomarkers in biospecimens.

      Patients having a clinically planned surgical procedure (biopsy or cytoreduction) for a
      suspected diagnosis of glioblastoma will be approached for participation in this study. Tumor
      tissue obtained from surgery will be used for histological diagnosis and clinical molecular
      profiling, and excess tumor tissue will be collected for potential correlative studies. A
      small sample of blood and CSF for research will also be collected.

      Once a diagnosis of glioblastoma is confirmed, the patient will be randomized 1:1:1 to
      Treatment Arm 1 standard of care (radiation + chemotherapy), Treatment Arm 2 (nivolumab), or
      Treatment Arm 3 (nivolumab + ipilimumab). Treatment will be started approximately 7-42 days
      following surgery once the patient has recovered from surgery. Routine clinical evaluations
      will be performed prior to treatment initiation and throughout treatment as clinically
      indicated. Radiographic brain imaging will be performed approximately 21-42 after treatment
      initiation and then routinely for medical management. Tumor response will be assessed
      according to immunotherapy Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (iRANO) Working Group
      criteria.

      Treatment may continue until the patient experiences unacceptable toxicity or clear disease
      progression. The determination of whether to stop treatment due to disease progression will
      be based on the investigator's evaluation of the patient's clinical and radiographic
      condition, taking into consideration the interpretation of localized inflammatory responses
      that can mimic radiographic features of tumor progress. Patients discontinuing treatment will
      be directed by their treating physician for the next step in their medical management - such
      as a clinically-indicated cytoreductive surgery, standard radiation chemotherapy if assigned
      to study arm 2 or 3, or a different treatment regimen. If another treatment is started,
      clinical evaluations and response assessments will continue as clinically-indicated; blood
      and CSF will be collected after the first month, then every three to six months.
