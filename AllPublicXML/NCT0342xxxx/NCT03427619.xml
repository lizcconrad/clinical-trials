  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard of care for Lymphatic Malformations has been surgical excision. We have been using
      OK432/Picibanil (generously supplied by Chugai Pharmaceuticals in Japan) since 1992 with
      great success for macrocystic disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic malformations are uncommon tumors that represent localized malformations in the
      development of the lymphatic system. They typically present in children under 2 years of age
      and in almost 50% of the cases, are diagnosed at birth. There is neither a racial nor a
      sexual tendency. The malformations can occur anywhere on the body, but typically they are in
      the head/neck area.

      Morbidity can be significant. Besides the obvious cosmetic deformity caused by these tumors,
      there is risk of infection and airway compromise and even obstruction. However, effective
      therapeutic options are limited. Small lesions can be observed, although spontaneous
      resolution is unlikely. For larger lesions, surgery has been the traditional form of therapy.
      In the head and neck, in particular, lymphangiomas typically wrap themselves around major
      neurovascular structures, making total excision removal difficult, if not impossible, and
      thus the likelihood of recurrence is quite high.

      Because of these surgical limitations, alternate therapies have been considered; including
      cryotherapy, diathermy, and chemical sclerotherapy.

      The investigators experience with using the drug for macrocystic disease(large cysts) since
      1992 in the United States has been very promising compared to traditional surgery. Recurrence
      rate to date, has been very minimal as well. (&lt;2%)

    <description>Response rate will be assessed radio-graphically after the final injection using the Clinical Staging Classification System and de Serres staging system.Images will be used and orthogonal measurements of LM size will be used to calculate volume/size in cubic centimeters (cc). Response rate to OK-432 immunotherapy will be recorded as percentage reduction in volume and graded as complete (90%-100% reduction in volume), substantial (60%-89% reduction in volume), incomplete (20%-59% reduction in volume), or none (0%-19% reduction in volume). Clinical success is defined as a complete or substantial response.</description>
