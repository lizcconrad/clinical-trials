  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transfers between interfaces of care are recognized as a source of medication discrepancies,
      medication errors (MEs) and potentially adverse drug events. ME are very common at hospital
      and may have important clinical and economic consequences. The lack and loss of medication
      information and communication between health professionals at points of care transition may
      often lead to ME. According to the literature, up to two thirds of medication histories
      contain at least one error. Some studies have compared pharmaceutical team with physician or
      nurse on the detection of UMD or ME and have reported that pharmacists were one of the best
      health care providers to establish medication history. To improve medication safety and
      decrease MEs rate, several institutions have recommended to develop medication reconciliation
      at all transition points such as admission, transfer and discharge. Medication reconciliation
      is the process that compares a patient's medication order to all medications that the patient
      has been taking and should take at admission, transfer and discharge of hospitalization.
      Medication reconciliation programs led by pharmacists are effective to reduce medications
      discrepancies. However, studies evaluating the efficacy of medication reconciliation program
      are very heterogeneous in terms of populations, definitions and methodology. Thus, proportion
      of ME differs enormously between studies, ranging from under 10% to over 60% at admission of
      hospitalization. Elderly patients with their numerous comorbidities associated with
      polypharmacy, such as patients of internal medecin unit, are at high risk of ME and at risk
      of safety issues. However, medication reconciliation process is very time consuming with an
      average of 30 minutes by patient. Thereby, review of all inpatients within 24 hours of
      admissions is very difficult or impossible. Targeting &quot;high-risk situation&quot; and &quot;high-risk
      patient&quot; are crucial to detect ME before causing harm. Therefore, evaluating the risk of MEs
      and their potential consequences in specific population of internal medicine unit using a
      validated medication reconciliation process seems of utmost importance for internal medicine
      specialist clinical practice and the decrease of ME rate. Consequently, the aim of our study
      was to (i) evaluate the prevalence of ME in an internal medicine unit at admission of
      hospitalization, (ii) determine the type of medication involved and the potential clinical
      impact of ME and (iii) identify factors associated with a risk of ME and serious ME.
