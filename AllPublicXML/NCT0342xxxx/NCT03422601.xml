  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to validate that the Immunoscore® test (IS0 to IS4) is able to
      identify patients with high risk (IS 0-1) of relapse or death whichever occurs first among
      Stage III patients under oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy.

      Then the prognostic value of Immunoscore® Colon to predict disease free survival (DFS) will
      be assessed in Stage III patients under Oxaliplatin treatment in each arm of the IDEA trial
      (6- months and 3-months treatment).

      Finally, the additive value of the Immunoscore® test to stratify the DFS will be evaluated
      among standard clinical and biological parameters and tumor features.

    <description>DFS is defined as the time from randomization to relapse or death, whichever occurred first. Secondary colon cancers are regarded as DFS events, whereas non-colon tumors are to be disregarded in the analysis. Patients with no defined events observed during the follow-up will be censored at the date of last disease evaluation which showed no evidence of relapse, or secondary primary colon cancer.</description>
