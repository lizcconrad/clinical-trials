  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation dose reduction has been a primary driver of technology development in
      multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT). The optimization of radiation dose for patient and
      task specific computed tomography (CT) applications continues to be an ongoing challenge,
      especially in pediatric patients where the desire to reduce radiation dose to lowest possible
      levels leads to both positive and negative effects. A novel research tool on the Siemens dual
      source (Flash® and Force ®) CT scanners allows one to assess multiple tube current levels
      from a single CT acquisition without incurring additional dose to the patient. Tube current
      is a primary contributor to radiation dose and image noise, which are inversely related. This
      is achieved by independently adjusting the current of each tube, while maintaining same kV in
      each x-ray tube. Moreover, Duke's medical physics team has developed a method based on
      mathematical expressions that allows the creation of incremental dose levels from the
      acquired image data sets. This innovative and powerful tool can be used to compare diagnostic
      accuracy, detectability, and many more relevant clinical features amongst multiple tube
      current levels with the attainment of a single CT acquisition.
