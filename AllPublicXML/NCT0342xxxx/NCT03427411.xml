  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      In the United States, each year there are more than 30,000 cases of human papillomavirus
      (HPV) associated cancers. Some of these cancers are often incurable and are not improved by
      standard therapies. Researchers want to see if a new drug M7824, which targets and blocks a
      pathway that prevents the immune system from effectively fighting the cancer can shrink
      tumors in people with some HPV cancers.

      Objectives:

      To see if the drug M7824 causes tumors to shrink.

      Eligibility:

      Adults age 18 and older who have a cancer associated with HPV infection.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will review their
      symptoms and how they perform normal activities. They will have body scans. They will give
      blood and urine samples. They will have a sample of their tumor tissue taken if one is not
      available.

      Participants will have an electrocardiogram to evaluate their heart. Then they will get the
      study drug through a thin tube in an arm vein.

      Participants will get the drug every 2 weeks for 26 times (1 year). This is 1 course.

      After the course, participants will be monitored but will not take the study drug. If their
      condition gets worse, they will start another course with the drug. This process can be
      repeated as many times as needed.

      Treatment will stop if the participant has bad side effects or the drug stops working.

      Throughout the study, participants will repeat some or all the screening tests.

      After participants stop taking the drug, they will have a follow-up visit and repeat some
      screening tests. They will get periodic follow-up phone calls.

      Background:

        -  Metastatic or refractory/recurrent HPV associated malignancies (cervical, anal,
           oropharyngeal cancers etc.) are often incurable and poorly palliated by standard
           therapies.

        -  TGF-betaR1 pathway signaling and overexpression are significantly associated with HPV+
           cancers.

        -  PD-1 inhibitors have produced a 12-20% response rate for these diseases.

        -  M7824 is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of monoclonal antibodies against
           human PD-L1 and soluble extracellular domain of human TGF-beta receptor II (TGF-beta
           RII) which functions as a TGF-beta &quot;trap.&quot;

        -  Early data from a small cohort of patients with HPV associated malignancies in a phase I
           trial of M7824 has shown promising activity (NCT02517398). As of May 30, 2017, 4 of 9
           patients (44%) with HPV associated malignancies have had preliminary evidence of
           clinical benefit including:

             -  Patient with metastatic cervical cancer with a 25% reduction in her disease at 3
                months

             -  Patient with metastatic P16+ head and neck cancer with an unconfirmed partial
                response (PR) at 6 weeks

        -  Patient with metastatic anal cancer with a durable PR ongoing 9 months after starting
           treatment

             -  Patient with metastatic cervical cancer with a durable complete response (CR)
                ongoing 15 months after starting treatment.

             -  Notably, the P16+ head and neck cancer patient with unconfirmed PR, anal cancer
                patient with durable PR and cervical cancer patient with durable CR all have
                HPV+disease.

        -  Immune related adverse events with M7824 in the phase I trial to date have been on par
           with other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting a manageable safety profile.

        -  EMD Serono has an ongoing expansion cohort evaluating M7824 in patients with HNSCC as
           well as in cervical cancer excluding neuroendocrine cervical cancer.

      Objective:

      -To determine the objective response rate (ORR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) in subjects with recurrent or metastatic HPV associated
      malignancies.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
           HPV associated malignancies including:

             -  Non-Neuroendocrine Cervical cancers

             -  P16+ Oropharyngeal cancers

             -  Anal cancers

             -  Vulvar, vaginal, penile, squamous cell rectal and neuroendocrine cervical cancers

             -  Other locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (e.g. lung, esophagus) that are
                known HPV+

             -  Subjects must have measurable disease.

      Design:

        -  This is a Phase II trial of M7824 in patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV
           associated malignancies.

        -  Patients will be scheduled to receive 1,200 mg of M7824 IV every 2 weeks until off
           treatment criteria are met.

        -  There will be three cohorts: (1) Patients with anal cancer whose disease is na(SqrRoot)
           ve to checkpoint inhibition, (2) Patients with other rare HPV associated tumors
           (squamous cell rectal, vulvar, vaginal, penile cancer, neuroendocrine cervical)
           na(SqrRoot) ve to checkpoint inhibition (3) Patients with any HPV associated cancers
           whose disease is refractory to checkpoint inhibition.

        -  All 3 cohorts of the trial will be conducted using a Simon two-stage phase II trial
           design.

        pregnant women and there is f potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because
        there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to

        treatment of the mother with M7824, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
        treated with M7824.

          -  Patients with prior investigational drug, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or any prior
             radiotherapy (except for palliative bone directed therapy) within the past 28 days
             prior to the first drug administration except if the investigator has assessed that
             all residual treatment-related toxicities have resolved or are minimal and feel the
             patient is otherwise suitable for enrollment.

          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first drug administration (minimally
             invasive procedures such as diagnostic biopsies are permitted).

          -  Known intolerance to or life threatening side effects resulting from prior checkpoint
             inhibitor therapy.

             peritumoral hemorrhage on baseline imaging are also excluded unless the hemorrhage is
             grade less than or equal to 1 and has been shown to be stable on two consecutive
             imaging scans.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory
             agent with exception of:

                  disease or other mild autoimmune disorders not requiring immunosuppressive
                  treatment;

               -  Subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the
                  steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at
                  doses less than or equal to 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day;

             Investigator as high risk for investigational drug treatment.

          -  History of second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment except for the following:
             adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, superficial
             bladder cancer or other localized malignancy which has been adequately treated.

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (Grade greater than
             or equal to 3 NCI CTCAE v4.03)

          -  Patients with vulvar cancer originating from differentiated vulvar intraepithelial
             neoplasia (d-VIN), as opposed to vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia of usual type, are
             excluded. Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma originating from differentiated VIN (d-VIN)
             is HPV negative; however, rare cases of HPV positive d-VIN can occur. Patients are not
             excluded if their tumor has tested positive for HPV or there is no documentation of
             prior VIN type.
