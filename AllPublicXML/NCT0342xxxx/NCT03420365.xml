  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals of advanced age are at higher risk of cognitive deterioration.A single bout of
      aerobic exercise was found to improve cognitive functions. The aim of this study is to
      explore the effect of a single bout of balance and coordination exercise versus aerobic
      exercise on cognitive functions among elderly people.

    <description>This cognitive domain will be based on scores of two tests: Go-NoGo test and the Stroop test, which will be performed by the use of NeuroTrax (NeuroTrax Corp., Israel) computerized battery that utilizes novel adaptations of traditional neuropsychological tests. In order to assess attention the mean reaction times (RTs) for the Go-NoGo test and the no-interference (meaning) phase of the Stroop test, and mean SD of RT for the Go-NoGo test will be calculated.</description>

    <description>This cognitive domain will be based on scores of three tests: Go-NoGo test, Catch game and the Stroop test, which will be performed by the use of NeuroTrax (NeuroTrax Corp., Israel) computerized battery that utilizes novel adaptations of traditional neuropsychological tests. In order to assess executive function Performance indices for the Stroop test and the Go-NoGo test, and mean accuracy for the Catch Game will be calculated.</description>
