  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to demonstrate that the Parsortix™ PC1 system enables
      the capture and harvest of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the peripheral blood of
      patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and not from healthy volunteers (HVs). The study
      is also designed to demonstrate that the CTCs harvested by the Parsortix PC1 system from MBC
      patients can be used effectively for different types of evaluations (e.g. cytopathology,
      FISH, qPCR, RNAseq, etc.).

      This is an investigational study. The Parsortix PC1 system is not FDA approved and is
      currently being used for research purposes only.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 200 evaluable MBC patients (either newly diagnosed or patients with
      progressive/recurrent disease who are about to start a new line of therapy for the treatment
      of their disease) and 200 evaluable healthy volunteer (HV) subjects (healthy women with no
      history of cancer) will be enrolled at a minimum of three (3) US based clinical sites. Each
      subject will have information about their age race/ethnicity, height and weight, menopausal
      status, smoking status, pregnancy and/or nursing status, and a brief medical history captured
      at the time of enrollment. Blood will be drawn from each subject into three different EDTA
      tubes (minimum of ~7mL up to a maximum of ~23mL of whole blood) specifically for the purposes
      of this study. One of the blood tubes collected will be used for a complete blood count (CBC)
      with differential testing, while the other two tubes of blood will be processed on the
      Parsortix PC1 system for the capture and harvest of CTCs. The cells harvested from one of the
      blood tubes will be deposited onto a glass slide and automated Wright-Giemsa staining will be
      done to allow for identification of CTCs based on their cytologic features (e.g. size, shape,
      nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, chromatin structure, etc.) by an expert cytopathologist. The
      cells harvested from the remaining blood tube will be used for one of three different
      evaluations: Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) for evaluation of Her-2/neu gene
      amplification, quantitative reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for evaluation of
      cancer related gene expression, or whole transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) for determination
      of the expression patterns of breast cancer related genes.
