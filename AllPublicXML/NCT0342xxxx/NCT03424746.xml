      This is a Pilot Trial Using Chelation Therapy for Limb Preservation in Diabetic Patients with
      Critical Limb Ischemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic
      acid (EDTA) based chelation therapy plus vitamins in diabetic patients with severe peripheral
      artery disease presenting with impending amputation and determine if there is an improvement
      in outcomes and a delay or reduction of amputations.

      The investigators propose to enroll 10 patients in an open-label study of TACT-formula,
      EDTA-based chelation therapy + commercially available TACT oral multi vitamins, delivering
      40-50 infusions over 1 year. Clinical assessment, and noninvasive blood flow assessments will
      be performed at baseline, and at completion of 20 and 40 infusions. HIPAA-compliant
      photographs of the affected lower limbs will be taken at each infusion visit.

      The specific aims of this open-label pilot study are to:

        1. Assess the effect of EDTA-based chelation therapy plus vitamins in diabetic patients
           with below-the-knee peripheral artery disease presenting with impending amputation and
           determine if there is an improvement in vascular flow parameters, such that the
           scheduled amputation can be averted or reduced in extent.

        2. Co-primary severity endpoint: Changes in pain scores, quality of life, wound severity,
           segmental lower extremity pressures and endothelial function.

        3. Assess safety of EDTA-based chelation therapy in this patient population, defined as
           deterioration of renal function, symptomatic hypocalcemia or hypoglycemia within 8 hours
           of each infusion, or Class 4 heart failure within 24 hours of an infusion.

    <description>Segmental lower extremity pressures including Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP), Pulse Volume Recording (PVR) and ankle brachial index (ABI), will be obtained at baseline, after 20 and 40 infusions using the SensiLase PAD-IQ® . This test can be used to accurately detect the presence and severity of peripheral artery disease. Additionally, for patients entering the continued treatment phase, the test will be performed during infusion visits 45 and 50.</description>

Additionally, for patients entering the continued treatment phase, wound evaluation will be performed during infusion visits 45 and 50.</description>
