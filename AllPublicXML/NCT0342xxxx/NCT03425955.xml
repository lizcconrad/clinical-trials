      Aesthetic performance of &quot;SUNEKOS® 200&quot; injectable treatment on main sign of face skin aging
      in normotypic or overweight subjects with rounded, oval or squared face and in thin subjects
      with oval or triangular face and &quot;sagging&quot; skin.Interstitial or cushion technique in
      comparison to bolus technique at five points (half - face method within subjects).

      Spontaneous, open, clinical trial, conducted by one centre under dermatological control.
      Primary end point of the study was to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental
      measurements the aesthetic performance of &quot;SUNEKOS® 200&quot; injectable treatment on main sign of
      face skin aging in normotypic or overweight subjects with rounded, oval or squared face and
      in thin subjects with oval or triangular face and &quot;sagging&quot; skin.

      The micro-injections of the study product were executed by a specialized dermatologist, on
      the face of female volunteers with photoaging of mild/moderate grade; to improve the
      treatment aesthetic performance two different injection techniques were carried out
      mono-laterally on the left or right face side randomly: &quot;interstitial fluid technique&quot; (IFT)
      for the 1st subjects' typology (aged 35-50 years) and &quot;cushion technique&quot; in association to
      &quot;retrograde interstitial fluid technique&quot; (RIFT) for the 2nd (aged 45-60). On the
      contralateral face side the injection treatment was performed by bolus technique on five
      pre-determined face points, preceding for the 2nd subjects' typology by cushion technique.

      It was also aim of this study to evaluate tolerance both by investigator and volunteers and
      efficacy by the volunteers
