    <textblock>
      This study tests the hypothesis that, compared to prior normal blood sugar, prior low blood
      sugar impairs cardiovascular autonomic function. The proposed studies will also test the
      hypothesis that the effects of prior low blood sugar on cardiovascular autonomic function are
      blocked by administration of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

      This study involves three interventions, which are performed in random order. Each
      intervention involves a 3-day inpatient visit. There is a space of 1-3 months between
      interventions. The three interventions are: 1) placebo with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic
      clamp, 2) spironolactone with a hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp, or 3) placebo with a
      hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp. Each 3-day inpatient visit includes the following. On
      Day 1, autonomic testing is performed. Autonomic testing includes assessment of Baroreflex
      Sensitivity (BRS). BRS is assessed using the Modified Oxford procedure, which involves
      sequential administration of nitroprusside and phenylephrine while measuring heart rate and
      beat to beat blood pressure with a finapress and assessing Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity
      (MSNA). MSNA is measured using microelectrodes placed near the peroneal nerve. On Day 2,
      hyperinsulinemic clamps are performed with pre-treatment with either placebo or
      spironolactone. Modified Oxford Procedures are performed prior to and during each clamp on
      Day 2. On Day 3, the autonomic testing performed on Day 1 is repeated..

    <description>Participants undergo two 120-minute hypoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp procedures (50 mg/dL) - an AM clamp from about 9 am to 11 am and a PM clamp from 1 pm to 3 pm on Day 2 of a 3-Day study visit. Participants receive two doses of 100 mg of spironolactone - one dose 12 hours and one dose 3 hours before the first clamp starts. Modified Oxford Procedure is performed in duplicate at six time points - on Day 1, before the AM hyperinsulinemic clamp, during the AM hyperinsulinemic clamp, before the PM hyperinsulinemic clamp, during the PM hyperinsulinemic clamp, and on Day 3. The Modified Oxford procedure is performed to calculate baroreflex sensitivity.</description>

    <ipd_description>The data collected will comply with the NIH requirements for timely release and data sharing. Data will be shared in the form of publications and presentations in scientific forums. As the NIH has noted, the investigators reserve the right to keep the data restricted in order to perform the initial analyses for this grant proposal and will continue to use the data for further, but not prolonged, exclusive use. Of note, the sharing of this data will be limited by at least the following issues, some unique to this proposal and some not unique. Some of the data obtained in this study is defined to be sensitive in nature, which may restrict its ability to be shared. Data may only be shared with the approval of our IRB and is limited by HIPPA and any other regulations that may be promulgated during the course of this proposal.</ipd_description>
