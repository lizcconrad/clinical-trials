             contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, transdermal, implanted,
             and injected), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion,
             vasectomised partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line with the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.&quot; [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the
             duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception]

          -  If the patient is using oral corticosteroids, the weekly cumulative dose must not
             exceed 80 mg of prednisone equivalent; the weekly dose must be stable over the 4 weeks
             preceding the 1st dose of study drug.

          -  If the patient is using antimalarials, methotrexate, leflunomide, mycophenolate
             mofetil (MMF), or azathioprine, the start date must be at least 3 months prior to the
             1st dose of study drug, and the daily dose must be stable over the 4 weeks preceding
             the 1st dose of study drug.

          -  If the patient is not currently using corticosteroids, antimalarials, methotrexate,
             MMF, or azathioprine, the last dose (in case of previous use) must be at least 4 weeks
             prior to the 1st dose of study drug. For leflunomide, the stop date must be at least 8
             weeks before the 1st dose of study drug unless an adequate cholestryamine washout has
             been performed. If cholestyramine washout is performed, the last use of leflunomide
             must be at least 4 weeks before the 1st dose of study drug.

          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions, to remain at
             the study center for the required duration during each study visit, and to return to
