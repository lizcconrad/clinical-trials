  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A monocentric, parallel-arm, prospective, randomized therapeutic trial that compares the
      efficacy of two curative keratoconus treatment techniques by cross-linking collagen
      (accelerated conventional technique or iontophoresis). The primary endpoint will be the depth
      of the demarcation line measured by confocal microscopy and OCT at 1 month. This line
      represents the limit depth between treated and untreated stroma.

    <textblock>
      A two-arm, parallel, open-label, prospective, randomized therapeutic trial comparing two
      management strategies. The goal is to describe and compare, thanks to in vivo confocal
      microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT), the structural modifications observed
      postoperatively on evolutive keratoconus treated by cross-linking of collagen in accelerated
      procedure and iontophoresis. The study will be monocentric and will take place in the
      ophthalmology department of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital. Patients will be recruited
      through consultation dedicated to keratoconus (The ophthalmology department of
      Clermont-Ferrand is one of the 9 French centers of expertise for this pathology). Inclusion
      will be offered to all patients over 18 years old who meet the scalability criteria and who
      will benefit from a cross-linking procedure. Blind randomization will be performed between
      iontophoresis and accelerated procedure. The dates of the visits will be fixed, with a
      preoperative evaluation, and a follow-up follow-up on 6 months with controls at 1 month, 3
      months and 6 months. Confocal microscopy imaging and OCT will be performed during the
      preoperative visit and during visits at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.
