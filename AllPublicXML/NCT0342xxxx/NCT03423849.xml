  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, breast cancer is the most incident and prevalent cancer among women. Despite
      advances in the treatment of advanced breast cancer (ABC) during the past decade, adjuvant
      systemic therapy has yield little progression for such patients. ABC remains an incurable
      disease, responsible for approximate 40,000 deaths annually and a median life expectancy of
      no more than 3 years. The NCCN guidelines clearly define routine adjuvant chemotherapy
      regimens for the early breast cancer, however, for the patients with recurrence and
      metastasis, the choice of treatment options is not clear. In this trial, we choose the
      patients with disease progression who received anthracycline and taxane adjuvant chemotherapy
      after surgery. The patients received vinorelbine and gemcitabine (NG) or vinorelbine and
      platinum (NP) regiments for 6 cycles. Then the patients with complete response (CR), partly
      response (PR) and stable disease(SD) will be assigned to 3 groups, one group will receive the
      original regiment for 3 cycles to maintain treatment, one group will receive the vinorelbine
      for 6 cycles, the other group will receive the capecitabine for 6 cycles. Trasuzumab will be
      used to patients if HER-2 positive. Endocrine therapy will be used if the hormone receptors
      positive after the chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is to assess disease-free survival
      (DFS), the secondary endpoint is to assess the overall survival (OS).

      The trial is designed to help us to choose the maintain treatment regiment for the patients
      with effective first-line salvage therapy. After inorelbine and gemcitabine (NG) or
      vinorelbine and platinum (NP) regiments for 6 cycles, patients will be assess the effect of
      treatment. As for the patients with complete response (CR), partly response (PR) and stable
      disease(SD), the investigators will randomly assign them to receive 3 cycles of original
      regiment, or 6 cycles of vinorelbine, or 6 cycles of capecitabine. Trasuzumab will be used to
      patients if HER-2 positive. Endocrine therapy will be used if the hormone receptors positive
      after the chemotherapy. The effectiveness of therapy will be estimated after the maintain
      therapy. The first two years the patient was prescribed every 3 months to review the disease,
      then review the disease every six months. The primary endpoint is to assess disease-free
      survival (DFS), the secondary endpoint is to assess the overall survival (OS).
