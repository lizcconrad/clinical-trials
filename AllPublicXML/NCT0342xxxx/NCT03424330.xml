  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the safety, usability and efficacy of the ReX-C - a novel
      medication management system - in measurement and improvement of adherence, in patients
      receiving oral anti-coagulation therapy for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ReX-C is a mobile system intended to provide solid, oral medicine on patient demand,
      according to a pre-programmed treatment protocol. ReX-C addresses poor adherence to
      medication therapy by providing real-time, reliable adherence data to caregivers and timely,
      personalized reminders to patients.

      During the study, the use of ReX-C system to receive medications will be compared to Standard
      of Care. Patients' adherence will be evaluated for both methods.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will employ a randomized, controlled crossover study design.
The study comprises two stages:
Stage 1: ReX-C Intervention in which subjects will use ReX-C to receive medication.
Stage 2: Control, in which Treatment as Usual (TAU). All subjects enrolled for the study will participate in both stages in a randomized crossover mode.</intervention_model_description>
