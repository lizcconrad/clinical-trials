  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed tomography represents the mainstay for diagnosing various diseases in the whole
      body. Over the past decade, enormous efforts were undertaken by both CT manufacturers and
      radiologist to reduce the radiation dose to patients. Today, the dose is significantly lower
      that it was before the era of multislice CT and iterative reconstruction methods. The X-ray
      beam originating from the tube in a CT system contains a spectrum of different energies,
      whereby the &quot;harder&quot; beams with higher energy penetrate the patient better, and the &quot;softer&quot;
      beams will be absorbed through the patient's tissues. Recent research has been shown that the
      radiation dose can be further reduced by improved primary beam filtering in CT. This study is
      intended to compare the radiation dose in clinically indicated, routine CT examination while
      maintaining a diagnostic image quality, on a new CT system with modified primary beam
      filtering.

      At the Joint Department of Medical Imaging (JDMI), the investigators periodically adjust the
      radiation dose and modify the clinical imaging protocols in order to continuously optimize
      image quality in CT. The investigators have formalized the process of radiation dose
      adjustemnts by implementing a CT dose committee that meets on a monthly basis and reviews
      imaging protocols (SOP). The committee includes radiologists, technologists, vendor
      representative (if needed), managers and the radiation protection officer. Part of the review
      is the investigator's in-house developed Coral image quality review program as well as the
      clinically used radiation dose monitoring software (Radimetrics).

      Part of the evaluation study of the new CT system is to monitor 520 patients who will undergo
      a clinically indicated CT scan on the new system. Identical to stnadard-of-care (SOC) quality
      insurance, the investigators will use the existing monitoring software (Radimetrics, JDMI) in
      order to capture the data in the existing database. The investigators will also capture
      quality data through the existing CT image quality feedback tool. After installation of the
      new CT system, the investigators will maintain the radiation dose as currently applied in the
      standard JDMI wide imaging protocols and examine 20 patients on the new system; radiation
      dose and image quality feedback will be recorded in the identical fashion to standard
      operating procedures (CT image quality and radiation dose committee). Subsequently, the
      investigators will drop the dose by approx. 10% for each scanning protocol and scan the
      subsequent 250 patients while concurrently analyzing the impact on the collective dose to the
      patient population. Based on the expected increase in image noise, the investigators will
      calculate the possible additional dose reduction in percent and modify all protocols
      accordingly for the subsequent 250 patients. This step-down approach ensures that no CT scan
      will be performed with too little dose, and that all CT scans remain diagnostic.

    <ipd_description>Image quality data will be stored in our clinical data base identical to SOC. We will not create a new database for the purpose of the study. Radiation dose measurements will also be stored in our clinical database identical to SOC. The selection of the patients for the purpose of the study (radiation dose to the population) is being performed through the Radimetrics software that sorts the database based on the CT equipment used. We will get a full list of all patients who were scanned on the new system, with a graphical display of the radiation dose distribution in relation to the other clinical CT. This feature is routinely used for all other clinical CT scanner</ipd_description>
