  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral intravenous cannulation is one of the most common procedures performed in children
      admitted to hospital. It is a painful and anxiety-provoking gesture for children with
      possible memorization of the pain even more present for patients with chronic pathology.
      Nevertheless, this care is essential to administer the treatments.

      The cannulation is usually set up by the observation and touching of the veins by the nurse.
      However, this technique is often insufficient in young children and especially infants
      because they have a higher thickness adipose tissue. Their veins are of small caliber, hardly
      visible and palpable which increases the probability of a failure of the insertion of the
      catheter at the first attempt.

      In the literature, different techniques are mentioned to promote the visualization of veins
      and thus the insertion of cannulation. The AccuVein速400 (AV400) system uses an infrared laser
      beam to project the image of superficial veins to the skin. In adults, AV400 has been shown
      to improve the success rate of insertion cannulation when venous capital is precarious. The
      question now arises as to whether this tool could be of interest to children who are
      particularly difficult to assist cannulation, especially the youngest of them.

      Investigator hypothesize that AV400 could bring a benefit to the placement of cannulation, in
      the child with a venous capital difficult to catheterize and thus increase the success of the
      cannulation at the first attempt.

      Children admitted to pediatric emergencies, pediatric day hospitals and the general pediatric
      ward, who are less than 3 years old and whose care requires the placement of a cannulation
      will be identified by the caregivers as potentially included.

      The DIVA score will be carried out by the nurse who takes care of the child thanks to the
      dedicated form. If the child has an Emla速 patch, this score will be achieved after removing
      the patch. The nurse that will achieve the score will be the same that will pose the
      intravenous cannulation. Children with an assessment score &lt;4 will not be included in the
      study but will still be counted.

      The nurse must perform the randomization by inquiring about the randomization week: standard
      method or AV400 method.

      The information will be made to the parents and the information form given. The parents'
      consent regarding the care of their child will be collected by the same nurse.

      The means of prevention of pain and distraction will be set up in box with the nurse and / or
      the auxiliary childcare and the parents. Peripheral intravenous cannulation will be performed
      by the nurse in collaboration with the auxiliary childcare.

      Caregivers and parents will evaluate the care. The documents concerning the practical
      realization of the study will be grouped together and made available in each service in
      dedicated bins.
