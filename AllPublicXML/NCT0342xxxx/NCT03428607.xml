    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, multi-center phase II study of AZD6738 and olaparib combination
      therapy in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a second or third line
      chemotherapy.

      Patients will receive AZD6738 and olaparib combination therapy. The arm is composed of 45
      patients.

      AZD6738 160mg QD per os administered for 7 days and olaparib 300mg BID per os administered
      daily. One cycle is considered of 28 days.

      Tumour evaluation using RECIST 1.1 will be conducted at screening (within 28 days prior to
      first dose) and every 8 weeks relative to the date, up to week 56, then every 12 weeks until
      objective disease progression (within a window of ± 7 days of the scheduled date).

      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression (unless other criteria
      for treatment discontinuation are met). Patients may continue AZD6738 and olaparib beyond
      progression (according to RECIST 1.1), at the discretion of the investigator if they are
      clinically benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation
      criteria.

      If a patient discontinues study treatment prior to disease progression, they should continue
      to be assessed using RECIST 1.1 until disease progression and then followed up for survival.

      Assessments for survival should be made every 8 weeks following objective disease
      progression. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation
      of AZD6738 and olaparib treatment, will be collected.

      The imaging modalities used for RECIST 1.1 assessment will be CT or MRI scans of chest,
      abdomen and pelvis. RECIST 1.1 scans will be analysed by the investigator on site.

      Patients may also be requested to provide tumour samples from the primary or metastatic
      tumours on progression to understand resistance mechanisms. Sample provision is optional and
      depend on the patient's will.
