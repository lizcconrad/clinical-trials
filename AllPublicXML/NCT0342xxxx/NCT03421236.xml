  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the fourth and eighth most common malignancy among men and women,
      respectively. About 75% of bladder cancers are diagnosed as non muscle-invasive and according
      to specific tumor-stage and grade characteristics, intravesical immunotherapy with Bacillus
      Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) is used to prevent recurrence and/or progression. However, BCG
      immunotherapy is associated with significant adverse events and treatment failure may occur
      in 30-40% of cases, hence the necessity for alternative therapies. In an orthotopic MB49
      mouse bladder cancer model, another bacterial vaccine (Ty21a/Vivotif) turned out to be more
      effective than BCG for inducing tumor regression and mice survival upon intravesical
      instillation; and potentially safer because Ty21a bacteria did not infect/persist in any mice
      tissues nor in human bladder explants or cell lines, in contrast to BCG. Ty21a/Vivotif has
      been used in the last 30 years in millions of individuals as an oral typhoid vaccine with a
      high safety record. In this phase I trial we will be testing the safety of intravesical
      administration of Ty21a and its effect on bladder immunity in non-muscle invasive bladder
      cancer (NMIBC) patients, for whom recommendation of BCG therapy is not mandatory.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an intermediary or low risk of progression of bladder cancer (according
             to an EORTC score and clinical considerations) and thus not requiring BCG
             immunotherapy will be included after a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor
             (TURBT). Male and Female patients aged &gt; 18yrs, with a Karnofsky performance status of
             60% or more, sero-negative for HIV, HBV and HCV and with laboratory parameters for
             vital function in the normal range or with abnormalities without clinical significance
             may be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with NMIBC that require BCG treatments or with muscle-invasive bladder
             cancer, sero-positive for HIV, HBV and HCV or with other serious illnesses (e.g.,
             serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding disorders, autoimmune disease),
             will be excluded.
