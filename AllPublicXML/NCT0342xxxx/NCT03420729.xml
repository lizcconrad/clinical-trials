  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspepsia is a common presenting complaint that doctors have to manage and this is true both
      in the primary and secondary care setting. OGD is a useful test for investigating a variety
      of suspected upper GI disorders including dyspepsia. However, it is uncomfortable for
      patients and incurs the risk of intubation and sedation. Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the
      investigation of choice for diseases of the small bowel. It is safe, non-invasive and well
      tolerated, the main risk being capsule retention occurring in up to 1-2% of procedures.

      The investigators wish to undertake a prospective study comparing acceptability and
      tolerability of MACE and OGD in the investigation of dyspepsia. Patients presenting to
      general practice or the outpatients department with symptoms of dyspepsia who are referred
      for investigation are invited to take part in the study. Patients will undergo MACE prior to
      OGD performed by an endoscopist blinded to the MACE findings. . A comparison of tolerance and
      acceptance of both procedures will be measured by means of using structured and validated,
      qualitative questionnaires. The aim is to assess for whether there is a significant
      difference between the perception and experience of both modalities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single blinded, comparative trial of patient acceptability and
      tolerance of magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy and gastroscopy for the investigation of
      dyspepsia.

      The study will be conducted within Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. Recruitment will take place
      at the Sloan Medical Centre, the Royal Hallamshire Hospital or the Northern General Hospital
      during the consultation when patients present with dyspepsia requiring gastroscopy for
      investigation as per national guidelines. MACE will take place at the Sloan Medical Centre.
      Equipment for collecting demographics (height, weight etc) will be available. All the capsule
      equipment is stored and re-charged in this designated room. The case report files and
      computer data will be stored in this room that is secured by a locked door.

      Gastroscopy will take place in the Endoscopy Departments, which are specially designed units
      for a variety of endoscopic tests, at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Northern General
      Hospital.

      Patients are assessed in the Sloan Medical Centre or the Royal Hallamshire Hospital/Northern
      General Hospital outpatients department for their primary presenting complaints of dyspepsia.
      The study will be discussed with patients in those who satisfy the enrolment criteria. If in
      agreement to enter the study, informed written consent will be obtained from the patient.
      Prior to any investigation, the pre-MACE section (1) of the questionnaire will be completed
      by the patient with the assistance of study team members. MACE will be performed at the Sloan
      Medical Centre before the OGDÍ¾ this will be in a dedicated room setup to accommodate the MACE
      procedure (see Figure 1). The post-MACE section (2) of the questionnaire will then be
      completed by the patient with the assistance of study team members. MACE will be preceded by
      obtaining measurements of height, weight and waist/hip circumference. The patient will be
      given 500 to 1000mls of water with 6 drops of simethicone added to drink. This is to enable
      adequate distension of the stomach.

      The patient then swallows the capsule in the presence of the PI. MACE of the oesophagus and
      stomach will be carried out by the PI. Once the PI is satisfied that an adequate examination
      has been completed the capsule will be allowed to pass into and through the small bowel.
      Visibility of major locations of the stomach will be documented. Any pathology noted will be
      recorded according to the standard fashion described for OGD reporting. A note of the
      procedure duration will be recorded. The patient will complete their small bowel capsule
      endoscopy in the standard way and this will be reported in the usual fashion.

      Patients will also be referred for OGD as part of the normal pathway for investigation of
      dyspepsia. After MACE patients will attend a designated list for their OGD within 1 week and
      this will be performed by a JAG accredited endoscopist who has experience in endoscopic
      therapy. The endoscopist performing the OGD will be a member of the study team. The
      participant will be asked to complete the pre-OGD section (3) of the participant
      questionnaire before, and the post- OGD section (4) after the procedure. OGD will be
      performed in the standard fashion and reported to the PI to compose a written record for
      study purposes. This reporting system (InfoFlex) requires details to be entered regarding
      indication for examination, patient comfort, sedation and pathology. Pathology will be
      documented in a standardised way (for further details see section on Scientific
      Justification). An entry of the duration of procedure will be included. This denotes the end
      of the participants' involvement in the study. The patient will be managed thereafter
      according to the responsible clinician at the Sloan Medical Centre or Sheffield Teaching
      Hospitals NHS Trust
