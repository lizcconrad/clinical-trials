    <textblock>
      The purpose of the experiment is to investigate the effect of known genetic variants in
      organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) on the effect of morphine after major surgery. This is
      primarily done by investigating systemic exposure of morphine in a cohort of patients
      undergoing scheduled laparoscopic colon or laparoscopic rectum surgery, and as pain treatment
      with intravenous (iv) morphine at the end of and after surgery (primary endpoints). As a
      secondary endpoint, we will investigate the effect (pharmacodynamics) of morphine in the same
      patients by registering pain during rest and activity, side effects and the degree of
      sedation at appropriate time intervals.

    <description>The study was designed as an open, non-controlled drug trial, with scientists and participants blinded to the patients OCT1 status. Morphine will be given as a single dosis (0,15 mg/kg) at the end of the Surgery and later as boluses of 0,04mg/kg administrated by patient-controlled analgesia, (PCA). Blood samples with drug concentrations will be used to determine a difference in morphine AUC due to the patients OCT1 status. Questionnaire answers will be used to determine the effect of morphine due to the patients OCT1 status</description>
