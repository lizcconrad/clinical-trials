  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the potential of group metacognitive therapy in alleviating emotional
      distress in cancer survivors. The investigators aim to find out if a group based approach is
      acceptable to patients and feasible to deliver in a routine clinical health psychology
      service.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival rates in cancer continue to improve, with over 2 million adult cancer survivors in
      the United Kingdom, projected to increase to 4 million by 2030. Around 25% of these survivors
      require treatment for clinical levels of emotional distress. Current pharmacological
      treatments are not very effective and are not well tolerated by patients, who prefer
      psychological treatments. However, meta-analyses of well-controlled studies of psychological
      treatments indicate that these achieve only small effect sizes. Reflecting this limited
      efficacy in the face of the need for psychological treatment, the National Cancer
      Survivorship Research Initiative highlighted development and evaluation of practically
      feasible interventions for depression and anxiety in cancer survivors as an urgent research
      priority. It is recognised that current influential psychotherapeutic approaches need to be
      modified to meet the specific needs associated with cancer. However modifications have been
      pragmatic rather than theory-driven and have not improved efficacy.

      The study addresses the stages of 'development' and 'piloting and feasibility' in Medical
      Research Council guidance on intervention development, albeit with a relatively well-defined
      starting point given existing evidence for efficacy of metacognitive therapy (MCT) in other
      settings and promising preliminary evidence of applicability in cancer. The investigators
      will conduct a phase I open trial to test the potential efficacy of group MCT in cancer
      survivors and the hypothesised causal metacognitive mechanisms underpinning treatment
      response.

    <description>Group metacognitive therapy (MCT) is a brief psychological intervention designed to be delivered in small groups of 4-8 patients over a course of six, 90 minute sessions conducted on a weekly basis</description>

    <description>Group MCT is based on a manualised protocol and is structured in the following way. In session 1, idiosyncratic case formulations based on the generic metacognitive model are developed for each participant. Socialization helps patients to understand that worry/rumination and unhelpful coping strategies are maintaining emotional distress. Patients are then introduced to, and practice well established treatment techniques to modify negative beliefs about uncontrollability of rumination/worry. Later sessions address relapse prevention and involves modifying remaining use of the 'cognitive attentional syndrome', reviewing residual conviction in positive and negative beliefs and consolidating and strengthening alternative ways of responding to negative thoughts.</description>
