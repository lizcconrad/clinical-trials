  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the existence of an effective screening test (pap smear), cervical cancer is, every
      year in France, the cause of more than 3,000 new cases and 1,100 deaths. But, in France, 4 in
      10 women are not screened or not often enough (nearly 7 millions women). It is therefore
      necessary to develop new strategies to reach these women. The etiological factor of this
      cancer is persistent infection with oncogenic High-Risk Human PapillomaVirus (HR-HPV).
      Thereby, HPV-based tests could be alternative screening tests. Vaginal self-sampling with
      HR-HPV test is simpler and less intrusive than the pap smear. It has been shown that vaginal
      self-sampling with HPV test is a powerful means to increase the participation rate in
      cervical cancer screening. The investigators hypothesize that it is possible to optimize
      participation rate by improving the communication media associated to the vaginal
      self-sampling kit. This is why the accompanying letter and the leaflet explaining how to
      perform the vaginal self-sampling will be submit to women opinion by using the Focus Group
      method. The objective is to identify improvement ideas of these two communication media.

    <description>Each Focus Group of 10 women will be led by a psychologist according to a semi-directive interview pattern. This interview guideline specifies in details the ideal proceedings of Focus Group, as well as the various predetermined topics to be addressed in the form of questions and / or relaunches.
