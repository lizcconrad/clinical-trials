      To evaluate the correlation between pre-surgical 4DCT-ventilation imaging and post-surgical
      lung function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the correlation between pre-surgical 4-Dimensional Computed
      Tomography-ventilation (4DCT-ventilation) imaging and post-surgical lung function. To
      determine whether 4DCT-ventilation is a better predictor of post-surgical lung function than
      nuclear medicine imaging using pulmonary function tests (PFTs). To determine whether
      4DCT-ventilation is a better predictor of post-surgical lung function than nuclear medicine
      imaging using quality of life (QOL) questionnaires. Evaluate cost-effectiveness of using
      4DCT-ventialtion and VQ scans for pre-surgical assessment. To use longitudinal (pre and
      post-surgical) 4DCT-ventilation imaging to derive novel post-surgical prediction formulas.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation between 4DCT-ventilation-based %PPO PFTs and true, post-operative PFTs. The %PPO PFT values are a standard part of a pre-surgical work up and are used to classify patients according to surgical risk categories. %PPO PFTs are calculated by scaling the pre-surgical PFT values by the amount of lung function that will be lost due to surgery; where the amount of lung function lost is estimated from the lung function imaging scan. We will calculate %PPO PFTs with both nuclear medicine VQ scans and 4DCT-ventilation imaging.</description>

    <description>The patient will undergo 4DCT imaging. The 4DCT imaging data along with image processing techniques will be used to generate a 4DCT-ventilation map. All surgical decisions will be based on the current standard of care imaging (VQ scans) and not on the 4DCT imaging results.</description>
