      A Multicenter, observational Data Collection Study to Evaluate the Safety and Performance of
      the Nexus™ Aortic Arch Stent Graft System in patients that were implanted with the device as
      part of Compassionate Use Procedures.

      The purpose of the study is to collect and analyze data that is recorded as standard of care
      for patients that were implanted with the Nexus device as part of Compassionate Use
      Procedures.The data will be used to obtain additional information on the safety and
      performance of the Nexus™ Aortic Arch Stent Graft System in patients affected by pathologies
      involving the aortic arch.

      Data will be collected at each time point of patient's follow up conducted according to the
      standard of care in each site.
