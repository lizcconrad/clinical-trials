  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in China, and the incidence and
      mortality rate are second in malignant tumors. The treatment of gastric cancer need
      integrated multidisciplinary treatment, and surgery is the only possible curative method for
      gastric cancer at present. Previous studies have reported that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy
      can downstage primary tumor to increase radical resection rate in order to improve the
      long-term prognosis of advanced gastric cancer. However, there is no study on the application
      of hypo-radiotherapy to neoadjuvant radiotherapy in gastric cancer. The aim of this study was
      to observe the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limited toxicity (DLT) of
      hypo-fractionated radiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer.

      After enrolled in this study, the patient was first treated with radiotherapy, concurrent
      with oral S-1 80mg/m2/day, on radiotherapy days. 3 weeks after the end of radiotherapy,
      patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and S-1. Oxaliplatin is given
      on dose of 130mg/m2 iv on day 1; S-1 on 40-60mg po BID on day 1-14, oral. Imaging evaluation
      was performed 3 weeks after neoadjuvant treatment. The radical operation and surgical
      procedure were determined on MDT discussion. Non-operable patients continue with 3 cycles of
      chemotherapy, and the chemotherapy regimen can be changed. A 3 cycle of SOX adjuvant
      chemotherapy was performed after surgery.
