  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic acidosis is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and is a common
      complication in patients who have received a kidney transplant. Kidney transplant recipients
      (KTR) with lower serum bicarbonate levels, even within the normal range, have an increased
      risk of graft loss and mortality. The investigators propose a prospective, double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, 18-week crossover pilot study to examine the effects of
      sodium bicarbonate on vascular endothelial function, graft function, and cognitive function
      in 20 KTR patients.

    <measure>Change in Brachial Artery Flow-Mediated Dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8, 10, and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Brachial artery Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) will be determined using high-resolution ultrasonography (Toshiba Xario 200) as described originally by Celermajer et al., and more recently by our group. FMD will be measured at the beginning and end of each study period for a total of 4 measurements. ECG-gated end-diastolic ultrasound images and Doppler flow of the brachial artery will be acquired during baseline and FMD conditions.</description>

    <measure>Change in Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGF-B1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8, 10, and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary TGF-B1 will be measured from 24-hour urine collections. It will be measured by a commercially available ELISA (R&amp;D Systems). The within day precision for this assay is 6.7% at 257 pg/ml. All measurements will be performed at the Children's Pediatric CTRC at Children's Hospital Colorado.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8, 10, and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox computerized tests to evaluate 1) attention, 2) episodic memory, 3) working memory, 4) language, 5) executive function, and 6) processing speed.</description>
