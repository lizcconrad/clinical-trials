  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The innovation in this preliminary study is the use of message reminders in patients after
      myocardial infarction in stage I of rehabilitation (ie discharge from hospital) at home via
      SMS, compared with studies of patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation (stage II)in the
      hospital physiotherapy department.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first stage of rehabilitation begins during hospitalization. Motivation for the
      rehabilitation process for the patient. At this stage there will be preparation for release
      and guidance for the patient and their families regarding secondary prevention and return to
      domestic activity. This stage includes mobility, walking, controlled motility and gradual
      joint activation to maintain ranges and prevent complications from prolonged immobilization
      in bed.
