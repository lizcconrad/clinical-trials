  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to preliminary assess safety and efficacy of an adaptive Deep
      Brain Stimulation (DBS) closed-loop method in patients with PD.

      The study has been designed as a double blind randomized crossover trial that uses
      conventional DBS as a concurrent control in PD patients in need of Implantable Pulse
      Generator (IPG) replacement.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PD patients in need of IPG replacement will be screened to identify the ones eligible for
      enrollment.

      Randomized patients will undergo 2 days of experimental sessions (i.e. one per each type of
      stimulation mode, cDBS and aDBS), in a well-controlled environment (i.e. during
      hospitalization). During each experimental session experienced neurologists will collect
      information on safety and efficacy endpoints.

    <description>The investigational medical device (&quot;AlphaDBSvext&quot;) is a portable, external, dual mode stimulator that can deliver adaptive DBS or conventional DBS for the treatment of PD.
In the adaptive mode, the device records Local Field Potential activity from the implanted DBS electrode and simultaneously delivers stimulation through the same electrode based on the recorded signal.</description>
