      • to assess the feasibility of implementing ultrasonography and Range of motion (ROM) as
      objective measurements to correlate the improvement of the knee mobility with the pain
      reduction of the affected knee in the patients assuming nutraceutical containing HA.

      The secondary objectives of the trial are:

        -  to assess the feasibility of implementing Actigraphy as objective measurements to
           correlate the improvement of the knee mobility with the pain reduction (optional).

        -  to evaluate the enrollment range in one month.

      The explorative objectives of the trial are:

      • Preliminary data on efficacy of the tested product

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any gender and age from 50 to 70 years

          -  Symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee with mild joint discomfort for at least 6
             months prior to enrollment, following ACR criteria with history and physical
             examination (1). Subjects diagnosed with bilateral knee OA will be asked to specify
             the most affected knee at baseline, and this knee will be evaluated throughout the
             study period.

          -  Available confirmatory X-ray (performed within the previous 6 months) diagnosis
             (Kellgren/Lawrence score 2) at the evaluated knee joint (2).

          -  Subjects experienced pain for at least 15 of the 30 days prior to the start of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have any inflammatory arthritic condition (different from the OA of the
             knee), fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis or autoimmune disorder.

          -  Treatment with oral corticosteroids within 4 weeks before screening.

          -  Intra-articular injections of HA or corticosteroids in the target joint within 3
             months before screening.

          -  Treatment with anti-inflammatory or chondroprotective drugs (chondroitin sulfate,
             glucosamine, methylsulfonylmethane, HA, diacerein) 2 weeks before the selection.

          -  HA-containing nutritional supplements or cosmetics during the month before the study.

          -  Previous surgical treatment of knee joint(s) or its necessity; complication(s)
             necessary for hospitalization and surgical treatment.

          -  Significant injury to the target joint within the past 6 months prior to screening
             (identified from medical history).

          -  Subjects following an energy-restricted diet for weight loss.

          -  Pregnant women, nursing mothers, or women (only if childbearing potential) not using
             adequate methods of contraception.

          -  Subjects with cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or hematologic illness, or
             other medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             compromise participation or be likely to lead to hospitalization during the course of
             the study.

          -  Participation in an interventional clinical study in the previous 30 days.

          -  Presence of any clinically significant medical condition judged by the investigator to
             preclude the patient's inclusion in the study.
