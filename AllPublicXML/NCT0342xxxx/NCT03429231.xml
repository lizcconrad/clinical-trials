    <description>To evaluate the quality of life in healthy postmenopausal women who are taking Coenzyme Q-Ubiquinol for 3 months in comparison with another group that does not take them. The Cervantes Health-Related Quality of Life scale for menopause will be used for this outcome. In that scale next to the 0 and the 5 there are words that describe two opposite answers to the question. Between the 0 and the 5 there are also four boxes numbered 1 to 4. The participants should answer the questions by checking the box that best represents what they think and feel. In other words, they should check 5 if they are completely agree and 0 they are completely disagree. If they are not completely agree or disagree, they should check the boxes in between</description>
