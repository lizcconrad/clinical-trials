  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) contributes importantly to mortality and morbidity. Prevention
      of CVD by lifestyle change and medication is important and needs full attention.

      In the Netherlands an integrated program for cardiovascular risk management (CVRM), based on
      the Chronic Care Model (CCM), has been introduced in many regions in recent years, but
      evidence from studies that this approach is beneficial is very limited.

      In the ZWOT-CASE study the investigators will assess the effect of integrated care for CVRM
      in the region of Zwolle on two major cardiovascular risk factors: systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) in patients with or at high
      risk of CVD.

      This study is a pragmatic clinical trial comparing integrated care for CVRM with usual care
      among patients aged 40-80 years with CVD (n= 370) or with a high CVD risk (n= 370) within 26
      general practices. After one year follow-up, primary outcomes (SBP and LDL-cholesterol level)
      are measured. Secondary outcomes include lifestyle habits (smoking, dietary habits, alcohol
      use, physical activity), risk factor awareness, 10-year risk of cardiovascular morbidity or
      mortality, health care consumption, patient satisfaction and quality of life.

    <description>The intervention under study will be the integrated care for cardiovascular risk management (CVRM), based on the Dutch CVRM guideline. Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a high cardiovascular risk (CVR) (&gt;10%) or use of antihypertensives or lipid lowering drugs are included in the program. Patients will be invited for an intake consultation, including a blood test, an interview, physical examination and estimation of the 10-years cardiovascular risk. If indicated, treatment with medication will be started and general lifestyle advises will be given. Patients can be referred to smoking cessation therapy, dietician and exercise programs or a physiotherapist. Patients will be controlled on a regular base to evaluate and adjust their personal goals.</description>

    <description>Usual care will be based on the Dutch CVRM guideline, describing how to calculate the CVR and advices to lower this risk by lifestyle intervention and/or medication. However systematic identification of patients eligible for CVRM, actively inviting patients for a visit, regular follow-up and standardized collaboration with other disciplines in the health care chain are not necessarily part of usual care.</description>

        patients with a high (&gt;10%) ten year risk of CVD morbidity and mortality based on the Dutch
