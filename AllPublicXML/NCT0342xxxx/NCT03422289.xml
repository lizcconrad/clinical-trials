  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PCOS patients are initially treated with 2 g myo-inositol and 0.2 mg folic acid, two times
      per day by oral route, for three months. Among them, the subjects who have not ovulated
      despite this treatment are administered with 2g myo-inositol and 0.2 mg folic acid plus 50 mg
      α-lactalbumin for three months. Most of them improve and achieve ovulation. Therefore, the
      combination of α-lactalbumin with myo-inositol allows to get a significant result in the
      treatment of PCOS patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome is a complex chronic condition inducing several related disorders,
      such as subfertility and pregnancy complications. So far myo-inositol, successfully used in
      PCOS, has not been always effective in all patients. Aiming at overcoming this drawback, we
      tested a new formulation with myo-inositol and α-lactalbumin, in consideration of the effects
      exerted by α-lactalbumin in favoring molecule passage among body compartments, and also in
      consideration of its anti-inflammatory activity.

      Only PCOS patients, according to Rotterdam ESHRE-ASRM criteria, with anovulation and
      infertility &gt; 1 year, were included in the study. Following a treatment with 2 g myo-inositol
      and 0.2 mg folic acid, a part of them are resistant and do not ovulate.

      These non-responders to myo-inositol alone undergo the second phase of the study, receiving
      2g myo-inositol and 0.2 mg folic acid plus 50 mg α-lactalbumin for three months. After this
      combined treatment, the majority of them ovulate, showing a hormone and lipid profile
      improvement. In addition, myo-inositol plasma levels at the end of the treatment are
      significantly higher than at baseline and comparable to those patients who respond positively
      to myo-inositol alone.
