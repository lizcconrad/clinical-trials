  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is rare. First-line treatment is corticotherapy. Then,
      several second-line treatments (SLT) are available: splenectomy, off-label rituximab and
      thrombopoietin-receptor agonists since 2009. The compared efficacy and safety on clinical
      events in the long-term are unknown. The main objective of the FAITH study is to build the
      cohort of all treated adult persistent (â‰¥3 months) primary ITP patients in France, to assess
      the benefit-to-risk ratio of SLT in real-life practice. Data source is the database of French
      Health Insurance System (SNIIRAM) which covers the entire French population. It collects
      demographic, chronic disease, hospitalization and drug dispensing data. All patients with ITP
      were extracted from 2009 to 2012, and then every year for 10 years. The investigator will
      build the cohort from raw data. Outcomes (death, hospitalization, drug dispensing) will be
      compared according to SLT, with controls from the general population and untreated patients.
