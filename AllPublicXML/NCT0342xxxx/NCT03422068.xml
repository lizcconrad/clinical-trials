    <textblock>
      Part 1: Multiple Rising Dose (MRD) The primary objective is to investigate safety and
      tolerability of BI 1015550 in patients with IPF.

      The secondary objectives are to investigate the effect of BI 1015550 on the target engagement
      biomarker and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 1015550

      Part 2: On top of standard of care (SOC) The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the identified dose of BI 1015550 from Part 1 in patients with IPF on top of
      nintedanib and pirfenidone, respectively.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BI 1015550 when
      co-administered with nintedanib and pirfenidone.
