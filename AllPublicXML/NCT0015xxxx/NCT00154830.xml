  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent physical disabilities originating in childhood.
      Crouch gait is a common gait abnormality in patients with cerebral palsy, which is common
      treated with hamstring lengthening. This surgery can alter mechanical property of lower limb
      and affected ability of generating force in hamstring, leading changes in functional
      activities. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to investigate the effects of hamstring
      lengthening on pelvis and hip control while performing functional activity, including level
      walking and sit-to-stand.

      Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most prevalent physical disabilities originating in childhood.
      Crouch gait is a common gait abnormality in patients with cerebral palsy, which is common
      treated with hamstring lengthening. This surgery can alter mechanical property of lower limb
      and affected ability of generating force in hamstring, leading changes in functional
      activities. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to investigate the effects of hamstring
      lengthening on pelvis and hip control while performing functional activity, including level
      walking and sit-to-stand.

      Gait or motion analysis has been used widely in the diagnosis of patients with locomotor
      pathology and the subsequent planning and assessment of treatment. Ten subjects diagnosed
      with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy and crouch gait will be recruited and ten healthy
      controls will be recruited in this study with inform consents. Detailed physical examination
      and motion analysis experiments will be performed in normal group and in spastic diplegic
      patients before the hamstring lengthening and follow ip after six months. The subjects would
      be asked to perform level walking with self-selected pace and sit-to-stand from an armless
      chair. For each test, subjects would repeat at least 5 times, with their kinematic, kinetic
      and EMG data collected simultaneously. With thorough analysis and comparison of these data,
      it is hoped that a reference in clinical decision of hamstring lengthening can be
      established, and a complete knowledge of the effects after hamstring lengthening, which will
      be helpful for future clinical rehabilitation.
