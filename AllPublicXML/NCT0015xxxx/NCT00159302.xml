    <textblock>
      This pilot study will measure the baseline levels and the intra- and inter-subject
      variability of exhaled (alveolar and bronchial) and nasal NO in smoking subjects with mild
      and moderate COPD on or off steroid treatment, smoking healthy volunteers and non-smoking
      mild asthmatics off steroids, using multiple exhalation flow rates.

      In addition, exploratory markers of iNOS activity (eg. 3-nitrotyrosine, nitrite, nitrate and
      3-nitro-4-hydoxyphenylacetic acid) in blood, sputum, urine and exhaled breath condensate will
      be evaluated. We will also evaluate exhaled and nasal NO in a population of mild asthmatics
      in order to obtain baseline and variability data for future clinical studies involving
      asthmatic subjects.
