                  (ECG), or other heart disease classified NYHA III or IV.

               -  Liver disease such as cirrhosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or primary or
                  metastatic neoplasm.

               -  Gastrointestinal disorder such as GI bleeding, malabsorption syndromes,
                  post-gastrectomy, or active peptic ulcer disease.
