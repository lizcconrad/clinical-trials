      Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH)has become the most prevalent operation
      method in woman suffering from uterine myoma or adenomyosis nowadays. The operation decisions
      for these women are always due to symptoms such as pain, anemia and mass effect. However,
      there is a lack of measurement for these symptoms and therefore highlight the need to
      validate these symptom by health-related quality of life (QOL) assessments. Patients usually
      recovered better by LAVH comparing to traditional open surgeries. However, LAVH was
      restricted to cases with small size uteri and most QOL reported neglected uterine weight or
      were based on small uteri size. We recently intervened a new surgical procedure called RULU
      during LAVH and thus released this limitation. This will give a more unbiased study on the
      effect of QOL in patients receiving LAVH. In this study, we plan to use two questionnaires:
      the disease specific UFS-QOL and the WHO-QOL Taiwan version questionnaires for patients
      receiving LAVH. Assessment will be performed before operation; and 3 days, 7 days, 3 months
      and 18 months after operation. From these assessments, we plan to determine which QOL
      variables will be useful as operation guidelines for patients suffering from leiomyoma or
      adenomyosis, and for the assessment of appropriates and outcomes of LAVH.

      Hysterectomy is the most common non-pregnancy-related surgical procedure performed in women
      in Taiwan. There are three surgical approaches to hysterectomy: abdominal, vaginal and
      laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) and LAVH has become the most prevalent
      operation method in woman suffering from uterine myoma or adenomyosis nowadays. The operation
      decisions for these women are always due to symptoms such as pain, anemia and mass effect.
      However, there is a lack of measurement for these symptoms and therefore highlight the need
      to validate these symptom by health-related quality of life (QOL) assessments. Patients
      usually recovered better by LAVH comparing to traditional open surgeries. However, LAVH was
      restricted to cases with small size uteri and most QOL reported neglected uterine weight or
      were based on small uteri size. We recently intervened a new surgical procedure called RULU
