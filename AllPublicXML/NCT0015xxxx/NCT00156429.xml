  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective review of the data available on patients and their family members
      with HCM and prospective follow-up of this cohort for clinical outcome and diagnostic
      studies. Genetic samples are being examined in this cohort to determine whether certain to
      determine whether certain beta-AR polymorphisms as well as other common genetic polymorphisms
      are associated with different morphological features, such as LVH in patients with HCM and
      whether these polymorphisms influence the clinical course and outcome in patients with HCM.
      For that purpose, we will build a database with clinical information including serial
      echocardiographic measurements for patients with HCM that have regular follow up and test
      them for beta-AR polymorphisms as well as other common genetic polymorphisms and other known
      cardiac-related polymorphisms that can potentially contribute to the morphologic differences
      seen in patients with HCM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18+ years of age

          -  Diagnosed with HCM defined by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy with
             minimal wall thickness &gt;/= 15mm without the presence of hypertension or systemic
             disease that can account for the degree of hypertrophy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hypertension present prior to the diagnosis of HCM

          -  aortic stenosis with aortic valve area &lt; 1cm2

          -  known systemic disease that can cause LVH, such as infiltrative diseases
