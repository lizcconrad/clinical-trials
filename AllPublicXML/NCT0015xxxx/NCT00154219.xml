    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the
      investigational drug, lumiracoxib as compared to celecoxib and placebo in subjects with hip
      osteoarthritis. Both lumiracoxib and celecoxib belong to the same class of drug (COX-2
      selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]).
