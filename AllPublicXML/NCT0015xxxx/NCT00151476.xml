    <textblock>
      This is a registry-based observational study assessing clinical outcomes in FAP patients
      receiving celecoxib compared with historical/concurrent registry patients who have not
      received celecoxib.

      Both retrospective and prospective data will be utilized. No sampling methods apply.

      The study prematurely discontinued on April 11, 2008 due to slow enrollment. It should be
      noted that safety concerns have not been seen in this study and have not factored into this
      decision.

          -  Have received a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) within the last 3 months,

          -  Have pharmacological treatment recorded for their FAP disease at the defined index
             date.

      <desc>All SAEs, expected and unexpected, occurring while subject was receiving celecoxib during his/her prospective (on-study) participation in the study, regardless of the apparent relationship to the drug, were collected and reported to the sponsor.

          <description>All celecoxib treated subjects (includes Matched Celecoxib Treated and Not Matched Celecoxib Treated subjects); treatment prescribed outside clinical trial setting per routine medical care. Routine medical care: celecoxib is prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorization and as prescribed in medical practice. The assignment of the patient to celecoxib is not decided in advance by the study protocol but falls within current practice. All patients regardless of treatment status are followed according to local standard of medical care by the respective physicians.</description>
