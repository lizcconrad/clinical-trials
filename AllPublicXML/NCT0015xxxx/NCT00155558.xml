      To determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of 5-FU and leucovorin
      with novel 48-hour infusion schedule, and to collect toxicity profile at different dose level
      of 5-FU/LV 48-hour infusion.

      Colorectal cancer is one of the major in Taiwan.It caused 3128 deaths in 1999, and
      represented the No.3 cancer killer in both male and female population of Taiwan.

      Recently, evidence has accumulated that weekly, 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU may
      improve the response rate and survival time compared with 5-FU bolus regiment. In a
      randomized multicenter trial of metastatic colorectal cancer, Kohne et al reported an overall
      response rate of 44%and a median survival time of 16 months using a weekly-times-six schedule
      of infusional 5-FU (2600mg/m2 24-hours infusion). In another randomized study for advanced
      colorectal cancer, de Gramont et al reported a significantly better outcome in patients
      treated by a similar schedule which combined &quot;bolus plus infusional&quot; 5-FU compared to &quot;bolus&quot;
      5-FU. These results suggest that 24-or 48-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU is more effective
      than the conventional bolus schedules.
