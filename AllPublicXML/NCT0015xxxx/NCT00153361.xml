  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of an HIV prevention behavioral
      intervention to reduce sexual risk for HIV infection among non-injection, substance-using men
      who have sex with men (SUMSM). The primary goal of the intervention is to reduce HIV
      transmission by reducing the incidence of unprotected anal sex while under the influence of
      alcohol and other drugs (AOD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be the largest risk category for incident and
      prevalent cases of HIV and AIDS in the U.S. Studies of MSM have established an association
      between alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and risky sexual behaviors. Although studies have
      assessed and confirmed the association of AOD use and unsafe sex, few have focused
      specifically on reducing sexual risk of SUMSM.

      Sexual risk reduction interventions for MSM identified in the published scientific literature
      have demonstrated that they are generally effective at reducing sexual risk behaviors among
      MSM. However, none of these interventions specifically targeted non-injecting SUMSM. Thus, a
      gap exists in prevention efforts to reduce HIV transmission among SUMSM.

      The primary aim of the Project Mix overall is to develop and evaluate a practical
      intervention strategy that is specifically tailored to the needs of non-injecting SUMSM. The
      intent of the intervention is to decrease the number of unprotected anal sex partners (and
      acts) while under the influence of AOD and in general.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  be 18 years of age or older;

          -  self-identify as male;

          -  understand and read English;

          -  live within the metropolitan area;

          -  report being drunk or &quot;buzzed&quot; on alcohol 2 or more times or high on non-injection
             drugs at least once during (or two hours before) anal sex in the past six months;

          -  have had at least one unprotected anal sex episode in the past six months with a male
             partner of unknown or different HIV-status than their own (i.e., DUA)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  report only marijuana, only Viagra or only marijuana and Viagra use during anal sex
             (current research shows that marijuana use is not associated with sexual risk
             behavior);

          -  report injecting drugs (eligible if only methamphetamine, steroids, hormones and/or
             prescribed medications) in the past six months;

          -  have known their HIV-positive status for less than six months (this is done to allow
             for psychological and behavioral adjustment following an initial HIV diagnosis and
             this time frame coincides with our screening window); these men (if they so desire)
             will be put on a wait list and contacted after 6 months have passed since their first
             HIV-positive test result;

          -  are currently involved in another HIV behavioral intervention study for MSM [local
             study site identifies a list of such studies in their community at the time of the
             trial];

          -  have a specific plan to move from the metropolitan area within the next 15 months;

          -  participated in the pilot phase of the project;

          -  other reasons that the investigators deem would make participation either detrimental
             to the participant or to the study.
