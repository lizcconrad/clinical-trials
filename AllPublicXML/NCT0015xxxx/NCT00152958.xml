  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess sustained efficacy in patients who have responded to a 6
      month treatment with open-label pramipexole.

      Secondary objectives are the measurement of severity of the RLS, assessment of early
      withdrawal phenomena after termination of trial medication, augmentation under treatment,
      sleepiness, quality of life and subjective wellbeing, the physician's clinical assessment of
      symptom severity and improvement. Another secondary objective is safety and tolerability of
      treatment.
