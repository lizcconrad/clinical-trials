  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a separate protocol the Department of Genetic Medicine is proposing to carry out a study
      using gene transfer to treat the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of late
      infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL), a fatal, rare, recessive disorder of the
      (CNS) in children. In the context that there is little known about the genotype - phenotype
      correlations of LINCL, and that our referral far exceed the number (n=11) of children that
      will be entered into the gene transfer protocol, we are proposing to capitalize on this
      unique opportunity to evaluate this disorder in this separate study. In this context, the aim
      of this protocol is to study the genotype - phenotype correlations of the CNS manifestations
      of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. This will be accomplished by comparing the
      genotype to a neurologic assessment, and LINCL clinical rating scale; magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) assessments of the CNS; and routine
      clinical evaluations.

      This proposed clinical protocol is designed to assess genotype - phenotype correlations of
      LINCL, including a preliminary assessment regarding the genotype - phenotype correlations of
      progressive CNS deterioration inherent to this disorder. The trial will include the primary
      endpoint of neurological assessment including the LINCL clinical rating scale and parental
      evaluations; and the secondary endpoint of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopic (MRS) assessments of the CNS.

      The study will be carried out in children diagnosed with LINCL in all stages. The staging is
      based on a modification of the scale of Steinfeld et al (Steinfeld, 2002). The study
      anticipates a total n=30 children assessed over a period of 18 months. Of these, we
      anticipate that approximately two-thirds will not be entered into the proposed gene therapy
      protocol and thus approximately n=20 will be available for this study to be reassessed at 1
      year. Thus, we anticipate that we will be able to capture a one-time genotype - phenotype
      snapshot for all n=30, and a 1 year genotype - phenotype progression assessment for n=20.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A definitive diagnosis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis

          -  Between the age of 2 and 18 years

          -  Not previously participated in a gene transfer study for LINCL.

          -  Parents of study participants must agree to comply in good faith with the conditions
             of the study, including attending all of the required baseline and follow-up
             assessments.

          -  Both parents or legal guardians must give consent for their child's participation in
             the research study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with heart disease that would be a risk for anesthesia.

          -  Concurrent participation in any other FDA approved Investigational New Drug clinical
             protocol is not allowed, although the Principal Investigator will work with other
             doctors to accommodate specific requests (e.g., a study of nutritional supplements
             probably would not be a disqualification).

          -  Individuals who have a contraindication to MRI/MRS assessment including: (1) heart
             pacemaker and/or related implants; (2) metal fragment/chip in the eye or other sites;
             (3) an aneurysm clip in their brain; and (4) metallic inner ear implants.
