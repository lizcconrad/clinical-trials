  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary focus of this study is to collect information through diagnostic testing, blood
      sample analysis and patient data collection on patients starting hemodialysis to determine
      risk and preventative factors of bleeding and clotting events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis patients have a very high rate of heart attacks, strokes and amputation. These
      problems are caused by a blood vessel problem called atherosclerosis (hardening of the
      arteries), and by clotting. Clotting is also a problem in the access, which is their lifeline
      for hemodialysis. We have early results which show that some risk factors for clotting in the
      general population are common in dialysis patients. Bleeding is another significant problem
      within this population. In this pilot study we will measure bleeding/clotting factors in the
      blood of consenting patients who are just starting dialysis. We will also do special tests to
      show how much calcium build up and atherosclerotic build up has happened in the arteries and
      whether the arteries are becoming stiff. We will then follow patients for up to four years
      and record any health problems that might reflect bleeding, clotting or a blood vessel
      problem. At the end of the study, we will compare people who have had bleeding, clotting or
      blood vessel problem with those who have not, and learn which of the measurements predicted
      problems. We will go on to study potential treatments, such as anti-clotting drugs, which
      might prevent or delay the occurrence of such problems. This would improve the health of
      dialysis patients.
