      The Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ) is a new questionnaire that was developed to
      assess erectile attributes in men with erectile dysfunction. The study objective is to
      validate the Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ) through the evaluation of subject
      responses to the QEQ regarding the quality and hardness of erections at baseline compared to
      subject responses post 6 and 10 weeks dosing with Viagra (sildenafil citrate).
