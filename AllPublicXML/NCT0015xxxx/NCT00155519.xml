    <textblock>
      Current diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia are based on marked positive and negative
      symptoms. This definition may impede the exploration of basic phenomenological
      psychopathology or pathological mechanism of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia was found to have
      neuroanatomical, neurophysiological and neuropsychological impairment. However, the existence
      of these basic pathological states may not manifest as clinical state of schizophrenia, and
      it is found in normal relatives of schizophrenia proband. The clinical state of this
      underlying pathology may include so-called latent or early, or pseudo-neurotic schizophrenia
      or schizotypal disorder. The manifestation of prominent neurotic symptom state may not only
      present as an psychopathological issue, but also induce misdiagnosis in clinical practice.
      This may interfere early diagnosis of schizophrenia and may delay the chance of early and
      appropriate treatment.

      Taking the fact of this disadvantaged conditions, this research is for exploration of
      clinical pathology and neuropsychological functions of latent or pseudo-neurotic
      schizophrenia. The strategy ia a natural follow-up study on the clinical cases obtained from
      the registration record of the medical charts of the National Taiwan University Hospital from
      1970 to 1995. The natural follow-up results till study time (5 yrs to 30 yrs following
      period) will be explored. By using neurotic group (50 cases), latent schizophrenia group (50
      cases) and schizotypal group (30 cases), the differences in clinical pathology,
      neuropsychological functions and family history of schizophrenia will be examined. There are
      5 hypotheses to be tested: (1) Schizotaxia may exist as the manifestations of latent
      schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder and frank schizophrenia. The severity of pathology
      increased step by step; (2) The syndrome may change from the lower order to higher order to
      higher order, but not all of them changed to the higher order; (3) The clinical pathology of
      latent schizophrenia has both neurotic symptom as well as basic symptoms of schizophrenia;
      (4) There is the same kind of neuropsychological impairment of schizophrenia in the group of
      latent schizophrenia, and (5) The prevalence of schizophrenia in the first degree relatives
      of latent schizophrenia is higher than that of the general population. Finally, this study
      results will help the establishment of valid screening and/or diagnostic method (criteria) of
      latent schizophrenia for clinical and research usage.
