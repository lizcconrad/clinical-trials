  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of a simplified
      PI-based treatment regimen (Kaletra,ä) compared to conventional HAART regimens in patients
      infected with HIV-1 who are on their first boosted-PI antiretroviral treatment regimen.

      The potency of the antiviral activity of Kaletra has been clearly demonstrated in a wide
      spectrum of patients in a number of different clinical trials.6-9 The durable viral
      suppression seen after 4 years of therapy10 proves that it can provide effective, long-term
      treatment for people with HIV-1.

      Data from one of these trials (M97-720),6 an ongoing Phase II study of lopinavir/ritonavir in
      combination with NRTIs suggests there may be a role for monoclass therapy with Kaletra in the
      treatment of HIV-1-infection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has confirmed his or her willingness to participate in this study after being

             part, by signing and dating the IRB / IEC approved informed consent form.

          -  Subject is HIV positive and on their first antiretroviral treatment regimen, based on
             any two NRTIs plus lopinavir/ritonavir or a ritonavir-boosted PI combination. Subject
             must have had no previous exposure to other regimens.

          -  Subject has a viral load &lt;50 copies/ml at the time of baseline evaluation for at least
             6 months.

          -  Subject has a CD4 cell count ³ 100 cells/mm3.

          -  Subject is aged &gt;18 years.

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of
             acute illness.

          -  Subject has not been treated for an active opportunistic infection within 30 days of
             screening.
