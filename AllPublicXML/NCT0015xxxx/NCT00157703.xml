    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single site study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      intratumoral administration of G207 followed by treatment with radiation therapy in patients
      with recurrent/progressive malignant glioma.

      This study is a two stage phase 1 study, in which a de-escalating dosing scheme will be used,
      i.e. the first patients will receive the higher dose and if excessive toxicity occurs, the
      dose will be reduced for the following patients. The purpose of the dose de-escalation phase
      is to find the best safe dose of G207.

      In the first stage of the study, treatment with G207 will be followed by focal radiation
      therapy on the following day, and in the second stage treatment with G207 will be followed by
      gamma knife surgery also on the following day.

      All patients will return to the clinic 28 days and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after G207
      administration at which time clinical assessments will be performed, and will be followed for
      safety and survival at clinic visits or by telephone every 3 months for up to 2 additional
      years and annually thereafter.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically proven residual/recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, gliosarcoma or
             anaplastic astrocytoma which is progressive despite radiotherapy or chemotherapy

          2. Failed external beam radiotherapy &gt; 5,000 CGy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          3. Residual/recurrent lesion must be ≥ 1.0 cm and (for Stage 2 only) ≤ 4 cm in diameter
             as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          4. Normal hematological, renal and liver function

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3

               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3

               -  Prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &lt; 1.3 x control

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.7 mg/dl

               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl

               -  Transaminases &lt; 4 times above the upper limits of the institutional norm

          5. Karnofsky Performance Status score ≥ 70

          6. Age &gt; 19 years-old

          7. Capable of giving informed consent

          8. Must be willing to practice an effective barrier method of birth control for 2 months
             post G207 inoculation, whether male or female

          9. Females of childbearing potential: negative pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to
             G207 administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Surgical resection within 4 weeks of enrolment

          2. Acute infection, granulocytopenia or medical condition precluding surgery

             spinal fluid (CSF) dissemination

             of the cerebral ventricular system during inoculation with the study drug (Note: If

             must be aborted.)

             therapy

             herpesvirus protocol)

         13. Active oral or genital herpes lesion

         14. Any contraindication for undergoing MRI such as pacemakers, infusion pumps,
             ferromagnetic aneurysm clips, metal prostheses, etc.

         15. Radiation treatment volume of greater than 4 cm maximum diameter (Stage 2 only)
