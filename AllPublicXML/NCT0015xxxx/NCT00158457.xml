  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of Sub-saharian Africa, this trial evaluate one of the most simple treatment
      available for HIV-1 infected patients. The combination proposed is a triple antiretroviral
      therapy with only one intake of 3 pills per day. This combination has already been studied in
      the North countries.

      Here in Senegal, the efficacy and the compliance to treatment will be evaluated after 24, 48
      and 96 weeks of treatment.
