  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A well-known side-effect of cytostatics (drugs against malignancies) is a decrease in the
      number of white blood cells, especially of the so-called neutrophil granulocytes, which are
      very important for the defense against infections. Hence their decrease (called
      &quot;neutropenia&quot;) leads to a predisposition to infections.

      Since infections during neutropenia can be very dangerous, the patients are treated with
      antibiotics from the very first signs of such an infection (usually fever). If the
      antibiotics (drugs against bacteria) do not lead to a normalization of the body temperature
      within four days, a drug against fungi is added.

      In the IDEA study, one half of the patients receive the antifungal drug voriconazole (as
      usual) only in case the antibiotics alone do not lead to a normalization of the body
      temperature (current standard of care). The other half of the patients receive voriconazole
      immediately after onset of fever (concomitantly with the antibiotics).

      The research question is, whether in the &quot;early-treatment&quot; group fewer manifest fungal
      infections will be observed than in the &quot;late-treatment&quot; group.

      <recruitment_details>810 participants screened; 81 assigned to immediate voriconazole treatment and 66 to deferred voriconazole treatment. Study should be considered a pilot study; planned sample size (n=200) was not based on statistical power considerations.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Screening phase started with cytoreductive treatment; screening phase ended at onset of fever or if reconstitution of leukocytes to &gt;1000 per microliter (1000/uL) or neutrophils to &gt;500/uL. Randomization occurred within 18 hours after onset of fever (if febrile or had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay prior to onset of fever).</pre_assignment_details>
