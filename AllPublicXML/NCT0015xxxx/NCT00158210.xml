  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine abuse has been steadily increasing over the past decade. Rivastigmine is a
      medication that may be helpful in treating methamphetamine dependence. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of rivastigmine in treating methamphetamine dependent
      individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine is a powerful stimulant that affects the central nervous system. Chronic
      methamphetamine use often leads to psychotic behavior. Rivastigmine is an
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is currently approved to treat Alzheimer's-related
      dementia. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of rivastigmine in treating
      methamphetamine dependent individuals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either one of two dose levels of rivastigmine or
      placebo for 12 weeks. Participants will be assessed for cardiovascular, subjective, and
      reinforcing effects that are produced by methamphetamine. All participants will partake in
      contingency management sessions through Week 4.
