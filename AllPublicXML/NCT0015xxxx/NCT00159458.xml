      The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
      chemotherapy will be effective in reducing or eliminating the tumor(s) in patients with
      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

      Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for the treatment of pancreatic and lung cancer; oxaliplatin is a chemotherapy drug that is
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of colon cancer. Neither gemcitabine nor oxaliplatin
      are approved for the treatment of breast cancer. However, both drugs have been shown to
      decrease the size of breast cancer tumors.
