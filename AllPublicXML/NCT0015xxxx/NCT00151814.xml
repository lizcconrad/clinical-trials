      <recruitment_details>The recruitment period was from September 2005 to February 2008. This period lasted for this length of time because of difficulties in recruiting participants. Children from 12 months old to 16 years old were to be enrolled.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The 2-5 years old cohort had only 4 participants and their data were not sufficient for meaningful analysis. No participants in the 12-23 month old category were enrolled.</pre_assignment_details>
