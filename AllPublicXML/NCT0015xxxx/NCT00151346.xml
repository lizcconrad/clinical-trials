    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to compare the use of spinal-epidural versus traditional labor
      epidural on maternal and fetal effects. The hope is to determine the safest and most
      effective epidural method of relieving pain during labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE) was developed to allow excellent pain control for
      the pregnant woman who arrives in advanced labor and does not have much time for the
      anesthetic to have its effect. This has been extended recently to women in all stages of
      labor because of its rapid and excellent control of pain. Recent case series comparing CSE
      with traditional epidural have shown a slight difference in the rate of hypotension and fetal
      bradycardia, with the CSE technique having a higher rate of both of these side effects. This
      study will compare the two techniques in a prospective, randomized method.

      The aim is to compare the maternal and fetal effects of two neuraxial block techniques for
      pain control during labor, to document blood pressure changes in upper and lower extremities
      pre- and post- block placement, and to document side effects (e.g. pruritus) and patient
      satisfaction with both techniques.

    <description>Subjects assigned to this group will receive &quot;combined spinal-epidural&quot; (CSE) to relieve pain during labor. For CSE, subjects receive a small amount of a local anesthetic and a small amount of a narcotic pain killer directly into the spinal canal (a smaller amount than is given for traditional epidural), followed by a small amount of both of these medications that is continuously infused into the epidural space through a catheter that is left in place. CSE is not experimental.</description>
