      Null hypothesis of this study: Biliary atresia patients with cholestatic jaundice do not have
      systemic immunity defect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary atresia patients with cholestatic jaundice were noted to have increased incidence of
      infectious complications. Previous animal models of bile duct ligation with acute jaundice
      ever demonstrated impairment of both humoral and cellular immune function. We performed the
      immunity study in biliary atresia patients due to the lack of comprehensive systemic immunity
      study in pediatric cholestatic model. Systemic humoral immunity (total serum IgG, IgA, IgM,
      C3 and C4), specific cellular immunity (lymphocyte classification, mitogen response,
      cytokines level after PHA stimulation test), and non-specific cellular immunity (absolute
      neutrophil count, PMN CD11b/CD18 expression level, PMN superoxide release function, and PMN
      phagocytosis function) were tested. Association with serum bilirubin level, nutritional
      status and blood biochemical values were tested to see the relation between systemic immune
      function and cholestatic jaundice.
