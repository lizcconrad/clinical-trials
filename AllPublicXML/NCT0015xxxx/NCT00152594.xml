  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether voriconazole is as effective as antifungal
      prophylaxis in patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      Hypothesis: Voriconazole is superior to placebo in the prophylaxis of lung infiltrates until
      day 21 after the start of induction chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed or relapsed, de novo or secondary AML

          2. First induction chemotherapy cycle

          3. Expected neutropenic phase of a minimum duration of 10 days

          4. Age &gt;= 18 years

          5. Legally signed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known proven, probable or possible invasive fungal infection at randomization or in
             patient history

          2. Computed tomography (CT) with any signs of a fungal infection according to the
             European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycosis Study
             Group (MSG) criteria, i.e. with any infiltrate (Ascioglu, et al 2002)

          3. Any current fever unless explained by non-infectious causes

          4. Antibacterial prophylaxis other than TMP/SMX

          5. Liver function test [LFT] (AST/ALT/bilirubin) more than 3x the upper normal limit

          6. Subjects who are receiving and cannot discontinue one of the following drugs at least
             24 hours prior to randomization:

               -  Drugs with a known possibility of QTc prolongation (e.g. terfenadine, astemizole,
                  cisapride, pimozide, quinidine);

               -  Drugs whose plasma levels may be increased by voriconazole therapy (e.g.
                  sulfonylureas, ergot alkaloids, sirolimus, vinca alkaloids).

          7. Subjects who have received the following drugs within 14 days prior to randomization:
             potent inducers of hepatic enzymes that will reduce voriconazole levels (e.g.
             rifampicin, carbamazepine and barbiturates)

          8. Concomitant therapy with absorbable antifungals

          9. Patient has a diagnosis of acute hepatitis or cirrhosis due to any cause

         10. Known hypersensitivity or other contraindication to voriconazole

         11. Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

         12. Diseases or disabilities preventing the patient from participating in the trial

         13. Females of childbearing potential without negative serum pregnancy test at baseline or
             within 72 hours prior to start of study drug
