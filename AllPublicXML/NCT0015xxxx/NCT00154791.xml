  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a phase I/II clinical trial using biweekly gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and
      48-hour infusion of high dose 5-FU/leucovorin to treat patients with advanced pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. In the phase I part, the maximum tolerable dose of oxaliplatin in combination
      with biweekly gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 and 48-hour infusion of 5-FU 3000 mg/m2 and leucovorin
      300 mg/m2 will be determined. In the phase II part, the efficacy and safety of the biweekly
      chemotherapy with GOFL will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each dose of GOFL chemotherapy, intravenous infusion of gemcitabine at a fixed rate of 10
      mg/m2/min will be immediately followed by a 2-hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin and
      then a 48-hour intravenous infusion of 5-FU and leucovorin.The starting dose of oxaliplatin
      in the phase I part is 65 mg/m2, with dose increment of 10 mg/m2. Since the recommended dose
      for biweekly single dose oxaliplatin is 85 mg/m2, there will be no further dose escalation of
      oxaliplatin beyond 85 mg/m2.Patients will be entered in cohorts of three.If one out of three
      patients develops DLT, three additional patients will be accrued to the same dose level.9.1.3
      The six patients treated at the MTD dose level will be included in the phase II part of this
      study if only they have measurable lesion(s) prior to chemotherapy.For the phase II part, If
      three or more responders are observed in the initial 21 evaluable patients, the trial will
      proceed to the second stage. Additional 24 patients will be accrued in the second stage of
      the phase II part.
