  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few years several novel agents have been defined which are active in the
      treatment of relapsed epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Many of these new agents seemed to have
      mechanisms of action that are different from Carboplatin and taxol. This trial looks to
      evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of three sequential chemotherapy doublets in the
      treatment of women with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal or tubal carcinoma.

      Objective: To evaluate a novel regimen in ovarian carcinoma with an aim of demonstrating a
      higher than 50% laparotomy defined response rate. This rate is defined as the proportion of
      patients achieving either a pathologic complete response or a microscopic positive second
      look at the conclusion of therapy.

      Primary study goals:

      · To determine the efficacy of a triple doublet regimen in carefully defined cohorts of
      patients as defined by the surgical defined response rate

      Secondary study goals:

        -  To evaluate incidence of tubulin mutations in primary and secondary surgical specimens.

        -  To evaluate changes in IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, and FGF, at primary diagnosis, during and at
           the conclusion of therapy.

        -  To describe initial IL-6, IL-8, and FGF levels in patients who ultimately achieve
           pathologic remission vs those with gross residual disease.

      Patients will recieve 3 cycles of carboplatin and gemcitabine followed by 3 cycles of taxol
      and carboplatin and then three cycles of adriamycin and topotecan. All patients with a
      clinically complete response will then undergo second look operation to determine
      pathologically defined response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial carcinoma of müllerian origin. Specifically,
             ovarian, primary peritoneal and tubal carcinoma will be allowed. All histologic
             subtypes are eligible.

               -  Patients must have undergone an attempt at aggressive surgical debulking or
                  alternatively be eligible for interim debulking after cycle #3. Patients debulked
                  to no evidence of disease, microscopic disease or gross residual disease are
                  eligible.

               -  Stage II, III or IV disease. Patients with disease outside the abdominal cavity
                  are eligible unless presentation includes brain metastases.

               -  Able and willing to undergo a second look staging laparotomy.

               -  Patients must give written informed consent.

               -  Patient must be ag· Performance status (ECOG) &gt;2.

               -  Previous chemotherapy.

               -  Creatinine &gt; 1.5

               -  History of recent MI or congestive heart failure within 6 months of surgery

               -  SGOT &gt; 2x ULN, bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN

               -  Concurrent invasive malignancy. (Patients with concurrent superficial endometrial
                  carcinoma are eligible if their endometrial carcinoma is superficial or invades
                  less than 50% the thickness of the myometrium).

               -  Known hypersensitivity to E.coli derived products?

               -  Active psychiatric or mental illness that makes informed consent or careful
                  clinical follow-up unlikely e 18 years or older.

               -  Adequate bone marrow function with an ANC &gt; 2,500 and Platelets &gt;100,000/mm3.
