  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a one-year prospective, open-label, safety and efficacy study. De novo renal
      transplant recipients will be receiving cyclosporine, 1.44g EC-MPS (720 mg b.i.d.), and
      corticosteroids .The study will consist of a 12-month open-label treatment period on EC-MPS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Males and females aged 18-75 years. Recipients of de novo cadaveric, living unrelated or
        living related kidney transplants

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Multi-organ recipients (e.g. kidney and pancreas) or previous transplant with any organ.

        Patients who are recipients of A-B-O incompatible transplants. Patients with a historical
        or current peak PRA of 50%. Patients with already existing antibodies against the HLA-type
        of the receiving transplant.

        Evidence of severe liver disease (incl. abnormal liver profile i.e. AST, ALT or total
        bilirubin 3 times UNL).

        Patients who are HIV or Hepatitis B surface antigen positive. Patients with any known
        hypersensitivity to mycophenolic acid, MMF, EC-MPS, other components of the formulation
        (e.g. lactose).

        Patients with thrombocytopenia (75,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil count of &lt;
        1,500/mm3, and/or leukocytopenia (&lt; 2,500/mm3), and/or hemoglobin &lt; 6 g/dL at Screening or
        Baseline.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
