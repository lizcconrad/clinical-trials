  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate a possible interaction between formoterol and budesonide on GR-translocation
      and to compare the effect of different doses of Symbicort (80/4.5 and 2x80/4.5 mcg) with the
      effect of budesonide (200 mcg and 800 mcg) on GR translocation, and to investigate the effect
      of the study drugs on exhaled NO (bronchial and alveolar fraction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with mild steroid-naïve asthma (ATS criteria) of either sex with FEV1 &gt;70 %
             pred

          -  Able to produce sputum after sputum induction

          -  Exhaled NO (flow 50 ml/s) ≥ 20 ppb

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current upper respiratory tract infections

          -  Use of inhaled and/or oral GCS within 4 weeks prior to visit 1

          -  Treatment with antileukotrienes, theophylline, tiotropium and ipratropium within 2
             weeks prior to screening visit

          -  Hypersensitivity to any of the investigational drugs or lactose

          -  Use of any -blocking agent (including eye-drops)

          -  Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or planning a pregnancy during the study. Women

             asthma), gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine,
             metabolic, malignant, psychiatric, major physical impairment) which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or may influence the results of the study, or the subjects ability to
             participate in the study

          -  Inability to tolerate temporary withdrawal of bronchodilatory therapy

          -  Subjects not considered capable, as judged by the investigator, of following
             instructions of the study, e.g. because of a history of alcohol or drug abuse or any
             other reason
