  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to identify cyclosporine C2 levels during 12 months
      treatment , while cyclosporine microemulsion dosages are adjusted based on C0 cyclosporine
      blood samples, and retrospectively correlate C2 levels to outcome (renal function and
      incidence of acute rejections)
