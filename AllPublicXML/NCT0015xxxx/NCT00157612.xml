  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing home residents are frequently transferred to hospital for management of pneumonia.
      This often leads to hospital related complications and is a burden on the acute care health
      system. The purpose of this study is to assess whether managing residents with pneumonia and
      lower respiratory tract infection on site in the nursing home can reduce hospital admissions
      and can reduce complications and improve quality of life for residents. We have randomized
      residents with nursing home acquired pneumonia to on-site management, using a clinical
      pathway, versus usual care.

      We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial where nursing homes were randomized to
      either use of a clinical pathway or usual care for management of nursing home acquired
      pneumonia. The clinical pathway included chest radiographs performed on-site in the nursing
      home by a mobile x-ray unit, use of hypodermocylysis (subcutaneous infusion) for
      re-hydration, administration of an oral antimicrobials, and use of pulse oximetry to assess
      oxygenation. The main outcomes were hospital admission rate and length of stay. Secondary
      outcomes included health related quality of life, rates of both infectious and non-infectious
      complications within four weeks of onset of symptoms; mortality rate of residents with
      pneumonia (death from all causes within 30 days of onset of symptoms. Time to stabilization
      of vital signs, as well as functional status at four weeks, were assessed.
