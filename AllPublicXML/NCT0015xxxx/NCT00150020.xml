      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EC-MPS in maintenance
      renal transplant patients who experience gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance due to adverse
      events associated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and were converted to EC-MPS.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females aged 18-75 years.

          2. Recipients of first or secondary cadaveric, living unrelated or living related kidney
             transplant.

          3. Recipients who are at least 4 weeks post renal transplantation.

          4. Patients currently receiving MMF (all dosages are allowed), cyclosporine
             microemulsion, its generic equivalent, cyclosporine USP (modified) or tacrolimus with
             or without corticosteroids as part of their immunosuppressive regimen for at least 2
             weeks.

          5. Patients with mild and/or moderate GI complaints (e.g. upper abdominal pain,
             dyspepsia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting) with or without diarrhea.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Multi-organ patients (e.g. kidney and pancreas) or previous transplant with any other
             organ different from kidney (secondary kidney transplant is allowed).

          2. Evidence of graft rejection, treatment of acute rejection or unstable renal function
             within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit.

          3. Patients who have received an investigational immunosuppressive drug within 4 weeks
             prior to study entry.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
