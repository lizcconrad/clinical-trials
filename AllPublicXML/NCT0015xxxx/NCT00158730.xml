      To evaluate and compare two AmBisome dosing regimens for the initial treatment of invasive
      aspergillosis and other filamentous fungal infections diagnosed by modified EORTC criteria in
      immunocompromised patients, as determined by overall response rates at end of course of
      treatment.

      To evaluate and compare two AmBisome dosing regimens for the initial treatment of invasive
      aspergillosis and other filamentous fungal infections diagnosed by modified EORTC criteria in
      immunocompromised patients, as determined by overall response rates at end of course of
      treatment.

      Determine and compare the following parameters for the two treatment arms:

        -  Safety and tolerability

        -  Survival rates and the rates of infection relapse at 4 weeks Post Treatment.

        -  Survival rate at 12 weeks after study entry.

        -  Time to favorable overall response and time to End of Treatment for patients with
           favorable overall response.

        -  Cumulative dose of study drug given through End of Treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Immunocompromised due to hematologic malignancies, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia,
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, solid organ transplantation, other conditions
             resulting in severe neutropenia, HIV infection, prolonged corticosteroid therapy
             (greater than or less than 20 mg of Prednisone or equivalent for greater than or less
             than 3 weeks), treatment with other immunosuppressant medications, or other acquired
             or hereditary immunocompromising conditions that place the patients at risk for IFI.
             Evidence of Proven, Probably or Possible IFFI by modified EORTC criteria. Continued
             treatment with study drug is contingent upon confirmation of diagnosis of Proven or
             Probable IFI within 4 working days after study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy of less than 30 days; chronic IFI (defined as signs/symptoms of IFI
             present for less 4 weeks preceding entry into study;prior systemic therapy of greater
             than or less than 4 days with any polyene anti-fungal agent within 14 days of study
             enrollment;prior systemic therapy of greater than or less than 4 days with
             non-polyenes for the current, documented IFI. Use of another investigational,
             unlicensed drug within 30 days of screening or concurrent participation in another
             clinical trial using an investigational, unlicensed drug; serum creatinine greater
             than 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), serum ALT or AST less than 5 x ULN; pregnant or
             lactating women; history of allergy or serious adverse reaction to any polyene
             anti-fungal agent.
