  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will test the hypothesis that inflammation and insulin resistance contribute to
      reduced walking distance in subjects with intermittent claudication by impairing vascular
      reactivity and skeletal muscle metabolic function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), an important clinical manifestation of
      atherosclerosis, often suffer symptoms of intermittent claudication that impair their walking
      ability and adversely affect their quality of life. People with PAD are also at increased
      risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke and death.
      Unfortunately, medical therapies directed to the functional and limb-threatening
      manifestations are limited. Little attention has been paid to the biologic processes that
      cause PAD, and to atherogenic mechanisms that may preferentially affect the peripheral
      circulation.

      Vascular inflammation and insulin resistance are two important and interdependent conditions
      that are associated with atherosclerosis. Subjects in this trial (160 adults with stable
      intermittent claudication who are not taking insulin or insulin-sensitizing medications, such
      as thiazolidinediones) will be randomized in a placebo-controlled, parallel design manner, to
      atorvastatin 80 mg orally daily (to reduce inflammation) and pioglitazone 45 mg orally once
      daily (to improve insulin sensitivity). Forty healthy adult subjects, age and gender-matched
      to a subset of the study group, will be enrolled to serve as a control population. Primary
      and secondary study endpoints include: treadmill walking time, endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation, and insulin-mediated skeletal muscle glucose uptake.

    <description>A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed prior to and during FDG-PET imaging to measure insulin sensitivity and to standardize metabolic conditions. Subjects were required to fast for 8 hours prior to the study. Patients were given a primed insulin infusion of 2 mU/kg/min. Serum glucose measurements were made at five-minute intervals from an arterialized venous sample achieved by placing the hand in a warming box at 50Â°C. Blood glucose levels are checked every 5 minutes and 20% dextrose infusion is adjusted to maintain a serum glucose level of approximately 80 mg/dL. Subjects were considered to have achieved steady state when the dextrose infusion rate required to maintain a serum glucose level of 80 mg/dL varied by no greater than 5%. To compute the steady-state glucose disposal rate, we averaged the glucose infusion rates over the last 20 minutes of the clamp and applied a &quot;space correction&quot; to account for small changes in serum glucose levels over that time period.</description>

        <description>A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed prior to and during FDG-PET imaging to measure insulin sensitivity and to standardize metabolic conditions. Subjects were required to fast for 8 hours prior to the study. Patients were given a primed insulin infusion of 2 mU/kg/min. Serum glucose measurements were made at five-minute intervals from an arterialized venous sample achieved by placing the hand in a warming box at 50Â°C. Blood glucose levels are checked every 5 minutes and 20% dextrose infusion is adjusted to maintain a serum glucose level of approximately 80 mg/dL. Subjects were considered to have achieved steady state when the dextrose infusion rate required to maintain a serum glucose level of 80 mg/dL varied by no greater than 5%. To compute the steady-state glucose disposal rate, we averaged the glucose infusion rates over the last 20 minutes of the clamp and applied a âspace correctionâ to account for small changes in serum glucose levels over that time period.</description>
