  <brief_summary>

      The goal of the project is to examine the impact of providing housing for people living with
      HIV who are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness on their HIV disease progression,
      risks of transmitting HIV, and medical care access and utilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence is accumulating that homelessness and housing may be important factors that
      influence human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sex and drug risk behaviors. Despite this
      apparent connection, few studies have investigated whether homelessness or unstable housing,
      compared with stable and adequate housing, is linked with HIV risk behaviors, and whether
      change in housing status is associated with change in risk behaviors.

      The Housing and Health Study is a multi-site, multi-agency research collaboration. This
      project is a unique collaboration between federal agencies (the Department of Housing and
      Urban Development and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), local government
      agencies, universities, and private not-for-profit organizations.

      The goal of the project is to examine the impact of providing housing for people living with
      HIV who are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness on their disease progression, their
      risks of transmitting HIV, and medical care access and utilization. A total of 630 people
      living with HIV from three study sites complete the baseline study sessions. Half the
      participants (n=315) are randomly assigned to each of the two study groups. Treatment group
      participants receive Housing and Health Study housing rental assistance, and comparison group
      participants receive assistance finding housing according to local standard practice.

      At baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline, participants complete study questionnaires
      and provide blood specimens to test for CD4 and viral load. In addition, the cost
      effectiveness of the study will be investigated by examining the HIV-related costs averted by
      providing housing to persons at high risk for transmitting HIV.
