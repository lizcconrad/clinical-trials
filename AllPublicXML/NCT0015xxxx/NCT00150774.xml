      A double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of adjunctive treatment with
      LEV 3000mg/day in reducing myoclonic seizures in adolescents and adults suffering from
      idiopathic generalised epilepsy and to evaluate the safety of LEV in the same population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy
             experiencing myoclonic seizures (IIB) that are classifiable according to the
             International Classification of Epileptic Seizures. To ensure an idiopathic
             generalized epilepsy population, only these subjects with the diagnosis of juvenile
             myoclonic epilepsy (JME), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) or epilepsy with generalized
             tonic- clonic seizures on awakening must be included.

          -  Presence of at least eight days with at least one myoclonic seizure (IIB) per day
             during the eight weeks of the Baseline period.

          -  Absence of brain lesion documented on a CT scan or MRI; if a CT scan or MRI has not
             been performed within the past five years before Visit 1, a CT scan (or MRI where
             legally required) should be performed during the Baseline period.

          -  Presence of EEG features consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy on an EEG
             recorded during the Baseline period or no more than one year before Visit 1.

          -  Male/female children ≥ 12 years of age or adult ≤ 65 years of age at Visit 1.

          -  Subject on a stable dose of one standard anti-epileptic treatment for at least four
             weeks before Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous exposure to levetiracetam.

          -  History of partial seizures.

          -  History of convulsive or non-convulsive status epilepticus within 3 months prior to
             Visit 1.

          -  Subject taking vigabatrin or tiagabine, subject on felbamate with less than 18 months
             exposure, and subject under vagal nerve stimulation or ketogenic diet.

          -  Subject taking any drug (except the concomitant AEDs) with possible CNS effects.
