  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of a community diabetes
      education program administered by a community health worker in a low-cost community clinic.
      We expect an improvement in overall glycemic control in the experimental group of at least
      20%. We also expect to document improvement in diabetes self-management skills, quality of
      life and an increase in achievement of ADA standards of care4 in the experimental group.
