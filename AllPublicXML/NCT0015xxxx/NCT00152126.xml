  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have provided evidence that residual microscopic malignant cells in autologous bone
      marrow or blood stem cell grafts can contribute to posttransplant relapse. Researchers are
      currently exploring different methods in an attempt to purify or &quot;purge&quot; the stem cell
      product to minimize the risk of tumor contamination.

      The CD133+ antigen is a protein contained on or &quot;expressed&quot; on numerous cells in the human
      body including specific hematopoietic progenitor (blood forming) cells. However, this antigen
      is not expressed on certain cancer cells including neuroblastoma. A technique using the
      investigational CliniMACS cell sorting device has been developed in an effort to filter out
      only those stem cells that express this CD133+ antigen in order to infuse a hematopoietic
      stem cell product with no tumor contamination potential.

      The primary objective of this study is to establish safety of treating patients with a high
      dose chemotherapy regimen of Busulfan and Melphalan followed by autologous CD133+
      hematopoietic stem cell support. Transplants recipients are expected to achieve engraftment
      as defined by an absolute neutrophil count of greater than or equal to 500/mm3 for three
      consecutive days by day 42-post infusion. Thus, safety of the treatment plan will be
      evaluated in terms of failure to engraft by this specific time period.

      Secondary objectives for this protocol include the following:

        -  To describe CD133+ graft content post-selection and to describe the yield and purity of
           CD133+ content of the graft obtained.

        -  To describe the negative selection efficiency of this strategy by assessing the
           processed product for tumor specific markers, when applicable.

        -  To characterize the proliferation of clonal progeny of CD133+ cells.

        -  To characterize lymphocyte and hematopoietic reconstitution (including the kinetics of
           platelet engraftment) in these patients.

        -  To estimate one-year disease-free and overall survival in these transplant recipients.
