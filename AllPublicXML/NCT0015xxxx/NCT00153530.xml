  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to deliver primary systemic high-dose methotrexate (MTX) treatment to
      PCNSL patients and to define the role of whole brain irradiation (WBI) in primary therapy,
      i.e., to analyze whether patients who have undergone primary chemotherapy can postpone
      irradiation with its possible late sequelae until recurrence without incurring losses in
      progression-free and overall survival. This is studied here for the first time worldwide in a
      systematic, controlled and randomized manner. In this study, one arm with six cycles of
      high-dose MTX and subsequent irradiation (A1), which comes closest to a &quot;standard arm of
      primary therapy&quot;, at least according to the majority assessment, is compared to irradiation
      at recurrence with regard to time to progression and overall survival (A2). In primary
      therapy failure, it will also be analyzed to what extent salvage therapy with AraC is
      equivalent to irradiation as the &quot;standard arm&quot; with regard to time to progression and
      overall survival (arm B1 and B2).

      Six 14-day cycles of high-dose MTX will be given at the beginning of the study. Randomization
      will be performed centrally at the study headquarters in UKBF Berlin already at study
      inclusion. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria will receive the first systemic treatment
      with 4 g/m2 MTX i.v. over 4 hours within 14 days. Dexamethasone in a dose of 3 x 8 mg/day
      orally for 10 days will additionally be given in the first cycle. This dexamethasone dose
      will be started 3 days before the first MTX application. Ten to 14 days after the 3rd and 6th
      MTX dose, the response to MTX therapy will be evaluated by MRI and a repeated CSF examination
      in the case of renewed CSF involvement. Assessment can also be made at any other time point
      if there is clinical deterioration. In all cases, the neuroradiological reference center
      (Department of Neuroradiology, University of Tübingen) will decide about the response to MTX
      therapy. MRI and CT scans should be sent to the neuroradiological reference center after HD
      MTX is terminated for central response evaluation. If complete remission is achieved after
      completing high-dose MTX therapy, patients will be treated with WBI (45 Gy in 1.5 Gy
      fractions) starting a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 7 weeks after the end of chemotherapy
      (arm A1) or WBI at first recurrence (arm A2). If primary therapy is not successful (partial
      remission, stable disease after the 6th cycle, progression at any time of MTX therapy),
      patients will receive WBI (45 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions; arm B1) or high-dose AraC chemotherapy
      3 g/m2 i.v. over 3 hours every 12 hours for 2 days (arm B2) according to the randomization.
      If high-dose MTX therapy leads to termination before the application of 6 cycles of MTX (see
      termination criteria) but allows further AraC therapy or WBI, further treatment is given in
      the non-CR arm according to the randomization. High-dose AraC therapy will be administered in
      four 3-week cycles. If complete remission occurs already after one or two cycles, only one
      additional cycle will be applied. Patients will not be crossed over into the B arms.

      If there is a recurrence or progression after finishing a complete treatment arm, the patient
      can be treated with chemotherapy according to PCV protocol or WBI in the B2 arm. This
      decision is left up to the individual study center.

      The G-PCNSL-SG-1 study is a prospective, controlled phase IV study with central
      randomization. Patients in both arms will be submitted to stratified randomization according
      to age (&lt; 60; &gt; 60) and center to minimize the effect of important therapy-related prognostic
      factors. The study is not blinded. Randomization will be performed centrally at study
      inclusion at the Institute of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University
      Hospital Benjamin Franklin of the Free University of Berlin.

      The planned study duration is 7 years - 4 years in the recruitment phase with a subsequent
      3-year follow-up period and a 6-month evaluation phase. For an individual patient, the
      treatment time in arm A1 is 12 weeks for 6 cycles of MTX therapy, followed by a 4-7-week
      resting period and then 6 weeks until the completion of WBI (arm A1). In arm A2, the patient
      is irradiated (a total of 6 weeks) only in the case of recurrence. Up to that point, the
      patient will be followed up in fixed intervals like those patients in A1 after WBI. In arm B,
      MTX therapy is immediately followed by 6 weeks of WBI (arm B1) or the maximal 3 months of
      AraC therapy. After completing the protocol of the planned therapy, all patients will be
      followed-up for at least three years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically/immunocytologically confirmed primary non-Hodgkin's
             lymphoma of the CNS. A central reference pathological report will be made on inclusion
             into the study (Prof. Dr. Pietsch, Reference Center for Brain Tumors of the German
             Society for Neuropathology and Neuroanatomy, Institute of Neuropathology of the Bonn
             University Hospital). Histological diagnosis is usually performed by preferential
             stereotactic biopsy of suspicious lesions in the brain or spinal cord. The diagnosis
             from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) requires the detection of malignant lymphocytes
             according to cytological and immunocytological criteria. There should be no more than
             2 weeks between establishing the diagnosis and inclusion in the study. The
             availability of the reference pathological report is not absolutely necessary for
             inclusion in the study and beginning therapy.

          -  Aged &gt; 18 years

          -  Life expectancy of at least 2 months

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve with a peripheral granulocyte count of &gt; 1,500/µl and
             thrombocyte count of &gt; 100,000/µl; bilirubin in the normal range; GOT of &lt; three times
             the upper normal limit and adequate renal function with a creatinine clearance of &gt; 50
             ml/min and serum creatinine in the normal range.

          -  Written informed consent

          -  In women of child-bearing age, pregnancy is excluded, effective contraception is
             necessary, and women should not be breast feeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Manifestation of lymphoma outside of the CNS

          -  Severe diseases in other organs which would make performing intensive chemotherapy
             impossible; Karnofsky index &gt; 50% due to previous diseases other than PCNSL. Karnofsky
             &gt; 30 will be accepted only due to the PCNSL.

          -  Active infection

          -  HIV positivity

          -  Previous treatment of PCNSL other than with corticosteroids, antiepileptics or
             diuretics

          -  Previous radiotherapy of the brain

          -  Concomitant or previous malignant diseases in the last 5 years except for an
             adequately treated basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ

          -  Immunosuppression, concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, or organ transplantation

          -  Ongoing chemotherapy for another disease
