  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) post- transplantation decreases patient and graft
      survival. Some immunosuppressive agents are associated with a higher incidence of NODM. This
      study evaluates the safety and efficacy of converting patients with NODM from tacrolimus to
      cyclosporine micro-emulsion as a primary immunosuppressant for kidney and liver recipients.
