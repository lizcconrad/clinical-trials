  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine efficacy of 70 mg alendronate once weekly
      compared to placebo. This will be measured by percent changes in lumbar spine(LS) bone
      mineral density(BMD) in adult cystic fibrosis(CF)patients after one year of treatment. The
      investigators hypothesize that in adult CF patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis,
      alendronate 70 mg once weekly will produce a mean increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD
      that is greater than that observed with placebo at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controled trial have begun to establish the efficacy and safety of bisphosphonates
      in CF patients with decreased BMD. The development of a once weekly dosing regimen of
      alendronate and the low prevalence of esophageal adverse events may be an advantageous
      therapeutic option for this high-risk population. This is a one-year randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in 55 CF patients with osteopenia or
      osteoporosis. Six Canadian centres are participating in this study. Patients randomized to
      treatment will receive 70 mg oral alendronate once weekly, while controls will receive
      identical placebo once weekly. All medication dispensed will be concealed. There will be no
      dose modification during the course of the trial. All patients will receive a total of 1000
      mg calcium, 500 through supplementation and 500 through diet. All patients will continue to
      take vitamin D supplementation ( 2 tablets per day, 400 IU vitamin D/tablet).
