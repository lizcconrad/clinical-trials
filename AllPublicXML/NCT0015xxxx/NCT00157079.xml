        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained from either the subject or the subject's legally
             acceptable representative prior to any study-related procedures and study product
             administration

          -  Diagnosis of a PID disorder as defined by World Health Organization criteria for which
             the subject has been receiving a regimen of IGIV infusions every 21 to 28 days over a
             period of at least 4 months pre-study at a dose of 300-600 mg/kg body weight

          -  Subjects &gt; 24 months of age

          -  A negative serum pregnancy test for any female subject who is of childbearing
             potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects sero-positive at enrollment for one or more of the following: hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV), antibodies to human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Types 1 or 2

          -  Subjects with levels of alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino
             transferase (AST) &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal for the testing laboratory. An
             AST &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal is allowable, if the ALT does not exceed the
             upper limit of the reference range for the testing laboratory

          -  Subjects with neutropenia (defined as an ANC &gt;= 1,000/mm3)

          -  Subjects with serum creatinine levels greater than two times the upper limit of normal
             for age and gender

          -  Subjects with malignancy or a history of malignancy

          -  Subjects who received any blood or blood product exposure other than an IGIV and/or
             immune serum globulin (ISG) preparation within the 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Subjects with an ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions
             (urticaria, breathing difficulty, severe hypotension, or anaphylaxis) following IGIV
             and/or ISG infusions

          -  Subjects with selective complete IgA deficiency

          -  Subjects with moderate levels of anti-IgA antibodies (&gt;150), or subjects with lower
             anti-IgA antibodies who are naive to IGIV treatment. (Subjects with lower levels of
             IgA antibodies, whom the investigators know to have tolerated IgA containing IGIV
             preparations in the past, may be included if the investigator is comfortable with
             this)

          -  Subjects receiving antibiotic therapy for the treatment of infection within 30 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Subjects who receive prophylactic antibiotics as part of their care regimen

          -  Subjects participating in another clinical study involving an investigational product
             or device within 30 days prior to study entry
