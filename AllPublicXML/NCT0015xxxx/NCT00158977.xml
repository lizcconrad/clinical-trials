  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RENEWAL 3 AVT device is designed to treat patients suffering from HF, with a history of
      or at risk of developing atrial and ventricular arrhythmias
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clinical evaluation to:

        -  Confirm that there are no adverse interactions when Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia (ICD),
           Heart Failure (HF) and Atrial Tachyarrhythmia (AT) therapies are combined

        -  Confirm Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia (ICD)
           therapy is delivered in the presence of atrial therapies

        -  Demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of atrial therapies in a heart failure
           population

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet the following criteria should be given consideration for inclusion in the
        clinical investigation:

          -  Meet all device indications and contraindications

          -  Willing and capable of providing informed consent, undergoing a device implant,
             participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an
             approved clinical investigational center and at the intervals defined by this protocol

          -  Prescribed to stable optimal pharmacologic therapy for heart failure

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dL obtained no more than two weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Age 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and
             national law

          -  Geographically stable residents who are available for follow-up

          -  Able to provide documented evidence of one or more episodes of AF/AT within 12 months
             of implantation

        NOTE: Guidant recommends anticoagulation therapy per physician discretion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who will be excluded from the investigation are those who meet any one of the
        following criteria:

          -  Have a preexisting non-Guidant left ventricular lead

          -  Have a preexisting unipolar pacemaker that will not be explanted/abandoned

          -  Documented life expectancy of less than six months or expected to undergo heart
             transplant within the next six months

          -  Have an atrial tachyarrhythmia that is permanent (i.e., does not terminate
             spontaneously and cannot be terminated with medical intervention) within 180 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to a 0.7 mg dose of dexamethasone acetate

          -  Have surgically uncorrected primary valvular heart disease

          -  Currently requiring hemo-dialysis

          -  Have had a myocardial infarct, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, or
             coronary artery bypass graft during the preceding 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or infiltrative cardiomyopathy (e.g.,
             amyloidosis, sarcoidosis)

          -  Have a mechanical tricuspid heart valve

          -  Enrolled in any concurrent study, without Guidant written approval, that may confound
             the results of this study

          -  A Cerebral Vascular Event/ Transient Ischemic Attack within 12 months of implantation

          -  During the four weeks prior to implantation, a patient experiences an episode of AF Â³
             48 hours in duration and was not anticoagulated at an adequate therapeutic level for
             the 4 weeks prior to enrollment with an INR = 2.0-3.0 at enrollment

          -  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant

        Note: Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of
        enrollment
