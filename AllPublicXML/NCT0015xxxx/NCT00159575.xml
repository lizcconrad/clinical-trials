      Aim of study: To investigate whether four months of metformin treatment before IVF
      (in-vitro-fertilisation) or ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic-sperm-injection) might increase clinical
      pregnancy rate in normal-weight (body mass index [BMI] below 28 kg/m3) in PCOS (polycystic
      ovarian syndrome) women.

      PCOS is an hormonal disease including hyperandrogenism, oligo-or anovulation and/or
      polycystic ovaries by ultrasound. PCOS women often suffer insulin resistance or even diabetes
      risk as well as a full blown metabolic disease.

      These women often suffer infertility due to their lack of regular ovulations. Metformin is a
      well known anti-diabetic drug, and in some PCOS women metformin might decrease the
      hyperandrogenism, improve insulin resistance and give more regular ovulations. Thereby
      increase chance of pregnancy. Our hypothesis is that metformin will increase clinical
      pregnancy rates both spontaneously and following IVF/ICSI.
