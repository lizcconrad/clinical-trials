      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a topical 5% minoxidil
      formulation in males for the treatment of pattern hair loss. The secondary purpose is to
      evaluate the safety of a topical 5% minoxidil formulation in males when used twice daily for
      the treatment of pattern hair loss and to obtain the safety data on the investigational
      product when used twice daily for up to one year.

      Male subjects with androgenetic alopecia were enrolled in this fourteen-center trial.
      Subjects were randomized to use either 5% minoxidil or placebo foam twice daily for 16 weeks.
      A total of 143 subjects continued use of the 5% minoxidil foam for 8 to 12 months in an
      open-label phase to obtain safety data on 5% minoxidil topical foam when used twice daily for
      up to one year.

      The 5% minoxidil foam was shown to be effective in the treatment of male androgenetic
      alopecia in a 16 week trial. It was statistically significantly superior to placebo foam in
      the primary efficacy measure of mean change in the non-vellus hair count in the target region
      between Baseline and Week 16, and the subject rating assessed an overall improvement from
      Baseline.

      The efficacy of 5% minoxidil compared to placebo was confirmed by the secondary efficacy
      endpoints of scores from the expert panel review of hair regrowth when comparing photographs
      obtained at Baseline with photographs obtained at Week 16, as well as the percent change from
      Baseline in non-vellus hair counts within a pre-specified area of clipped hair.

      The 5% minoxidil foam formulation was well tolerated, the incidence of adverse events was
      similar between groups, and no safety concerns were raised based on clinical laboratory test
      results, vital signs or scalp irritation scores.
