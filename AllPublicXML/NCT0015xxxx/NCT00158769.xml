  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This compound, GR270773, is a lipid based compound being developed to treat Sepsis. Lipids
      are broken down in the body by the liver. This study is designed to see whether the effect of
      the drug in people with poorly functioning livers is any different to the effect on healthy
      adults.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as defined by a Child-Pugh score of 7-9 will be included. Subjects will be given GR270773 as a loading infusion of 25 milligram per kilogram per hour (mg/kg/hr) for 2 hours followed by a maintenance infusion of 5 mg/kg/hr for 70 hours.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Healthy subjects</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will be matched as closely as possible to the group of moderate hepatic subjects for gender, age and body mass index (BMI). Subjects will be administered 25 mg/kg/hr GR270773 as a loading dose for 2 hours followed by a maintenance infusion of 5 mg/kg/hr for 70 hours. Following a washout period of 21 days, the subjects will then receive a loading dose of 75 mg/kg/hr for 2 hours followed by a maintenance dose of 12.5 mg/kg/hr of GR270773 for 70 hours.</description>
