  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomised, cross-over, controlled study, a total of 84 subjects will be included: 12
      healthy non-smoking volunteers; 12 current smokers; 30 patients with mild steroid-naïve
      asthma; and 30 patients with mild-moderate COPD.

      Each subject will have 1 screening visit (if necessary) and 2 study visits. At visits 2 and 3
      the effects of adenosine 5`-triphosphate (ATP) or adenosine 5`-monophosphate (AMP) challenge,
      given in a random order, will be tested.
