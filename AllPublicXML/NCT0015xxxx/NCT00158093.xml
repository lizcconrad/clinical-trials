  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nebivolol is one of a class of drugs known as beta-blockers. These drugs are useful in the
      treatment of high blood pressure, angina, abnormal heart rhythms and following a heart
      attack. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of nebivolol to cause a certain
      type of abnormal heart rhythm, known as QTc prolongation. The potential of nebivolol to cause
      this adverse event will be compared to three other drugs: atenolol, a beta-blocker approved
      by the FDA; Avelox (moxifloxacin), an anti-biotic approved for use by the FDA which is known
      to cause QTc prolongation; and placebo, a drug look-alike that contains no drug. The working
      hypothesis was that 20 or 40 mg of nebivolol would not prolong corrected QT intervals
      measured during peak nebivolol concentrations (i.e., 2 hours after dosing) on Day 7.
