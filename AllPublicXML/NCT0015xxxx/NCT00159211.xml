    <textblock>
      In type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control despite maximum &quot;classic&quot; oral
      treatment, bed time insulin therapy may lead to a parallel increase in abdominal visceral and
      subcutaneous fat, whereas pioglitazone treatment should lead to a stability (or even a
      decrease ) in visceral and an increase in subcutaneous abdominal fat. As visceral fat mass is
      correlated with insulin-resistance and cardio-vascular risk, the evolution of visceral
      abdominal fat in type 2 diabetic patients is of great importance.

      Main objective:

      To compare visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat compartment after a six-month bed time
      insulin or pioglitazone treatment in type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control
      despite a maximal oral treatment with metformin and sulfonylureas.

      The study hypothesis is that quantity of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue
      should differently evolute comparing a 6 month treatment with pioglitazone® (30 or 45mg/j) or
      NPH &quot; bed-time &quot; insulin (0.2u/kg/
