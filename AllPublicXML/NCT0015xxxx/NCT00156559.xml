      This research is designed to address the question, &quot;Does the relative deficit in vaccine
      immunogenicity in extremely premature infants persist beyond the first 6 months of life?&quot; We
      propose to measure the immunogenicity of varicella and mumps-measles-rubella vaccines in
      relatively healthy, 12-to-15 month-old children born at &lt;29 weeks gestation, when compared to
      full-term infants, as measured by the relevant viral serologies.

      Title: MMR and Varicella Vaccine Responses in Extremely Premature Infants

      Phase: IV

      Population: 16 generally healthy premature infants born at &lt; 29 weeks' gestation, &lt; 16 months
      old from the Rochester area 16 generally healthy full-term infants born at &gt;/= 37 weeks'
      gestation, &lt; 16 months old from the Rochester area

      Number of Sites: University of Rochester

      Study Duration: 1.5 - 8.5 months

      Description of Agent or Intervention:

      Subjects will make 2 study visits. The first, at 15 months of age, will coincide with a
      routine well child visit. Subjects will have 2 mL of blood drawn at the time of their
      routine, 15-month MMR, varicella, and pneumococcal conjugate immunizations. At a second study
      visit 4-6 weeks later, another 2 mL of blood will be drawn.

      Objectives:

      Primary: We propose to measure the immunogenicity of routinely administered varicella and
      mumps-measles-rubella vaccines in relatively healthy, 12-to-15 month-old children born at &lt;29
      weeks gestation (premature), when compared to that in full-term infants.

      Measles titers will be measured by neutralization assay. Mumps and rubella titers will be
      measured by enzyme-linked florescent immunoassay. Varicella titers will be measured by enzyme
      linked immunosorbent assay.

      Safety will be assessed by parental recall of vaccine-related adverse events and by active,
      prospective collection of blood-draw-associated adverse events.

      Schematic of Study Design:

      Subjects will be approached at 9-12 months of age for inclusion, and will consent at this
      time or at Visit 1

      Visit 1 (15 mos):

      Preterm N = 16, Full term N = 16, 2 ml blood draw

      Routine MMR, varicella vaccines administered by primary pediatrician per standard of care (at
      Visit 1)

      Visit 2 (16 mos):

      Preterm N = 16, Full term N = 16, 2 ml blood draw

      Varicella, mumps, measles and rubella vaccine titers measured by ELISA

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study.

          1. Premature infant &lt; 29 weeks' gestation at birth or term infant &gt;/= 37 weeks' gestation
             at birth.

          2. Postnatal age &lt; 16 months, 0 days.

          3. Has not yet received MMR or varicella vaccines. (There are no restrictions on the
             administration of other vaccines at the time of MMR/varicella vaccination.)

          4. Parental permission.

          5. Agreement of primary care pediatrician/ health care provider.

          6. Receives primary pediatric care within an approximate 25-mile radius of the University
             of Rochester.

          7. Healthy status at enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known immunodeficiency.

          2. Systemic corticosteroid therapy at the time of MMR/varicella vaccination.

          3. Requiring oxygen therapy.

          4. Clinically significant findings on review of medical history and physical exam
             determined by the investigator or sub-investigator to be sufficient for exclusion.

          5. Any condition determined by the investigator that would interfere with the evaluation
             of the vaccine or be a potential health risk to the subject.
