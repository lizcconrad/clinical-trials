  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermic resuscitation is proven to be benefit to the cardiac origin cardiac arrest
      patients for it improve brain recovery dramatically. However, traditional cooling devices and
      methods, most external cooling methods, include ice blanket, cooling helmet, or ice packing
      lower the body temperature slowly or inefficiently which make many emergency physicians
      hesitate to perform hypothermic resuscitation. To improve and promote the practice of
      hypothermia resuscitation, more efficient temperature control method is necessary. We conduct
      this clinical trial to evaluate the safety and feasibility of internal cooling catheter and
      temperature regulatory device, which is approved by FDA in neurologic ICU for temperature
      control, in the cardiac arrest patients.

      We recruited successful resuscitated nontraumatic cardiac arrest adult patients in the
      emergency department to evaluate the safety and feasibility of application those invasive
      internal temperature regulator devices. Internal cooling catheter, &quot;ICY&quot; , and thermal
      regulator device, &quot;Coolguard 2000&quot; are applied to the patients from femoral vein. WE definite
      4 stages according to the temperature during the clinical trial: &quot;The Cooling Phase&quot;,
      &quot;Hypothermia phase&quot;, &quot;Rewarming phase&quot;, and &quot;Postrewarming phase&quot;. The temperature is lowed
      or elevated by the rate 0.5C/hr during the Cooling and Rewarming Phase, and it is maintained
      33 +/- 1 C during hypothermia phase for 12 hours according to the comment of ACLS. To
      understand the safety and feasibility, regular blood sampling, bedside EEG and vital
      monitors, and special sheets are designed to document the every reasons, time points or every
      clinical events during hypothermia therapy. The patients is observed until rewarming finish
      for 48 hours or till death if expired during post-resuscitation hypothermia therapy.
