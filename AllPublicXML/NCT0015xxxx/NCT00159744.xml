  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swings that range from high (manic) to low
      (depressed) states. Sometimes, symptoms of both depression and mania are present (mixed
      episodes). Asenapine is an investigational medication for the treatment of manic or mixed
      episodes of bipolar disorder. This is a 3-week study that will test the safety and efficacy
      of this medication. Patients will receive either asenapine, olanzapine (a medication that is
      already approved for the treatment of bipolar mania), or placebo (no active medication).
      Patients will be required to stay in the hospital for at least the first seven days of
      treatment. Patients that complete the 3 week study may be eligible to continue in extension
      studies for an additional 9 (study A7501006) to 49 (study A7501007) weeks.
