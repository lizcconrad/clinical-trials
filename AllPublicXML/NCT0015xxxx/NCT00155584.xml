  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been developed as a promising new cancer treatment modality,
      which involves the uptakes of a photosensitizer by tumor cells, followed by the activation of
      photosensitizer with approximate wavelength of light. The mechanisms of the PDT-induced
      cytotoxic effect relate to singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen intermediates generated
      by PDT, which give rise to cellular stress and cause cell death. Previously, using the
      homemade LED light source, we have shown that ALA-PDT is effective for the treatment of
      premalignant lesions such as mucosal dysplasia and carcinoma in situ of oral cavity. Due to
      the advantages of low cost, high reliability, and portability, LED light source provides an
      alternative approach for the light irradiation of PDT.

      Verruca vulgaris are benign skin papillomas caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). They
      are very common and can affect many different sites including the face, hands, feet and
      genitalia. Although the present therapeutic approaches are more or less effective in
      eradicating the lesions, relapses are very common. Furthermore, at times the anatomical
      location and depth of lesions often make the treatment difficult, time-consuming and painful.
      Therefore, it is necessary to develop new modalities for wart treatment.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to develop topical ALA-PDT as an alternative treatment
      of wart but without the unwanted side effects of pain and burning. To fulfill this goal, the
      following works will be performed. First, topical ALA formulation and LED array will be
      specifically designed and developed for the skin lesions. Second, the efficacy of the ALA
      formulation designed for wart treatment will be evaluated with in vivo fluorescence imaging
      system. Third, the therapeutic efficacy of ALA-PDT will be evaluated by using a LED array
      designed for skin irradiation. Forth, the unwanted side effects of pain and burning will be
      further compared between red and green LED array.

      Verruca vulgaris or warts are benign skin papillomas caused by the human papilloma virus
      (HPV). They are very common and can affect many different sites including the face, hands,
      feet and genitalia. Although the present therapeutic approaches are more or less effective in
      eradicating the lesions, scars and relapses are very common. Furthermore, at times the
      anatomical location and depth of lesions often make the treatment difficult, time-consuming
      and painful. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new modalities for wart treatment.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been developed as a promising new cancer treatment modality,
      which involves the uptakes of a photosensitizer by tumor cells, followed by the activation of
      photosensitizer with approximate wavelength of light. The endogenous conversion of
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) has broadened the use of PDT. The
      mechanisms of the PDT-induced cytotoxic effect relate to singlet oxygen and other reactive
      oxygen intermediates generated by PDT, which give rise to cellular stress and cause cell
      death. Previously, using the homemade LED light source, we have shown that topical ALA-PDT is
      effective for the treatment of warts. However, the excruciating pain induced by ALA and red
      LED could be due to deeper penetration of the ALA formulation or the deeper penetration of
      red light. Thus the pain might be related to the injured nerve fibers underlying the skin.
      This study is to provide evidence of these two green or red LED efficacy in removing the
      warts and also their side-effect of pain.
