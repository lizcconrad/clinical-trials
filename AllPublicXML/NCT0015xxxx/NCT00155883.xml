  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the tumor response rate of bi-weekly docetaxel plus
      24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU/leucovorin chemotherapy for patients with inoperable
      advanced gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in Taiwan. We have previously
      demonstrated that weekly 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin
      is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Our in
      vitro and clinical studies suggested that long (24 hours or more) infusion of 5-FU/leucovorin
      may, compared with the conventional bolus regimens, enhance its anti-tumor activity in
      gastric cancer by prolonging suppression of thymidylate synthase, the target enzyme of 5-FU
      cytotoxicity. Docetaxel, a mitotic inhibitor, has good single-agent activity against gastric
      cancer, with a tumor response rate around 20 to 24%. Preliminary clinical data indicate that
      a biweekly administration of docetaxel will reduce the incidence of neutropenia and asthenia,
      two most bothersome side effects of tri-weekly and weekly docetaxel, respectively, while
      maintaining its anti-tumor activity. This phase II trial is designed to test the efficacy and
      toxicity of biweekly docetaxel and 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-FU/leucovorin as
      first-line therapy for patients with inoperable advanced gastric cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven and inoperable advanced gastric adenocarcinoma.

          2. Bi-dimensionally measurable disease by physical examination or image study
             (roentgenogram or computed tomography scan). The index lesions should be at least 20
             mm Ã— 10 mm in size.

          3. Age must be older than 18 and younger than 75 year-old.

          4. Karnofsky performance status&gt;60% (see Appendix)

          5. Adequate bone marrow reserves, defined as white blood cell (WBC)&gt;4,000/l, absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;1,500/l, platelet&gt;100,000/l.

          6. Liver transaminases &lt;2.5 times upper normal limit if no liver metastasis and 5 times
             upper normal limit if liver metastasis is present; total bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dl; serum
             creatinine&lt;1.5mg/dl.

          7. Serum triglyceride level&gt;70mg/dl.

          8. Previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease is not allowed in this study. Previous
             adjuvant chemotherapy following curative gastrectomy is acceptable if the adjuvant
             chemotherapy has been completed for more than 6 months before enrollment into the
             present study.

          9. Previous radiotherapy is allowed if the treatment was completed at least 4 weeks
             before the enrollment into this study.

         10. Patients of childbearing age should have effective contraception during the study
             period.

         11. All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are receiving concurrent radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other experimental
             therapy.

          2. Patients who refuse port-A catheter implantation.

          3. Patients with brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          4. Patients who have significant cardiac arrhythmia or acute myocardial infarction within
             6 months before entry.

          5. Patients who have major systemic diseases that the attending physicians considered
             inappropriate for systemic chemotherapy.

          6. Life expectancy of less than 2 months.

          7. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women or men with reproductive
             potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective
             contraceptive method.

          8. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.
