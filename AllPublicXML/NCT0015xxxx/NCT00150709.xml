      The open-label study to allow pediatric patients who have participated in prior Levetiracetam
      (Keppra®) studies to continue their treatment with adequate monitoring and standardized
      follow-up care until Levetiracetam (Keppra®) is approved for use in children or until the
      completion of the development program for pediatrics.
