  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of an echocardiographic
      contrast agent, AI-700, in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) and/or congestive heart failure (CHF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In ongoing clinical trials, AI-700 is currently being evaluated for its value to provide
      enhanced echocardiography to detect CAD. The patient population is comprised of those
      patients who have chest pain and are being evaluated for inducible ischemia. This population
      may include patients with compromised pulmonary function due to COPD or CHF. This study was
      to evaluate the safety of AI-700 in these patients.
