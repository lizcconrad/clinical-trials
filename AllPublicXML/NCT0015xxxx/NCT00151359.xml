  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our research has shown that pressure sensation from the soles of the feet (plantar
      mechanoreceptors) plays an important role in controlling several key aspects of balancing
      reactions, particularly during compensatory stepping . As a result, age-related loss of
      plantar pressure sensation, which is very common, can lead to impaired control of these
      reactions. However, we have shown that it is possible to compensate for balance impairments
      resulting from this loss of sensation by using special footwear insoles to facilitate
      sensation from the perimeter of the sole. To date, we have demonstrated the feasibility of
      this approach in laboratory studies, and we have obtained a U.S. patent for the design
      concept. However, it remains to be determined whether the benefits of the footwear persist
      over the long term, or whether there is a habituation of the effect. Also, we need to
      determine whether there are any practical problems associated with wearing such footwear,
      e.g. due to discomfort or irritation of the skin.
