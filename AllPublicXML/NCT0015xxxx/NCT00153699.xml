  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We test the hypothesis whether topiramate narrows the angles which may render Asians more
      likely to suffer from acute angle closure glaucoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and prophylaxis of migraine attacks.
      There were case reports of acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG) associated with its use. AACG
      is particularly common in Asians because of a higher prevalence of narrow angle., we test the
      hypothesis whether topiramate narrows the angles which may render them more likely to suffer
      from AACG.
