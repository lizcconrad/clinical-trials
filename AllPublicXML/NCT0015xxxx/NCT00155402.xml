      This clinical trial tries to use tissue fibrin glues (Tisseel) to treat various ocular
      surface diseases or surgeries, which includes pterygium surgery, corneal melting/perforation,
      Gunderson's flap, conjunctival laceration, and muscle/clinical/filtering surgery.

      This clinical trial tries to use tissue fibrin glues (Tisseel) to treat various ocular
      surface diseases or surgeries. The inclusion criteria are:

        1. ocular surface disease which may need amniotic membrane transplantation (corneal pro
           epithelization, pterygium surgery, etc)

        2. infectious or noninfectious corneal ulcer with perforation less than 3 mm

        3. conjunctival transplantation/suture

        4. corneal surgeries which can be treated by conventional suture technique or application
           with cyanoacrylic acid tissue glues.

      Informed consents will be obtained from the patients before applications. After surgeries,
      topical steroids and antibiotics will be used, and therapeutic contact lens will be used. The
      patients will be followed up for at least three months.
