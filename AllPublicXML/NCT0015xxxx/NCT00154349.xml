        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of ALL.

          -  Patients confirmed to be Ph chromosome positive or bcr-abl gene positive.

          -  Patients in relapse

          -  Patients refractory to initial remission induction therapy

          -  Patients ineligible for initial remission induction therapy

          -  Patients with an ECOG Performance Status Score from 0 to 2

          -  Serum creatinine concentration of not more than 2 × the upper limit of the normal
             range (ULN)

          -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) of not more than 3 × ULN. In patients with hepatic
             dysfunction from leukemic involvement, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) should be not more
             than 5 × ULN

          -  Serum bilirubin level not more than 3 × ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with findings indicative of leukemic involvement of the central nervous
             system

          -  Patients with any serious concomitant medical condition (e.g., poorly controllable
             infection, interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, congestive cardiac failure,
             poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, mental disorder)

          -  Patients expected to receive any hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within 6
             weeks of the planned initiation of the study drug

          -  Patients having received any hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who have a Grade
             3 or 4 GVHD.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
