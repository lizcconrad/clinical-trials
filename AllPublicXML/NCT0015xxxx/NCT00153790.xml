  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to examine whether the intake of PhosphoLEAN is effective in aiding a
      cohort of women in losing weight. Participants taking the supplement will have significantly
      greater improvement in study outcomes than those taking the placebo.

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will be randomized to either a control or treatment group taking the dietary
      supplement containing a soy lecithin-derived N-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (NOPE) and
      caffeine free Green Tea-derived epigallocathchin gallate (EGCG) whose trade name is
      PhosphoLean. The outcome is to determine the effects on indices of weight loss and appetite
      suppression. Participants will return at 6, 12, and 16 weeks for clinical measures.
