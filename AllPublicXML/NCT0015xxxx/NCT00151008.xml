      Subjects will be applying active gel or placebo to target lesions to each side of the body in
      a blinded manner. They will start at three times a week and increase to daily or even twice a
      day regimen if tolerated. After 2 weeks of application, NBUVB will be added to treatment
      regimen (whole body, three times a week). Total study time is 10 weeks.
