  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and determine the effectiveness of a multi-level
      community participatory intervention designed to rapidly immunize hard-to-reach populations,
      including substance users, within disadvantaged minority communities.

      Specific Aims of the project are as follows:

        1. To identify the relative contributions of personal factors and structural barriers to
           immunization status in hard-to-reach populations.

        2. To estimate the size of the hard-to-reach population in specified disadvantaged urban
           communities using venue-based sampling, probability-based sampling, capture-recapture
           methods and modified Delphi techniques.

        3. To compare vaccination rates in hard-to-reach populations between neighborhoods that
           receive a community-based vaccine outreach intervention versus neighborhoods where
           vaccines are offered through standard public health programs, using an incremental
           crossover multilevel community intervention design.

      This study follows a quasi-experimental design involving a multilevel community participatory
      intervention that is designed to rapidly immunize hard-to-reach (HTR) populations in
      disadvantaged minority communities. Low vaccination coverage among minorities and persons
      living in and near poverty is a persistent problem that is particularly acute among HTR
      populations (e.g. injection drug users, elderly shut-ins). Immunization rates are affected by
      multiple factors including demographics, attitudes about vaccination, health norms, barriers
      to access, and immunization delivery methods. Efforts to successfully vaccinate HTR
      populations must address these factors. A community-based program with rapid vaccination can
      serve as an initial model for emergency preparedness vaccination plans and for future efforts
      to widely introduce HIV vaccination in disadvantaged urban communities. This project will be
      conducted by a community-public health partnership in eight disadvantaged neighborhoods
      within Harlem and the South Bronx in three phases. In Phase 1 we will implement a brief
      survey assessment of residents in designated neighborhoods to identify current key barriers
      to immunization faced by the target HTR populations in these neighborhoods. Also, using
      several estimation methods, we will determine the size of the target populations in the study
      neighborhoods to establish vaccine needed and to estimate denominators for vaccination rates.
      In Phase 2, we will implement two waves of a multilevel community intervention trial
      (developed with input from the survey and community partners). In the first wave, four
      randomly selected neighborhoods will receive the intervention (i.e., community education,
      community-organization engagement, and door-to-door influenza vaccination program for
      eligible groups etc). In the four control communities, target populations will be invited to
      come for vaccination at specified locations as part of usual public health efforts. In the
      second vaccination wave, using a crossover design, after updating and revising the approach
      based on experience from Wave 1, we will implement the intervention in the four control
      communities; this vaccination wave will be conducted over one week to test the feasibility of
      rapid vaccination of these populations. Phase 3 of this project will identify the promising
      elements of the program and develop materials to allow generalizability to other urban areas
      and to other vaccines (e.g., HIV, HBV, etc).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The possible participant pool for this project is the adult population (over the age of 18)
        of 8 circumscribed neighborhoods in East Harlem and South Bronx in NYC. These neighborhoods
        have a total population of approximately 24,000 people (based on the 2000 US Census) and we
        anticipate that up to 4,000 may be among the eligible hard-to-reach populations that are
        the target of this proposal. We will identify eligible populations through a brief survey
        instrument. During the intervention phase of this study, persons who are eligible to
        receive influenza vaccination will be offered influenza vaccination. Eligibility criteria
        for influenza vaccination are the eligibility criteria established by the Advisory
        Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines. These will be determined as part of the
        standard data collection instrument. Eligible persons include persons over the age of 65
        and persons concurrent comorbidity including immunosuppression (HIV or active injection
        drug use), chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular disorder (including asthma), or chronic
        metabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic dysfunction).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria include an allergy to vaccines, an allergy to eggs, inability to provide
        consent, currently under care of a physician and a plan to receive influenza vaccine in the
        near-future, or having already received the influenza vaccine during this year (CDC 1999).
