  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single centre study evaluating efficacy and viral kinetics of combination
      PEG-IFNa2a and Ribavirin treatment on CHC genotype 1 patients, administered until viral
      clearance demonstrated between 4 – 12 weeks, then randomised to further continued combination
      treatment for one of three defined durations. Followed-up for 24 weeks after treatment
      cessation.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine the necessary duration of combination treatment with Pegylated-Interferon
           alfa2a (PEGASYS) &amp; Ribavirin in Patients infected with genotype 1, in order to achieve
           viral clearance

        2. To identify host factors, which are associated with different patterns of virological
           response to combination treatment (fast responder, slow responder, non-responder). On
           this basis, to identify possible predictors for the duration of antiviral treatment.

      Forty treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C, all infected with genotype 1, will
      be entered into this study. All 40 patients will be started on the same regimen of 180mg
      Pegylated-Interferon alfa2a (PEGASYS) weekly plus Ribavirin 1000-1200mg daily. HCV RNA in the
      serum will be monitored by qualitative PCR at treatment weeks 4, 8 and 12. Patients who
      become HCV RNA negative at any of the above time-points (4,8 or 12), will be randomised into
      one of three groups to continue the same antiviral regimen for an additional 3 month, 6 month
      or 9 month period. All these patients will subsequently be followed-up and monitored for a
      further 6 months after stopping all antiviral treatment.

      Treatment will be discontinued for patients who remain persistently HCV RNA positive at
      treatment week 12 and they will be withdrawn from the study protocol.
