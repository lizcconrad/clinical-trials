    <textblock>
      Phase 3 , open-label, randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      Lilly/Alkermes inhaled insulin system compared to injected insulin in type 1 and type 2
      diabetes patients with asthma or COPD. Patients will be treated for 12 months with a 2 month
      follow up period.
