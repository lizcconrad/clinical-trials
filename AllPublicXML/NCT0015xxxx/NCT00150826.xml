      INDICATION Microvascular angina. OBJECTIVES To investigate the effect of ACE (angiotensin
      converting enzyme) inhibition (quinapril) in improving coronary microvascular function.

      PATIENT POPULATION Women who meet the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute-sponsored WISE
      (Women Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation) study criteria of chest discomfort, coronary flow
      reserve limitations and evidence for myocardial ischemia in the absence of significant
      coronary artery stenosis.

      STUDY DESIGN A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, comparative trial. TREATMENT
      Quinapril 80 mg/d versus placebo for four months. PRIMARY EFFICACY PARAMETER(S) Coronary flow
      reserve (CFR) at Week 16 adjusted for baseline CFR, treatment group assignment, site-specific
      variables, and site by treatment effects.

      SECONDARY EFFICACY PARAMETERS Week 16 change in chest discomfort as measured by the Seattle
      Angina Questionnaire adjusting for baseline values, site, and site by treatment effects.

      SAFETY PARAMETERS Hematology, blood chemistries, blood pressure and pulse, and frequency and
      occurrence of adverse events.

      STATISTICAL RATIONALE AND ANALYSIS A statistical rationale for the number of patients in the
      study has been provided. Interim analyses are planned after 15 patients have been enrolled in
      each group.

      ANTICIPATED TOTAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS 78 (39 per group). ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF PATIENTS AT
      EACH SITE Approximately 26

      A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, comparative trial evaluating the effects of
      ACE inhibition on microvascular function in women with coronary flow reserve limitations and
      chest discomfort. Women who are enrolled in the WISE study can be enrolled into this
      ancillary study if they meet the study criteria. Women not enrolled in the WISE study can
      also be entered into this ancillary study as long as they too meet the study criteria. After
      WISE evaluations including symptom assessment using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)
      and documented reduced coronary blood flow reserve (&lt;3.0 velocity), patients will be
      randomized to double-blind placebo or quinapril (started at 40 mg/d and titrated to 80 mg/d
      by the end of the first week). After treatment on the maximum tolerated dose for 16 weeks,
      patients will be reevaluated with coronary angiogram with coronary flow reserve measurements
      and assessment of angina using the SAQ.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Non pregnant women with chest discomfort 21 to 75 years of age from diverse
             racial/ethnic groups.

          2. Suspected ischemic heart disease (IHD) but no severe coronary stenosis (&gt; 50% diameter
             reduction) on coronary angiography used to qualify for WISE.

          3. Coronary flow reserve limitation (&lt;3.0 velocity).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are breast-feeding or who are pregnant. Women of childbearing potential may
             be enrolled but must agree not to become pregnant during the course of the study and
             must practice a method of birth control considered reliable by the investigator. If
             established on hormonal contraceptives for more than 3 months, patients will be
             allowed to participate providing this therapy remains constant throughout the study.
             If a patient becomes pregnant or begins breast-feeding during the study, she must be
             withdrawn immediately.

          2. Acute ischemic syndrome defined as acute myocardial infarction (MI) (by enzyme or
             electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria) or unstable angina within 1 month of entry.

          3. Uncontrolled moderate hypertension: Sitting blood pressure &gt;160/95mmHg with
             measurements recorded on at least 2 occasions (for blood pressure control, patients
             must first be stabilized, preferably with a diuretic, and kept on that dosing regimen
             throughout participation in the study).

          4. Severe heart failure defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV on
             treatment.

          5. Coronary revascularization by either coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or
             percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or Stent Placement.

          6. Conditions likely to influence outcomes independent of IHD: Severe lung, renal
             (creatinine &gt;3.0) or hepatic disease, surgically uncorrected significant congenital or
             valvular heart disease and other disease likely to be fatal or require frequent
             hospitalization within the next six months.

          7. Adherence or retention reasons: Recent alcoholism or drug abuse, psychiatric illness
             including severe depression, dementia, active participation in any other research
             trial other than WISE, unwilling to complete follow-up evaluation including repeat
             testing.

          8. Hypersensitivity to any medications to be used in the study (e.g. angioedema to
             ACE-I).

          9. Documented obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

         10. Aortic stenosis (valve area &lt;1.5cm).

         11. LV dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;=35%).

         12. History of cocaine or amphetamine abuse.

         13. ACE-I or angiotension 1 (AT-1) receptor blocker use within 30 days or need for
             continued ACEI/AT-1RB use.
