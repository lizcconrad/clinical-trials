      This study will be used to determine the effectiveness of GirlPOWER!, an innovative mentoring
      program for adolescent minority girls living in urban areas.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential benefits of adolescent mentoring programs cannot be overemphasized. Mentoring
      may be especially beneficial to urban-living, minority adolescents who may lack role models.
      The Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) organization administers a widely-praised and
      empirically-supported program that is committed to building successful mentoring
      relationships between adolescents and adults in their community. In collaboration with the
      BBBS affiliate agency in Chicago, the PI has developed an intervention called GirlPOWER!
      GirlPOWER! combines mentoring with self-esteem enhancement and health education and promotion
      strategies. This study will determine the effectiveness of the GirlPOWER! intervention and
      determine its feasibility in being applied to other populations.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the GirlPOWER! intervention or
      traditional mentoring through BBBS and followed for 1 year. Participants in the GirlPOWER!
      group and their mentors will engage in structured activities that focus on strengthening the
      mentoring relationship, promoting self-esteem, reducing levels of health-compromising
      behaviors such as substance use and violence, and increasing levels of health-enhancing
      behaviors. Traditional mentoring comprises less structured activities and typically includes
      general discussion of an adolescent's day-to-day life and any accomplishments and challenges
      he or she may have experienced. Participants will be assessed at study entry, 3 months
      following entry, and at the end of one year. Assessments will include surveys completed by
      youth as well as their parents, mentors, and teachers; academic data also will be obtained
      from school records.
