      To assess the anti-PRP antibody response one month after vaccination in the groups receiving
      a fourth consecutive dose of two formulations of DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects were previously primed with one of the two formulations of the combined
      DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine. At the age of 10 months, 50% of each group received a plain PRP
      challenge to assess the immune memory to PRP. In this booster study in the second year of
      life, all subjects who received DTPw-HBV/Hib and plain PRP will receive DTPw-HBV as a booster
      vaccination. All other subjects will receive as booster the same vaccine they received in the
      primary vaccination study.

          -  A male or female of at least 15 months of age at the time of the booster vaccination,

             vaccination.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering the study.

        Exclusion criteria for enrolment

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine(s)

             period.

          -  Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             during the period starting from 30 days before and ending 30 days after administration
             of study vaccines with the exception of oral polio vaccine (OPV).

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the booster dose.

          -  Previous booster vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B or
             Hib with the exception of plain PRP challenge.
