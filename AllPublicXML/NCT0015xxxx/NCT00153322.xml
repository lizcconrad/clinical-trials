      This study will demonstrate using measures of effectiveness, the feasibility of partnering
      with the community to create, disseminate, implement and evaluate Shape Up Somerville: Eat
      Smart. Play Hard., a community-based environmental change intervention to prevent obesity in
      culturally diverse, high-risk, early elementary school children. Based on formative work with
      parents, children, teachers, school food service, school officials, and community members, a
      community-wide campaign will be developed with targeted environmental change strategies for
      early elementary school children within the before-, during-, and after-school environments
      reinforced by changes within the home and community to support behavioral action and
      maintenance. The intervention targeting children will bring the energy equation into balance
      by offering numerous physical activity options that total up to 125 kcals per day and by
      improving the composition of the food served and the dietary options, particularly snack
      foods, available throughout the day. This study will measure awareness and participation of
      the partners and residents within the community. In addition the temporal change in BMI
      z-score will be monitored internally in 700 Somerville children and externally in 1000
      control children from 2 demographically-matched communities for one year and will be compared
      to the change in BMI z-score in children participating in Shape Up Somerville with children
      from control communities over the one-year intervention and for one year of follow up. If
      successful, Somerville will serve as the model community that paves the way for
      cost-effective nationwide environmental action to prevent obesity at the community level.
