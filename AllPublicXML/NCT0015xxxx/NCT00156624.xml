  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Thunder Trail is a randomized , double-blinded, placebo controlled German multi-centre
      study on the efficacy of local paclitaxel for prevention of restenosis in the superficial and
      popliteal artery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug eluting stents have been proven to reduce the restenosis rate in the coronary arteries.
      Unfortunately drug eluting stents failed to demonstrate superiority over bare stents in the
      superficial femoral artery. We could show that a non-stent based delivery of Taxan was equal
      or superior to drug eluting stents in an animal model. This was both true for the coronary
      arteries and peripheral vessels.

      In a prospective blinded trail &gt;135 patients are randomized either to receive Taxan locally
      administered with a balloon catheter during balloon angioplasty, or together with contrast
      media. One group serves as control. There were no limitations due to lesion length. Follow-up
      angiography will be after 6 months, 12 months and 2 years.
