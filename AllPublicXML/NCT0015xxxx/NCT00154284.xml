  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of everolimus in combination
      with basiliximab, and steroids with and without cyclosporine microemulsion in de novo kidney
      transplant recipients.

    <textblock>
      This is a combined analysis using 81 patients randomized and treated in CRAD001A2419
      (NCT00154284) with 33 randomized and treated in CRAD001A2423 (NCT00170807). This approach is
      reflected in the protocol amendments for each study, and the one clinical study report for
      both.

    <measure>Renal Function Measured by Calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR Calculated According to the Nankivell Formula)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Month 3 and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Nankivell's formula for calculated GFR is shown below:
GFR [mL/min] = 6.7/C + W/4 - UREA/2 - 100/H2+ 35 (25 for females). Where W is body weight at specific visit [kg], H is height at specific visit [m], C is the serum concentration of creatinine [mmol/L], and UREA is the serum concentration of urea [mmol/L]. UREA was calculated from blood urea nitrogen (BUN) lab data by: UREA = 2.1441*BUN. If a GFR value from Nankivell formula was less than 10 [mL/min], then the value was assigned as 10 [mL/min].</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Biopsy-proven Acute Rejection (BPAR) Episodes, Graft Loss, Death or Loss to Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Renal biopsies were collected for all cases of suspected acute rejection. For these cases, regardless of initiation of anti-rejection treatment, a graft core biopsy had been performed within 48 hours. These biopsies were listed on the Kidney Allograft Biopsy eCRF and the results used for patient management for BPAR. Graft loss was defined as the allograft was presumed to be lost on the day the patient started dialysis and was not able to subsequently be removed from dialysis as well as re-transplant. BPAR, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up was analyzed by means of frequency tables.</description>

    <time_frame>6 month and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Creatinine clearance calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula and summarized by mean, and standard deviation. Cockcroft-Gault formula to calculate Creatinine Clearance (CrCl[mL/min]) is shown below:
CrCl[mL/min] = (140 - A) * W / (72 * C) * R. Where A is age at sample date [years], W is body weight at specific visit [kg], C is the serum concentration of creatinine [mg/dL], R = 1 if the patient is male and = 0.85 if female.</description>

    <description>Patients were treated with everolimus and cyclosporine for 3 months post-transplantation. Everolimus (Certican) was administered orally, in two divided doses (b.i.d), and at the same time as Cyclosporine (Neoral). Everolimus (Certican) dose was adjusted in order to maintain a trough level between 3 and 8 ng/mL until randomization. After randomization the target trough range remained at 3 - 8 ng/mL in the cyclosporine (Neoral) continuation groups for a period of 9 months. Each patient was administered i.v. prednisone (or equivalent) pre- or intra-operatively according to center practice.</description>

    <description>Patients were treated with everolimus and cyclosporine for 3 months post-transplantation. Everolimus (Certican) was administered orally, in two divided doses (b.i.d), and at the same time as Cyclosporine (Neoral). Everolimus (Certican) dose was adjusted in order to maintain a trough level between 3 and 8 ng/mL until randomization. Therefore, patients were randomized to cyclosporine withdrawal over a period of 1 month (±1 week) in study A2419 (NCT00154284) and over 3 months (±1 week) in study A2423 (NCT00170807). After randomization, final target trough range for everolimus was 8 - 12 ng/mL. Each patient was administered i.v. prednisone (or equivalent) pre- or intra-operatively according to center practice.</description>

        <description>Nankivell’s formula for calculated GFR is shown below:
GFR [mL/min] = 6.7/C + W/4 – UREA/2 – 100/H2+ 35 (25 for females). Where W is body weight at specific visit [kg], H is height at specific visit [m], C is the serum concentration of creatinine [mmol/L], and UREA is the serum concentration of urea [mmol/L]. UREA was calculated from blood urea nitrogen (BUN) lab data by: UREA = 2.1441*BUN. If a GFR value from Nankivell formula was less than 10 [mL/min], then the value was assigned as 10 [mL/min].</description>

Everolimus (Certican) was administered orally, in two divided doses (b.i.d), and at the same time as Cyclosporine (Neoral). Everolimus (Certican) dose was adjusted in order to maintain a trough level between 3 and 8 ng/mL until randomization. After randomization the target trough range remained at 3 - 8 ng/mL in the cyclosporine (Neoral) continuation groups for a period of 9 months.

        <description>Renal biopsies were collected for all cases of suspected acute rejection. For these cases, regardless of initiation of anti-rejection treatment, a graft core biopsy had been performed within 48 hours. These biopsies were listed on the Kidney Allograft Biopsy eCRF and the results used for patient management for BPAR. Graft loss was defined as the allograft was presumed to be lost on the day the patient started dialysis and was not able to subsequently be removed from dialysis as well as re-transplant. BPAR, graft loss, death, or loss to follow-up was analyzed by means of frequency tables.</description>

          <title>Everolimus (Certican) With Cyclosporine (Neoral) Withdrawal</title>
          <description>Patients were treated with everolimus and cyclosporine for 3 months post-transplantation. Everolimus (Certican) was administered orally, in two divided doses (b.i.d), and at the same time as Cyclosporine (Neoral). Everolimus (Certican) dose was adjusted in order to maintain a trough level between 3 and 8 ng/mL until randomization. Therefore, patients were randomized to cyclosporine withdrawal over a period of 1 month (±1 week) in study A2419 (NCT00154284) and over 3 months (±1 week) in study A2423 (NCT00170807). After randomization, final target trough range for everolimus was 8 - 12 ng/mL. Each patient was administered i.v. prednisone (or equivalent) pre- or intra-operatively according to center practice.</description>

          <description>Patients were treated with everolimus and cyclosporine for 3 months post-transplantation. Everolimus (Certican) was administered orally, in two divided doses (b.i.d), and at the same time as Cyclosporine (Neoral).

After randomization the target trough range remained at 3 - 8 ng/mL in the cyclosporine (Neoral) continuation groups for a period of 9 months.
