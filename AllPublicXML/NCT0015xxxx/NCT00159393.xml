  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney stones vary in size from a tiny grain of sand to as large as filling the inside of the
      kidney. Treatment decisions depend on the size, location, and composition of the stone. Some
      kidney stones can be treated with lithotripsy (breaking up stones inside the body with shock
      waves created outside the body) or ureteroscopy (placing a small telescope up the urine
      channel to remove the stone). When stones are large in size or in the lower part of the
      kidney, a percutaneous (making a passage from the back into the kidney) procedure has been
      found to be the best method to remove the stones safely and efficiently. A passage is made
      into the back to allow a small telescope to see the stone and break it into fragments for
      removal. A small catheter is placed at the end of the procedure to allow the kidney to drain.

      The purpose of this study is to record information about your surgery into a database so we
      can look at how patients who have had this procedure have done over time. We hope that
      reporting the outcomes of this surgery will be helpful to urologists and patients in the
      future. There may be certain factors that can be identified through this study as having
      better outcomes that may help make future surgeries safer.

      Patients of IU Health Physicians Urology who have been scheduled to undergo percutaneous
      removal of one or more kidney stones will be asked to consent to be part of our registry and
      database for percutaneous procedures. The database contains information about the subjects
      surgery, such as stone size and location, number of access sites to remove the stone, length
      of stay in the hospital, secondary procedures, etc. This information is reviewed periodically
      to look for trends so that physicians may find ways to improve the percutaneous procedure.
      All information in the database is kept confidential. Data is collected at follow-up
      appointments at one month and one year to see if the subject is still stone free.
