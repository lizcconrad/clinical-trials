      The purpose of this study is to show that Protein C Concentrate is a safe and effective
      treatment for subjects with congenital protein C deficiency. Depending on the type of
      treatment required, patients are assigned to one of 3 study parts: Part 1 is for the
      treatment of acute episodes, Part 2 is for short-term prophylaxis, and Part 3 is for
      long-term prophylaxis in infants aged less than 6 months only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newborn subjects &lt;= 6 months of age: diagnosis of severe congenital protein C
             deficiency, with documented functional protein C level &lt; 20%. If a genetic diagnosis
             is not available prior to initiation of Protein C Concentrate treatment, a documented
             family history of protein C deficiency is required.

          -  Subjects &gt; 6 months of age: confirmed diagnosis of severe congenital protein C
             deficiency, i.e., by

          -  a genetic analysis of severe congenital protein C deficiency (i.e., homozygous or
             double heterozygous) OR

          -  a documented family history of protein C deficiency AND a documented functional
             protein C level &lt; 20% while the subject is in an asymptomatic state and not receiving
             oral anticoagulation therapy

          -  Signed and dated informed consent from either the subject or the subject's legally
             authorized representative prior to enrollment. Informed consent includes consent for
             conducting a genetic analysis (if the genetic defect is unknown).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of allergic reactions to Protein C Concentrate. In the case of
             allergic reactions occurring at the Protein C Concentrate injection site; exclusion
             from the study is at the discretion of the investigator but should be reported as an
             AE regardless of the subject's inclusion in or exclusion from the study.

          -  Participation in any clinical study in which another investigational agent is used
             within 30 days prior to enrollment or its use is expected at any time for the duration
             of study participation.
