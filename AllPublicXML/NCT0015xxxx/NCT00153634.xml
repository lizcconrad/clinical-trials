  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized multi-center clinical trial to compare the microbiological efficacy,
      clinical efficacy, and safety of using standard versus biofilm susceptibility testing of P.
      aeruginosa sputum isolates to guide antibiotic selection for treatment of airway infection in
      clinically stable patients with CF.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were screened to determine eligibility and to obtain a sputum culture. Eligible
      patients were randomized to either the standard or biofilm study arm. Antibiotic selection
      was performed centrally according to a standard algorithm using the susceptibility test
      results of the assigned study arm. On Day 0, patients were started on a 14-day course of two
      antibiotics as selected per protocol. Antibiotics were administered intravenously (IV) and/or
      orally. A follow-up phone call or visit occurred on Day 7. An end of treatment visit was
      conducted after completion of antibiotic therapy. A total of 39 patients were randomized.
      Many screened patients were ineligible for randomization based on microbiology results.
