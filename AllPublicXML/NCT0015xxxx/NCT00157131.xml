  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate skin graft adherence and wound healing in
      burn patients to evaluate whether FS 4IU VH S/D is equivalent or superior to the current
      standard of care (staples). The primary endpoint is achievement of complete (100%) wound
      closure within 28 days.

    <description>FS 4IU VH S/D was administered intraoperatively to the wound bed by spray application using the TISSOMAT and Spray Set. Only the DUPLOJECTvii system and Spray Set (connection tube with sterile filter and spray head) device was used for simultaneous spray application of the study product. A thin layer of FS 4IU VH S/D was applied to the wound bed using a &quot;painting motion&quot; from side to side to achieve coverage. The recommended dosing volume was 2.0 to 4.0 mL/100 cm2. One 2-mL pack (4 mL total volume) of FS 4IU VH S/D applied using the TISSOMAT and Spray Set was sufficient to coat a wound bed of 100-200 cm2.</description>
