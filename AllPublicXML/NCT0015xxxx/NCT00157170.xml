      To evaluate the impact of a supervised exercise program (SEP) on self-efficacy,quality of
      life status and cardiovascular fitness among people with HIV in a 24 week randomised
      controlled trial.We hypothesised that a combined aerobic and resisted exercise (intervention)
      would improve these parameters compared to an individual walking program with monthly group
      forum (control).

    <textblock>
      With combination antiretroviral therapy, HIV has become a chronic, manageable medical
      condition. Medication adherence is now a critical determinant of patient outcomes. Quality of
      life (QOL) rather than just survival has also become an important consideration in HIV
      management strategies. The role of non-pharmacological interventions such as exercise to
      enhance self efficacy (which correlates with adherence) and QOL among people with HIV
      requires formal investigation.

      We evaluated the impact of a supervised exercise program (SEP) on self-efficacy among people
      with HIV in a 24 week, randomised controlled trial of participation in a SEP with combined
      aerobic and resisted exercise (intervention) versus an individual walking program with
      monthly group forum (control). QOL and cardiovascular fitness were also evaluated as
      secondary endpoints. Twenty subjects were enrolled in each arm, and assessments were
      performed at baseline, 2 month and 6 months, including a Generic Self Efficacy Scale, 1
      minute heart rate response post 3 minute step test, and a validated HIV-specific QOL survey.

      Self efficacy and cardiovascular fitness improved in the intervention but not the control
      subjects over the study period (p&lt;0.0001 for both). QOL also improved (8 out of 10
      dimensions) in the intervention group but not in controls (0 out of 10 dimensions).

      These data support the use of SEP as an important therapeutic intervention for people with
      HIV, with significant benefits to self efficacy, cardiovascular fitness and QOL over six
      months. Importantly, these benefits were not achieved through unsupervised exercise over the
      same period.
