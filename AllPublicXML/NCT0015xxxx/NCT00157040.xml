  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether rAHF-PFM is effective and safe in the
      treatment of children with hemophilia A. The study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 of the study
      is a pharmacokinetic evaluation, and Part 2 is an evaluation of efficacy and safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is less than 6 years of age

          -  Severe or moderately-severe hemophilia A as defined by a baseline factor VIII level &lt;=
             2%, documented at screening or on the basis of historical data (e.g., at hemophilia
             diagnosis)

          -  Documented medical history of at least 50 exposure days for treatment with all other
             factor VIII products

          -  Subject's parent or legally authorized representative has provided informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Detectable inhibitor to factor VIII measured in the screening sample by the local or
             central hemostasis laboratory

          -  History of inhibitor to factor VIII at any time prior to screening

          -  Subject has any one of the following laboratory abnormalities at the time of
             screening:

               1. platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3

               2. hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10 g/dL (100 g/L)

               3. serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 times the ULN for age

               4. total bilirubin &gt; 2 times the ULN for age

          -  Subject has an inherited or acquired hemostatic defect other than hemophilia A (e.g.,
             platelet dysfunction secondary to uremia, liver failure, von Willebrand's Disease)

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity to RECOMBINATE rAHF

          -  Subject is currently participating in another investigational drug study or has
             participated in any clinical study involving an investigational drug within 30 days of
             study entry

          -  Subject is identified by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to cooperate
             with study procedures
