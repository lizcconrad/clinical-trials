  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to assess whether the application of flammacerium for
      2 days is as good as, or even better than, the application of flammacerium for 10 days
      regarding woundhealing in partial thickness burns.

      Cerium is suggested to halt the cytokine cascade ensuing burn injury by binding the 'burn
      toxin' and, when used in combination with silver-sulfadiazine, may enhance its antibacterial
      effect. Since 1984, the combination of cerium and silver sulfadiazine, flammacerium, has been
      used in our centre. Current practice is to treat acute, non-facial, burns with daily cleaning
      and (re-)application of flammacerium for a total of ten days. However, prolonged application
      of cerium is thought to be unnecessary - it is effective in the early stages after injury-
      and prolonged application of silver sulfadiazine has a negative effect on wound healing. The
      objective of the proposed study is therefore, to assess whether the application of
      flammacerium for 2 days is as good as, or even better than, the application of flammacerium
      for 10 days regarding woundhealing in partial thickness burns.
