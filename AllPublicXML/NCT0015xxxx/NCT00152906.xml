  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A minority of patients with colorectal liver metastases and hepatobiliary cancer (primary
      liver cancer) are candidates for surgery, but there are no curative treatment options for
      these patients. Their median survival time is 3 to 12 months. Stereotactic radiation (SRT)
      (highly conformal radiotherapy (CRT)) is a treatment option for these patients with
      unresectable liver cancer, now possible due to improvements in our ability to localize and
      immobilize liver tumors and an improved understanding of the partial liver volume tolerance
      to radiation. SRT should permit liver tumors to be treated to tumorcidal doses while sparing
      the uninvolved liver, decreasing the risk of treatment related normal tissue toxicity. With
      such conformal radiation, it is possible to deliver radiation in fewer fractions than
      traditionally required, which should be more convenient for patients. In this study, CRT will
      be delivered during shallow breathing or breath hold to minimize organ motion due to
      breathing, decreasing the volume of normal liver that must be irradiated.
