        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female cardiac recipients 18-65 years of age undergoing primary heart
             transplantation. The graft must be functional at the time of randomization.

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault) ≥ 50 mL/min at screening.

          -  Patients who have given written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who are recipients of multiple solid organ transplants or have previously received
        organ transplants.

        Patients who received any investigational drug or who have been treated with an
        immunosuppressive drug or treatment within 1 month prior to randomization Patients
        receiving induction therapy which is not standard per local practice Patients with donor
        greater than 60 years and/or with known donor coronary or heart disease at the time of
        transplant.

        Donor heart cold ischemic time &gt;6 hours. Patients with Panel Reactive Antibodies &gt;20%.
        Patients who are recipients of ABO incompatible transplants Patients with platelet count
        &lt;50,000/mm3 at the evaluation before randomization.

        Presence of severe hypercholesterolemia (≥350 mg/dL; ≥9 mmol/L) or hypertriglyceridemia
        (≥750 mg/dL; ≥8.5 mmol/L) Patients with an absolute neutrophil count of ≤1,500/mm3 or white
        blood cell count of ≤4000/mm3 at baseline before surgery Patients with a history of
        significant coagulopathy or medical condition requiring long term anti-coagulation after
        transplantation (low dose aspirin treatment is allowed) Patients who are HIV-positive or
        Hepatitis C (PCR+ only) or B surface antigen positive. Laboratory results obtained within 6
        months prior to study entry are acceptable.

        Recipients of organs from donors who test positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen or
        Hepatitis C (PCR+ only) are excluded Patients with a known hypersensitivity to similar
        drugs and to the components of the formulations Patients being treated with terfenadine,
        astemizole, or cisapride. Patients who are treated with drugs strong inducers or inhibitors
        of cytochrome P450 3A4.

        Patients with any past (within the past 5 years) or present malignancy (other than excised
        basal cell carcinoma) Patients with clinically significant systemic infection Patients who
        are unable to take oral medication Existence of any surgical or medical condition, which in
        the opinion of the investigator, might significantly alter the absorption, distribution,
        metabolism and excretion of study medication, and/or the presence of severe diarrhea or
        active peptic ulcer Abnormal physical or laboratory findings of clinical significance
        within 2 weeks of randomization which would interfere with the objectives of the study
