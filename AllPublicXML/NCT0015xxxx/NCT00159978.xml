  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxia and tumor cell proliferation are important mechanisms contributing to resistance to
      radiotherapy in human head and neck tumor cells. Currently, assessment of these two tumor
      characteristics is performed in biopsies using immunohistochemical staining and subsequent
      analysis. A promising non-invasive method of characterizing a tumor is the use of
      positron-emission tomography (PET). Specific tracers can be used to detect hypoxia and
      proliferative activity. 18F-misonidazole is a tracer for hypoxia and 18F-thymidine is a
      tracer for proliferation.

      Patients suffering from head and neck cancer and who will undergo surgery will be included in
      this study.

      One week before the surgery the patients will undergo a CT-scan and a PET-scan with either of
      the tracers. Shortly before the surgery they will be given immunohistochemically detectable
      marker substances enabling the characterization of the tumor samples gathered from the
      resection specimen. These markers are pimonidazole for detection of hypoxia and
      iododeoxyuridine for detection of tumor cell proliferation.

      The data collected by PET-scan will be analysed and compared to the results acquired by
      immunohistochemistry.

    <description>18F-FLT-PET-images will be acquired one hour after injection of 250 MBq FLT. 18F-MISO-PET: 400 MBq FMISO will be injected intravenously. Marker administration: The day before surgery (â‰¤ 24h) pimonidazole (500 mg/m2) will be administered intravenously in 100 ml saline over 20 min. IdUrd (200 mg) will be administered as bolus injection 20 min before surgery.</description>
