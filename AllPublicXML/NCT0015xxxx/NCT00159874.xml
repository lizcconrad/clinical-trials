    <measure>Downtitration in Dose Due to Intolerability.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-DMC recomendation (04 August 2011)</time_frame>
    <description>Based on review of the survival data, DMC concluded that the high dose of sildenafil was associated with a harmful effect on survival when compared to the low dose. The DMC also expressed concern as to the potential dose-response relationship between increasing dose and mortality. Therefore, on 04 August 2011, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the 40 mg and 80 mg three times a day (TID) doses, as well as the 20 mg TID dose in children with body weight ≤20 kg. The protocol was amended per DMC recommendations.</description>

    <measure>Peak Volume of Oxygen (VO2) Consumed at Year 1 Using a Bicycle Ergometry Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPX)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise Tolerance Test (CPX test) was performed on developmentally able participants to determine the peak volume of VO2 consumed.

      <recruitment_details>This extension study included 220 participants at 31 sites. 14 participants did not go from A1481131 (NCT00159913) to A1481156. Participants from one center in Canada participated in base study A1481131 (NCT00159913) but not in this extension study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants remained in the same dose group as in study A1481131 (NCT00159913). Participants randomized to placebo in NCT00159913 were rerandomized to sildenafil in A1481156. Placebo participants in low weight category were rerandomized to medium or high dose (1:2) and other weight categories were rerandomized to low, medium or high dose (1:1:1).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Based on review of the survival data, DMC concluded that the high dose of sildenafil was associated with a harmful effect on survival when compared to the low dose. The DMC also expressed concern as to the potential dose-response relationship between increasing dose and mortality. Therefore, on 04 August 2011, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the 40 mg and 80 mg three times a day (TID) doses, as well as the 20 mg TID dose in children with body weight ≤20 kg. The protocol was amended per DMC recommendations.</description>

        <title>Peak Volume of Oxygen (VO2) Consumed at Year 1 Using a Bicycle Ergometry Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPX)</title>
        <description>Exercise Tolerance Test (CPX test) was performed on developmentally able participants to determine the peak volume of VO2 consumed. Participants were assumed to be developmentally able if they had a CPX exercise assessment at any visit during study A1481131 (NCT00159913). The CPX tests were performed as close to trough plasma levels of sildenafil as possible, i.e., prior to dosing and at least 4 hours after the previous dose. If participants were able to perform the CPX test in Study A1481131 (NCT00159913), they were expected to be able to perform the exercise paradigm in the extension study (A1481156) unless their clinical condition had deteriorated and the investigator considered this was unsafe for the participant</description>

        <population>An ITT population included all randomized participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication in base study and certain analyses were conducted at pre-specified time points: 1, 2 years and 3, 4 and 5 years (where data quantity allowed) from A1481131 (NCT00159913) baseline. Only developmentally able participants were used for this analysis.</population>

          <description>Exercise Tolerance Test (CPX test) was performed on developmentally able participants to determine the peak volume of VO2 consumed. Participants were assumed to be developmentally able if they had a CPX exercise assessment at any visit during study A1481131 (NCT00159913). The CPX tests were performed as close to trough plasma levels of sildenafil as possible, i.e., prior to dosing and at least 4 hours after the previous dose. If participants were able to perform the CPX test in Study A1481131 (NCT00159913), they were expected to be able to perform the exercise paradigm in the extension study (A1481156) unless their clinical condition had deteriorated and the investigator considered this was unsafe for the participant</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Anaerobic Threshold at Year 1.</title>
        <description>Exercise Tolerance Test (CPX test) was performed on developmentally able participants to measure the anaerobic threshold at Week 16 and Year 1. Participants were assumed to be developmentally able if they had a CPX exercise assessment at any visit during study A1481131 (NCT00159913). The CPX tests were performed as close to trough plasma levels of sildenafil as possible, i.e., prior to dosing and at least 4 hours after the previous dose. If participants were able to perform the CPX test in Study A1481131 (NCT00159913), they were expected to be able to perform the exercise paradigm in the extension study (A1481156) unless their clinical condition had deteriorated and the investigator considered this was unsafe for the participant.</description>

          <description>The WHO PH functional classification was as follows: Class I : Participants with PH but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Class II : Participants with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Class III : Participants with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV : Participants with PH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. Changes from baseline in functional class were summarised at Years 1, 2, 3, and 4. Numbers of participants improving by 3 classes, improving by 2 classes, improving by 1 class, not changing, worsening by 1 class, worsening by 2 classes or worsening by 3 classes from A1481131 baseline at Years 1, 2, 3 and 4 were evaluated.</description>
          <population>An ITT population included all randomly assigned participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication in base study and certain analyses were conducted at pre-specified time points: 1, 2 years and 3, 4 and 5 years (where data quantity allowed) from A1481131 (NCT00159913) baseline.</population>

        <title>Summary of Shift in Changes From Start of Sildenafil in WHO PH Functional Class by A1481156 Treatment Group at Year 4.</title>
        <description>The WHO PH functional classification was as follows: Class I : Participants with PH but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Class II : Participants with PH resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Class III : Participants with PH resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV : Participants with PH with inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. Changes from baseline in functional class were summarised at Years 1, 2, 3, and 4. Numbers of participants improving by 3 classes, improving by 2 classes, improving by 1 class, not changing, worsening by 1 class, worsening by 2 classes or worsening by 3 classes from A1481131 baseline at Years 1, 2, 3 and 4 were evaluated.</description>

        <title>Physician Global Assessment at Year 1</title>
        <description>The physician global assessment of disease severity was assessed at Year 1 in this extension study. The number and percentage of participants with markedly improved, moderately improved, mild improvement, no change, slightly worse, moderately worse, markedly worse were evaluated. Participants who withdrew from study treatment after at least 10 weeks of treatment were requested to perform the global assessments.</description>

        <population>An ITT population included all randomly assigned participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication in base study and certain analyses were conducted at pre-specified time points: 1, 2 years and 3, 4 and 5 years (where data quantity allowed) from A1481131 (NCT00159913) baseline.</population>
