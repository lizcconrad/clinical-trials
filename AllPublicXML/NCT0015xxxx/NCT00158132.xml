  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine addiction is a serious health problem with no available medical treatment for
      preventing relapse. Amantadine, a medication that improves muscle control, and propranolol, a
      medication that lowers blood pressure, may be useful in treating cocaine addiction in
      individuals with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms. This study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of amantadine and propranolol in preventing drug relapse among cocaine addicts.

      Cocaine withdrawal symptoms are a major contributing factor for why outpatient cocaine
      dependence treatment programs often fail. Individuals with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms
      often experience anxiety, shaking, and muscle pain. Amantadine is a medication currently used
      to improve muscle control, reduce shaking, and lessen stiffness. Therefore, it may help
      reduce the muscle pain that some cocaine addicts experience. By enhancing activity of the
      brain chemical dopamine, amantadine may also reduce other symptoms associated with cocaine
      withdrawal. Propranolol is a medication currently used to treat high blood pressure and
      irregular heart rhythms. It may reduce anxiety and lessen cocaine cravings in individuals
      addicted to cocaine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of amantadine
      and propranolol, alone and in combination, for treating cocaine addicts with severe cocaine
      withdrawal symptoms.

      A 2-week baseline evaluation period will be followed by an 8-week treatment phase. During the
      baseline evaluation, cocaine use will be measured with urine tests, three times each week.
      Only participants who are experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms and who use cocaine at
      least twice during the first 2 weeks will continue in the study. Eligible individuals will
      then be randomly assigned to receive amantadine alone, propranolol alone, a combination of
      amantadine and propranolol, or placebo. Treatments will begin at Week 3 and study visits will
      occur three times each week. Cocaine levels will be monitored throughout the study with urine
      tests.

             (CSSA)
