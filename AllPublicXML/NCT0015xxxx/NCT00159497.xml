  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to investigate the influence of HA-coating on bone remodeling around
      the cup in cementless THA.

      100 patients gave informed consent to participate in a controlled randomized study between
      porous coated Trilogy® versus Trilogy Calcicoat®. The cup was inserted in press-fit fixation.
      The femoral component was a cementless porous coated titanium alloy stem (Bi-Metric®), with a
      modular 28 mm CrCo head. Effect parameters were Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Bone Mineral
      Density (BMD) determined by DEXA scanning.

      Measurements revealed no difference between the two groups after 3 years, neither in clinical
      outcome nor in terms of periprosthetic bone density. Patients with Body Mass Index above
      normal regained more bone mineral than patients with normal weight. This finding supports the
      assumption that load is beneficial to bone remodeling. Advantages of better sealing of the
      bone-prosthesis interface, preventing polyethylene induced osteolysis, may still be
      anticipated for the 7 or 12 year follow-up examinations
