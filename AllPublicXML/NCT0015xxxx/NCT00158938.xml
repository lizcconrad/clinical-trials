    <textblock>
      This clinical study was a prospective, multi-center, clinical evaluation to document safety
      and effectiveness of the EASYTRAK 3 lead in humans. Patients implanted with the EASYTRAK 3
      lead were followed through pre-discharge, 1-month, 3-month and 6-month follow-ups

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV) including left ventricular
             dysfunction (EF &lt;= 35%) and QRS duration &gt;= 120 ms remaining symptomatic despite
             stable, optimal heart failure drug therapy.

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dL obtained no more than two weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Age 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and
             national law.

          -  Willing and capable of providing informed consent, undergoing a device implant,
             participating in all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an
             approved clinical investigational center and at the intervals defined by this
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A known hypersensitivity to a 1.0 mg (0.5 mg per electrode) dose of dexamethasone
             acetate.

          -  Previous cardiac resynchronization therapy, a coronary venous pace/sense lead or
             attempted LV lead placement.

          -  Pre-existing cardioversion/defibrillation leads other than those specified in this
             investigational plan (unless the investigator intends to replace them with permitted
             cardioversion/defibrillation leads).

          -  Requiring dialysis.

          -  A myocardial infarct, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary
             artery bypass graft during the preceding 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or infiltrative cardiomyopathy (e.g.,
             amyloidosis, sarcoidosis).

          -  A documented life expectancy of less than 6 months or expected to undergo heart
             transplant within 6 months.

          -  Enrolled in any concurrent study, without prior Guidant written approval, that may
             confound the results of this study.

          -  Have a mechanical tricuspid heart valve.
