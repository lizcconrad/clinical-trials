  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, an autosomal recessive condition, is mainly caused by
      mutations in the gene 21-hydroxylase and is treated with glucocorticoids in a slightly
      supraphysiological dose. Adult patients seem to be characterized by insulin resistance, which
      may be caused by the glucocorticoids and/or the accompanying obesity. The hypothesis of this
      study is that pioglitazone can improve insulin sensitivity and correlated cardiovascular risk
      factors in this specific group of patients. This will be tested in a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over trial; insulin sensitivity will be quantified by euglycemic
      hyperinsulinemic clamp studies.
