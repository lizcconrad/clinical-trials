  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the researchers will be enrolling patients who are failing their current
      antiretroviral regimen who also have resistance to 3TC or FTC. Patients will have their
      current antiretroviral regimen changed based on resistance testing and also be randomly
      assigned to either include, or not include 3TC/FTC in this new regimen. The purpose of the
      research is to investigate whether the change in therapy results in a decrease in the amount
      of virus particles and an increase in the CD4 cell count. In addition the researchers are
      investigating the relationship between the existence of resistance and the rate of decrease
      in viral load, and also to determine if continuing 3TC/FTC (despite being resistant to the
      medications) has any effect on the rate of decrease of viral load, or effect on CD4 counts.

    <textblock>
      In this randomized, open-label, controlled trial, HIV-infected patients who are failing
      3TC/FTC-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy, (HAART), will be offered individual
      treatment selection based on best clinical judgment and genotypic HIV-RNA resistance
      analysis. Patients who meet entry criteria will first be randomized to either continue or
      discontinue 3TC/FTC while they remain on their current therapy. HIV-1 viral load will be
      measured 4 times over a period of 14 days to determine the virologic response to this change.
      At day 14, each patient's regimen will be optimized to a new combination based on a genotype
      test taken at study entry. Patients will then start on the new salvage regimen, including or
      not including 3TC/FTC based on their initial randomization. Additional HIV-1 viral load
      measurements will be obtained to determine the virologic response to the new salvage regimen
      over 24 weeks.
