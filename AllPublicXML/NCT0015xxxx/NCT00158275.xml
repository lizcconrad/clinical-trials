      This study will determine the effectiveness of an intervention consisting of combined
      strategies in reducing the symptoms of both depression and chronic back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between depression and back pain is complex. Depression is the most common
      mental condition associated with chronic back pain. Despite this relationship, many patients
      with depression and back pain seek treatment only for one of the two conditions, which can
      worsen the untreated condition. An intervention that reduces the symptoms of both depression
      and back pain is needed. This study will determine the effectiveness of an integrated
      intervention in reducing both back pain and depression symptoms.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either an integrated intervention or
      standard of care for 6 months. Participants in the integrated intervention group will receive
      cognitive behavioral therapy for back pain and antidepressants and/or problem solving therapy
      for depression. Study visits will initially occur once a week and then taper to once every 2
      weeks for the 6-month duration; the time of tapering will depend on participant response to
      treatment and will be at the investigator's discretion. Depression and back pain symptoms
      will be assessed in all participants at study entry, at the end of treatment, and 6 months
      after the end of treatment. The study entry and study completion assessments will occur
      during study visits. The last assessment will be a telephone interview.
