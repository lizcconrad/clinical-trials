  <official_title>A Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Parallel Group, Positive-controlled Trial Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Levetiracetam (1000 to 3000 mg/Day Oral b.i.d.) to Carbamazepine (400 to 1200 mg/Day Oral b.i.d.), Used as Monotherapy for up to a Maximum of 121 Weeks in Subjects (≥ 16 Years) Newly or Recently Diagnosed as Suffering From Epilepsy, and Experiencing Partial or Generalized Tonic-clonic Seizures</official_title>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with newly or recently diagnosed epilepsy having experienced unprovoked
             partial seizures (IA, IB, IC with clear focal origin), or generalized tonic-clonic
             seizures (without clear focal origin), that are classifiable according to the
             International Classification of Epileptic Seizures. The discrimination between IC and
             IIE is not requested for inclusion.

          -  Subjects with at least 2 unprovoked seizures separated by a minimum of 48 hours in the
             year preceding randomization out of which at least 1 unprovoked seizure in the 3
             months preceding randomization.

          -  Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy.

          -  Male/female subjects (≥16 years).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of seizures of other types than partial (IA, IB, IC, with clear
             focal origin) and generalized tonic-clonic (without clear focal origin) seizures.

          -  History or presence of seizures occurring only in clustered patterns, defined as
             repeated seizures occurring over a short period of time, i.e. &lt; 20 minutes, with or
             without function regained between 2 ictal events.

          -  History, clinical or EEG finding suggestive of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)
             at randomization.
