  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent health policy documents have endorsed an integrated model of collaboration between
      pharmacists and physicians in primary care. The integration of pharmacists into primary care
      has been identified as a priority for primary health care reform in Canada. However, the best
      way to do this has not been demonstrated or evaluated. This demonstration project shows the
      various ways in which pharmacists can be trained and integrated into different family
      practice settings, the processes and costs associated with doing this, and the outcomes
      observed. The main hypothesis is that pharmacist integration into family practice will
      optimize medication use, clinical care and clinical outcomes. This information provides
      policy makers with necessary information about collaboration between pharmacists and family
      physicians for their overall goal of reforming the delivery of primary health care to the
      population.

      The overall goal of IMPACT was to improve patient outcomes by optimizing drug therapy through
      a community practice model that integrates pharmacists into family practices.

      This multi-site demonstration project involved 7 pharmacists, approximately 70 physicians and
      approximately 150,000 patients. Within each practice site, a pharmacist with special clinical
      training worked 2.5 days per week for 2 years and coordinated a multifaceted intervention
      aimed at optimizing drug therapy to improve patient outcomes (blood pressure, cholesterol,
      diabetes, pain control, constipation, etc.) The integrated pharmacist conducted patient
      assessments for medication problems, optimized office system medication management (e.g.
      develop process for handling of medication samples), and provided education (academic
      detailing ) focussed on key therapeutic areas. Pharmacists were provided with ongoing support
      from a training and mentorship program and the services of the Ontario Pharmacistsâ€™
      Association Drug Information Centre.

      The family physicians and other members of the practice worked closely with the pharmacist in
      implementing these strategic interventions. Family physicians from a range of practice models
      (Ontario Family Health Networks, Primary Care Networks, and other types of family physician
      group practices) participated in this project.

      Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the process of integration,
      pharmacist service uptake, drug-related patient outcomes, and the costs associated with
      program implementation for sustainability. The integration of the physicians and pharmacists
      at the practice sites were evaluated with the aim of generating a practical and transferable
      practice model. The main hypothesis was that pharmacist integration into family practice will
      optimize medication use, clinical care and clinical outcomes.
