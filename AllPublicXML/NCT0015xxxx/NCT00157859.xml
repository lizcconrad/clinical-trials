  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug resistant strains of P.falciparum and P.vivax are becoming increasingly prevalent
      in the Asia Pacific rim. To determine the efficacy of locally recommended antimalarial
      protocols in Papua, Indonesia, consecutive patients presenting to a rural clinic were
      enrolled into a prospective efficacy study. Patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria
      were treated with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and those with vivax malaria
      with chloroquine monotherapy. Patients failing therapy received unsupervised oral quinine +/-
      doxycycline for 7 days. Follow-up was continued for 42 days for falciparum malaria and 28
      days for vivax malaria.

      The study hypothesis was that current recommended antimalarial protocols were no longer
      effective.
