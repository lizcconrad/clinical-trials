      Patients with rectal cancer who are candidates for pre-operative radiation therapy may be
      enrolled in the Phase I, single center study. Patients will have a full blood count,
      biochemistry, urinalysis, and ECG for safety evaluation. Sequential cohorts of three patients
      will be given increasing doses of oral topotecan and fixed doses of concurrent radiation (45
      Gy) over five weeks. The starting dose of oral topotecan is 0.25 mg/m2 to be concomitantly
      administered with radiation (45 Gy) x 5 days every week unless the radiation is interrupted
      for Holidays/Weekends or toxicity requiring treatment delays occurs. A total of 25 doses are
      planned.

    <description>Subjects will be administered topotecan along with concomitant radiation for five days per week for five weeks. Topotecan doses will start at 0.25 milligrams per square meter (mg/m˄2) and will be escalated 0.15 mg/m˄2 for subsequent cohorts. To advance to the next dose level of topotecan, at least two subjects will have to complete therapy with oral topotecan without experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicity for three weeks after the oral topotecan treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed rectal cancer.

          -  Candidates for preoperative radiotherapy.

          -  Primary tumor at least 3cm and clinical stage of T2, T3, or T4 and any N according to
             the Astler-Coller modification of the Dukes staging system.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than 2.

          -  Diagnosis of rectal cancer should be no more than 90 days from start of therapy.

          -  Evaluation at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center.

          -  Recovery from prior surgery and life expectancy at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent rectal cancer that failed initial treatment.

          -  Exposure to topotecan, infection, immunodeficiencies, conditions of the
             gastrointestinal (GI) tract which would affect absorption, medication that maintains
             motility/gastric emptying.

          -  Any concomitant malignancy within the last five years.

          -  Severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy which would limit compliance with
             the study.
