    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of
      the CONTAK® RENEWAL™ 2/4/4HE cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) family
      and EASYTRAK® 2 lead in delivering LV-CRT or BiV-CRT with an LV Offset for patients with
      heart failure and an indication for an ICD.

      This clinical investigation is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind study
      design enrolling 360 patients at 57 centers to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of
      the therapy, the CONTAK RENEWAL 2/4/4HE devices and the EASYTRAK 2 lead.

          -  Creatinine £ 2.5 mg/dL obtained no more than 14 days prior to enrollment

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction £ 35% [measured by echo, multiple gated acquisition
             (MUGA) scan, cardiac catheterization, etc.] no more than 14 days prior to enrollment

          -  Willing and capable of undergoing a device implant and participating in all testing
             associated with this clinical investigation

          -  Age 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and
             national law

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Right bundle branch block morphology (per World Health Organization Guidelines) on a
             12-lead ECG obtained no more than 90 days prior to enrollment.

             spontaneously and cannot be terminated with medical intervention) or persistent (i.e.,
             can be terminated with medical intervention, but does not terminate spontaneously)
