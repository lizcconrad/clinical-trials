        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects, 18 years or older, requiring elective, primary or repeat
             vascular procedures with at least one end-to-side femoral or upper extremity vascular
             access arterial anastomosis (e.g. femoral-femoral, femoral-popliteal, femoral-tibial,
             ilio-femoral, aorto-bifemoral, abdominal aortic aneurysm, upper extremity vascular
             access for dialysis) using uncoated or heparin-coated PTFE grafts and polypropylene
             sutures (size 5-0 or 6-0) with a 1:1 needle-to-thread ratio.

          -  Following initial arterial clamp release, the study surgeon determines that adjunctive
             measures are needed to obtain haemostasis at the SAS.

          -  Subjects must be willing to and capable of participating in the study, and provided
             written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects undergoing re-vascularisation using autologous conduits (e.g. saphenous vein)
             or prosthetic material other than uncoated or heparin-coated PTFE.

          -  Subjects undergoing emergency surgery.

          -  Subjects with any intra-operative findings that may preclude conduct of the study
             procedure.

          -  Subjects with known intolerance to heparin, blood products or to one of the components
             of the study product.

          -  Subjects unwilling to receive blood products.

          -  Subjects with autoimmune immunodeficiency diseases (including known HIV).

          -  Subjects who are known, current alcohol and / or drug abusers.

          -  Subjects who have participated in another investigational drug or device research
             study within 30 days of enrolment.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing.
