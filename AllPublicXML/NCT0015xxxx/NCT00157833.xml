  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open randomized, parallel group, 6 week trial in two rural outpatient clinics will
      compare the safety and efficacy of a six dose coartemether regimen with 3 dose artekin
      regimen for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated falciparum and vivax malaria in adults and
      children (&gt;10kg).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the emergence of species of multi drug resistant P.falciparum across the archipelago the
      Indonesian Centre for Disease Control (CDC) now recommends amodiaquine plus artesunate in
      areas of high chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistant strains of P. falciparum.
      High levels of chloroquine resistance to P.vivax has also emerged in the eastern provinces.

      This trial sets out to assess two fixed dose artemisinin combination regimens: artekin
      (DHA-Piperaquine) and coartemether (artemether-lumefantrine) against both P.falciparum and P.
      vivax and their safety profiles.

      Patients who present to an established rural outpatient clinic in Timika, Papua with symptoms
      of acute, uncomplicated infection with P. falciparum, P.vivax or both species, will after
      laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis and having given informed consent to participate in
      the trial, be enrolled in the study. Drug administration will be supervised once per day.
      Patients will be treated as out-patients and then seen daily for the first week until
      aparasitaemic and thereafter at weekly visits to the clinic.

      The data used from this trial will be used to make a public health decision to determine a
      suitable alternative first line antimalarial in the Timika region. In order to ensure that
      the data gathered will be relevant to the clinical setting in which the drugs will be used,
      drug administration of medication will be deliberately designed to mimic conditions that will
      be experienced with widespread deployment (eg once daily supervision).
