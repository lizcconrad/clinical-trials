  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a diagnostic technique in MRI that distinguishes
      various metabolites on the basis of their slightly different chemical shifts or resonance
      frequencies. The Proton is the most abundant nucleus in the body. We will try to establish
      the typical proton MRS pattern of normal women breasts to be a guideline for future further
      investigations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are few reports regarding proton MRS in normal female breasts. The fibroglandular
      tissues and fat are the two major gross components in the breast. The water content in the
      fibroglandular tissues is much higher than that in the fat. There is still no documented
      report discussing proton MRS in normal female breasts of premenopausal and postmenopausal
      women. Our study is to evaluate the proton MRS findings among normal premenopausal and
      postmenopausal women breasts, to find out if there are statistical differences on the main
      proton MRS patterns, water and lipid peak intensities and ratios between the two groups.
