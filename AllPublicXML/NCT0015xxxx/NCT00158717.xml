      To investigate the durability of HBeAg seroconversion in patients with chronic hepatitis B
      virus infection (HBV) who have seroconverted while participating in a previous
      Gilead-sponsored study of adefovir dipivoxil.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the durability of HBeAg seroconversion
      in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) who have seroconverted while
      participating in a previous Gilead-sponsored study of adefovir dipivoxil.

      The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the durability of HBeAg loss in
      patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) who have experienced durable HBeAg
      loss while participating in a previous Gilead-sponsored study of adefovir dipivoxil.

        Patients who demonstrate HBeAg seroconversion or durable HBeAg loss in one of the previous
        Gilead-sponsored studies listed in Section 4.2 of this protocol and meet all inclusion and
        none of the exclusion criteria for this study will be eligible for enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and must have
             demonstrated HBeAg seroconversion or durable HBeAg loss as defined by the protocol in
             one of the following Gilead-sponsored studies: GS-96-412, GS-98-437, GS-00-461 or
             ongoing or future Gilead-sponsored studies identified by the Sponsor to be eligible
             for this study. Other patients who were enrolled in a now closed Gilead-sponsored
             study of ADV (GS-94-404, GS-96-412 Initial Phase or GS-96-413) and had previously
             demonstrated seroconversion or durable HBeAg loss during their participation will be
             evaluated by the clinical research organization (CRO) medical monitor for
             participation in this study on a case by case basis.

          -  Have documented negative serum HBeAg with or without positive anti-HBe present at the
             two study visits prior to the final visit of the previous study.

          -  A patient who has documented negative serum HBeAg without positive anti-HBe must also
             have undetectable serum HBV DNA (less than 1000 copies/mL using Roche Amplicor PCR
             Assay) and normalized ALT (less than ULN) confirmed during these two studies.

          -  All patients must be able to give written informed consent and comply with
             requirements of this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who seroconvert or experience durable HBeAg loss during their participation
             in study GS-00-480 will not be eligible.

          -  Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the
             investigator would interfere with patient treatment, assessment or compliance with the
             protocol.

          -  Receiving any of the excluded medications listed in the protocol.

          -  Inability to comply with study requirements.
