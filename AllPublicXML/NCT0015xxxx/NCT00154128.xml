  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to investigate a possible influence of an occlusal stabilization
      splint on the body posture in TMD cases and controls. Interocclusal appliances or occlusal
      splints are therapeutic devices that are most frequently used in the treatment of TMD.
      Changes of the mandibular position and occlusal equilibrations are assumed to have an impact
      on the general body posture.

      Thirty TMD cases and 10 controls were included in the study. All participants were recruited
      from the School of Dentistry, University of Greifswald. All subjects gave their written
      consent to participate in the study. They then completed a TMD history questionnaire and
      underwent a clinical examination. The examination included palpation of the masticatory
      muscles and the TMJs, range of mandibular motion measurements, and assessment of joint
      noises. The TMD cases were required to have a diagnoses of myofascial pain and/or arthralgia.
      Controls had to be free of pain symptoms in their masticatory muscles and TMJs. Body posture
      was measured during five minutes of walking using an ultrasound-distance measuring device
      (sonoSensÂ® Monitor) with small sensors placed on the skin that continually record changes in
      the distance between them. A static posture evaluation was performed with a contactless, and
      radiation-free static measurement of the back surface and spine using a 3D measurement system
      (formetric II). A second measurement was performed after insertion of the occlusal appliance
      and a third one after 7 days of treatment.

      The occlusal appliances were inserted after the first examination and all participants were
      instructed to use it at night and during examinations.
