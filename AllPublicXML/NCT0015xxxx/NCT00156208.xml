      symptomatic uterine fibroids who completed the 6 month Study C02-037.

      No medical therapy is currently available for the long-term treatment of abnormal uterine
      bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in women and many women must resort to surgery for
      relief. The objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety of asoprisnil 10 and
      25 mg administered daily for 18 months to subjects with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata who
      completed the 6 month Study C02-037. The safety endpoints for this study will be based on
      assessments of the endometrium, ovarian cysts, lipid profiles, adverse events and clinical
      laboratory evaluations.

      Some subjects receiving asoprisnil developed endometrial changes. As a result, dosing was
      prematurely discontinued for all subjects. To ensure safety, subjects will remain on study
      and will undergo scheduled study procedures. In most subjects, endometrial changes reversed
      after asoprisnil discontinuation.
