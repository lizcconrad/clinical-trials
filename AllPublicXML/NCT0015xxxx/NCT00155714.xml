  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of type-5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors
      (sildenafil) in primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension will be recruited and admitted to
      the ICUs of the National Taiwan University Hospital. Each patient will undergo Swan-Ganz
      catheterization and hemodynamic monitoring during administration of sildenafil. Efficacy of
      inhaled NO and Iloprost will also be compared.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    We can't obtained the test drug (Vadenafil) from Bayer. They decided not to carry out this
    trail in Taiwan. Therefore this trail has never been started.
