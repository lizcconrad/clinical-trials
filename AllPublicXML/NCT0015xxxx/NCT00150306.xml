      This study was terminated on July 11, 2007. The results of the primary endpoint analysis at
      the interim showed that the Zoloft group was not significantly different than the placebo on
      the primary endpoint and therefore the decision was made to terminate the trial. The decision
      to terminate the trial was not based on any safety concerns.
