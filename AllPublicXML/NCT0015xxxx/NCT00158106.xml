      Research Question: This is the pilot phase of a two-phase study. Phase 1 - What is the
      feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial of therapy for adults with
      post-stroke communication impairment? to be followed in 2006 by Phase 2 - What are the
      effectiveness, costs and service user preferences, for the provision of speech and language
      therapy for communication difficulties experienced by people in hospital with a stroke?
      Methodology: Phase 1 - Qualitative (focus groups &amp; individual interviews) and quantitative
      (pilot RCT). Phase 2 - Qualitative (focus groups &amp; individual interviews) and quantitative (a
      pragmatic, multicentred, randomised controlled trial, stratified by diagnosis and
      therapist/centre, using an 'intention to treat' approach). Discrete choice experiments will
      be used to determine cost effectiveness.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome will be functional communicative ability. The economic
      analysis will estimate the incremental cost effectiveness and net benefit of the intervention
      group compared to the control group from a societal perspective. The qualitative study will
      examine service users' and carers' perspectives on the process and effects of Speech and
      Language Therapy or the control treatment.

      Sample Group: Adults with dysarthria or aphasia, seen early after admission to hospital with
      a stroke. Exclusions: subarachnoid haemorrhage, progressive dementia, expected recovery
      without therapy.
