    <textblock>
      Children born less than 1500 grams are being enrolled into a study to test the effectiveness
      of a parental educational intervention in reducing the risk of future breathing problems. The
      intervention teaches parents of these children how to reduce the risk of / and recognize
      breathing problems.
