  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The purpose of this clinical trial is to look at the chemotherapy combination of
      docetaxel and capecitabine in the treatment of newly diagnosed or locally advanced prostate
      cancer, and to determine if this treatment is an acceptable, effective and a safe treatment
      option. In addition, this clinical trial will evaluate how this treatment affects chemicals
      (enzymes), and other cancer related genetic changes in the tumor. Optional: This clinical
      trial will conduct extra imaging studies for research purposes including combined endorectal
      prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRSI) and
      diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) to evaluate prostate cancer and response to study treatment.

        Patients must have newly diagnosed prostate cancer with at least one of the following
        criteria:

          -  Clinical Stage &gt; T2

          -  PSA &gt; 15 ng/ml

          -  Biopsy Gleason's sum &gt; 8

          -  All patients must have a minimum PSA value of &gt; 5 ng/ml.

          -  Patients may not have evidence of distant systemic metastasis.

          -  Patients may not undergo concurrent hormonal, biologic, or chemotherapy.

          -  Patients may not have prior unanticipated severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy
             or known hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil.

          -  Patients with a history of severe reaction to docetaxel or other drugs formulated with
             polysorbate 80 will not be eligible.

          -  Patients may not have an underlying cardiac disease.
