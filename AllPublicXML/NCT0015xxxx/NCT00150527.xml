    <textblock>
      Citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is used as a neuroendocrine
      probe in human subjects to assess serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) function as reflected
      in prolactin and plasma cortisol release. Citalopram is a racemic mixture of equal parts of
      the S(+) and R(-) enantiomers. The S(+) form (&quot;escitalopram&quot;) has been identified as being
      the active isomer and inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and consequently antidepressant
      activity is associated almost exclusively with the S-enantiomer. Escitalopram has been shown
      to be approximately twice as potent as citalopram at the primary, high-affinity binding site
      on the human serotonin transporter. Interestingly, investigations have suggested an
      antagonistic interaction of the R- and S-enantiomer at an allosteric binding site on the
      serotonin transporter. This antagonism has been shown in animal studies where the addition of
      R-citalopram to escitalopram treatments significantly counteracts the antidepressant and
      anti-anxiolytic effects of escitalopram. From these clinical and experimental data, the
      researchers can anticipate that escitalopram would increase cortisol and prolactin in the
      neuroendocrine challenge paradigm more effectively than citalopram.
