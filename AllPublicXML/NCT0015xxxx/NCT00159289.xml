      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of inhaled lipopolysaccharide
      endotoxin (LPS) on bronchial and alveolar exhaled nitric oxide (NO) and NO metabolites and
      other inflammatory markers and mediators in exhaled breath condensate, induced sputum, nasal
      lavage and mouthwash fluid in healthy non-smokers and current smokers, including patients
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
