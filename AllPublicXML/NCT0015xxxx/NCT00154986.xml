  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An ovarian cancer cell line (OVTW-59) derived from an ovarian endometrioid carcinoma was
      established and its sublines, labeled as P0, P1, P2, P3, and P4 with increasing invasion
      abilities were selected from transwell invasion chambers.Using cDNA microarray and verified
      with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we have identified IGFBP-3
      as an invasion-suppressor gene. We plan to study the role of IGFBP-3 in ovarian cancer
      invasion.

      We have successfully established an ovarian cancer cell line (OVTW-59), which was derived
      from an ovarian endometrioid carcinoma. Its sublines, labeled as P0, P1, P2, P3, and P4 with
      increasing invasion abilities, were selected from transwell invasion chambers, where P0
      represented the original cell line at 100th passage. By using cDNA microarray and verified
      with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we have identified the
      differentially gene expression profiles of these OVTW-59 series cell lines in order to
      identify the invasion related suppressor and oncogenes from ovarian carcinoma. From these
      genes, we selected insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3, which is a
      suppressor gene, and found it lower expressed in higher-grade tumors and correlated with poor
      patient survival. In vitro, we found IGFBP-3 related to the inhibition of cancer cell
      migration. In this study, we plan to setup stable transfected IGFBP-3 cell lines in P0 and
      P4, and study the relationship among IGFBP-3, metalloproteinase-2 (our previous studies which
      verified its relationship with tumor invasiveness) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. We
      would study the changes in cytoskeletal structures and the known functions of
      anti-proliferation and apoptosis in IGFBP-3. Furthermore, we would like to investigate the
      mechanism of IGFBP-3 in the inhibition of invasion/migration of ovarian carcinoma, either
      signaling through MAPK or PI3K/AKT pathways. Finally, through xenograft, we plan to study for
      the possible application of IGFBP-3 in ovarian cancer therapy.
