  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary response data, observed by Casali (Cancer, 2004) with imatinib 800 mg/day in
      patients affected by chordoma, need to be confirmed by a Phase II study, whose primary
      endpoint will be the formal assessment of clinical and pathological response. Aim of the
      study will be to explore treatment's activity, but also the potential impact of tumor
      response, the feasibility and outcome of subsequent surgery and radiotherapy. In addition,
      patterns of tumour response need to be investigated as well, given the peculiar patterns of
      response shown with molecular-targeted therapy in solid tumors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological diagnosis of chordoma.

          2. Biomolecular or immunohistochemical evidence of Imatinib mesylate target (PDGFRβ
             activation and/or presence of PDGFB). Biomolecular assessment of PDGFRβ activation
             should be made whenever possible. To this end, if frozen material is not available,
             obtaining of, fresh material is encouraged, if it should be obtained with no major
             distress for the patient, preferably through an incisional biopsy (to allow
             immunoprecipitation) or, if this is not feasible, a Trucut biopsy (to allow Western
             Blot assessment). However, if frozen or fresh material cannot be obtained, paraffined
             material is also acceptable.

             The biomolecular assessment will be centralized to the reference centers (to be
             defined).

          3. Measurable or evaluable disease

          4. Surgical resection of local disease unfeasible radically, or unaccepted by the
             patient, or amenable to become less demolitive, or easier, or likely more feasible,
             after cytoreduction, and/or metastatic disease. Debulking surgery before enrolment is
             allowed. In this case, enrolment should occur at least one month after surgery

          5. Performance status 0, 1, 2 or 3 (ECOG) (see § 8.1).

          6. Adequate end organ function, defined as the following: total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN,
             SGOT and SGPT &lt;2.5 x UNL (or &lt;5 x ULN if hepatic metastases are present), creatinine
             &lt;1.5 x ULN.

          7. Adequate bone marrow function, defined as the following: ANC &gt;1.5 x 10^9/L, platelets
             &gt;100 x 10^9/L, Hb &gt;9 g/dL. Blood transfusions are allowed to reach the baseline
             requested Hb level.

          8. Female patients of child-bearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before initiation of study drug dosing. Post menopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Male and female
             patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective method of birth
             control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of study
             drug.

          9. Written, voluntary, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with any other investigational or not investigational agents within
             28 days of first day of study drug dosing.

          2. Other primary malignancy with &lt;5 years clinically assessed disease-free interval,
             except basal cell skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, or other neoplasms judged
             to entail a low risk of relapse.

          3. Grade III/IV cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart Association Criteria
             (i.e., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study)

          4. Severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, chronic renal
             disease, or active uncontrolled infection).

          5. Known brain metastasis.

          6. Known chronic liver disease (i.e., chronic active hepatitis, and cirrhosis).

          7. Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          8. Previous radiotherapy to &gt;=25 % of the bone marrow.

          9. Major surgery within 2 weeks prior to study entry.

         10. Expected non-compliance to medical regimens.
