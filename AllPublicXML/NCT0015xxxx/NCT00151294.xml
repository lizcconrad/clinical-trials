  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotionally labile, depressed participants with multiple sclerosis treated with escitalopram
      will have a greater reduction in emotional lability scores and in their psychological
      distress scores than those who are randomized to receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple sclerosis who are experiencing mood lability and symptoms of
      depression will be randomized to receive either escitalopram 10mg/day or placebo tablets for
      a period of 6 weeks. It is hypothesized that patients receiving medication will experience a
      greater normalization of their emotional instability and a greater reduction in their
      depressive symptoms at the end of the six-week trial than those who are not receiving
      medication.
