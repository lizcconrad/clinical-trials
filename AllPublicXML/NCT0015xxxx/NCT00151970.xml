      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by 3
      main symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. This study will assess the
      efficacy, duration of effect, tolerability and safety of 4- and 6- hour wear times of SPD485
      in 6-12 year old subjects diagnosed with ADHD.
