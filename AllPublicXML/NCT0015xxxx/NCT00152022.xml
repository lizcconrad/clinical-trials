    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of SPD465 compared to
      placebo (a capsule with no medication in it) in the treatment of ADHD. The study will also
      look at how SPD465 affects the participants sleep and how they perceive their quality of
      life.
