  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taiwan is a hyperendemic area of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Previous studies
      demonstrated vigorous T cell responses to HBV-encoded antigens developed in patients with
      self-limited acute hepatitis B. In contrast, weak or no T cell responses could be detected in
      chronic hepatitis B (CH-B) patients. However, these immune responses are still not well known
      in patients with acute exacerbation (AE) of CH-B and in patients with advanced liver
      diseases, such as liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CD4+CD25+
      regulatory T cells might suppress immune responses against foreign antigens and pathogens.
      The roles of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in patients chronically infected with HBV remain to
      be clarified. The high percentage of HBV carriers in Taiwan are related to the vertical
      transmissions. High maternal HBV viral load may make the newborns tolerant to the HBV.
      However, the HBV-specific CD8+ T cells responses in the cord bloods of newborns are still
      unknown. Thus, we want to resolve these issues in this study. We will enroll the HBsAg (+)
      patients from NTUH. Blood samples will be collected. We will then analyze the HBV-specific
      CD8+ T cell responses and the clarify the roles of regulatory T cells.

      The HBsAg (+) patients from National Taiwan University Hospital will be included. Screening
      for HLA haplotype will be performed by amplification refractory mutation system / PCR method.
      The HLA-A2 or HLA-A11 will be enrolled to the study group because these two haplotypes are
      the most ones in Taiwan. The other HLA haplotype HBV carriers will be enrolled as
      HLA-mismatch control. The disease spectra include inactive HBV carrier, CH-B, CH-B with AE
      (defined as ALT &gt;= 5 X UNL), HBV-related LC, HBV-related HCCs.

      HBsAg, anti-HBs, IgM anti-HBc, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-HCV, anti-HDV, anti-HIV will be
      determined by commercial enzyme immunoassay kits. The serum levels of HBV DNA and genotypes
      will be done by quantitative real-time PCR. Patients who are also infected with HDV or HCV or
      HIV will be excluded.

      PBMCs will be isolated from heparinized blood samples by density gradient centrifugation on
      Ficoll-Hypaque. The PBMC will be washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended
      in T cell medium.

      Analysis of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses will be done by flow cytometry using pentamer
      staining.

      To analyze HBV-specific CD8+ T cells responses in patients with chronic HBV infection
      (prospective study). This part of the study is to clarify the role of HBV-specific T cell
      responses during the course of acute exacerbation of CH-B. Blood will be collected at four
      important time points.
