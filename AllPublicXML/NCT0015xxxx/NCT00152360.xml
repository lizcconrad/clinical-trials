      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of using the weight loss medication
      Xenical (generic name - orlistat) on weight loss and change in heart disease risk factors in
      patients of the Healthy Heart Program Lipid Clinic at St. Paul's Hospital over a three month
      period. Xenical works by blocking the body's absorption of dietary fat in the gut, allowing
      it to pass through to be excreted, therefore reducing the intake of fat and calories. This is
      a pilot study supported by Hoffmann-La Roche Limited which produces Xenical. The aim is to
      investigate whether weight loss will also result in reductions in heart disease risk factors
      that may allow for less of a need for medications controlling lipid levels, hypertension and
      plasma glucose.

      Obesity is associated with numerous chronic diseases and increased cardiovascular mortality.
      It is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in addition to being
      associated with diabetes and CVD risk factors. Weight loss interventions that target body fat
      reductions are associated with reductions in cholesterol levels, blood pressure and fasting
      glucose. Xenical (orlistat) is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor which results in a
      reduction in the absorption of exogenous fat. Studies of up to two years duration have
      demonstrated that those taking Xenical plus diet lost significantly more weight than those
      taking placebo plus diet. Coincident with this were decreases in cholesterol levels. The use
      of Xenical in Type 2 diabetic patients being treated with sulfonylurea resulted in greater
      discontinuation of the sulfonylurea plus a greater reduction in sulfonylurea dosage compared
      to placebo. The use of Xenical in the clinical environment has the potential to improve CVD
      risk factors and potentially reduce the burden of other medications.This is a pilot study to
      investigate the effectiveness of Xenical on cardiovascular risk factors in the patients of
      St. Paul's Hospital Lipid Clinic.
