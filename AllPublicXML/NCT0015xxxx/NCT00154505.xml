  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of lateral trunk supports (LTS) in special seating on the spinal alignment of 17
      spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects with scoliosis were studied using bi-planar radiographs.
      The LTS improved significantly the functional scoliotic spinal alignment in the frontal and
      sagittal planes regardless of the severity of scoliosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCI patients often develop progressive scoliosis due to loss of muscular support to maintain
      good sitting posture. Special seating with LTS has been widely used in clinical practice to
      improve their sitting postures. However, little is known as to how this can affect the
      scoliotic curve.The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of lateral trunk
      supports (LTS) in special seating on the spinal alignment of spinal cord injured (SCI)
      individuals with scoliosis.

      Ten male and seven female SCI subjects with scoliosis sat on an experimental chair with and
      without LTS while radiographs of the spine in the anteroposterior and lateral directions were
      taken. Radiographs of the spine in the A-P and lateral directions were taken with a digital
      radiographic imaging system (Saturn 9000 M, Comed., Korea). For each direction, the complete
      image of the spine was obtained from separate x-ray images of the upper and lower trunk due
      to the limited field of view of the x-ray machine. The Cobb angles and scoliotic indices
      based on the anteroposterior radiographic images and the angles of the thoracic and lumber
      spine based on lateral were calculated.
