  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amifostine is a radioprotective drug which is approved by the US FDA for administration prior
      to each radiation treatment using the intravenous route. The study evaluated the safety of
      amifostine administered subcutaneously. The four targeted toxicities were nausea/vomiting,
      hypotension, generalized skin rash, and injection-site skin reactions.
