  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of two antihypertensive drugs of known efficacy to investigate whether one
      has more favorable effects on brain blood flow and cognitive function.

      The project examines the neuropsychological status, peripheral blood flow, and structural
      cortical (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) and functional cortical blood flow (quantitative
      positron emission tomography, PET) status of previously unmedicated hypertensives. These
      individuals are then medicated for one year with one of two effective blood pressure
      medications. Our hypothesis is that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, but not the
      beta-blocker will normalize cerebral blood flow and possibly, cognitive function. This
      hypothesis is tested by a repetition of our initial examinations at the completion of one
      year of treatment.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects will be between 35 and 65 years of age, and must have a diastolic BP
             between 90 and 109 mm Hg, systolic BP between 140 and 179 mm Hg, or both. Eligibility
             will be based upon readings taken at two screening visits. For resting BP
             determinations, eating, smoking, drinking and heavy physical activity will be
             proscribed for 1 hour prior, and drinking caffeinated beverages 2 hours prior.
             Systolic and diastolic (5th phase) BP will be determined twice separated by 2 minutes
             using a 2-3 mm Hg/sec deflation rate. Before readings, a 60 s resting pulse will be
             obtained. Two readings over two such sessions will be averaged. All measurements will
             be obtained by individuals certified in BP measurement by the Department of
             Epidemiology of the Graduate School of Public Health.

        Potential subjects must have either no prior pharmacologic treatment for hypertension or
        minimal lifetime exposure. The latter is defined as no more than 6 months of blood pressure
        medication within the past 5 years. No blood pressure medication taken at all in the 6
        months preceding study enrollment. To establish medical eligibility and to screen for
        secondary causes of hypertension, subjects will provide a medical history and have their
        standard blood chemistry determined to screen for occult renal failure and primary
        hyperaldosteronism. All women will be postmenopausal or tested (urine specimen) to ensure
        the absence of pregnancy. To ensure their ability to complete the behavioral assessments,
        subjects must have at least an 8th grade education and immigrants must have spoken English
        as their primary language for at least five years.

        Exclusion Criteria. Exclusion criteria will include current use of any cardiovascular or
        psychotropic medications, or contraindication for use of an ACE inhibitor or beta blocker
        (e.g., prior adverse reaction or chronic obstructive lung disease, including asthma).
        Individuals with a resting blood pressure greater than a SBP &gt;180 mmHg and /or a DBP &gt;110
        are excluded as are individuals with a prior serious adverse reaction or allergy to beta
        blockers or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. We will exclude individuals with
        target organ damage (history of myocardial infarction, angioplasty, bypass surgery,
        congestive heart failure, stroke, or carotid endarterectomy), angina pectoris (determined
        by Rose questionnaire), a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, or chronic renal
        insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dl). Secondary hypertension, based upon known or
        clinically suspected renal artery stenosis, primary hyperaldosteronism, untreated thyroid
        disorder, heavy alcohol consumption (24 or more standard drinks per week), consistent use
        of illegal drugs (for example, crack/cocaine used once or more a month) or
        pheochromocytoma, will be grounds for exclusion. A standard of no more than 30 g per day
        (Klatsky, 2003) seems to have some acceptance for the level of alcohol intake that will not
        chronically alter blood pressure levels. Therefore, no more than a case of beer per week,
        21 (5 oz.) glasses of wine, or 21 shots (1.5 oz.) of hard liquor will be acceptable.
        Exclusion criteria also include neurological disorders (serious head injury, seizures,
        presenile or alcoholic dementia, Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis). Due to the
        MRI examination required, individuals not fitting into the bore of the magnet will be
        excluded. Those with known sensitivity to sulfa-containing antibiotics will be included in
        the study but will not undergo the acetazolamide portion of the PET scanning sessions:
        acetazolamide is a sulfonamide analog. Women with child-bearing potential (i.e., pre- or
        peri-menopausal) will be tested within 48 hours prior to the PET examination to ensure the
        absence of pregnancy. A urinary pregnancy test (e.g., Sure-Vue Urine hCG) will be
        administered to confirm the absence of pregnancy.
