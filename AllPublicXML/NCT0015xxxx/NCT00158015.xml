      The purpose of this study is to assess whether tissue doppler imaging is useful in predicting
      which patients will respond most to Cardiac Resynchronization therapy ( a type of pacemaker)

      Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is a newly developed therapy designed to improve
      outcomes in patients with heart failure(HF). Recent studies have shown significant
      symptomatic improvement and a decrease in hospitalization and mortality with CRT. However, up
      to 30 % of patients do not experience improvement with this invasive and costly therapy.
      Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) is emerging as an effective tool for non-invasively assessing
      mechanical dyssynchrony of the left ventricle (LV) and may aid in the identification of LV
      mechanical dyssynchrony to predict clinical response to CRT. PROMISE-CRT is designed to
      address the following hypothesis: Changes in tissue doppler imaging measures of left
      ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony from baseline to one week following cardiac
      resynchronization therapy will correlate with the clinical response at three months. Seventy
      HF patients clinically indicated to receive CRT will be enrolled in this six-month
      multi-center study conducted in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. TDI analyses,
      measures of clinical improvement and LV remodeling will be conducted one week, three months,
      six months after CRT implementation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Moderate or severe heart failure defined as NYHA class III-IV despite optimal
        pharmacological heart failure therapy.

        Stable Heart failure as defined as not hospitalized within the last month. A 12 lead
        electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained no more than 90 days prior to enrollment documenting a
        sinus rate &gt;50bpm, QRS duration &gt;120ms and PR interval&gt; 150ms Ejection Fraction &lt;35%
        documented within the last 6 months by one of the following methods: echo ( standard or
        TEE) LV gram, or MUGA Clinically indicated to receive CRT Ability to complete all the study
        visits including geographic stability

        Exclusion criteria:

        Serum creatinine &gt;3.5 Have or had a Myocardial infarct, unstable angina, percutaneous
        coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft during the preceding 30 days prior to
        enrollment.

        Have had previous cardiac resynchronization therapy, a coronary venous pace/sense lead or
        attempted LV lead placement.

        Dyspnea believed by the physician to be primarily related to lung disease. Have an atrial
        tachyarrhythmia that is permanent ( ie does not terminate spontaneously and cannot be
        terminated with medical intervention)or persistent (can be terminated with medical
        intervention but does not terminate spontaneously)within 90 days prior to enrollment Poor
        sinus node function that MD predicts will require &gt;70% atrial pacing. Inability to perform
        the six minute walk. Life expectancy of less than 6 months due to other medical conditions
        or expected to undergo heart transplant within the next 6 months.

        Have a mechanical tricuspid heart valve. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Patients
        with a hypersensitivity to a 0.7mg nominal dose of dexamethasone. Surgically uncorrected
        primary valvular heart disease. Patients who are currently enrolled in another
        investigational study that would directly impact the treatment or outcome of the current
        study.

        Patients who are younger than 18 years of age, pregnant, or who are mentally incompetent
        and cannot sign a patient informed consent.
