  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to evaluate the safety (Phase I components) of administering bexarotene
      (Targretin®, LGD1069) oral capsules in combination with two Taxol® and carboplatin
      (Paraplatin®) schedules to patients with stage IIIB and IV non-small cell lung cancer. This
      study will also evaluate the preliminary efficacy (Phase II component) of bexarotene oral
      capsules in combination with the weekly Taxol® schedule and carboplatin in these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase I portion of the study will evaluate the safety of administering bexarotene oral
      capsules daily at two dose levels (300 mg/m2 and 400 mg/m2) in combination with carboplatin
      and Taxol®. At least 6 patients will be entered onto each dose level. Doses will not be
      escalated over the course of treatment of an individual patient. The recommended Phase II
      dose is defined as the highest dose of bexarotene oral capsules (300 mg/m2 or 400 mg/m2) in
      combination with carboplatin and Taxol® that induces DLT in fewer than or equal to 33% of
      patients.

      The sequential phase II portion of the study will evaluate the efficacy of bexarotene oral
      capsules in combination with carboplatin and weekly Taxol® in patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer. The efficacy will be gauged according to the rate of major
      response where, by definition, a major response occurs if a patient achieves either complete
      remission (CR) or partial remission (PR). For these patients a true response rate of 20% or
      greater is sufficiently large to warrant further investigation. A true response rate of 10%
      or less indicates that the combination is less active.
