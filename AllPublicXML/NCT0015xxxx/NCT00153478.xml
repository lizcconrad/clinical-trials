  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project CHOICES Efficacy Study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to evaluate
      the clinical efficacy of a brief motivational intervention aimed at reducing alcohol-exposed
      pregnancies(AEP)in high-risk preconceptional women. The study is a multi-site collaborative
      study between the CDC and three universities. The hypothesis of the study is that a greater
      proportion of women will reduce thier risk of having an alcohol-exposed pregnancy after
      participating in the Information Plus Counseling (IPC) intervention than do those in the
      Information Only(IO) control group.

      Women at high risk for an AEP are define as sexually active, fertile women who are drinking
      more than 7 drinks per week and/or 5 or more drinks on any one day, and are noy using
      effective measures to prevent pregnancy. Participants will be recruited from community-based
      setting previously shown to have increased proportions of women at risk for AEP. Women in the
      intervention group (IPC) will receive 4 counselling sessions that include personal feedback
      on AEP risk behaviors drawn from baseline information,consequences of alcohol use in
      pregnancy, assessing readiness to change risk behaviors, pros and cons of risk drinking and
      unprotected intercourse, goal setting to reduce risk behaviors, and a consultation visit with
      a family planning provider to discuss appropriate choices for pregnancy prevention based on
      clinical assessment. Clients are counseled that there are two routes to reducing AEP risk,
      alcohol reduction or pregnancy prevention, with the ideal being both. Women in the control
      group (IO) will receive an informational brochure that addresses healthy lifestyle behaviors,
      including alcohol use, and a list of referral sources for health care treatment and alcohol
      abuse treatment. Both groups will be assessed at baseline using a full battery of measures
      that include alcohol and contraceptive use with follow-up measures at 3, 6, and 9 months
      after baseline.
