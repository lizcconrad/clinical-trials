  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares the efficacy of an aggressive versus a moderate initial antihypertensive
      regimen to reduce blood pressure in patients with Stage 2 hypertension. Additionally, the
      study examines the effects of blood pressure reduction on the levels of high sensitivity
      hsCRP. Although the main goal is to determine the overall effect of blood pressure reduction
      on hsCRP levels, analysis will also evaluate whether an aggressive antihypertensive regimen
      is more effective than a moderate one in reducing hsCRP levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Stage 2 hypertension as defined by the mean of three (3) repeated seated BP
             measurements of: SBP of 160 to 185 mmHg, inclusive and/or DBP of 100 to 109 mmHg,
             inclusive.

          2. Patients must have documentation of serum creatinine equal or &lt;2.0 mg/dL, serum
             potassium equal or &gt;3.5 and equal or &lt;5.5 mmol/L, and serum AST or ALT &lt;2xULN obtained
             within 3 months prior to Visit 1.

          3. Patients must have documentation of HbA1C equal or &lt;11.0 % obtained within 1 month
             prior to Visit 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of secondary hypertension.

          2. Pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor
             blockers, or aldosterone blockers within 3 months prior to Visit 1, or with thiazide
             diuretics within 1 month prior to Visit 1. The use of other classes of agents which
             lower BP but are being used for other therapy or for HTN, are allowed as long as these
             agents are started at least 3 months prior to randomization, are not initiated after
             enrollment and doses remain unchanged during the study.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
