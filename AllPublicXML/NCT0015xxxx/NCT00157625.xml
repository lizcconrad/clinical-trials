  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections are the most common type of hospital-acquired infection. The
      majority of these infections result from the use of indwelling urinary catheters. Often
      caregivers leave them in unnecessarily. The purpose of this study is to assess the
      effectiveness of an automatic stop order (automatic removal or urinary catheters when they no
      longer needed) in reducing urinary infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will randomize patients with urinary catheters to either automatic stop orders or to usual
      care. The primary outcome will be urinary tract infection. Secondary outcomes will include
      days of indwelling urinary catheterization, symptomatic urinary tract infection, isolation of
      antimicrobial-resistant bacteria from catheterized urine, antimicrobial use, bacteremia
      (blood-stream) infection secondary to urinary tract infection, and cost. We hypothesize that
      use of the automatic stop order will significantly reduce hospital-acquired urinary tract
      infection.
