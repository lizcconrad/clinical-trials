  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the patients who survive hospitalization after an acute myocardial infarction, ca. 10% die
      of sudden cardiac death in the following 2 years. The prognosis appears not improved by
      medication with antiarrhythmics (class I/III). A positive effect of beta-blockers (Metoprolol
      CR/Zok) on total mortality after myocardial infarction in patients with heart failure is well
      established. On the other hand, an implantable defibrillator (ICD) proved to be superior to
      medication when used for secondary prevention in patients after cardiac arrest. The question
      arises whether ICD therapy is also effective in primary prevention in high risk patients
      after acute myocardial infarction. This study determines if patients, who were defined as
      high risk patients in the early post infarction phase by means of noninvasive methods,
      benefit from primary prevention by means of an ICD. Special emphasis is put on an individual
      optimization of the infarction therapy, including beta-blockers.
