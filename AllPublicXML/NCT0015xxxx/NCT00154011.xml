  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the hypothesis in healthy subjects that the oral antidiabetic
      drug rosiglitazone provides additional vascular relaxing or modulating effects in addition to
      its blood glucose level reducing ability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of oral rosiglitazone therapy on the
      vascular responsiveness of different vasoactive compounds (angiotensin II, insulin, histamine
      and glyceroltrinitrate) in healthy subjects. Rosiglitazone will be given orally (4 weeks
      4mg/d, titrated to 8 mg/d for another 4 weeks) as treatment. Every subject will receive
      intravenous stimulation with angiotensin II, histamine, insulin and glyceroltrinitrate before
      and after an 8 weeks treatment interval with rosiglitazone.
