      This study will assess the effectiveness of pimozide in enhancing the effects of clozapine in
      the treatment of schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of schizophrenics exhibit partial or no response to typical
      antipsychotic medications. Clozapine has been shown to be more effective in treating
      schizophrenia than typical antipsychotic drugs. However, only an estimated 30% to 60% of
      people who are unresponsive to treatment with typical antipsychotics will respond to
      treatment with clozapine. Taking clozapine with pimozide, an antipsychotic drug, can increase
      clozapine's effects. However, sufficient research on this approach has not yet been
      performed. This study will assess the effectiveness of pimozide in enhancing the effects of
      clozapine in the treatment of schizophrenia.

      Participants in this double-blind study will receive a stable dose of clozapine for eight
      weeks prior to enrollment. For the first 4 weeks following enrollment, baseline measurements
      will be taken. Once a week, participants will report to the study site, where symptom
      severity, cognitive ability, and functional status, including reading level, will be
      assessed. In addition, participants will receive a standard medical examination, which will
      include blood tests and an EKG. Upon completion of this initial phase, participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: clozapine combined with pimozide; or
      clozapine combined with placebo. This phase will last for 12 weeks. Study visits will
      continue to occur weekly, and will be used to re-assess the measurements obtained during
      baseline. In addition, participants will have an EKG at each study visit for the first 4
      weeks of treatment. All baseline measurements will be repeated in Week 12.

    <measure>Positive Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Variable change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of positive schizophrenic symptoms The Positive Syndrome Scale of the PANSS is comprised of seven items measuring positive such symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, etc. Each item is scored on a 7 point scale of that particular symptom's severity, ranging from 1 = absent, 2 = minimal, 3 = mild, 4 = moderate, 5 = moderate severe, 6 = severe, and 7 = extreme. The PANSS Positive Subscale seven items has a range of a summed score from 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology). Therefore, the higher the score, the more severe the symtpoms.</description>

    <measure>Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Variable change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of negative schizophrenic symptoms, The Negative Syndrome scale is compromised of seven items, each scored on severity with numeric assignments ranging from 1 = absent, 2 = minimal, 3 = mild, 4 = moderate, 5 = moderate severe, 6 = severe, and 7 = extreme. The items which comprise the Negative Syndrome Scale of the PANSS measure things such as emotional withdrawal, apathy, difficulty in abstract thinking, etc. The seven items which comprise the PANSS Negative Subscale has an aggregate range of 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology), a higher score indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>variable change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression-improvement (CGI-improvement) scale is a research rating tool, developed for use in NIMH-sponsored clinical trials provides a brief assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's overall clinical improvement prior to and after initiating a study medication. The CGI-change is rated on a seven point scale ranging from 1= very much improved since the initiation of treatment to 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment. Therefore, a lower score indicates more improvement in symptoms over time.</description>

        <title>Positive Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</title>
        <description>Severity of positive schizophrenic symptoms The Positive Syndrome Scale of the PANSS is comprised of seven items measuring positive such symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, etc. Each item is scored on a 7 point scale of that particular symptom's severity, ranging from 1 = absent, 2 = minimal, 3 = mild, 4 = moderate, 5 = moderate severe, 6 = severe, and 7 = extreme. The PANSS Positive Subscale seven items has a range of a summed score from 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology). Therefore, the higher the score, the more severe the symtpoms.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Global Impression-improvement (CGI-improvement) scale is a research rating tool, developed for use in NIMH-sponsored clinical trials provides a brief assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's overall clinical improvement prior to and after initiating a study medication. The CGI-change is rated on a seven point scale ranging from 1= very much improved since the initiation of treatment to 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment. Therefore, a lower score indicates more improvement in symptoms over time.</description>

The items which comprise the Negative Syndrome Scale of the PANSS measure things such as emotional withdrawal, apathy, difficulty in abstract thinking, etc. The seven items which comprise the PANSS Negative Subscale has an aggregate range of 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology), a higher score indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
