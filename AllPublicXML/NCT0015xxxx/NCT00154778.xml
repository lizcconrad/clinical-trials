  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1982,cancer has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan. In particular,gastric cancer
      is the fourth leading cause of death in male cancer patients and the sixth for female
      patients in 2000,accounting for an estimated 2,374 deaths. In recent years, the treatment of
      gastric cancer patients has gradually been improving due to advances in early diagnosis and
      surgical techniques. Although chemotherapy and radiation therapy have been used in either the
      adjuvant or palliative setting, their values are still limited due to their unacceptable
      toxicity or inadequate efficiency.
