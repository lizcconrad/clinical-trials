      T.to investigate a possible mechanism of the glucocorticosteroid receptors (GR) defect in
      patients with severe COPD by studying the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on GR- binding,
      interleukin production (IL-6/IL-8) and MKP-1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      blood (PBMC)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with severe (stage III, Gold) to very severe (stage IV, GOLD) COPD or
             subjects who are healthy smokers or subjects who are non-smokers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current upper respiratory tract infections

          -  Any significant disease or disorder (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary (other than
             asthma), gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine,
             metabolic, malignant, psychiatric, major physical impairment) which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or may influence the results of the study, or the subjects ability to
             participate in the study

          -  Subjects not considered capable, as judged by the investigator, of following
             instructions of the study, e.g. because of a history of alcohol or drug abuse or any
