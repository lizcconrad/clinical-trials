  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific is to study the MR morphologic and spectroscopic brain correlates and predictors
      of development in children with severe developmental disorders (autistic spectrum disorders
      and/or mental retardation and/or language disorders). Given the frequently observed
      association of autism with known medical conditions, particularly in cases with comorbid
      mental retardation and in cases with atypical autism (Rutter et al., 1994; Gillberg, 1995),
      children with suspected autism or related developmental disorders will be asked to
      participate in an extensive state of the art laboratory work-up which includes T1 and T2
      weighted MRI of the brain. MRI data will be analyzed both qualitatively, looking for focal
      abnormalities and degree of myelination, and quantitatively, measuring volumes of total
      brain, cerebellum, ventricles and grey and white matter. For research purposes, the work-up
      will be supplied with proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain. This data
      set provides the opportunity to chart brain-behavior relationships in young children with
      suspected autism and related PDD cross-sectionally.
