      In order to evaluate the effect of eliminating nasal carriage by mupirocin prophylaxis on
      subsequent Staphylococcus aureus infection, a prospective randomized trial was performed
      particularly including patients with predisposing risk factors for S. aureus infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a past study, we showed that there is a strong correlation between strains colonizing the
      anterior nares, strains isolated from the presumed foci of infection, and strains isolated
      from blood in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. These results suggested that a
      substantial proportion of cases of systemic S. aureus infections appear to be of endogenous
      origin and that eradication of nasal colonization should be the chief strategy for reducing
      the incidence of hospital-acquired S. aureus infections.

      In order to evaluate the effect of eliminating nasal carriage by mupirocin prophylaxis on
      subsequent S. aureus infection, a prospective randomized trial was performed particularly
      including patients with predisposing risk factors for S. aureus infections. All patients
      admitted to selected units in clinics for anaesthesiology, hemato-oncology, cardiac surgery,
      and orthopedics at the University Hospital of Muenster were regularly screened for nasal
      carriage, i.e. at admission and, subsequently, on a weekly basis. S. aureus carrying patients
      were prospectively randomized, to be either treated with mupirocin for 5 days, or left
      untreated. Patients infected with S. aureus at admission and patients detected to be MRSA
      carrier were excluded from randomization.

      Patients were regularly seen during the course of their hospital stay and
      predisposing/conditional risk factors were systematically documented. In both groups
      (untreated patients and patients with mupirocin prophylaxis), all nosocomial infections were
      documented according to CDC guidelines. If infected, specimens were taken for microbiological
      diagnosis. All S. aureus isolates (from the anterior nares as well as from the focus of
      infection) were collected and were genotyped.
