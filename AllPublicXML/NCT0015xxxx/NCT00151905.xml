  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a common viral lung infection in infants. Standard treatment often includes
      the use of inhaled medications which are usually first mixed with a standard salt solution.
      Inhalation of a more concentrated salt solution (hypertonic saline) has been successfully
      used to treat other types of lung disease in children and adults. The purpose of this study
      is to see if using inhaled hypertonic saline helps infants with bronchiolitis get better more
      quickly.

    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a common illness in infants and is associated with a significant morbidity.
      Standard therapy is controversial and largely ineffective; care is mostly supportive although
      nebulized medications continue to be commonly used. These medications are typically mixed
      with normal saline to produce a sufficient volume for efficient nebulization.

      Inhaled hypertonic saline has been used to aid airway clearance in children with cystic
      fibrosis. It has also been used, in low dose, in two small studies in children with
      bronchiolitis. The current study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multi-center trial comparing frequent dosing with 3% hypertonic saline compared to normal
      saline in the treatment of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.
