    <measure>Change From Baseline in Migraine Period Frequency Per 28 Days in Treatment Phase (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>A migraine period was defined as a migraine headache that started, ended, or recurred within 24 hours. If the headache persisted for longer than 24 hours, it was considered a new migraine period. Participants recorded the frequency of migraine period in diary. Efficacy analyses were performed using both the 24-hour and 48-hour rule for defining migraine periods. Data is presented as mean number of migraine period per 28 days +/- standard error. A negative change indicates a decrease in the number of migraine periods from baseline. LOCF = last observation carried forward (ie, observation from last phase with active treatment)</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Duration Per Migraine Attack in Treatment Phase (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of a migraine attack was the sum of the duration (in hours) of each migraine headache that was collapsed to form the migraine attack. The time between the offset of first migraine headache and the onset of the next migraine headache was not counted in the duration of migraine attack. The average duration of the migraine attacks in each phase was calculated as the total duration (in hours) of the migraine attacks during each phase, divided by the number of migraine attacks in the corresponding treatment phase. Efficacy analyses were performed using both the 24-hour and 48-hour rule. The data is presented as mean hours +/- standard error.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Migraine Severity Per Migraine Attack in Treatment Phase (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The average migraine attack severity in each treatment phase was calculated using the sum of the severity of migraine attacks during the treatment phase, divided by the number of qualified migraine attacks. The scale of severity for each migraine attack ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating increased migraine severity. Efficacy analyses were performed using both the 24-hour and 48-hour rule.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Migraine Attack Frequency Per 28 Days in Treatment Phase (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>Qualified migraine headache was defined as two major subtypes: migraine without aura(headache that lasted 4-72 hours with at least two characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate/ severe pain intensity or aggravation by/ causing avoidance of routine physical activity and either nausea/ vomiting or photophobia,phonophobia); migraine with aura (attack with reversible focal neurological symptoms that usually precede or sometimes accompany the headache) per Migraine Criteria of the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society. All of the qualified headaches, which occur after the initial qualified migraine headache, but within 24 hours of previous qualified migraine headache, were collapsed into one qualified migraine attack. Two qualified migraine attacks were considered to be distinct when the end of previous and the beginning of the next migraine attack were separated by at least 24/48 hours per 24/48 hour rule.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Migraine Period Frequency Per 28 Days in Maintenance Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 11 to Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>A migraine period was defined as a migraine headache that started, ended, or recurred within 24 hours. If the headache persisted for longer than 24 hours, it was considered a new migraine period. Efficacy analyses were performed using both the 24-hour and 48-hour rule for defining migraine periods. Data is presented as mean number of migraine period per 28 days +/- standard error. A negative change indicates a decrease in the number of migraine periods from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Days Requiring Symptomatic Rescue Medication Per 28 Days in Treatment Phase (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days requiring symptomatic rescue medication was calculated as the number of calender days during the migraine attack when the patient took one or more migraine rescue medications as recorded on the participant's diary. The calendar date(s) during which medication was taken will be used for calculations. Efficacy analyses were performed using both the 24-hour and 48-hour rule. The data is presented as mean days +/- standard error.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Days With Migraine Attack Per 28 Days in Treatment Phase (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 19</time_frame>
    <description>A migraine attack day was defined as a calendar day (from 0 hours to 24 hours) during which at least one migraine attack took place. If the migraine attack continues through midnight, each day will be counted separately. Efficacy analyses were performed using both the 24-hour and 48-hour rule. Data is presented as mean number of days with migraine attack per 28 days +/- standard error.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Number of Participants With Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of Migraine (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 23</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC was a self-evaluation scale for each patient to assess his or her status compared to baseline in migraine headache frequency and intensity, the occurrence of adverse events, and overall functional status, measured on a 7-point scale. The scale ranges from &quot;very much improved&quot; with a score of 1 to &quot;very much worse&quot; with a score of 7. A responder is defined as being &quot;very much improved&quot; or &quot;much improved&quot;. The data is presented as number of participants. LOCF = last observation carried forward (ie, observation from last phase with active treatment)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of any race, 18 to 65 years of age inclusive.

          2. Patients with a history of migraine (with or without aura) according to the Headache
             Classification Committee of the IHS. Migraine attacks have to have had an onset before
             age 50 and have to have been present for at least 12 months.

          3. Patients with 4-12 qualified migraine attacks per month over the past three months
             prior to Screening, as well as during the four weeks of the Baseline Phase will be
             eligible for entry into this study. The interval between two qualified migraine
             attacks should be at least 24 hours to be counted as distinct migraine attacks. A
             qualified migraine attack without aura is defined as a headache that lasts 4-72 hours
             (if untreated or unsuccessfully treated) or if successfully treated (revised per
             Amendment 01). This attack has at least two of the following characteristics:
             unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity that inhibits or
             prohibits daily activities or aggravation by routine physical activities such as
             walking up stairs. In addition, at least one of the following symptoms must be present
             during the headache: nausea, vomiting, or photophobia and phonophobia (revised per
             Amendments 01 and 02). A qualified migraine attack with aura must fulfill the same
             criteria as the headache attack, plus have an associated aura as defined by the
             Migraine Criteria of the Headache Classification Committee of the International
             Headache Society. An aura alone that requires acute migraine treatment will also be
             considered a migraine attack.

          4. Male and female patients will be eligible for enrollment. Females should be either of
             non-childbearing potential by reason of surgery, radiation, menopause (one year post
             onset), or of childbearing potential and practicing a medically acceptable method of
             contraception (eg, abstinence, a barrier method plus spermicide, or IUD) for at least
             one month before study randomization and for two months after the end of the study,
             and have a negative serum B-hCG at Screening. Pregnant and/or lactating females are
             excluded. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional
             approved method of contraception (eg, a barrier method plus spermicide, or IUD)
             starting with the Baseline Phase and continuing throughout the entire study period.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Duration Per Migraine Attack in Treatment Phase (LOCF)</title>
        <description>The duration of a migraine attack was the sum of the duration (in hours) of each migraine headache that was collapsed to form the migraine attack. The time between the offset of first migraine headache and the onset of the next migraine headache was not counted in the duration of migraine attack. The average duration of the migraine attacks in each phase was calculated as the total duration (in hours) of the migraine attacks during each phase, divided by the number of migraine attacks in the corresponding treatment phase. Efficacy analyses were performed using both the 24-hour and 48-hour rule. The data is presented as mean hours +/- standard error.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Migraine Attack Frequency Per 28 Days in Treatment Phase (LOCF)</title>
        <description>Qualified migraine headache was defined as two major subtypes: migraine without aura(headache that lasted 4-72 hours with at least two characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate/ severe pain intensity or aggravation by/ causing avoidance of routine physical activity and either nausea/ vomiting or photophobia,phonophobia); migraine with aura (attack with reversible focal neurological symptoms that usually precede or sometimes accompany the headache) per Migraine Criteria of the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society. All of the qualified headaches, which occur after the initial qualified migraine headache, but within 24 hours of previous qualified migraine headache, were collapsed into one qualified migraine attack. Two qualified migraine attacks were considered to be distinct when the end of previous and the beginning of the next migraine attack were separated by at least 24/48 hours per 24/48 hour rule.</description>
