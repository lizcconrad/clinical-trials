    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most frequent neoplasm of women in Taiwan and in the world. It
      influences about 2,700 women with about 1,000 women dying of cervical cancer each year and in
      Taiwan. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) have been consistently implicated in causing cervical
      cancer especially those high-risk types which have been strongly associated with cervical
      cancer. In recent years, there has been compelling evidence that infection with human
      papillomavirus (HPV) is a major etiologic factor in the development of cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma.

      As in most virus-induced diseases, an adequate immune response is likely to play a key role
      in the clearance of HPV infections and HPV-related lesions. This assumption is born out by
      both epidemiological studies and animal models. Immune-compromised patients such as
      HIV-infected women, organ transplant recipients, and patients suffering from other forms of
      malignancies, are at a higher risk of developing CIN lesions and invasive cervical cancer.
      Moreover, several studies establish the existence of natural HPV E7-specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte (CTL) immunity in humans. Only a minority of women infected with oncogenic HPV
      types develop CIN or cervical cancer. Indeed, the majority of CIN lesions do not progress or
      even regress to normal cytology, indicating that other factors such as an inadequate immune
      function are necessary for the development of progressive CIN lesions and cervical carcinoma.

      Consequently, the HLA class I and II phenotypes may be correlated with an effective immune
      response against HPV-associated cervical lesions. Differences in the recognition of foreign
      antigens, such as those contributed by alleles at the HLA class I or II loci, might be
      proposed to affect the risk of developing cervical cancer.

      In the present proposal, the investigators would like to examine the HLA class I and II
      associations among Taiwanese women with cervical neoplasia. The purposes of this proposal
      are:

        1. to address the relationships between the HLA class I and II haplotype, HPV infection,
           and cervical cancer; and

        2. to elucidate the immunologic responses to HPV type 16 in different HLA class I and II
           haplotypes. It will help the investigators to identify which population of HLA genotypes
           is more susceptible to HPV infection and progresses to invasive cervical cancer. The
           results of this research will be very useful for the prevention and screening of
           cervical cancer in the future.

      1. To survey the incidence of HPV infection in CIN and cervical cancer patients.

           Using epidemiologic data drawn from a wide range of countries and population groups,
           investigators have found evidence of HPV in 90% to 95% of cervical cancers. The
           incidence of HPV in cervical cancer was 79% in our own report. Besides, 91% of
           high-grade CIN cases and 50% of low-grade CIN cases could be attributed to HPV infection
           in Taiwanese women. Because these reports for Taiwanese women were published around 10
           years ago, it is important to survey and update the incidence of HPV in CIN and cervical
           cancer patients in Taiwanese women. We will survey the incidence of HPV infection in 500
           cervical cancer patients, 100 patients of CIN and 100 normal population patients.

        2. To survey the human leukocyte antigen haplotype in CIN and cervical cancer patients.

           HLA class I and II alleles have been reported to associate with the nasopharyngeal
           carcinoma in Taiwan. Besides, human leukocyte antigen class I and II alleles might
           interplay in the response to interferon-alpha treatment in Taiwanese patients with
           chronic hepatitis C virus infection. We will detect the HLA class I and II haplotype
           first and then correlate them with the CIN and cervical cancer patients.

        3. To identify the correlation between HLA class I and II haplotype and HPV infection and
           CIN and cervical cancer.

           We will further survey the correlation between HLA class I and II and the genotypes of
           HPV in CIN and cervical cancer patients. We will identify which HLA class I and II
           haplotypes have positive or negative correlation with HPV infection, CIN and cervical
           cancer. Then we would determine which specific HLA antigens are important in determining
           the risk of HPV infection, CIN and cervical cancer.

        4. To elucidate the immunologic responses to HPV type 16 in HLA2 with different II
           haplotypes and the role of immunogenetics in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer.

      HPV type 16 has been identified to be the highest incidence of malignant HPV genotypes in
      cervical cancer. Our laboratory has set up immunologic assays for evaluating the immune
      responses to HPV type 16. We will survey the immune response to HPV type 16 in those HLA
      class I and II haplotypes which have positive or negative correlation with the HPV infection
      and cervical cancer. We would identify which population of HLA genotype are more susceptible
      to HPV infection and invasive cervical cancer and elucidate the role of immunogenetics in the
      HPV infection and carcinogenesis of cervical cancer.
