  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on a universal eradication of H. pylori in an offshore island (Matsu) with a high
      prevalence of gastric cancer as well as premalignant gastric lesion, we first examined the
      infection rate of H. pylori. Secondly, we evaluated the efficacy of clarithromycin-based
      triple therapy with a levofloxacin-based rescue treatment. And thirdly, we tested the
      hypothesis that whether the cure of H. pylori can reverse the premalignant gastric lesion.
      Fourth, we determine the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. The gene-environment
      interaction will be addressed regarding gastric cancer carcinogenesis. Finally, the incident
      rate of gastric cancer would be followed in this cohort.

    <textblock>
      Despite the decline of global incidence, gastric cancer still affects public health
      substantially due to the considerable medical burden in the treatment of disease at the
      symptomatic stage. This fact has prompted clinicians to extend their attention from the
      multidisciplinary therapies to the design of preventive strategies. Gastric cancer
      development follows a carcinogenic process from non-atrophic gastritis, atrophic gastritis,
      intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and eventually to the adenocarcinoma. Helicobacter pylori
      (H. pylori) infection triggers this carcinogenic cascade and its eradication is currently the
      most reliable regimen to arrest the histologic progression in order to prevent gastric
      cancer. Emerging data have suggested that the benefit of H. pylori treatment earlier in the
      course of infection is larger and cannot be outweighed by a disfavored discount rate as a
      result of different time horizons between early treatment and later benefit of averting
      advanced cancer.

      In the Asia-Pacific area, however, virulent strains of H. pylori infection are highly
      prevalent and premalignant gastric lesions may have already developed at the take-off age of
      active intervention. Our current knowledge remains limited in answering whether H. pylori
      eradication can regress these premalignant lesions and if so, what determinant can contribute
      to a positive response is unknown. The concept of &quot;a point of no return&quot; suggests that the
      benefit of H. pylori eradication may diminish at later stages when many types of molecular
      damage become irreversible. Several population-based studies, in contrast, found that the
      premalignant gastric lesions were potentially reversible given a sufficiently long duration
      free from infection. The inconsistence may reflect the facts that studies with adequate
      sample size and long enough follow-up are rarely available and that some important factors,
      such as the variation in host susceptibility to disease and dietary exposure to carcinogens,
      are difficult to be measured but they are likely to confound the results.

      Therefore, the present study was to:

        1. Determine the efficacy of a novel regimen to treat the H. pylori infection in the
           general population.

        2. To address the question whether the premalignant gastric lesion could be reversed
           following the cure of infection.

        3. To simulate the cost-effectiveness of this chemoprevention.

        4. To use individual data to empirically calculate the cost-effectiveness of this
           intervention.

        5. To address the host genetic susceptibility to gastric cancer development.

        6. To follow-up the gastric cancer incidence following the eradication of H. pylori.

    <description>For subjects who received the first-line treatment, the costs included the initial 13C-UBT, one-week triple therapy (esomeprazole 40mg once daily, amoxicillin 1g twice daily, and clarithromycin 500mg twice daily), and the confirmatory 13C-UBT. For subjects in whom the initial treatment failed, the costs further included the re-treatment consisting of ten-day triple therapy (esomeprazole 40mg once daily, amoxicillin 1g twice daily, and levofloxacin 500mg once daily), and the confirmatory 13C-UBT.
The first round of study was between 2004 and 2005, the second round was between 2008 and 2009, and the third round was between 2012 and 2013.</description>
