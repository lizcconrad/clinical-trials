  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol directed weaning has been shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation for
      patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of tertiary centres. However, this benefit
      has not previously been studied in a community hospital setting. We therefore sought to
      evaluate the impact of an evidence-based weaning guideline on the outcomes for patients
      receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICUs of community hospitals in a cluster randomized
      controlled trial involving 11 community hospitals.

          -  patients ventilated for more than 24 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients less than 16 years of age patients who receive only non-invasive ventilation
