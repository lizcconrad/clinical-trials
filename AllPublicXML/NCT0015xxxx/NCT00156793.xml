  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the ability of AI-700-enhanced rest-stress
      echocardiography to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with suspected ischemic
      heart disease who are indicated for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
      imaging.

      Assessment of myocardial perfusion has been demonstrated to provide both diagnostic and
      prognostic value to patients with ischemic heart disease by allowing the clinician to assess
      the hemodynamic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD). The primary objective of the
      clinical development program for AI-700 is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of AI-700
      as an intravenous ultrasound contrast agent in patients with suspected myocardial perfusion
      defects.

      The patient population is comprised of patients who are being evaluated for inducible
      ischemia. The primary study objective was to determine the accuracy, sensitivity, and
      specificity of AI-700-enhanced echocardiographic imaging for detecting CAD using coronary
      angiography/left ventriculography (ANGIO/LVG) or single-photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT) with clinical outcome as the reference standards.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Men and non-pregnant/non-lactating women with a recent history of typical or atypical
        chest pain (angina) who were 18 to 80 years of age and who had been clinically indicated
        for SPECT evaluation for the presence of inducible ischemia were to be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Study candidates who have had any of the following conditions were to be excluded from
             the study: any clinically unstable condition or major surgery within 7 days prior to
             AI-700 dosing; an acute MI, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack
             within 30 days prior to dosing; congestive heart failure graded as New York Heart
             Association Grade 4 within 3 months prior to dosing; significant left main CAD;
             moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; oxygen saturation &lt; 90% at
             rest; or prior CABG (unless &gt;= 6 months prior to AI-700 dosing and patient had typical
             angina)

          -  Candidates with significant cardiovascular or pulmonary structural and/or functional
             abnormality, or in whom visualization of the left ventricle was not adequate for
             evaluation of cardiac function during the Exclusion ECHO, were not eligible to
             participate in the study.

          -  Patients who had a history of MI of non-CAD etiology or who exhibited new or changing
             ECG abnormalities at any time between Screening and AI-700 dosing were to be similarly
             excluded.

          -  Other exclusion criteria included: participation in an investigational drug/device
             study within 30 days prior to dosing (90 days for UK sites), non-seasonal asthma
             within the past 3 years or recent seasonal asthma requiring prescription medication,
             organ transplant or end-stage organ failure, and active seizure disorder.

          -  Candidates were to be excluded for uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, frequent
             premature ventricular or atrial contractions, history of prolonged QT/QTc, use of
             automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillator or pacemaker, and any rhythm
             abnormality that had not been evaluated and treated by a specialist or for which
             current treatment did not ensure patient safety.

          -  Candidates who had used methylated xanthines within 24 hours of dosing were also to be
             excluded. Patients were also to be excluded if aminophylline, theophylline, or
             dipyridamole were contraindicated according to each agentâ€™s product labeling.
