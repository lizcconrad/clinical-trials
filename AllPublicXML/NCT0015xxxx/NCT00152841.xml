    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:In patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease diagnosed with mild or
      moderate anaemia:

        1. iron supplementation will increase disease activity and oxidative stress

        2. the addition of antioxidant vitamin will reduce this detrimental effect
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To maintain site/extent of disease and medication consistent among groups, the design is a
      double blind crossover placebo-controlled trial.

        1. If mild anaemia, patients are randomized to 300 mg of ferrous fumarate or placebo for 4
           weeks followed by 2 weeks of washout period after which patients will crossover the
           opposite treatments for another 4 weeks.

        2. If moderate anaemia, patients will receive 600 mg of ferrous fumarate for 10 weeks. They
           are randomized to either vitamin E (800 IU) or placebo for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks
           of washout period after which patients will crossover the opposite treatments for
           another 4 weeks
