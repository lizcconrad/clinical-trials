      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of the drugs docetaxel and
      capecitabine is effective in treating breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some chemotherapy drugs are thought to work in synergy, meaning they work better in
      combination, rather than singly because one drug may cause changes in the tumor that will
      make the other drug more effective. The drugs docetaxel and capecitabine may work in synergy,
      based on laboratory studies in tumors. These laboratory studies show that docetaxel increases
      the levels of a critical enzyme, called thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which is necessary to
      activate the capecitabine. This study will use this promising chemotherapy combination in
      patients with breast cancer. Before, during, and after chemotherapy, the participants' breast
      tumors will be examined to see if TP increases, as predicted by the laboratory studies. The
      study will also look at other factors in tumors and blood that may be able to predict how
      effective the chemotherapy will be for each individual, so that in the future we may better
      select the best chemotherapy for an individual's cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a primary measurable invasive breast cancer with the primary
             tumor intact (T1, 2, 3, or 4, any N, M0). The clinical stage must meet one of the
             following criteria:

               1. Size ≥ 2 cm on mammography, ultrasound, or PE

               2. OR ≥ 1 cm and ER negative, and amenable to research biopsy.

               3. OR &lt;1 cm and documented intact axillary metastasis amenable to serial research
                  CORE biopsies.

          -  Histologic diagnosis of at least one site of invasive cancer must be by core needle
             biopsy or incisional biopsy. Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen and
             progesterone receptors, and HER-2 neu receptor should be obtained on the initial
             diagnostic sample.

          -  Patients must have had mammography performed at the University of Michigan, OR outside
             film review prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients must have clinical ultrasound performed at the University of Michigan prior
             to enrollment.

          -  All patients are required to sign an informed consent regarding the experimental
             nature of this therapy, including the research biopsies, in accordance with the
             University of Michigan Institutional Review Board standards.

          -  Patients must have ECOG Performance status of 0-1.

          -  This study is limited to women only.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a documented negative serum HCG within 7
             days prior to treatment. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at least
             12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breast tumors that are not measurable by any of the modalities, including physical
             examination, mammography, or ultrasound.

          -  Tumors diagnosed by excisional biopsy, or incisional biopsy that does not leave
             measurable disease by physical examination, mammography, or ultrasound.

          -  Age less than 18 years.

          -  Granulocyte count of &lt;1500/mm3, hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dl platelet count of &lt;100,000/mm3.
