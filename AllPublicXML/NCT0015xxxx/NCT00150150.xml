  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nodular goitre is common in the general population and less than 5% of the patients who
      undergo surgery for solitary thyroid nodules have cancer, in absence of clinical suspicion.
      Nodules left untreated seem to have a slight growth potential in borderline iodine-deficient
      areas. Interstitial laser photo-coagulation (ILP) is a procedure for local hyperthermia and
      photocoagulation, allowing minimally invasive treatment of benign tumors, including thyroid
      nodules. The aim of these studies are to evaluate if ILP will be useful in reducing the
      volume of the benign thyroid nodule and thyroid function will be unaffected in euthyroid
      patients, and normalized in pretoxic- and toxic thyroid nodules. The investigations are
      listed below:

        1. Randomized study of interstitial laser photocoagulation for benign solitary cold thyroid
           nodules – one versus two or three treatments

        2. Randomized study of interstitial laser photocoagulation for benign solitary autonomous
           thyroid nodules – 131I versus laser ablation

        3. Interstitial laser photocoagulation for benign thyroid cystadenomas. – a feasibility
           study.
