    <textblock>
      Hypothesis / aims of study A RCT has shown that results of prolapse repair via vaginal
      approach could be improved when a polypropylene mesh is used as tissue support (1). However,
      non protected heavy-weight meshes were associated with a high rate of local complications
      such as vaginal erosions and dyspareunia (2). The aim of this multicentre study is to
      evaluate anatomical and functional results of an innovative low-weight polypropylene mesh
      protected by an absorbable hydrophilic film in the prolapse repair by vaginal route, in
      comparison by the standard anterior colporrhaphy.

      Study design, materials and methods This study involves 15 centres in French Private or
      Public Hospital. Patients will be randomly allocated to be operated by a standard anterior
      colporrhaphy or by an anterior repair reinforced by a specially designed mesh: UgytexTM
      (Sofradim, France). Ugytex is a low-weight (38g/m²) and highly porous (average porosity: 89%,
      pores over 1.5mm) polypropylene monofilament mesh offering tissue ingrowth and connective
      differentiation for a stable and long-term support. The mesh is coated with a hydrophilic
      film composed of atelocollagen, polyethylene glycol and glycerol. The absorbable coating
      protects delicate pelvic viscera from the risk of acute inflammation during the healing’s
      inflammatory peak. Prolapse severity will be evaluated using the POP-Q system. In order to
      evaluate the patient’s quality of life, the validated PFDI and the PFIQ questionnaires will
      be used preoperatively and during follow-up (3), as well as a validated questionnaire on
      sexual problems. The difference on one-year cure rate should be 15% (80% for the anterior
      colporrhaphy and 95% for the mesh repair). Then the estimated number of patient is 97 in each
      arm.
