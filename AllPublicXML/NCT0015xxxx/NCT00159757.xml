  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been evidence that ziprasidone is efficacious in decreasing the magnitude of both
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and also effective in the treatment of
      depressive symptoms. It shows good tolerance with low incidence of extrapyramidal side
      effects and does not significantly influence body weight. As it has been shown that
      ziprasidone is efficacious and safe in patients who have been pretreated with other
      antipsychotic that has to be withdrawn either due to the side effects or not satisfied
      efficacy. The purpose of the study was to provide further evidence for the efficacy and
      safety of patients with schizophrenia and allow for psychiatrists in Hungary to gain
      experience with the drug before wide commercial availability.

      involved in the decision to terminate the trial.
