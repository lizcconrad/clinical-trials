  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on previous observation that, in men with localized prostate cancer,
      non-cancerous prostate tissue is hypoxic, and on the known contribution of hypoxia to the
      progression of cancer. Patients undergoing diagnostic prostate biopsy with serum prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) less than 10ng/ml and who have given informed consent will have oxygen
      measurements of the prostate and peri-prostatic tissue taken with the Eppendorf electrode at
      the time of biopsy. The oxygenation of normal prostate tissue will be compared to that of
      cancerous prostate tissue. In men with negative biopsies, the prostate tissue oxygen
      measurements will be compared with the peri-prostatic tissue oxygen measurements.
