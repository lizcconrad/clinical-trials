      To test whether levels of OPG can be changed during orthodontic treatment. Alveolar bone
      samples will be collected from partially impacted third molars after orthodontic uprighting
      for different period of time in volunteers. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
      analysis for OPG and RANKL will reveal their roles in this physiological process.

      Long treatment time is a major factor causing high fee for orthodontic treatment. Patients
      would have dental caries or periodontitis resulted from improper oral hygiene care during
      this long treatment period. Therefore, how to speed up the tooth movement which determines
      the duration of orthodontic treatment, can help more people to obtain good occlusion and
      esthetics. Orthodontic force on tooth induces bone resorption on the compression side and
      bone deposition on the tension side, thus bone remodels and then tooth moves. Bone resorption
      is a complex process. Osteoblasts play an important role during initiation of bone
      resorption.

      Changes OPG expression of osteoblasts under mechanical stimulation can play a role in bone
      remodeling. In order to test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be achieved:

        1. To test whether levels of OPG can be changed during orthodontic treatment. Alveolar bone
           samples will be collected from partially impacted third molars after orthodontic
           uprighting for different period of time in volunteers. In situ hybridization and
           immunohistochemistry analysis for OPG and RANKL will reveal their roles in this
           physiological process.

        2. To optimize the regulation by changing magnitude and frequency of pressure, and
           characterize the time table for these changes..
