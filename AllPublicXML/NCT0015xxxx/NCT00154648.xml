      This trial is to show the diagnostic efficacy of Gadovist for contrast enhanced Magnetic
      Resonance Angiography (CE-MRA) of arteries (specified vessel segments) by analyzing the rate
      of agreement, image quality, and diagnostic confidence between a CE-MRA based diagnosis and
      the diagnosis achieved from the comparator procedure IA DSA using Ultravist.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  With suspected or known disease of the arteries

          -  Scheduled for an IA DSA/cut film angiography of the arteries in a period of less than
             7 days prior to or after the study period and has completed delineation and
             documentation of all vessels.

          -  Willing and able to continue study participation. This includes the administration of
             GadovistÂ® 1.0 and completion of all procedures required by the study protocol

          -  Patient is between 20 and 75 years of age

          -  Fully informed and has signed consent in advance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is clinically unstable or his/her clinical course during the 72 hour safety
             observation period was unpredictable

          -  Patient with renal failure

          -  Woman who is pregnant or of childbearing potential without having had a negative
             pregnancy test prior to enrollment (within 72 hours prior to CE-MRA)

          -  Lactating woman

          -  Patient with any contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination and
             IA DSA.

          -  Patient receives any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study entry or is
             planned to receive any other investigational drug during the safety follow-up (72
             hours after CE-MRA).

          -  Patient is scheduled for surgery or other interventions within the 72 hours after the
             CE-MRA/IA DSA or had any such procedure within 48 hours prior to the study CE-MRA/IA
             DSA.

          -  Hypersensitivity to gadobutrol products

          -  Patient has previously entered this study
