  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether Epoetin alfa manufactured by a roller bottle technology (Epoetin alfa
      RB) and Epoetin alfa manufactured by a deep tank process (Epoetin alfa DT) have a comparable
      safety profile when administered to patients with CKD not on dialysis.

        Inclusion Criteria: - â‰¥ 18 years of age - CKD not on dialysis: estimated glomerular
        filtration rate (GFR) of 15mL/min to 60 mL/min (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
        [MDRD] equation) - Clinically stable - Mean of all screening/baseline hemoglobin (Hb)
        values between 11.0 to 13.0 g/dL - Currently receiving Epoetin alfa RB (ie. Epogen or
        Procrit) at the same dosing frequency for at least four weeks prior to randomization with
        no more than 1 missed or withheld dose in each of the 2 week periods - Adequate iron stores
        (transferrin saturation &gt; 15.0%) - No prior use of erythropoietic agents other than Epogen,
        Procrit or Aranesp Exclusion Criteria: - Currently receiving treatment with any
        erythropoietic stimulating protein other than Epogen or Procrit. - Prior use of
        erythropoietic agents other than Epogen, Procrit or Aranesp. - Uncontrolled hypertension
        (defined as diastolic blood pressure [BP] &gt; 110 mmHg or systolic BP &gt; 180 mmHg during
        screening). - Grand mal seizure within the last 6 months prior to screening. - Acute
        myocardial ischemia; hospitalization for congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction
        within 12 weeks before randomization. - Stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic) or transient
        ischemic attack within 12 weeks before randomization. - Major surgery within 3 months prior
        to screening (excluding vascular access surgery). - Clinical evidence of systemic infection
        or inflammatory disease at the time of screening and up until randomization. - Known
        history of severe hyperparathyroidism (intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] &gt;1500 pg/ml or
        bio-intact parathyroid hormone [biPTH] &gt; 800 pg/ml within 3 months prior to randomization).
        - Known positivity for HIV antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen. - Clinical evidence of
        current malignancy with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
        - Blood transfusions within 8 weeks prior to screening or active bleeding. - Androgen
        therapy within 8 weeks prior to screening. - Interferon therapy.

        Patients known to have tested positive at any time in the past for antibodies to
        erythropoietic proteins. - Systemic hematological disease (eg. sickle cell anemia,
        myelodysplastic syndromes, hematological malignancy); myeloma; hemolytic anemia. - Other
        investigational products are excluded. - Subject is currently enrolled in, or has not yet
        completed a period of at least 30 days since ending other investigational device or drug
        trial(s). - Psychiatric, addictive, or any other disorder that compromises ability to give
        truly informed consent for participation in this study. - Pregnant or breast feeding (women
        of child-bearing potential must be taking adequate contraceptive precautions). -
