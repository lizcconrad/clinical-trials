      4 week open study to evaluate the safety of levocetirizine in young children (2 - 6 years)
      suffering from allergic rhinitis. As secondary objective, this study will assess the efficacy
      of the treatment by means of the T4SS (Total 4 symptoms scores of allergic rhinitis) and each
      of the 4 individual rhinitis symptom scores
