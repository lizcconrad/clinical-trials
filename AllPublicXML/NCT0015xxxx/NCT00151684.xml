  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore diazoxide efficacy in treatment of obese men and
      assessment of maximal insulin suppression in obese men without hyperglycaemia.

      Obesity is associated with markedly elevated plasma insulin levels throughout the day. The
      concept is that obese subjects predominantly develop lean tissue resistance against the
      glucoregulatory actions of insulin, but remain relatively sensitive to the lipogenic and
      antilipolytic effects of insulin in adipose tissue. According to this theory, suppression of
      hyperinsulinism by diazoxide, a well known inhibitor of glucose stimulated insulin secretion,
      might be useful to treat obesity because it will help to reverse the process of lipid
      storage.

      The purpose of this study is to explore diazoxide efficacy in treatment of obese men and
      assessment of maximal insulin suppression in obese men without hyperglycaemia.

      Study design:

      This study is an open-labelled, non-randomized, phase IIa study.

      Treatment:

      During a 6 month period, the dosage of Diazoxide will be raised gradually until a maximum of
      900 mg/day, under control of bloodpressure and glucose levels.

      Endpoints, monthly determined:

        -  body weight

        -  abdominal circumference

        -  body composition measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry

        -  glucose tolerance
