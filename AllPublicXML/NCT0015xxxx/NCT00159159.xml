      Primary Objective:

        -  Evaluation of the benefit on renal function of one year of a low dose of ciclosporine
           versus the usual dose

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the immunosuppressive efficacy and tolerance of the treatment

      Study Duration:

      Twelve months for each patient

      Study Treatment: Ciclosporine

      Group A: low dose &gt;= 130 µg/l &lt; T0 ciclosporinemia &lt; 200 µg/l; Group B: standard dose &gt;= 200
      µg/l &lt; T0 ciclosporinemia &lt; 300 µg/l.

      Study Visits:

      One visit every 15 days, for the first three months; then 1 visit every month, for 6 months;
      and 1 visit at 9 and 12 months.

      Associated Treatments:

        -  Mycophenolate (Cellcept®), 3g a day

        -  Corticoids, as used for transplanted patients

      Randomization: Randomization will occur when it is decided that ciclosporine will be
      introduced.
