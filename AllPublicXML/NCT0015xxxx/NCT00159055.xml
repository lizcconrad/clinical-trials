      Treatment strategy of patients:

      Stem cell engraftment (myeloablative or NST) for induction of host vs graft myeloablative
      transplantation tolerance.

      Whenever indicated, additional post NST DLI given in graded increment, to optimize control of
      GVHD.

      Preparation of immune donor lymphocytes, either by donor immunization in-vitro with a
      CMV-specific peptide followed by administration of immunized donor lymphocytes, or by
      injection of donor lymphocytes and in-vivo sensitization of donor lymphocytes in the patient
      following DLI.

      Pre-emptive treatment of seronegative patients at risk or patients with documented viremia or
      CMV disease with CMV-specific donor lymphocytes generated in-vivo in the donor or in the host
      by peptide immunization.

      Consenting donors will be immunized with CMV-specific peptides, for induction of CTLs in-vivo
      following subcutaneous inoculation of peptides with adjuvant or donor APC pulsed with
      relevant peptides.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Patient:

          -  Consenting patients with indication for myeloablative BMT or NST with an HLA matching
             sibling available, for transplant.

          -  Patients at risk of CMV disease including seronegative patients; patients with
             seronegative donors, and seronegative donor for sero positive patients.

          -  Patients with resistant CMV viremia or CMV disease not responding to conventional
             treatment with ganciclovir, or Foscarnet.

          -  Patients with HLA phenotype for which a relevant peptide for CMV exists.

          -  For Donor:

          -  Consenting sibling &gt;18 years old.

          -  HLA phenotype for which a relevant peptide for CMV exists.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For Patient:

          -  Patients with severe resistant GVHD where there may be a risk to administer DLI or
             immunized donor lymphocytes.

          -  For Donor:

          -  Consenting sibling &gt;18 years old.

          -  HLA phenotype for which a relevant peptide for CMV exists.

          -  Donor with an infectious disease (e.g. HIV-1; HBV, etc.)
