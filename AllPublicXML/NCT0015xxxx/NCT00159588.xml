    <textblock>
      It is a common belief that patients with MOH rarely respond of preventative medications
      whilst overusing acute medications. However, no randomized trial has been done previously to
      prove such statement. Based on some clinical experiences, our hypothesis are patients with
      probably MOH may benefit from use of preventive medications better than treatment with abrupt
      withdrawal or no specific treatment.

      This randomized multi-centre study started January 2004, and patients with probably MOH have
      been included from five different University hospitals in Norway. The last patient was
      included November 9th 2006, final inclusion date was December 31th 2006. At this time a total
      of 64 patients with probable MOH according to the International Classification of Headache
      Disorders, 2nd Edition (2004) were included.

      The included patients were randomized to one out of three possible options:

        1. Abrupt withdrawal of the acute medication(s) they have been overusing. After 3 month:
           use of preventative medication (best choice)in those who need such treatment, 12 month
           follow-up.

        2. Start with preventative medication (best choice) directly without abrupt withdrawal, 12
           month follow-up.

        3. No specific treatment (controls), 5 month follow-up.
