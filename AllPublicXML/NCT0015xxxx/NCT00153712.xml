      The aim of this study is to study the natural history of the ulcer healing while on proton
      pump inhibitors (PPI) and the ulcer recurrence without acid suppression therapy of
      Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID), non-Helicobacter pylori (HP) bleeding ulcer
      patients.

      Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID), Non-Helicobacter pylori (HP) bleeding peptic
      ulcers are relatively common in the West (11%-44%). It is uncommon in Hong Kong (4%).
      Significant number of these patients with non-NSAID, non-Hp bleeding ulcers had co-morbid
      illness and many had life-threatening conditions. Our recent study showed that there is an
      increasing incidence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), non-Helicobacter
      pylori (Hp) bleeding peptic ulcers. There is no datum on the natural course of these patients
      and this is our aim to have this observational study.

    <description>The secondary endpoint is recurrent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which was defined as recurrent overt bleeding (melena or hematochezia without an upper GI source) or a drop in hemoglobin &gt;2 g/dL, without an upper GI source or other non-GI causes of anemia. We excluded hemorrhoidal bleeding and colorectal cancer as lower GI outcomes.</description>
