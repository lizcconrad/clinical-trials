  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term treatment of progestin has been demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on
      endometrial angiogenesis and the proliferation of endometrial stromal cells. As a result,
      progestin is now widely employed in the treatment of endometrial cancer, endometrial
      hyperplasia, and dysfunction uterine bleeding. In the treatment of adenomyosis, however, the
      beneficial effect of progestin was limited. It might imply that the behavior of endometrial
      cells in women with adenomyosis is different from that in women without adenomyosis.

      Our previous study revealed that the expression of killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) on NK
      cells was decreased in eutopic endometrium in women with adenomyosis. It may be a
      compensatory effect in which the NK cytotoxicity is activated in order to wipe out the
      abnormal endometrial cells that might go out of the eutopic site of endometrium. It implies
      that the formation of adenomyosis might be due to “abnormal” endometrial tissues, but not the
      aberrant local immunological dysfunction in myometrium. This finding is compatible with
      previous reports in which eutopic endometrium obtained from women with endometriosis or
      adenomyosis was found to behave differently from endometrium in unaffected women.

      In this study, we try to collect endometrial tissues from women with and without adenomyosis,
      and then purify the endometrial stromal cells from endometrium. The endometrial stromal cells
      are cultured for 8 days with the supplement of medroxyprogesterone (MPA) or danazol.
      Quantification of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA in endometrial cells, and the concentrations of IL-6 and
      IL-8 in cultured media will be done with real time RT-PCR and ELISA respectively. The
      expression of different cytokines of endometrial cells in response to progestin might be
      further elucidated after our experiment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eutopic endometrium was obtained and separated into single endometrial stromal cell (ESC) in
      women with adenomyosis (study group) and without adenomyosis (control group).

      After becoming pre-confluent (covering 80% of the culture well), ESC was cultured for 8 days
      solely or with the addition of medroxyprogesterone (MPA) or danazol.

      ELISA was done to measure IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha concentrations of the culture media.

      Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was done to measure IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha RNA levels in
      ESC.
