  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal therapy is the standard treatment for prostate cancer which has spread to other
      areas of the body. Despite the high initial response rates to hormonal therapy, the vast
      majority of men will develop cancer which is no longer responsive to hormone deprivation. The
      average time for hormonal therapy to be effective is about 18 months. Chemotherapy
      combinations which can treat the disease when it no longer responds to hormonal therapy have
      been developed, but these treatments are not curative. One of these combinations is
      estramustine, etoposide and paclitaxel. In men with far advanced disease, 60% will have a
      decrease in their PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) or shrinkage of tumors after treatment with
      this chemotherapy. Despite this, these men have all developed further disease progression
      requiring additional treatment. One possible way to make chemotherapy more effective is to
      give it when the number of tumor cells is smallest, and the number of cells to be killed is
      at a low level. One situation in which this is true is when a man has responded to hormonal
      therapy any tumors are at their smallest size. This study will test whether the addition of
      chemotherapy at that time will prolong the time until the cancer becomes unresponsive to
      hormonal therapy.

    <criteria>

        All patients must have a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate with
        evidence of metastases on bone or CT scan. Patients with regional metastases to pelvic
        lymph nodes (D1 disease) as their only site of metastases will be excluded from this study.

        Patients on androgen suppression therapy at the time of registration must have received
        less than seven months of therapy (excluding any neoadjuvant hormonal therapy) and must
        have a decreasing or stable PSA level.

        Patients may not be undergoing concurrent chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiation
        therapy. Prior to radiation therapy must have completed more than 4 weeks prior to
        registration.

        Patients may not have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy.

        Patients may not have evidence of brain metastases or untreated spinal cord compression.
