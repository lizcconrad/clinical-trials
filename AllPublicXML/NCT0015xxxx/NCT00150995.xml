      Purpose: The aim of this clinical trail is to evaluate Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) in the
      treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tetrathiomolybdate or TM, a drug developed for Wilson's Disease, removes copper from the
      bloodstream. Copper is a key factor in angiogenesis (blood vessel growth)- a process that
      occurs normally in the body but becomes uncontrolled in cancerous cells. Tetrathiomolybdate
      essentially wages war against copper, which serves to choke off tumor growth. Realizing the
      key role of copper in angiogenesis, researchers have begun exploring treatment with
      Tetrathiomolybdate for different types of cancers. This clinical trial will evaluate the
      effectiveness of Tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of patients with hormone refractory
      prostate cancer. Hormone refractory prostate cancer refers to advanced disease in which the
      patient no longer responding to conventional hormonal treatment.

    <description>To determine the time to progression of prostate cancer in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer treated with tetrathiomolybdate. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions. For disease evaluable only by bone scan, the appearance of new lesions was considered evidence of progression. The development of pain in an existing lesion requiring institution of palliative radiotherapy or prescription narcotics was also considered evidence of progression.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          -  Patients must have histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate with
             progression following hormonal therapy and antiandrogen withdrawal.

          -  Patients must have minimal disease (defined as bone metastasis or visceral disease
             with no impairment of organ function or pain severe enough to require narcotics for
             control).

          -  Adequate bone marrow and renal function

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score of 0 or 1 (a measure of general well
             being where 1 represents asymptomatic and 5 represents death)

          -  Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks

          -  Must have completed radiation more than 4 weeks prior to registration and must have a
             rising PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) and lesion outside of the radiation field

        Exclusion:

          -  Patients with an elevated PSA as the only evidence of disease

          -  Clinical evidence of spinal cord compression

          -  History of prior malignancy within the past 5 years (with the exception of in situ
             carcinoma of any site or nonmelanoma skin cancer)
