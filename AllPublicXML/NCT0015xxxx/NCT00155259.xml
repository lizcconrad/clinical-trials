      The primary endpoint of this phase II trial is the objective response rate of the regimen.
      The secondary endpoints include treatment-related toxicity, progression free survival and

      This is an open-label phase II trial designed to test the effect and toxicity profile of
      combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine in locally advanced breast cancer
      patients.Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death for women in Taiwan.
      Despite the advance in multidisciplinary treatment, a significant number of patients
      eventually develop metastatic disease, especially those who present with locally advanced
      breast cancer (LABC). LABC remains an important and challenging problem in practice. In LABC,
      treatment strategies that include neoadjuvant chemotherapy have several potential advantages:
      early initiation of systemic therapy, in vivo assessment of response, and downstaging of
      primary tumor and regional lymphatic metastases, which makes breast-conserving surgery an
      option for many. The potential theoretical shortcomings include delay in local treatment,
      introduction of drug resistance, and unreliability of clinical staging. In practice, the
      advantages have exceeded the disadvantages. Clinical trial has demonstrated that docetaxel
      and capecitabine is highly effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. On the
      other hand, our previous study has demonstrated that combination of taxane and cisplatin is
      highly effective in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer. We design
      a combination chemotherapy using docetaxel with cisplatin and capecitabine in the treatment
      of locally advanced breast cancer.

               2. Tumor involvement of chest wall (ribs or intercostals or serratus anterior
                  muscles) or skin (ipsilateral cutaneous edema, ulceration, or satellite nodules)

               3. Clinical evident inflammatory carcinoma

               4. Ipsilateral fixed axillary adenopathy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment (including hormonal therapy, chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy or biological therapy) for LABC. Concomitant use of above therapy will no
             be allowed.

          -  Pregnant or lactating woman

          -  Metastases disease other than regional lymph node metastases (supraclavicular lymph
