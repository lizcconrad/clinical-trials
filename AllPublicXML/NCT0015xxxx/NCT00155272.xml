      This is a pilot study of concomitant radiotherapy and thalidomide for patients with locally
      advanced HCC. Patients whose tumor(s) are not suitable for other local treatment, such as
      surgery, trans-arterial chemoembolization (TAE), ethanol injection, or radiofrequency
      ablation. will be enrolled.Radical radiotherapy will be started after pre-treatment
      evaluation. The total dose of RT will be 50Gy in 25 fractions to local tumor(s). Oral
      Thalidomide will be started 3 days before RT begins. Thalidomide treatment will continue for
      totally 6 months or until tumor progression. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCEMRI) will be
      done at the following time points to assess the change in tumor perfusion: (1) before the
      start of thalidomide treatment; (2) 3 days after thalidomide before radiotherapy; (3) 2weeks
      after radiotherapy begins;and (4) 1 month after radiotherapy completes. DCEMRI will then be
      done every 3 months until disease progression.Serum samples for angiogenic cytokine studies
      will also be collected.The study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of
      combination treatment of radiotherapy and thalidomide for locally advanced HCC. The sample
      size was determined by the expected incidence of grade 4 toxicity of the combination
      treatment versus radiotherapy alone for locally advanced HCC. Since the grade 4 toxicity of
      radiotherapy alone is 7-9%, we need at least 15 patients to evaluate for feasibility of the
      combination treatment. With an estimated drop out rate of approximately 10%, 17 patients will
      be enrolled.
