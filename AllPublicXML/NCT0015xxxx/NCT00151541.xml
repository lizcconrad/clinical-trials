      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of 5% Dapsone Topical Gel,
      (DTG) twice daily in combination with once daily vehicle control, adapalene gel 0.1% or
      benzoyl peroxide gel 4%. The second objective of the study is to determine dapsone exposure
      after co-administration of DTG 5% with vehicle control, adapalene or benzoyl peroxide gel.

      This is a 3 arm, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study comparing safety and
      efficacy of DTG 5% twice daily plus vehicle control once daily vs. DTG 5% twice daily plus
      adapalene gel 0.1% once daily vs. DTG 5% twice daily plus 4% benzoyl peroxide gel once daily
      in subjects with acne vulgaris. Approximately 300 male and female subjects, 12 years of age
      and older, with acne vulgaris and &gt; 20 inflammatory lesions (papules and/or pustules) and &gt;
      20 non-inflammatory lesions (comedones) above the mandibular line at Baseline will be
      enrolled. Follow-up visits will occur at Week 2, 4, 8 and 12. Global Acne Assessments, Lesion
      Counts and Local Adverse Reaction Assessments will be conducted at each visit. A physical
      exam will be done at Baseline and Week 12. Plasma Dapsone Level samples will be drawn at
      Baseline, Week 2 and Week 12/ET for dapsone plasma level assessments. Adverse events and
      concomitant medications will be assessed throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Study subjects will be considered for participation based upon medical history and findings
        from the pre-study interview and examination. They will be enrolled according to the
        following conditions:

          1. Each subject or parent/guardian will read and sign the informed assent and/or consent
             form as required by IRB regulations. If a subject should require someone to read
             and/or interpret any or all of the informed consent, a statement of this fact will be
             documented. If a subject is unable to read or if a legally acceptable representative
             is unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed
             consent discussion to ensure accurate representation of the informed consent document
             is given verbally. If a subject does not understand English, a validated translated
             informed consent agreement will be provided. If the subject is a minor, the signature
             of their parent or guardian will be required per Institutional Review Board
             regulations.

          2. Male and female subjects, 12 years of age and older.

          3. A female subject of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or nursing. All female
             subjects must be practicing an effective method of birth control as determined by the
             Investigator. Any female who is not sexually active must agree to begin using an
             effective method of birth control, excluding hormonal birth control, if she becomes
             sexually active during the study.

             A female subject using hormonal birth control must have been on a stable dose for 3
             months prior to Baseline.

             Note: A surgically sterilized partner is not an acceptable method of birth control.

          4. A urine pregnancy test will be required of all female subjects, 60 years of age and
             younger prior to treatment. If the subject can provide documentation of surgical
             sterilization, at the baseline visit, a pregnancy test is not required.

             Negative test results must be obtained prior to randomization.

          5. Subjects must be in good physical and mental health.

          6. The subject must be willing to avoid swimming and bathing for 2 hours following test
             article application. Additionally, the subject must be willing to avoid moisturizers,
             sunscreens and cosmetics for 1 hour following test article application.

          7. The subject must score &gt; 2 on the Global Acne Assessment Score at Baseline (Appendix
             D).

          8. Subjects must have a clear diagnosis of acne vulgaris of the face, and have a minimum
             of 20 inflammatory lesions (pustules and papules) and 20 non-inflammatory lesions
             (comedones) above the mandibular line at Baseline. If, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, the subject's acne should be treated with a systemic acne medication,
             they should not be enrolled in the study.

          9. Subjects must be willing to undergo blood draws throughout the study.

         10. The subject must be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

        MEDICATIONS EXCLUDED IN THE ADMISSION CRITERIA WILL NOT BE PERMITTED DURING THE STUDY.

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry:

          1. Subjects using systemic immunosuppressive medications within 28 days prior to Baseline
             and throughout the study. Intranasal and/or inhaled corticosteriods are acceptable
             throughout the study if at a stable and standard dose, as labeled within the Package
             Insert.

          2. Subjects who are using topical agents for acne (including and not limited to benzoyl
             peroxide, antibiotics, topical vitamin A derivates such as retinol or retinoids,
             medicated cosmetics, cleansers) within 14 days prior to Baseline and throughout the
             study. This includes over the counter medications and cleansers that contain acne
             treatment ingredients, e.g. benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid.

          3. Subjects who have received light therapies (ultraviolet B, tanning bed, lasers,
             photodynamic treatment), systemic medications, or skin treatments known to affect acne
             or inflammatory responses within the 28 days prior to Baseline and throughout the
             study. This includes but is not limited to: antibiotics, large doses (&gt;50,000 U/day)
             of vitamin A, hormones (excluding those used for birth control), spironolactone,
             aldactone, aldactizide, cyproterone acetate, NSAIDS and chemical exfoliative
             treatments (alpha-hydroxy acid or &quot;fruit-wash,&quot; &quot;lunchtime&quot; or phenol peels) or
             physical peels (laser, &quot;dry ice&quot; peels). Short-term treatment with antibiotics and
             NSAIDS during the study for non-acne related conditions is acceptable provided that
             exposure is limited to 14 days per course for antibiotics and 7 days per month for
             NSAIDS.

          4. Subjects who have received isotretinoin (Accutane) within the three months prior to
             Baseline and throughout the study.

          5. Subjects that have participated in any previous QLT USA, Inc. (formerly Atrix
             Laboratories, Inc.) dapsone topical gel studies.

          6. Subjects who have any medical condition which, in the Investigator's judgment, makes
             the subject an inappropriate study candidate.

          7. Subjects who have any condition that would hinder accurate facial acne evaluations
             including excessive facial hair (beard), excessive scarring, sunburn or other
             disfigurement.

          8. Subjects with severe cystic acne or acne conglobata.

          9. Subjects with any active or developing nodules above the mandibular line at Baseline.

         10. Subjects with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to dapsone, adapalene, benzoyl
             peroxide, or any component of the study products.

         11. Subjects taking another investigational test article within the 30 days prior to
             Baseline or throughout the study.

         12. Female subjects having started a new, or having changed their current hormonal
             contraceptive or hormone replacement therapy within three months prior to Baseline.
             Subjects receiving Depo Provera® injections in preceding 4 months are excluded from
