      To show the feasibility of liver transplantation in HCV-HIV coinfected patients. To study the
      two-year survival after transplantation, the interaction between HCV and HIV after
      transplantation, the influence of HIV on HCV recurrence after transplantation, the
      interaction between immunosuppressive and antiretroviral drugs in particular anti-proteases,
      immunological follow-up and quality of life of these patients

    <textblock>
      Until recently, HIV infection was considered as a contraindication for liver transplantation.
      A dramatic improvement in survival of HIV patients have been observed since the advent of new
      antiviral treatments against HIV including antiproteases. However an important proportion of
      patients with HCV-HIV coinfection are suffering from life-threatening liver disease due to
      HCV infection. Liver transplantation may be considered in this particular group of patients.

      The ideal timing for the indication of liver transplantation during HIV disease and during
      the course of HCV liver disease needs to be defined. Liver transplantation in this particular
      group of patients raised several questions : a) the role of HIV infection on prevalence and
      severity of HCV recurrence after transplantation ; b) the role of liver transplantation and
      immunosuppression on HIV disease ; c) drug interactions between immunosuppressive agents and
      antiproteases ; d) immunological follow-up and quality of life of these patients.
