  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although LAAM, a derivative of methadone, has been successfully used as an alternative to
      methadone maintenance in opioid addicts, its effect on concurrent opioid and cocaine abuse
      has not been ascertained. Thus, this study proposes to examine the clinical efficacy of low-
      and high-dose LAAM maintenance on opioid and cocaine use in opioid-dependent cocaine abusers.
      In addition, since contingency management procedures have demonstrated some success in
      decreasing cocaine use in cocaine-abusing individuals, this study also proposes to examine
      the clinical efficacy of the presence or absence of contingency management procedures
      targeting illicit drug use.

      One hundred forty male and female opioid-dependent cocaine abusers will be stratified by sex
      and randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups according to a 2 x 2 experimental
      design: low-dose LAAM (99 mg/wk) with adjunct contingency management procedures; low-dose
      LAAM (99 mg/wk) without adjunct contingency management procedures; high-dose LAAM (330 mg/wk)
      with adjunct contingency management procedures; and high-dose LAAM (330 mg/wk) without
      adjunct contingency management procedures. The duration of the study will be 24 weeks, with
      LAAM being administered on a thrice-weekly (MWF) basis.

      Subjects are inducted onto LAAM during weeks 1-3 and then maintained on their assigned
      maintenance dose (99 mg/wk or 330 mg/wk) through week 24. During maintenance, the Friday dose
      will be 1.3 times greater than the Monday and Wednesday dose. At the conclusion of the study,
      subjects undergo detoxification from LAAM over a 4-week period. For those in the contingency
      management procedure group, each drug-free urine submitted will result in a voucher worth a
      certain monetary value that increases for consecutively drug-free urines (weeks 1-12) or a
      monetary voucher with a fixed value (weeks 13-24). Subjects not assigned to the contingency
      management procedure will receive monetary vouchers (weeks 1-24) according to a yoked-control
      schedule (that is, not contingent upon illicit drug abstinence). Vouchers can be exchanged
      for mutually agreed upon goods and services at any time during the study. Outcome measures
      will include: 1) treatment retention, 2) illicit drug use, 3) self-reported adverse and
      opioid withdrawal symptoms, and 4) psychosocial functioning. Follow-up interviews at nine
      months and/or one year post-study entry will be conducted to determine status post-treatment.
      Prognostic factors (i.e., sex, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression), will also be
      examined in relation to treatment outcome and post-treatment status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One hundred forty male and female cocaine-abusing, opioid-dependent individuals
             between the ages 21-55, with at least 40% women and 40% Afro-Americans, who not be
             currently enrolled in treatment, will be entered into the study. Subjects must have
             current opioid dependence as evidenced by documentation of prior treatment for opioid
             dependence or signs of withdrawal upon administration of naloxone (0.8 mg, i.m.), and
             opioid-positive urine screen. Subjects also must be current users of cocaine with
             self-reported use of &gt; 12 gms during the preceding 12 months, self-reported use of &gt; 1
             gm/week in the month preceding study entry, and cocaine-positive urine screen.
             Subjects must fulfill DSM-III-R criteria for opioid and cocaine dependence. These
             criteria will be ascertained using the substance abuse section of the SCID interview
             developed for use with DSM-III-R

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Criteria for exclusion include current diagnosis of other drug or alcohol dependence
             (other than opiates, cocaine or tobacco); ill health (e.g., major cardiovascular,
             renal, endocrine, hepatic disorder); respiratory condition (e.g., asthma); history of
             major psychiatric disorder (psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression);
             current suicidality; LFT's (i.e., liver enzymes) greater than 3 times normal levels;
             and pregnancy.
