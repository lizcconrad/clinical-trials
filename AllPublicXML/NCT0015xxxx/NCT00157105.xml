        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;= 5 years

          -  The subject has severe or moderately severe hemophilia A defined by a baseline factor
             VIII level &lt;= 2% of normal documented at screening or historically (e.g., at
             hemophilia diagnosis)

          -  Subjects may enroll regardless of their serologic status for human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)

          -  The subject requires a surgical, dental or other invasive procedure--either elective
             or emergency

          -  The subject has a history of at least 150 exposure days for all other factor VIII
             products (as estimated by the study site investigator) prior to study entry

          -  The subject has a life expectancy of at least 28 days from the day of surgery

          -  The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agreed to its provisions,
             and signed and dated the informed consent form approved by the appropriate IRB/IEC and
             Baxter BioScience

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a detectable inhibitor to factor VIII in the local hemostasis
             laboratory at the investigative site at the time of enrollment

          -  The subject has a history of inhibitor to factor VIII &gt; 1.0 BU. Note: If the subject
             has a history of an inhibitor titer &gt; 1.0 BU at any time prior to enrollment but
             demonstrated expected clinical responses to conventional doses of factor VIII therapy,
             the subject may enroll

          -  The subject has known hypersensitivity to Recombinate

          -  The subject is currently participating in another investigational drug study, or has
             participated in any clinical trial involving an investigational drug within 30 days of
             study entry

          -  The subject has clinical and/or laboratory evidence of abnormal hemostasis from causes
             other than hemophilia A (e.g., late-stage chronic liver disease, immune
             thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation)

          -  The subject is identified by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to
             cooperate with study procedures.
