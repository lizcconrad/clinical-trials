  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hib disease rates in rural Alaska before introduction of HIb conjugate vaccine were among the
      highest in the world. Since vaccine introduction, rates have fallen by 90% but the disease
      has not been eliminated. This study is designed to test one possible means of eliminating Hib
      carriage and thus to eliminate person to person transmission and invasive disease.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of community-wide use of Hib
      conjugate vaccine for eliminating oropharyngeal Hib carriage in rural Alaska villages.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  Determine risk factors for Hib OP carriage including demographic characteristics, and
           immunologic characteristics (antibody level and function). This will be accomplished
           through a case-control study described below.

        -  Measure antibody response to Hib conjugate vaccine among adults who have not previously
           received Hib vaccine. This will be accomplished through a cohort study of participating
           adults in the vaccine intervention communities.

      This was a pilot intervention to assess the feasibility of using Hib conjugate vaccine to
      eliminate Hib carriage in rural Alaska villages, with three villages to serve as a comparison
      group. WE performed community-wide surveys of Hib carriage by recruiting volunteers for
      throat cultures to establish a baseline rate of Hib carriage for each community. Then Hib
      carriers were offered chemoprophylaxis to clear Hib from their throats. In the vaccine
      intervention communities, a single dose of Hib conjugate vaccine was offered to persons of
      all ages. This was followed by a second community-wide Hib carriage survey after one year to
      assess the effectiveness of the intervention.
