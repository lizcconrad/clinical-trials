  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if different reinforcement procedures (i.e.,
      schedules) produce different patterns of long-term abstinence from methamphetamine. We
      anticipate that the three contingency management conditions will promote longer periods of
      abstinence in the year following treatment relative to the standard control group.
      Furthermore, we predict that the intermittent reinforcement procedures will produce longer
      periods of continued abstinence (i.e., long-term behavior change) in the year following
      treatment than the continuous reinforcement procedure. Finally, we predict that the
      intermittent unpredictable schedule will produce longer lasting behavior change than the
      intermittent predictable schedule. Methamphetamine use will be measured using urine
      toxicology and self-report of methamphetamine use.

      Briefly the four study conditions are: (1) standard treatment which consists of 16 weeks of
      psychosocial treatment, (2) continuous contingency management which consists of 16 weeks of
      psychosocial treatment with a contingency management procedure in effect during the first
      twelve weeks in which vouchers are made available after each provision of a
      methamphetamine-negative urine test, (3) intermittent predictable contingency management
      which consists of 16 weeks of psychosocial treatment with a contingency management procedure
      in effect during the first twelve weeks in which vouchers are available after the provision
      of every three consecutive methamphetamine-negative urine samples, and (4) intermittent
      unpredictable contingency management which consists of 16 weeks of psychosocial treatment
      with a contingency management procedure in effect during the first twelve weeks in which
      vouchers are available on one day each week (randomly selected after the first week) for the
      provision of methamphetamine-negative urine samples provided all urine samples since delivery
      of the last reinforcer were also methamphetamine negative.

    <description>Those in the continuous condition will receive a contingency management voucher each time they test negative for methamphetamine. The initial voucher value will be $2.50. Each consecutive instance of abstinence will increase the magnitude of the voucher by $1.50. Three consecutive abstinences will result in the delivery of a $10.00 bonus. Provision of a methamphetamine-positive urine sample, or failure to test, will result in a reset in the voucher magnitude back to its original level from whence the progression can begin again. All participants will provide observed urine samples three times a week (e.g., M, W, &amp; F) for twelve weeks and will complete study-related measures one time per week.</description>

There are no bonuses for consecutive instances of abstinence in the intermittent predictable condition. Provision of a methamphetamine-positive urine sample, or failure to test, will result in a reset in the voucher magnitude back to its original level from whence the progression can begin again.

They will then be eligible to receive a voucher one day a week if all of their urine tests since the receipt of their last voucher were methamphetamine negative. They will receive a voucher for $35.50 for the provision of their second set of 3 consecutive instances of methamphetamine-negative urine samples, $49.00 for their third set of 3 consecutive instances, and so forth. The day of the week on which the voucher will be available will be randomly selected for each week and the participants will not know which day of the week they will be eligible to receive a voucher until they have provided their urine test.

Participants in the intermittent predictable condition will receive $22.00 for the provision of their first three consecutive methamphetamine-negative urine samples, $35.50 for the provision of their second set of three consecutive instances of methamphetamine-negative urine samples, and so forth. There are no bonuses for consecutive instances of abstinence in the intermittent predictable condition. Provision of a methamphetamine-positive urine sample, or failure to test, will result in a reset in the voucher magnitude back to its original level from whence the progression can begin again.

            <description>Those in the intermittent predictable condition will earn a voucher when they provide three consecutive methamphetamine-negative urine tests. Participants in the intermittent predictable condition will receive $22.00 for the provision of their first three consecutive methamphetamine-negative urine samples, $35.50 for the provision of their second set of three consecutive instances of methamphetamine-negative urine samples, and so forth. There are no bonuses for consecutive instances of abstinence in the intermittent predictable condition. Provision of a methamphetamine-positive urine sample, or failure to test, will result in a reset in the voucher magnitude back to its original level from whence the progression can begin again.
