             participated in another Gilead-sponsored study, the CRO or Sponsor's Medical Monitor
             will evaluate for participation in this study on a case by case basis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness that would interfere with patient
             treatment, assessment or compliance with the protocol or dosing requirements.

             B, vancomycin, cidofovir, foscarnet, cisplatin, or pentamidine OR competitors of renal
             excretion such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone. These agents must be discontinued at
             least 7 days prior to starting treatment with adefovir dipivoxil.

          -  Currently receiving investigational agents with activity against hepatitis B virus.
