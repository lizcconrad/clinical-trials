  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The retinal vasculature is morphologically and functionally related to the cerebral vessels
      due to its common origin from the internal carotid artery. A recent study demonstrated that
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the retinal vasculature is impaired in patients with
      essential hypertension, which is a strong risk factor for stroke. Furthermore, AT1-receptor
      blockade was demonstrated to improve retinal endothelium-dependent vasodilation in these
      hypertensive patients. Hypercholesterolemia is also a risk factor for ischemic stroke and
      impairment of endothelial function has been observed in various vascular beds in
      hypercholesterolemic patients, including the coronary and the forearm vasculature. Whether
      endothelial function of the retinal vasculature is impaired in patients with
      hypercholesterolemia has not yet been investigated. In patients with stroke, AT1-receptor
      blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition have beneficial effects on clinical
      outcome. Alterations of endothelial function of the cerebral vasculature might be one
      pathogenetic factor for the beneficial clinical outcome. To further address this issue, the
      present study was designed to test the hypothesis that endothelium-dependent vasodilation of
      the retinal vasculature is impaired in hypercholesterolemic patients and that endothelial
      function can be improved by AT1-receptor blockade.
