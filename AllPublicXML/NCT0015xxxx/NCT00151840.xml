    <textblock>
      Sanquin has developed, in cooperation with the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service
      (FRCBTS), a liquid intravenous immunoglobulin product, IVIG-L. The liquid formulation of
      intravenous immunoglobulin simplifies infusion, eliminates possible mistakes in the
      reconstitution with water for injection and reduces space requirements in storage.

      In addition to donor selection and screening, several procedures have been included in the
      production process to improve viral safety.

      In this clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of IVIG-L in patients with ITP will be
      assessed and compared with data obtained from literature. IVIG-L will also be studied in
      patients with hypogammaglobulinemia.The results from both studies will be used for an
      application for marketing authorisation of IVIG-L in Finland and the Netherlands.
