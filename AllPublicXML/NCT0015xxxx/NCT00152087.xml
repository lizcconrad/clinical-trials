  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection of the affected liver offers the best chance for disease-free survival in
      patients with Hepatoma (HCC). Unfortunately, most hepatoma patients present with disease
      which is multi-focal and thus not resectable. Fewer than 15% of HCC patients are resectable.
      The objective of treatment with TheraSphere is to selectively administer a dose of
      radioactive material directly to neoplastic tissue in the liver. Systemic therapy is largely
      ineffective.

      Protocol Objectives include:

        -  Determine the proportion of patients with HCC in whom the treatment plan can be
           completed

        -  Evaluate the response to therapy

        -  Evaluate toxicities and adverse experiences associated with TheraSphere treatment

        -  Evaluate survival time
