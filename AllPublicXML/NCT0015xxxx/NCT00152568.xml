      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of checking car seats during
      pediatric well-child visits on the use and properness of use of car seats for children 0-8
      years. We are following up with families when they return for the next pediatric check up to
      see if they are appropriately using car seats for their children.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of a car seat inspection
      at the time of a pediatric visit on the proper use of car seats 4-6 months later.

      Motor vehicle-related injury is the leading cause of death of children. Proper restraint in a
      motor vehicle reduces the risk of fatality in a crash by approximately 70%. However, multiple
      studies have found approximately 85% of car seats are misused. Urban poor and minority
      populations have been found to have higher child passenger death rates, and may have lower
      car seat usage rates than the rest of the population. Child passenger safety (CPS)
      technicians trained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and
      certified by the American Automobile Association (AAA) capably check proper car seat usage in
      &quot;check up&quot; events, and operate recently established &quot;fitting stations.&quot; However, we are not
      aware of an attempt to provide the CPS technical services to families attending a routine
      checkup with their medical provider.

      This project will involve implementing and evaluating a program providing car seat checks at
      the time of routine pediatric visits at the Friend Family Health Center (FFHC). To determine
      if the car seat checks improve proper car seat use, children who receive the intervention
      will have their car seat use reassessed at the time of a scheduled return visit to their
      medical provider. The frequency of routinely scheduled health maintenance visits is greatest
      for the youngest children. Opportunities to collect follow up car seat use data therefore
      will be greatest for the youngest children. This evaluation will focus on 0 year olds. While
      we will also assess the older children and booster seat use, the sample size calculation for
      this study was determined for these younger children.
