      This feasibility clinical investigation is designed to demonstrate that the NeuroPace
      external Responsive Neurostimulator (model eRNS-300) can safely deliver responsive electrical
      stimulation automatically to affect epileptiform activity. The eRNS-300 is based on an
      implantable neurostimulator that has been adapted for acute, external use in a hospital
      setting.

      The Automated Response to Spontaneous Epileptiform Activity using the External Responsive
      Neurostimulator (eRNS) system clinical investigation involves subjects who are undergoing
      intracranial monitoring for the evaluation of epilepsy surgery and who are being monitored in
      the hospital's epilepsy monitoring unit. During the subject's participation, at the
      discretion of the investigator, the subject will be connected to the eRNS. The eRNS is an
      investigational device that attaches to standard intracranial electrode monitoring equipment
      to monitor the subject's seizure activity. It is anticipated that the subject may be
      connected to the eRNS for a period of time extending from one day to a few weeks. After the
      subject has enough seizures to complete their evaluation for epilepsy surgery, the physician
      may enable the responsive stimulation settings for the eRNS. The subject's participation in
      the clinical investigation will be complete prior to the removal of their intracranial
      electrodes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery in a manner consistent with the
             Surgery for Epilepsy, NIH Consensus Statement, 1990 Mar 19-21; 8(2); 1-20.

          -  Subject is implanted with intracranial electrodes.

          -  Subject is under constant medical supervision while implanted with the intracranial
             electrodes.

          -  Subject is twelve (12) years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is pregnant.

          -  Subject has a clinically significant or unstable medical condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would make it inadvisable for the individual to
             participate.

          -  Subject has a progressive central nervous system disease or serious acute or ongoing
             systemic illnesses.

          -  Subject has an active psychosis, severe depression, suicidal ideation or psychiatric
             conditions associated with impaired judgment.

          -  Subject is considered at high risk, for any reason, by any of the investigators.

          -  Subject is implanted with a medical device that might interfere with the eRNS. (This
             includes, but is not limited to direct brain neurostimulators, pacemakers, implantable
             cardiac defibrillators, spinal cord stimulators, vagal nerve stimulators, cochlear
             implants)
