  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of adding Botox injection to serial
      manipulations and castings in patients with clubfoot. The study hypothesis was that the use
      of Botox in the setting of serial manipulations and castings is an effective treatment for
      clubfoot.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients meeting the inclusion criteria will undergo manipulation and casting until
      hindfoot stall is encountered. Hindfoot stall is defined as forefoot abduction to 60 degrees
      but persistence of hindfoot equinus. At hindfoot stall, subjects received Botox injections at
      10 IU/kg into the gastrosoleus muscle complex. Following injections, subjects were recasted.
