      The aim of the study is to investigate whether intravenous infusion of pantoprazole
      (Pantoloc) is effective in preventing recurrent bleeding in patients who present with acute
      ulcer bleeding and continue to use aspirin

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin is an effective treatment for acute stroke and heart attack. However, aspirin also
      induces ulcer and provokes acute ulcer bleeding. Thus, aspirin is often withheld in acute
      ulcer bleeding but this precipitate recurrent stroke or heart attack. We previously showed
      that intravenous infusion of a potent acid suppressant substantially reduced the incidence of
      recurrent ulcer bleeding in patients who withheld aspirin. The aim of this study is to
      investigate whether intravenous infusion of an acid suppressant (Pantoprazole) is effective
      in preventing recurrent ulcer bleeding with continuous use of aspirin.
