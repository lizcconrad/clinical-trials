    <textblock>
      No medical therapy is currently available for the long-term treatment of abnormal uterine
      bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in women and many women must resort to surgery for
      relief. The objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety of two asoprisnil
      doses (10 and 25 mg tablets) administered daily to women who received asoprisnil in one of
      the asoprisnil long-term studies (study C03-062 or study M01-391). The safety endpoints for
      this study will include the affects of asoprisnil on the endometrium, ovaries, bone (a subset
      of study M01-391 subjects), lipid profiles, adverse events, and changes from baseline lab
      values and vital signs.

      Some subjects receiving asoprisnil developed endometrial changes. As a result, dosing was
      prematurely discontinued for all subjects. To ensure safety, subjects will remain on study
      and will undergo scheduled study procedures. In most subjects, endometrial changes reversed
      after asoprisnil discontinuation.
