  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alpha thalassemia causes mild anemia and is found in many ethnic groups. Usually it is found
      in regions where malaria is endemic. We have found that alpha thalassemia is common in
      Ashkenazim, whose countries of origin are in temperate climates.

      We are analyzing the alpha globin genes of individuals of many ethnic groups and will compare
      to try to define the origin of thalassemia in these individuals of European extraction.
