  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of VAST is to determine whether the Rate Smoothing feature in Guidant’s
      PRIZM/VITALITY-family ICDs has an effect on the incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who receive a commercially available Guidant PRIZM, PRIZM 2, or VITALITY AVT
             ICD

          -  Patients who sign and date a Patient Informed Consent prior to study enrollment

          -  Patients who remain in the clinical care of physicians of their implanting center

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have chronic atrial fibrillation. Paroxysms of AF are not an exclusion
             criterion, but the patient must be in normal sinus rhythm at the time of
             randomization. If history of AF is unknown or uncertain, or the patient was recently
             cardioverted, there must be at least 23 hours of normal sinus rhythm within the 24
             hour period preceding randomization

          -  Patients who previously had an ICD

          -  Patients with current indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy with
             defibrillation (CRT-D)

          -  Patients whose life expectancy is less than 12 months due to other medical conditions

          -  Patients who are expected to receive a heart transplant during the duration of the
             study

          -  Patients who have or who are likely to receive a tricuspid or other valve prosthesis

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study of active medical
             therapy. Each instance should be brought to Guidant’s Clinical Application Research
             Studies (CARS) group to determine eligibility

          -  Patients who are younger than 18 years of age

          -  Patients who are mentally incompetent and cannot give a Patient Informed Consent or
             participate in the study
