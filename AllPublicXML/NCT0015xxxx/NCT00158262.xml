    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of taking propranolol soon after a traumatizing
      incident in reducing the incidence and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder in acutely
      traumatized individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can occur following
      exposure to a traumatic event in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. PTSD
      is marked by clear biological changes as well as psychological symptoms. Many people with
      PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in the form of flashback episodes, memories, nightmares, or
      frightening thoughts. This study will assess the effect of post-trauma propranolol on
      reducing the incidence and severity of PTSD. The study will also evaluate propranolol's
      effectiveness as a preventive measure against subsequent PTSD symptoms.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be recruited upon admission to the Massachusetts
      General Hospital Emergency Department after exposure to a psychologically traumatic event.
      Baseline psychometric and psychobiologic measurements will be collected. Within 6 hours
      following the traumatic event, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either 40 mg
      of short-acting propranolol or placebo and 60 mg of either long-acting propranolol or
      placebo. For the next 10 days, participants will receive 120 mg of either long-acting
      propranolol or placebo twice daily. A 9-day medication tapering will follow. Participants
      will undergo psychophysiologic, psychodiagnostic, and psychometric testing for PTSD 1 and 3
      months following the traumatic event.

    <measure>Physiological Posterior Probability of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as Determined From Psychophysiologic Responses During Script-Driven Mental Imagery at Month 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The posterior probability of developing PTSD was determined for each participant from a composite of psychophysiological responses during script-driven mental imagery of traumatic events (two exemplars) that included assessments of heart rate response in beats per minute, skin conductance response in microSiemens, and corrugator and left lateral frontalis facial muscle electromyogram (EMG) responses in microVolts. Responses for the two traumatic scripts were averaged and square-root transformed for analysis. Responses during personal traumatic imagery of previously studied individuals with and without current PTSD were used to calculate each participant's posterior probability of being classified as PTSD.</description>

    <description>The clinician evaluated the overall frequency and intensity/severity of the participant's PTSD symptoms using the CAPS. 17 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) PTSD symptoms were assessed using a 5-point scale for intensity where 0=none to 4=extreme and a 5-point scale for frequency where 0=never to 4=most or all of the time. The intensity score and the frequency scores were added together for a total possible score of 0 (best) to 136 (worst).</description>

        <title>Physiological Posterior Probability of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as Determined From Psychophysiologic Responses During Script-Driven Mental Imagery at Month 1</title>
        <description>The posterior probability of developing PTSD was determined for each participant from a composite of psychophysiological responses during script-driven mental imagery of traumatic events (two exemplars) that included assessments of heart rate response in beats per minute, skin conductance response in microSiemens, and corrugator and left lateral frontalis facial muscle electromyogram (EMG) responses in microVolts. Responses for the two traumatic scripts were averaged and square-root transformed for analysis. Responses during personal traumatic imagery of previously studied individuals with and without current PTSD were used to calculate each participant’s posterior probability of being classified as PTSD.</description>
