      The investigators will recruit a cross-sectional group of diabetic women in internist
      clinics. UDS will be applied for voiding function in each case. Intravesical electrical
      stimulation will be used to test CPT per 5 Hz, 250 Hz, 2000 Hz for the patients. The
      differences of intravesical CPT between diabetic women with and without voiding dysfunction
      will be determined.

      Diabetes is a common metabolic disease of multiorgan involvement. The American Diabetes
      Association reported that the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM)
      in the United States is currently 6% and rising. The increase is secondary to a rising
      incident in obesity, as well as a change in the criteria for the diagnosis of DM from a
      fasting blood glucose 140 mg/dl to 126 mg/dl. Besides impaired blood glucose regulation, many
      direct and indirect sequelae of DM can occur. Triopathy of diabetes including retinopathy,
      neuropathy, and nephropathy are familiar to every internist. Lower urinary tract dysfunction
      is one of the most common complications in this group of patients.

      We look at the difference of intravesical sensation in diabetic women by current perception
      test; then, we can find the patient with diabetic cystopathy in early stage. We compare the
      groups of diabetic women with or without voiding dysfunction by urodynamic study. CPT test
      for intravesical sensation will be applied.
