    <textblock>
      This is a web-based pilot study to evaluate the association between the treatment of anemia
      with darbepoetin alfa (aranesp) and the clinical benefits in symptom palliation, improved
      functional status and quality of life in patients with cancer. The feasibility of web-based
      assessments and data capture will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia associated with lung cancer and chemotherapy is an important factor effecting patient
      symptoms, functional status, and overall quality of life (Groopman and Itri 1999; Langer,
      Choy et al. 2002). Darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp®) has demonstrated a significant effect upon
      ameliorating chemotherapy-induced anemia in lung cancer (Vansteenkiste, Pirker et al. 2002;
      Vansteenkiste, Poulsen et al. 2002). This trial is designed to evaluate the association
      between the treatment of anemia with darbepoetin alfa and direct electronic capture of
      clinical benefits in cancer-related symptoms, functional status and overall quality of life.
      This trial uses a secure web-based design to capture the patient-associated symptoms,
      functional status and quality of life. This novel secure web-based system was selected to
      improve the efficiency and quality of clinical data capture. If our hypothesis is correct,
      treatment with darbepoetin alfa will be associated with improved palliation of cancer-related
      symptoms, improved functional status, and result in overall benefits to the patient's
      health-related quality of life. The development of a web-based system to directly capture
      patient-related symptoms, functional status and quality of life will permit us in the future
      to conduct a national or international trial addressing the effects of darbepoetin alfa on
      these factors. If our hypothesis is incorrect, it may be that these parameters are not
      affected by the correction of anemia with darbepoetin alfa or the measures are not sensitive
      enough to detect these differences. A notable finding would be a clearly defined improvement
      in symptom palliation, functional status, and quality of life associated with darbepoetin
      alfa therapy.

    <description>The allocation to the treatment arms will be dependent on the schedule of chemotherapy (i.e. weekly, every 2 week, or every 4 week chemotherapy schedules will receive a starting dose of 200 mcg darbepoetin alfa and every 3 week chemotherapy schedule will receive a starting dose of 300 mcg). Non-responders are defined as patients who experience &lt;1.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin concentrations after 6 weeks. Darbepoetin alfa will be held for hemoglobin concentrations &gt;13.0 g/dL.</description>
