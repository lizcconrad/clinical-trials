  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma represents today 3% of the solid tumors of the adult. Their bad
      prognosis is due to the frequency of metastasis and the resistance to chemotherapy.
      Immunotherapy (interferon-α, interleukin-2) has shown some good results but an important
      toxicity. In our study, we evaluate the response to a new therapeutic strategy which combines
      an injection of patient's own activated lymphocytes to a classic immunotherapy with
      interferon-α and interleukin-2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I and II trials for the treatment of melanoma or renal cell carcinoma have already
      evaluated lymphokine-activated killer cells and tumor-infiltrating cells. In metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma, these therapies have shown some complete responses and a low toxicity. In our
      study, we evaluate the response to a new therapeutic strategy which combines an injection of
      patient's own activated lymphocytes to a classic immunotherapy with interferon-α and
      interleukin-2. A secondary objective is to improve cell preparation methods and to
      characterize functionally and phenotypically injected cells.
