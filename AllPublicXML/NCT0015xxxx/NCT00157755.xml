  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of gastric stimulation in the
      reduction of nausea and vomiting in patients with gastroparesis using an approved
      Humanitarian device. There are two cohorts in this study based on etiology, one for diabetic
      and one for idiopathic.

      A maximum of 150 patients (75 diabetic and 75 idiopathic) from up to 15 centers in the United
      States will be followed closely for twelve months and then once a year after that until the
      study closes.

      If you are someone suffering with symptoms of gastroparesis despite trying oral medications,
      you may be eligible to participate in a clinical study using a surgically implanted gastric
      stimulator.

    <measure>Percent Reduction in Frequency of Weekly Vomiting Episodes When the Device is Turned ON, Relative to When the Device is Turned OFF</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 months and 7.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Diaries were used to record daily vomiting episodes for 28 days prior to each office follow-up visit. The weekly vomiting frequency (WVF) was based on the average number of weekly vomiting episodes recorded in the patient diary. The percent reduction is calculated as ((WVF during OFF - WVF during ON)/ (WVF during OFF))*100%. A positive reduction represents an improvement in WVF when the device was ON.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Reduction in Symptom Score When the Device is Turned ON, Relative to When the Device is Turned OFF</measure>
    <time_frame>4.5 months and 7.5 months</time_frame>
    <description>A symptom interview was conducted at each visit to assess vomiting, nausea, early satiety, bloating, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain and epigastric burning. The scale for each symptom ranges from 0 to 4, with 0 being absence of symptoms and 4 being extremely frequent (≥ 7 episodes per week). Total symptom score (TSS) is the sum of the individual frequency symptom scores. The percent reduction is calculated as ((TSS during OFF - TSS during ON)/ (TSS during OFF))*100%. A positive reduction represents an improvement in TSS when the device was ON.</description>

    <description>Diaries were used to record daily vomiting episodes for 28 days prior to each office follow-up visit. The weekly vomiting frequency (WVF) was based on the average number of weekly vomiting episodes recorded in the patient diary. The percent reduction is calculated as ((WVF at baseline - WVF at 12 months)/ (WVF at baseline))*100%. A positive reduction represents an improvement in WVF at 12 months.</description>

             symptoms of nausea and vomiting) medications for a minimum of one month, unless you're
             unable to take these types of medications

          -  Have symptoms of gastroparesis that have required treatment for at least one year

          -  Life expectancy less than one year

          -  Have other implantable devices such as pacemakers

          -  Pregnancy or planned pregnancy

        <description>A symptom interview was conducted at each visit to assess vomiting, nausea, early satiety, bloating, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain and epigastric burning. The scale for each symptom ranges from 0 to 4, with 0 being absence of symptoms and 4 being extremely frequent (≥ 7 episodes per week). Total symptom score (TSS) is the sum of the individual frequency symptom scores. The percent reduction is calculated as ((TSS during OFF - TSS during ON)/ (TSS during OFF))*100%. A positive reduction represents an improvement in TSS when the device was ON.</description>

        <description>A symptom interview was conducted at each visit to assess vomiting, nausea, early satiety, bloating, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain and epigastric burning. The scale for each symptom ranges from 0 to 4, with 0 being absence of symptoms and 4 being extremely frequent (≥ 7 episodes per week). Total symptom score (TSS) is the sum of the individual frequency symptom scores. The change is calculated as TSS at baseline - TSS at 12 months. A positive change represents an improvement in TSS at 12 months.</description>

The raw score of 0 represents poor health and 100 represents best health. The physical component summary (PCS) score is a norm based score calculated from the raw scores of these 8 domains with a focus on physical health. The change in PCS is calculated as PCS at baseline - PCS at 12 months. A negative change in PCS represents an improvement in QOL.</description>

        <description>Gastric emptying was evaluated using a standardized scintigraphy method and a low fat egg substitute test meal. After standard meal and marker preparation, the subsequent images were taken at 2 hours and 4 hours and percentage of gastric retention was evaluated. Change in 2-hour GET is calculated as % of gastric retention at 2 hours at baseline - % of gastric retention at 2 hours at 12 months. A positive change represents an improvement in gastric emptying at 12 months.</description>

          <title>Change in Gastric Emptying Results at 12 Months Compared to Baseline (2 Hours)</title>
          <description>Gastric emptying was evaluated using a standardized scintigraphy method and a low fat egg substitute test meal. After standard meal and marker preparation, the subsequent images were taken at 2 hours and 4 hours and percentage of gastric retention was evaluated. Change in 2-hour GET is calculated as % of gastric retention at 2 hours at baseline - % of gastric retention at 2 hours at 12 months. A positive change represents an improvement in gastric emptying at 12 months.</description>
