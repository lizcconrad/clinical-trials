  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that injecting donor bone marrow cells into the recipient
      thymus gland at the time of heart transplantation in children will prove to be feasible and
      safe. They further hypothesize that recipients receiving donor bone marrow will experience
      less acute rejection events with reduced long-term requirements for immunosuppressive
      medications when compared to controls who do not receive marrow but who are managed under an
      identical immunosuppressive protocol.
