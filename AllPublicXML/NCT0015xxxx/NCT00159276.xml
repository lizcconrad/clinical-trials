  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate a possible mechanism of the GR defect in patients with severe COPD by studying
      the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on GR-GRE binding, expression of inflammatory and
      anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-8, MKP-1, GILZ, SLPI production in sputum cells
