      The aim of this study is to compare the incidence of cardiovascular events between two target
      systolic blood pressure levels, below 140 mmHg and below 150 mmHg under treatment with
      valsartan in elderly isolated systolic hypertensive patients in Japan.

      Although antihypertensive therapy has been proven to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality, it is unclear how much blood pressure should be decreased in elderly patients with
      hypertension. The Valsartan in Elderly Isolated Systolic Hypertension (VALISH) study is a
      multicenter parallel-group study comparing the incidence of cardiovascular events between two
      target systolic blood pressure levels, below 140 mmHg and below 150 mmHg, under treatment
      with valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, as an initial antihypertensive drug in
      elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. The number of patients to be recruited
      is 3,000 and the duration of follow-up is at least 2 years. This 3,000-patient trial was
      designed with a two-sided Î± level of 0.05 and 80% power to detect the difference in incidence
      of cardiovascular events between the target blood pressure levels based on estimation of the
      cardiovascular events ratio as 21.5/1,000 patient-years and 29.1/1,000 patient-years for the
      two blood pressure levels. The VALISH study, a large-scale investigator-initiated trial in
      Japan, will determine whether age should be considered in setting target blood pressure in
      treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients.
