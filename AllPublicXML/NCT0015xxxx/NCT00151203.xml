      PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of clarithromycin (Biaxin®), lenalidomide
           (Revlimid™), and dexamethasone (Decadron®) as an induction therapy for patients with
           newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).

        -  To evaluate the safety of the combination of clarithromycin, lenalidomide, and
           dexamethasone as an induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM.

      SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVES

        -  To examine the role of clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetic properties of dexamethasone
           and lenalidomide.

        -  To examine the angiogenesis profile in untreated patients and in patients receiving
           induction therapy.

    <description>Dexamethasone (Decadron®) will be given orally at a dose of 40 mg on days 1, 2, 3, 8, 15 and 22 during the first cycle and once a week on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for each subsequent cycle.
Clarithromycin (Biaxin®) will be given orally at a dose of 500 mg twice a day beginning on day 2 of cycle 1.
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) will be given orally at a dose of 25 mg daily beginning on day 3 and ending on day 21 of cycle 1 and on days 1-21 of subsequent cycles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must voluntarily sign and understand written informed consent.

          -  Histologically confirmed Durie-Salomon stage II or III MM (see Appendix II). Stage I
             MM patients will be eligible if they display poor prognostic factors (ß2M &gt; or = 5.5
             mg/L, plasma cell proliferation index &gt; or = 5%, albumin of less then 3.0, and
             unfavorable cytogenetics).

          -  Measurable disease as defined by &gt; 1.0 g/dL serum monoclonal protein, &gt;0.1 g/dL serum
             free light chains, &gt; 0.2 g/24 hrs urinary M-protein excretion, and/or measurable
             plasmacytoma(s).

          -  Age &gt; or = 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; or = 70% (&gt;60% if due to bony involvement of myeloma
             (see Appendix V).

          -  No prior treatment or less than one full course of first-line therapy. Patients may be
             receiving adjuvant antiresorptive therapy (i.e., pamidronate or zoledronic acid) as
             routine care.

          -  If the patient is a woman of childbearing age, she must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 7 days of starting study.

          -  Due to the unknown risk of teratogenic side effects, subjects (women and men) must
             agree to use effective contraception throughout the duration of the study and for at
             least 1 month after discontinuation of study drugs.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt; or = 1000 cells/mm3 (1.0 x 109/L)

          -  Platelets count &gt; or = 75,000/mm3 (75 x 109/L)

          -  Serum SGOT/AST &lt; 3.0 x upper limits of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum SGPT/ALT &lt; 3.0 x upper limits of normal (ULN)

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dL (221 µmol/L)

          -  Serum total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL (34 µmol/L)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with non-secretory MM (no measurable monoclonal protein, free light chains,
             and/or M-spike in blood or urine).

          -  Prior history of other malignancies (except for basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast) unless disease free for ³ 5
             years.

          -  NYHA Class III or IV heart disease. History of active angina, congestive heart
             disease, or myocardial infarction within 6 months.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women are ineligible.

          -  Known HIV positivity

          -  Active viral or bacterial infections or any coexisting medical problem that would
