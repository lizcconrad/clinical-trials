      The field of child abuse prevention faces not only the challenge of developing and
      disseminating effective treatments, but the problem of high attrition rates and treatment
      noncompliance. This study will compare the effects of a motivational intervention with a
      &quot;services as usual&quot; orientation group on program retention, treatment compliance, and
      long-term outcomes in families with histories of child maltreatment.
