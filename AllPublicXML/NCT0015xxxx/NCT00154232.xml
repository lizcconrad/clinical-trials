  <brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Combination of Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS), Basiliximab, and C2-monitored Cyclosporine in de Novo Renal Transplant Recipients at Potential High Risk of Delayed Graft Function (DGF)</brief_title>
  <official_title>A 3 Month, Multicenter, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Impact of the Immunosuppressive Combination of Enteric-Coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC- MPS), Basiliximab and Cyclosporine for Microemulsion With C2 Monitoring, on Efficacy and Safety Outcomes in de Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients at Potential High Risk of DGF.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the short-term benefit of the combination of basiliximab,
      EC-MPS and cyclosporine microemulsion with C2 monitoring on the prophylaxis of acute
      rejection in a population of de novo renal transplant patients at potential high risk of DGF.
