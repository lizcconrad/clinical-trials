  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One emerging concept is that some form of injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the
      success of circulating-cell participation in differentiated tissue structure and function.
      Once reperfusion is achieved in acute myocardial infarction, an intense inflammatory cascade
      is unleashed.

      The architecture of the left ventricle rearranges, leading to ventricular remodeling. The
      &quot;homing process&quot;involves stem cell migration to the sites of injury or ischemia, which
      provides an environment that is favorable to growth and function. This microenvironment is a
      stimulus for homing and differentiation of stem cells of the appropriate lineage. It
      increases vascular permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin, along with
      homing receptors that facilitate the attachment, which is mediated by cell-to-cell contact
      and chemoattractant release from local tissue injury.The migratory capacity of stem cells
      might be dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) , stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)and stem cell factor (SCF).The expression of
      VEGF ,SDF-1 and SCF is highly up-regulated in hypoxic tissue, supporting the hypothesis that
      these factors may represent homing signals crucial to the recruitment of circulating
      progenitor cells to assist the endogenous repair mechanisms in the infarcted tissue. This
      study will examine whether cardiac rehabilitation increases the concentration of stem cell
      factors released into the bloodstream and if these factors are correlated with the
      improvement of heart function.

      Exercise training has beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with congestive heart
      failure.A similar benefit may be seen after MI, with an improvement in functional capacity
      averaging 20 percent. More important, however, is the possible effect on survival. In a
      meta-analysis of 24 trials examining the effect of cardiac rehabilitation after MI, there was
      a significant reduction in mortality with rehabilitation (odds ratio 0.81).

      Previous studies focused on the effect of rehabilitation comes from the improvement of oxygen
      utilization in skeletal muscle. The effects on cardiac morphology and perfusion status were
      rather little to be addressed.

      In this study, we will collect the questionaires, blood sampling for assay of stem cell
      factors, maximal O2 consumption, and cardiac MRI before and after cardiac
      rehabilitation.SDF-1 (stromal cell derived factor-1), SCF(stem cell factor), and VEGF
      (vasculoendothelial growth factor) will be measured by ELISA. Cardiac MRI will provide the
      information about (1) LV function, (2) scar size, and (3) perfusion status (dipyridamole
      stress MRI).

    <measure>Myocardial Blood Flow at Baseline and 3-month Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>First-pass, contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion images acquired for 80 heart beats in the left ventricle. Short-axis views were obtained after intravenous administration of gadodiamide. Perfusion studies were performed at rest and during the stress induced by a 4 min infusion of dipyridamole at a concentration of 0.14 mg/kg of body weight per minute.To determine absolute MBF values at rest and stress status, we adopted a model-independent deconvolution method proposed by Jerosch-Herold et al, a method that was previously validated in experimental animal studies by comparison with blood-flow measurements with radiolabelled microspheres.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Angiogenic Cytokines at Baseline and 3-month Follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and stem cell factor (SCF) are known to increase the formation of new vessels at ischaemic sites and thus enhance myocardial perfusion. To rule out any effect of short-term exercise on cytokines levels, blood samples were always taken after at least 72 h of physical inactivity and overnight fasting when the subject had rested in the sitting position for at least 10 min. The plasma samples were immediately frozen and stored at −70°C. High-sensitivity ELISA (Bender MedSystems, R&amp;D) were used to measure plasma levels of SCF, SDF-1 and VEGF according to the manufacturer's protocols.</description>

        <title>Myocardial Blood Flow at Baseline and 3-month Follow-up</title>
        <description>First-pass, contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion images acquired for 80 heart beats in the left ventricle. Short-axis views were obtained after intravenous administration of gadodiamide. Perfusion studies were performed at rest and during the stress induced by a 4 min infusion of dipyridamole at a concentration of 0.14 mg/kg of body weight per minute.To determine absolute MBF values at rest and stress status, we adopted a model-independent deconvolution method proposed by Jerosch-Herold et al, a method that was previously validated in experimental animal studies by comparison with blood-flow measurements with radiolabelled microspheres.</description>

        <population>Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the training group, which underwent a 3-month cardiac rehabilitation program, or the nontraining group in which patients continued their usual lifestyle. Healthy controls underwent the test of myocardial perfusion only at baseline. The analysis was intention-to-treat.</population>

        <title>Angiogenic Cytokines at Baseline and 3-month Follow-up</title>
        <description>Angiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and stem cell factor (SCF) are known to increase the formation of new vessels at ischaemic sites and thus enhance myocardial perfusion. To rule out any effect of short-term exercise on cytokines levels, blood samples were always taken after at least 72 h of physical inactivity and overnight fasting when the subject had rested in the sitting position for at least 10 min. The plasma samples were immediately frozen and stored at −70°C. High-sensitivity ELISA (Bender MedSystems, R&amp;D) were used to measure plasma levels of SCF, SDF-1 and VEGF according to the manufacturer’s protocols.</description>
        <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
        <population>We calculated that we would need 18 patients in each group to achieve a power of at least 80% to detect a 20% difference in MBF change between study groups, with a two-sided significance level of p&lt;0.05, and a 20% increase for the stress MBF change from baseline to 3 months' follow-up. The analysis was intention-to-treat.</population>
