      The aim of the study is to show the implication of platelets in vasodilation using in vivo
      and in vitro analysis and to compare the effects of placebo, aspirin and Clopidogrel in this
      interaction platelets/vessels.

      The effects of 7 days of each treatment will be compared in healthy subjects and patients
      with arteriopathy.
