  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired ocular blood flow is an important risk factor in the pathogenesis of primary open
      angle glaucoma (POAG). A few studies suggest that topical dorzolamide 2% may increase optic
      nerve perfusion. The objectives of this study are to learn the effects of dorzolamide on the
      retinal and optic nerve blood flow of glaucoma patients.

      The present study is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, crossover design study of
      newly diagnosed or already treated patients with early glaucoma.

      The investigators will check ocular blood flow parameters using the Canon Laser Blood
      Flowmeter (CLBF), used to evaluate retinal arteriole blood flow, and the Heidelberg retinal
      flowmeter (HRF), which measures blood flow through capillary beds in the retina and optic
      nerve head.

      Any demonstrated improvements to retinal and optic nerve blood flow with dorzolamide, will
      mean that the drug may protect against ischaemic nerve and retinal damage. Any documented
      improvement in flow could lead to a major change in the management of glaucoma patients as
      well as other retinal ischemic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein
      occlusion.

    <textblock>
      High intraocular pressure (IOP) is the major risk factor for glaucoma. Lowering intraocular
      pressure is still the only accepted form of treatment for glaucoma.

      Over the past decade, epidemiological and experimental evidence suggested that impaired
      ocular blood flow is an important risk factor with an important role in the pathogenesis of
      primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Several studies suggest that ischemia-promoting vascular
      factors may contribute to glaucomatous damage including vasospasm, impaired ocular perfusion
      pressure and general vascular disorders such as low blood pressure, especially dips in blood
      pressure at night.

      Different techniques are employed to assess vascular dysfunction in the eye. As the
      methodology of ocular blood flow assessment is complex and differs in various aspects (e.g.
      target tissue and physiological parameters), comparative studies are required in order to
      enhance the interpretation of these measurements.

      Our laboratory has state of the art equipment to assess ocular blood flow. One study done by
      us suggested that one drop of Dorzolamide 2% does not improve retinal blood flow in normal
      eyes. In the present study we plan to extend this study to 2 weeks of treatment in patients
      with POAG.

      Dorzolamide hydrochloride 2% is a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which reduces
      intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing the production of aqueous humour. Pharmacological
      studies on volunteers and glaucoma patients, using Color Doppler Imaging (measuring the
      retrobulbar blood flow) and Scanning laser Ophthalmoscopy (measuring arteriovenous passage
      time), indicate that topically applied Dorzolamide may increase perfusion of the optic nerve
      and peripapillary retina.
