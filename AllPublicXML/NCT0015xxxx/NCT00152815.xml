      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a one-year nutritional intervention
      with either betaine or vitamin E supplementation, or a weight reducing diet and exercise
      program on liver steatosis and steatohepatitis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline liver biopsy with macrovesicular fatty degeneration with inflammation
             (lobular or portal), with or without Mallory bodies, hepatocyte damage, and/or
             fibrosis diagnostic of NAFLD

          -  Convincing evidence of negligible alcohol consumption (&lt; 20 grams of ethanol per day)
             obtained from a detailed history, confirmed by at least one close relative

          -  If hyperlipidemia or diabetes, stable drug regimen required for the 6 months prior to
             and during the study

          -  Willingness to maintain stable weight and normal exercise program for the duration of
             the study, if randomized to vitamin E or betaine

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Liver disease of other etiology diagnosed as per routine medical investigation (e.g.,
             chronic viral hepatitis, auto-immune chronic hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or
             genetic liver disease such as Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin
             deficiency, or biliary obstruction)

          -  Complications of liver disease such as recurrent variceal bleeding, resistant ascites,
             spontaneous portosystemic encephalopathy, or bacterial peritonitis

          -  Concurrent medical illness contra-indicating a liver biopsy, history of unexplained
             bleeding, hemophilia or abnormal coagulation results as per routine laboratory work-up
             or other reason judged by the hepatologist to contra-indicate a percutaneous liver
             biopsy

          -  Medications known to precipitate steatohepatitis (corticosteroids, high dose
             estrogens, methotrexate, amiodarone, calcium channel blockers, spironolactone,
             sulfasalazine, naproxen, oxacillin or ampinovire) in the 6 months prior to entry

          -  Antioxidant vitamin supplementation, ursodeoxycholic acid, or any other experimental
             drug 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Pregnant or lactating
