  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the efficiency on AT / AF prevention and
      termination of a new algorithm contained in the Medtronic AT500 Antitachycardia device in
      patients with conventional pacemaker indications.

      Aim. More than 30% of patients (pts) implanted with a pacemaker are known to have atrial
      tachyarrhythmias (AT) despite medical treatment and about 20% of pts experience AT prior to
      implant. The Medtronic AT500TM is a new DDDRP pacemaker with extended memory and features
      designed for preventing and terminating AT. The objective of this European multi-center
      prospective crossover and randomized study is to evaluate efficacy of this device for
      decreasing AT burden, improving QOL and reducing symptoms and costs. Method. 243 pts are
      implanted with the AT500TM and followed at 1, 7 and 13 months after implant. All patients are
      selected for a dual chamber pacemaker indication plus at least two episodes of AT in the last
      12 months. One month after implantation patients are randomized either to a six month therapy
      phase (activation of preventive and ATP pacing) or a six month observation phase (No AT
      prevention nor Therapy). Crossover (CO) takes place at seven months after implant and the
      endpoint is reached at 13 months. Symptom checklist and QOL questionnaires are completed by
      pts at enrollment and after the two randomization periods. At each follow-up, a Save to Disk
      (STD) of device-stored AT episodes is performed and hospitalization, visits and/or other
      examinations are reported for future cost evaluation.
