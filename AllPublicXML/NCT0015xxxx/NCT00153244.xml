      The purpose of this study is to determine whether antiepileptic drug lamotrigine is effective
      in the treatment of chronic asthma.

      Effective therapy of asthma still remains quite serious problem. According GINA definition,
      asthma is an inflammatory disorder. Consequently, modern pharmacotherapy of asthma provides
      wide use of anti-inflammatory drugs. But asthma also is a paroxysmal disorder: many
      specialists and even some guidelines underline paroxysmal clinical picture of asthma. Besides
      this, according to some authors, neurogenic inflammation may play important role in asthma
      mechanism. But some other neurogenic inflammatory paroxysmal disorders exist, and they are
      migraine and trigeminal neuralgia. Some antiepileptic drugs, like carbamazepine and
      valproate, are very effective in therapy of migraine and trigeminal neuralgia - more than in
      80% of cases. If bronchial asthma also is paroxysmal inflammatory disease, like migraine and
      trigeminal neuralgia, it is possible that some antiepileptic drugs also are very effective in
      asthma therapy.

      We performed double-blind placebo-controlled 3-month trial for evaluation of lamotrigine
      efficacy in therapy of poorly controlled bronchial asthma. Lamotrigine is antiepileptic drug
      of new generation, produced by Glaxo SmithCline.

      Comparison: Patients received investigational drug in addition to their usual routine
      antiasthmatic treatment, compared to patients received placebo in addition to their usual
      routine antiasthmatic treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have given their informed consent before commencing the procedures
             specified in the protocol, indicating that they understand the objectives of the study
             and are willing to adhere to the procedures described in the protocol.

          -  Males or females.

          -  Patient aged between 16 and 65 years.

          -  Out patients.

          -  Non smokers or ex-smokers, having stopped smoking &gt; 1 year.

          -  Patients with an established (i.e. at least one year) clinical history of asthma.

          -  Absence of long-term remissions of asthma (lasting more than 1 month)

          -  Poorly controlled asthma, due to various reasons.

          -  Patients with a FEV1 reversibility of at least 12% from initial level after 400 mcg
             salbutamol inhalation (4 puffs of salbutamol MDI, 100 mcg per puff). Patients whose
             FEV1 reversibility was 12% within the past 12 months are acceptable, providing that
             the records are available to the investigator.

          -  Patients able to swallow capsules, able to understand and complete diary cards and to
             record their PEFR using a peak-flow meter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Long-term history of smoking (3 years and more)

          -  History or presence of cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, psychiatric, liver,
             immunologic, endocrine, infection or other diseases or dysfunctions if they are
             clinically significant. A clinically significant disease is defined as one which in
             the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of
             participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study
             or the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Patients with a recent history (&lt; 1 year) of myocardial infarction and/or (&lt; 3 years)
             of heart failure or patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy.

          -  History of cancer within the past 5 years.

          -  Patients with active tuberculosis with indication for treatment.

          -  Patients with a history of cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis or
             emphysema.

          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis or if the abnormal defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion.

          -  Patients with known allergy, side effects, intolerance/hypersensitivity to
             investigational drug

          -  Patients currently using MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptic
             drugs, narcotic agents.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women and sexually active women with childbearing potential not

             protocol.
