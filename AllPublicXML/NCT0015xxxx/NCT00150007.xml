      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact that GI complaints have on patient reported
      outcomes in renal transplant recipients and to determine if there is improvement in patient
      reported outcomes when patients are converted to a EC-MPS-based immunosuppressive treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Received kidney transplant at least 1 month prior to study enrollment;

          -  Receiving immunosuppressive regimen that includes MMF for at least 2 weeks prior to
             study enrollment;

          -  Eligible to convert to EC-MPS because of GI complaints OR not currently experiencing
             GI complaints and stable on current immunosuppressive regimen;

          -  At least 18 years of age;

          -  Willing to provide written informed consent; and

          -  Able to meet all study requirements including completing paper questionnaires and
             completing two study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  GI symptoms assumed or known not to be caused by MPA therapy (e.g. oral biphosphonates
             induced, infectious diarrhea);

          -  Acute rejection &lt; 1 week prior to study enrollment;

          -  Woman of child-bearing potential who is planning to become pregnant or is pregnant

          -  Undergoing acute medical intervention or hospitalization;

          -  Any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the site investigator based on
             recall or chart review, would interfere with completing the study, including but not

          -  Receiving any investigational drug or have received any investigational drug within 30
             days prior to study enrollment.
