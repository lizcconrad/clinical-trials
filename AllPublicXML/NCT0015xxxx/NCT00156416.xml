      One of the consequences of breast cancer treatment for younger women is the abrupt onset of
      menopause and its related symptoms. Menopausal symptoms disrupt usual activities, alter sleep
      patterns and decrease quality of life. The purpose of this randomized feasibility pilot study
      is to examine mindfulness meditation for menopausal symptom management for women who are
      breast cancer survivors and for women with naturally occurring menopause. The study is
      designed to: 1. establish the feasibility of a mindfulness meditation program for women who
      experience menopausal symptoms (e.g. hot flushes). 2. explore the treatment benefit of a
      mindfulness meditation program for menopausal symptom relief using changes in frequency and
      severity of hot flushes; frequency of sleep disruption, various aspects of quality of life
      and physiologic stress response (cortisol) as outcome measures. 3. evaluate whether the
      treatment benefits of mindfulness meditation differ in menopausal women with naturally
      occurring menopause versus women with menopause secondary to chemotherapy for breast cancer.
      Participants randomized to the attention control group will be offered meditation training
      after completion of the intervention and follow up phases. Participants will attend 8
      meditation sessions or 8 attention control sessions. Study variables are Menopausal Hot
      Flushes (self report &amp; skin conductance monitoring), Sleep Disruption (Pgh Sleep Quality
      Index), Physiologic Stress Response (cortisol), Quality of Life (Menopausal Quality of Life);
      and Protocol Design (recruitment &amp; retention rates, exit interviews). A convenience sample of
      60 women who experience menopausal symptoms will be recruited.

      One of the consequences of breast cancer treatment for younger women is the abrupt onset of
      menopause and its related symptoms. Menopausal symptoms disrupt usual activities, alter sleep
      patterns and decrease quality of life. In light of the recent findings from the Women's
      Health Initiative (re:use of exogenous estrogen), the need to investigate non-hormonal
      approaches (meditation) for short-term menopausal symptom discomfort is high. The purpose of
      this randomized feasibility pilot study is to examine mindfulness meditation for menopausal
      symptom management for women who are breast cancer survivors and for women with naturally
      occurring menopause. The study is designed to: 1. establish the feasibility of a mindfulness
      meditation program for women who experience menopausal symptoms (e.g. hot flushes). 2.
      explore the treatment benefit of a mindfulness meditation program for menopausal symptom
      relief using changes in frequency and severity of hot flushes; frequency of sleep disruption,
      various aspects of quality of life and physiologic stress response (cortisol) as outcome
      measures. 3. evaluate whether the treatment benefits of mindfulness meditation differ in
      menopausal women with naturally occurring menopause versus women with menopause secondary to
      chemotherapy for breast cancer. A 2x2 factorial repeated design will be used. The four
      randomized groups will consist of 1) naturally occurring menopause meditation; 2) naturally
      occurring menopause attention control; 3) breast cancer survivors meditation; 4) breast
      cancer survivors attention. Participants randomized to the attention control group will be
      offered meditation training after completion of the intervention and follow up phases.
      Participants will attend 8 meditation sessions or 8 attention control sessions. Study
      variables are Menopausal Hot Flushes (self report &amp; skin conductance monitoring), Sleep
      Disruption (Pgh Sleep Quality Index), Physiologic Stress Response (cortisol), Quality of Life
      (Menopausal Quality of Life); and Protocol Design (recruitment &amp; retention rates, exit
      interviews). A convenience sample of 60 women who experience menopausal symptoms will be
      recruited. Data analysis includes descriptive statistics, repeated measures content analysis.
      Results from this feasibility pilot study will inform the design of a larger randomized
      clinical trial to test the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation as a self care
      intervention for menopausal symptom management and improvement in quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  . Subjects will be selected based on their self-identification of menopausal hot
             flushes. Subjects may identify other menopausal symptoms but must have hot flushes.
             Inclusion criteria will include English speaking, self-identification of the
             menopausal symptom of hot flushes following treatment for breast cancer (stage I or
             II) and amenorrhea secondary to breast cancer treatment or for women with naturally
             occurring menopause amenorrhea of greater that one year but less than three years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria are, for women with breast cancer, amenorrhea of greater that one
             year prior to their diagnosis of breast cancer. Also, excluded is concurrent treatment
             of menopausal symptoms with hormonal supplementation, herbal remedies, acupuncture,
             acupressure or non-hormonal pharmacologic agents prescribed at doses specifically for
             hot flush relief (beta blockers, SSRIs). However, women taking either serotonin
             reuptake inhibitors for depression or beta-blockers for hypertension who exhibit hot
             flushes sufficient to meet inclusion criteria will be accepted into the study.
             Previous treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormones, herbs or acupuncture,
             structured meditation and/or regular yoga practice must have ceased at least three
             months prior to enrollment in the study to allow for a sufficient wash out period.
             Women who are presently in chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer are excluded due
             to the potential confounding effect of mindfulness meditation on quality of life due
             to chemotherapy symptom relief. Women with a moderate to severe level of depression
             (&gt;27), or suicidal thoughts or wishes, as measured by the Beck Depression Index, 2nd
             Ed (BDI-II), will be excluded and referred for treatment. However, following treatment
             for depression, they may enroll in the study assuming continuation of hot flushes at
             inclusion criteria levels.
