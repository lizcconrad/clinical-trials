  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study designed to evaluate sildenafil for the treatment of
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in children, aged 1 to 17 years. The purpose of the study is
      to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 16 weeks of chronic treatment with
      oral sildenafil given in three different doses, compared to placebo (inactive treatment).
      Efficacy will be measured by exercise and hemodynamics. Patients who complete this trial may
      be eligible to take part in an extension study, in which all patients will receive active
      treatment of sildenafil.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 32 centers in North, Latin and South America, Europe and Asia.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the 324 subjects screened, 235 subjects were randomized. 234 received treatment. One subject(sildenafil medium dose group) withdrew prior to taking any study treatment as the hemodynamic entrance criteria were not met.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Day 1-7 10 mg, followed by 10 mg TID (3 times daily) for body weights &gt; 20-45 kg and &gt; 45 kg, through Day 112.
Modeling of the plasma concentrations for each dose level showed that the low and medium doses were predicted to be similar for the 8 to 20 kg subjects (ie, subjects would receive the same dose because of the available tablet strengths); consequently there was no low dose for the &gt;= 8-20 kg weight group.</description>

Modeling of the plasma concentrations for each dose level showed that the low and medium doses were predicted to be similar for the 8 to 20 kg subjects (ie, subjects would receive the same dose because of the available tablet strengths); consequently there was no low dose for the &gt;= 8-20 kg weight group.</description>
