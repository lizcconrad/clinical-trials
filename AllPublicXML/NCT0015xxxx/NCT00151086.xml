      Purpose: This clinical trail will combine the chemotherapy drugs, Estramustine and
      Vinorelbine (Navelbine), on an intermittent therapy strategy based on PSA response in the
      treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer. The investigators will determine the
      tolerable dose of (oral) vinorelbine in combination with (oral) estramustine, and evaluate
      the efficacy of this treatment for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormone Refractory prostate cancer refers to advanced disease in which a patient no longer
      responds to conventional hormonal treatment. When hormone therapy is no longer successful,
      chemotherapy is a treatment option. However, current single-agent treatment has shown to have
      limited benefit. In this clinical trial, investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of
      combining two chemotherapy drugs, Estramustine and Vinorelbine (Navelbine), in the treatment
      of hormone refractory prostate cancer. Estramustine has been used in the treatment of
      prostate cancer for many years. Vinorelbine has shown activity in prostate cancer. In
      addition, the effect of this treatment on the quality of life of patients will be evaluated
      as measured using the FACT-P.

    <description>To determine the tolerable dose of oral vinorelbine in combination with oral estramustine on an intermittent schedule, and describe the toxicities of the regimen. The dose will not be escalated until at least 180 days of cumulative observation of acute toxicity in patients enrolled at a particular dose level.</description>

        Inclusion:

          -  Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. (No
             evidence of brain metastasis or untreated spinal cord compression.)

          -  Patients on total androgen suppression therapy must undergo nonsteroidal antiandrogen
             withdrawal and demonstrate at rising PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) 4 weeks after
             withdrawal for flutamide and 6 weeks after withdrawal for bicalutamide or nilutamide.

          -  Patients must have measurable soft tissue disease or evaluable (abnormal bone scan
             and/or elevated PSA). If PSA is the only evidence of progressive disease it must be
             greater than or equal to 4ng/mL.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and liver function

          -  ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0-2 (a measure of
             general well being on a scale of 0-5 where 0 represents asymptomatic and 5 represents
             death)

          -  Must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Must have a life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks

        Exclusion:

          -  Have previously received vinca alkaloid-based cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation to
             greater than or equal to 50% of the total bone marrow.

          -  Evidence of brain metastasis

          -  Spinal cord compression

          -  Prior malignancy except for in situ carcinoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, or adequately
             treated malignancy that has been inactive for less than 3 years

          -  Patients with preexisting neuropathy of greater than or equal to grade 2

          -  Active gastrointestinal disease, or a disorder that alters gastrointestinal motility
             or absorption
