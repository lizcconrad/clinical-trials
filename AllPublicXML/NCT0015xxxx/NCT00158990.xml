  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine whether concurrent treatment of patients with
      major depression (unipolar or bipolar) with triiodothyronine (T3) and sertraline, will lead
      to a stronger and/or more rapid antidepressant effect than treatment with sertraline alone.

      AIM: To determine the therapeutic efficacy and adverse effects of triiodothyronine (T3) as a
      supplement to the treatment of bipolar depression (BPD) with a mood stabilizer (MS) (lithium
      - Li, valproic acid - VPA or carbamazepine - CBZ) and the specific serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI), sertraline; and as a supplement to the treatment of unipolar depression
      (UPD) with sertraline.

      METHOD: A random assignment, double blind, placebo-controlled trial separately evaluating
      patients with a) BPD who are treated with MS + sertraline + T3 or MS + sertraline + placebo
      and b) UPD who are treated with sertraline + T3 or sertraline + placebo, for up to 8 weeks in
      both cases. The design of the trial will permit both the outcome of treatment and the speed
      of response to be evaluated.
