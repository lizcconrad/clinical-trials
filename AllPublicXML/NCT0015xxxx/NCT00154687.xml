      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Weekly TP-HDFL in advanced
      transitional cell carcinoma in terms of response rate and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transitional cell carcinoma(TCC)of urothelium,including bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis
      TCCs, was the most lethal urology malignancy in Taiwan. In 1995, approximately 1,300 new
      cases of TCC was diagnosed in Taiwan and more than 600 patients died of this disease.
      Advanced TCC is a moderately chemosensitive disease. A combination of methotrexate,
      vinblastine, and cisplatin with or without doxorubicin (M-VAC or CMV) has been widely used
      since 1980s. Despite the response rate was as high as 40-70%, the survival of these patients
      was only slightly increased from a median of 7 to 9 months for those who were treated with
      supportive care or cisplatin alone to a median of 12 months by cisplatin-based combination
      chemotherapy. One of the reasons for the poor treatment results is the inevitable
      treatment-related toxicities related to conventional systemic chemotherapy.
