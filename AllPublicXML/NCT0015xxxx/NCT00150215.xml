      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single doses of
           PF-00184562; and

        -  To explore the exposure-response relationship of neuropsychometric and tolerability
           measures of PF-00184562 compared to olanzapine.
