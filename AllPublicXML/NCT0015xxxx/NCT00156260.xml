    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research is to analyze the cells present in the fluid obtained
      via ductal lavage from the nipple of a woman with a known diagnosis of breast cancer. A
      portion of the lavage fluid may be used in future breast cancer biomarkers. Remaining lavage
      fluid will be used to analyze its biochemical composition, for investigational purposes only.

          3. prior margin-negative excisional biopsy of primary breast tumor, with no evidence of
             residual disease

          4. patient being treated with breast conservation therapy inability to understand the
