  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine acceptability and efficacy of 2 kinds of BV treatment
      among women at low risk for preterm delivery. The objectives are:

        1. To examine the side effects and patient acceptability of oral versus intravaginal
           metronidazole.

        2. To compare the efficacy of oral and intravaginal metronidazole for the treatment of BV

        3. To study the efficacy of oral and intravaginal metronidazole for the prevention of
           hospital admission during the 3rd trimester, chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery, and
           maternal infectious morbidity.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial. Women diagnosed as BV+ by Gram
      stain at 12-16 weeks gestation are randomly assigned to the following treatment groups: oral
      metronidazole (250 mg TID x 7 days) with intravaginal placebo; intravaginal metronidazole (5g
      0.75% gel BID x 5 days) with oral placebo. African American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific
      Islander, Native American, and white women are eligible. Women with a prior preterm delivery,
      multiple gestation, chronic hypertension or pre-existing diabetes, antibiotic use before
      enrollment in the study, allergy to metronidazole, history of alcohol abuse in past year, and
      women under age 18 are excluded.
