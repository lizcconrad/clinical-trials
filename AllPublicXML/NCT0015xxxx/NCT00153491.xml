  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of how well caregivers of children with malaria adhere to the recommended
      regimen for lumefantrine-artemether (LA). Children were randomly assigned to either a group
      receiving directly observed treatment in hospital or to a group treated at home by the
      routine caregiver (typically, patient's mother). Clinical/parasitologic, hematologic,
      pharmacologic and qualitative parameters were monitored over a 28-day follow-up period and
      are used to evaluate drug adherence.
