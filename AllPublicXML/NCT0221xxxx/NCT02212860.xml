  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy after surgery to remove breast cancer improves control of the breast
      cancer. Standard therapy after breast conservation surgery is five to six weeks of radiation
      to the entire breast.

      This clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness of conformal radiation therapy delivered
      only to the area in the breast where the lumpectomy will be performed.

      This study will determine if radiation therapy delivered in this manner will prevent the
      cancer from coming back and eliminate the need for five to six weeks of radiation.

      The study will also gather information about the safety and effects (good and bad) this
      radiation has, and on patient satisfaction with the appearance of the breast.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our proposal represents the convergence of several recent developments in the treatment of
      patients with low-risk carcinoma of the breast. For the selected subset of patients with
      low-risk disease, it appears that intra-operative radiotherapy with a single fraction leads
      to acceptable clinical outcomes in terms of local control, overall survival and toxicity.
      There have also been a few Phase I dose escalation trials demonstrating safety with single
      fraction breast radiation.

      In this study, we propose the delivery of radiotherapy using only a single fraction, 21 Gy,
      but using stereotactic body radiation therapy. Radiation will be delivered using
      Volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), planned on coregistered PET/MRI and CT imaging, and
      delivered prone. Our approach will potentially have numerous benefits, including
      significantly shortened treatment time, convenience and potentially reduced health care
      costs. It would significantly improve the quality of life of many patients.

      This study will also provide a unique opportunity for pathologic assessment of the impact of
      radiation at a microscopic level and on tumour markers without the confounding impact of
      systemic treatments, comparing pre- to post-radiation biopsy specimens for imaging and
      histologic predictors of radiation sensitivity.
