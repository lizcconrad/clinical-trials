    <textblock>
      Atelectasis is common during and after general anesthesia. Atelectasis develops early if
      preoxygenation with 100% oxygen is used and continuously used during induction until
      endotracheal intubation. The investigators hypothesize that a rapid anti-preoxygenation
      maneuver immediately after confirming a successful intubation, reduces the area of
      atelectasis as investigated by computed tomography compared to a standard procedure.

    <description>Handling of the airway during induction and intubation is performed in a conventional manner.
Initial ventilatory settings are also done in a conventional manner. As soon as correct position of the endotracheal tube is confirmed, controlled ventilation is started with a tidal volume of 7 mL/kg ideal body weight, PEEP 6 or 8 cm H2O (8 if BMI &gt;25) and a respiratory frequency of 10. The fresh gas flow is set to 1 Liter per minute with an oxygen mixture of 40%, aiming for an inspired FiO2 of 30-35%.
Unless the patient´s SpO2 falls below 90%, the FiO2 remains unchanged throughout the procedure.</description>

    <description>Handling of the airway during induction and intubation is performed in a conventional manner.
Immediately after confirming a successful intubation, the effect of preoxygenation is eliminated with a fresh gas flow of 10 L/min of air, delivered with volume controlled ventilation consisting of tidal volumes of approximately 15 ml/kg ideal body weight, a positive expiratory pressure of 10 cm H20 and a respiratory frequency of 10. As soon as the end tidal O2 reaches 25%, the ventilator settings are adjusted to normal values (same as in the control group), i.e. tidal volume 7 mL/kg ideal body weight, PEEP 6 or 8 cm H2O (8 if BMI &gt;25). The mixture of oxygen in the fresh gas is increased to 40% and the fresh gas flow is set to 1 Liter per minute, aiming for an inspired FiO2 of 30-35%.
Unless the patient´s SpO2 falls below 90%, the FiO2 remains unchanged throughout the procedure.</description>
