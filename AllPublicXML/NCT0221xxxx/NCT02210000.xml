    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial designed to confirm the
      symptomatic effects of camicinal treatment vs. placebo, on gastroparesis symptoms in type 1
      and 2 diabetic subjects with gastroparesis. The primary purpose of this study is to determine
      if a low-dose of camicinal (25 milligram[mg]) for 12 weeks of repeat administration improves
      gastroparesis symptoms as measured by the Gastrointestinal Cardinal Symptom Index - Daily
      Diary (GCSI-DD) in approximately 120 subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) who
      have documented abnormally slow gastric emptying and have symptoms consistent with
      gastroparesis.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either camicinal or placebo. The study
      will consist of a screening/baseline period of up to 35 days, a 12 week treatment period, a
      2-week post-treatment assessment of symptoms and a 14 day (+/- 2 days) post treatment safety
      follow-up visit.

    <measure>Percentage of Responders Based on the Fullness/Early Satiety Subscale (Responders) as Assessed by Gastrointestinal Cardinal Symptom Index-Daily Diary (GCSI-DD) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GCSI-DD consists of nine symptom severity items covering the following domains: nausea/vomiting; fullness/early satiety, and bloating. In addition, the GCSI-DD contains two symptom severity items upper abdominal pain and overall rating of gastroparesis symptoms. Participants were asked to rate each symptom on a 6-point scale from 0 to 5 with lower scores representing less symptom severity and higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Fullness/early satiety response is defined as an improvement from Baseline by at least one point in the weekly average for the subscale. A participant was defined as a responder if the participant's weekly average change from Baseline in the fullness/early satiety response score improved by at least 1 point. Percentage of participants showing response were presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Individual Items, Subscales and Total Score of GCSI-DD at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screening) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Items of GCSI-DD for gastroparesis (GP) symptom assessment included: 3-nausea, 4-feeling full after meals, 5-bloating, 6-unable to finish normal meal, 7-retching, 8-vomiting, 9-stomach visibly larger, 10-stomach fullness, 11-loss of appetite, 12-upper abdominal pain, 13-upper abdominal discomfort and 14-overall severity of GP symptoms. Each symptom rated on a 6-point scale from 0 to 5 where 0 indicated absence of symptom and higher score indicated greater severity of symptom. Score of nausea/vomiting subscale was mean of items 3, 7, 8; fullness/early satiety subscale was mean of items 4, 6, 10, 11; bloating subscale was mean of items 5, 9. Total GCSI-DD score was mean of 3 subscales. For all, 0 indicated absence of symptom and higher score indicated greater severity of symptoms. Baseline was defined as weekly average of last 7 daily scores recorded during screening period. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting mean score for Baseline from weekly average score of Week 12.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Blood Pressure of Potential Clinical Importance (PCI) Over 100 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days</time_frame>
    <description>Abnormal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured. If the value for a participant at a given visit was outside the PCI, the participants were further categorized as per the increase or decrease of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from Baseline by 10, 20 and 40 millimeters of mercury (mm of Hg). Number of participants with absolute (ABS) SBP (&gt;160 mm Hg) and ABS DBP (100 mm Hg) were also analyzed. Change from Baseline (CFB) is the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Participants were counted only once per parameter. Participant may have had more than 1 abnormal parameter. Only worst post-Baseline CFB values were considered. The categories mentioned for data values indicate the blood pressure ranges of clinical concern.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Normal and Abnormal 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) Measurements Over 100 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-lead ECG was analyzed as a measure of safety and tolerability. Number of participants with normal ECG, abnormal clinically significant, and abnormal clinically not significant ECG were reported. PR interval of &lt; 110 and &gt; 220 milliseconds (msec), QRS interval of &lt;75 and &gt; 110 msec, absolute QTc interval of &gt; 450 to ≤ 480 or &gt; 480 to ≤ 500 or &gt;500 msec, and increase from Baseline in QTc of &gt; 30 to ≤ 60 msec or &gt;60 msec was considered as of abnormal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Hematological Abnormalities of PCI by Treatment and Visit Over Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days</time_frame>
    <description>Hematology analysis was performed at screening (fasted) and during the study at each indicated time point. Participants with abnormalities in changes from Baseline values were recorded. Total absolute neutrophil count (tANC &lt;1.5 Giga per Liter [G/L]), hemoglobin (&lt;25 or &gt;25 G/L), hematocrit (&lt;0.075 or &gt;0.075 %), platelet count (&lt;100 or &gt;500 G/L), lymphocytes low (&lt;0.8 G/L), and white blood cells (WBC &lt;3 G/L or &gt;20G/L) were analyzed for their low (L) or high (H) values. Change from Baseline (CFB) was the post-Baseline value minus then Baseline value. Baseline was defined as last non-missing measurement prior to dosing. One participant was randomized to Placebo arm; however, was included within the Camicinal treatment group as they reported at least one PK trough concentration &gt;53 nano-grams per milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline Clinical Chemistry Abnormalities of PCI by Treatment and Visit Over Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 100 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical chemistry laboratory analysis was performed at screening (fasted) and during the study at each indicated time point. Albumin low (&lt;30 G/L), calcium low (&lt;2 or &gt;2.75 millimoles per Liter [mmol/L]), creatinine (&gt;44 micromoles per Liter change from baseline), Glucose (&lt;3 or &gt;18 mmol/L), potassium (&lt;3.0 or &gt;5.5 mmol/L), sodium (&lt;130 or &gt;150 mmol/L), and carbon di oxide (CO2) (&lt;18 or &gt;35 mmol/L) were analyzed for their low (L) or high (H) values. Participants with abnormalities in changes from Baseline values were recorded. Change from Baseline is the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of the Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of follow up (100 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. Any AE or SAE that led discontinuation of the study drug either by participant or by investigator was considered as an AE leading to discontinuation of the study drug.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Responders Based on the Fullness/Early Satiety Subscale (Responders) as Assessed by Gastrointestinal Cardinal Symptom Index-Daily Diary (GCSI–DD) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The GCSI-DD consists of nine symptom severity items covering the following domains: nausea/vomiting; fullness/early satiety, and bloating. In addition, the GCSI-DD contains two symptom severity items upper abdominal pain and overall rating of gastroparesis symptoms. Participants were asked to rate each symptom on a 6-point scale from 0 to 5 with lower scores representing less symptom severity and higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Fullness/early satiety response is defined as an improvement from Baseline by at least one point in the weekly average for the subscale. A participant was defined as a responder if the participant's weekly average change from Baseline in the fullness/early satiety response score improved by at least 1 point. Percentage of participants showing response were presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Individual Items, Subscales and Total Score of GCSI-DD at Week 12</title>
        <description>Items of GCSI-DD for gastroparesis (GP) symptom assessment included: 3-nausea, 4-feeling full after meals, 5-bloating, 6-unable to finish normal meal, 7-retching, 8-vomiting, 9-stomach visibly larger, 10-stomach fullness, 11-loss of appetite, 12-upper abdominal pain, 13-upper abdominal discomfort and 14-overall severity of GP symptoms. Each symptom rated on a 6-point scale from 0 to 5 where 0 indicated absence of symptom and higher score indicated greater severity of symptom. Score of nausea/vomiting subscale was mean of items 3, 7, 8; fullness/early satiety subscale was mean of items 4, 6, 10, 11; bloating subscale was mean of items 5, 9. Total GCSI-DD score was mean of 3 subscales. For all, 0 indicated absence of symptom and higher score indicated greater severity of symptoms. Baseline was defined as weekly average of last 7 daily scores recorded during screening period. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting mean score for Baseline from weekly average score of Week 12.</description>

        <description>Abnormal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured. If the value for a participant at a given visit was outside the PCI, the participants were further categorized as per the increase or decrease of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from Baseline by 10, 20 and 40 millimeters of mercury (mm of Hg). Number of participants with absolute (ABS) SBP (&gt;160 mm Hg) and ABS DBP (100 mm Hg) were also analyzed. Change from Baseline (CFB) is the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Participants were counted only once per parameter. Participant may have had more than 1 abnormal parameter. Only worst post-Baseline CFB values were considered.

        <description>Hematology analysis was performed at screening (fasted) and during the study at each indicated time point. Participants with abnormalities in changes from Baseline values were recorded. Total absolute neutrophil count (tANC &lt;1.5 Giga per Liter [G/L]), hemoglobin (&lt;25 or &gt;25 G/L), hematocrit (&lt;0.075 or &gt;0.075 %), platelet count (&lt;100 or &gt;500 G/L), lymphocytes low (&lt;0.8 G/L), and white blood cells (WBC &lt;3 G/L or &gt;20G/L) were analyzed for their low (L) or high (H) values. Change from Baseline (CFB) was the post-Baseline value minus then Baseline value. Baseline was defined as last non-missing measurement prior to dosing. One participant was randomized to Placebo arm; however, was included within the Camicinal treatment group as they reported at least one PK trough concentration &gt;53 nano-grams per milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

Total absolute neutrophil count (tANC &lt;1.5 Giga per Liter [G/L]), hemoglobin (&lt;25 or &gt;25 G/L), hematocrit (&lt;0.075 or &gt;0.075 %), platelet count (&lt;100 or &gt;500 G/L), lymphocytes low (&lt;0.8 G/L), and white blood cells (WBC &lt;3 G/L or &gt;20G/L) were analyzed for their low (L) or high (H) values. Change from Baseline (CFB) was the post-Baseline value minus then Baseline value. Baseline was defined as last non-missing measurement prior to dosing. One participant was randomized to Placebo arm; however, was included within the Camicinal treatment group as they reported at least one PK trough concentration &gt;53 nano-grams per milliliter (ng/mL).</description>
          <population>Safety Population. One participant randomized to Placebo arm had quantifiable concentration of Camicinal in blood and therefore was analyzed in the Camicinal group.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of the Study Drug</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. Any AE or SAE that led discontinuation of the study drug either by participant or by investigator was considered as an AE leading to discontinuation of the study drug.</description>
