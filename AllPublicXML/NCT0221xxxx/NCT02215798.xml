      Primary objective: To estimate the frequency of adverse events, serious and non-serious in
      Filipino patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain treated with duloxetine 60mg once
      daily within the study duration of approximately 6-8 weeks in a naturalistic clinical
      setting. Secondary objective: To evaluate the change from baseline to endpoint in the Brief
      Pain Inventory (BPI) and Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) assessed by the investigators
      in duloxetine use in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain among Filipino
      patients within the study duration of approximately 6-8 weeks in a naturalistic clinical
      setting.
