    <textblock>
      The Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol combination (FSC) at a dose of 100/50 micrograms (mcg)
      twice daily in DISKUS inhaler (also known as ACCUHALER速, Ddpi) inhaler is a recognised and
      licensed therapy for the treatment of asthma. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is developing the
      ROTAHALER/ ROTACAPS速 (Rdpi) inhaler as an alternative treatment option for asthmatic
      patients. This study is a Phase I, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two- treatment,
      four-way cross-over (replicate design), two sequence, repeat dose, two centre study in mild
      to moderate asthmatics to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fluticasone
      proprionate/salmeterol (100/50 mcg) delivered via the Rdpi versus the Ddpi. A total of 58
      subjects will be enrolled to ensure 52 subjects complete all dosing occasions. Each subject
      will be allocated to one of two treatment sequences and will participate in four treatment
      periods, receiving each of the treatments twice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a known physician diagnosis of asthma with a best Forced Expiratory
             Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) of &gt;70% of the predicted normal value at the Screening
             visit. Percent predicted will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society
             Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations. Subjects must abstain from short
             acting beta-2 agonists (SABA) use for 6 hours prior to the Screening visit.

          -  During the screening visit, subjects must either demonstrate the presence of
             reversible airway disease, defined as an increase in FEV1 of &gt;=12.0% over baseline and
             an absolute change of &gt;=200 millilitres (mL) within 60 minutes following 4 inhalations
             of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or equivalent nebulized treatment with
             albuterol/salbutamol solution) or in the absence of reversibility have documented
             evidence of a physician diagnosed asthma for at least 6 months

          -  Male/females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilograms (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18 - 35.0
             kilogram/square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40
             milliinternational units per/millilitre (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picogram/millilitre
             (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomoles per liter [pmol/L]) is confirmatory. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the contraception methods, if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.;

             Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as
             determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to
             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree
             to use contraception until the follow-up visit.; OR has only same-sex partners, when
             this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

             day / 20) x number of years smoked].

             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).
