      The primary objective of the proposed research is to determine the influence of 8 weeks of
      twice daily consumption of 120 kcal servings of dried apples or a commonly consumed low fat
      120kcal muffin on components of obesity (waist circumference [waist measurement], serum
      glucose [blood sugar], triglycerides [fats in the blood] and HDL-cholesterol, and blood
      pressure) as well as antioxidant status, inflammatory markers, nutrient intake in overweight
      and obese individuals. A total of 48 children aged 10-16 years will be randomly assigned to
      groups and provided with twice daily 120 kcal servings of either dried apples or muffins for
      8 weeks of feeding. Prior to initiating the feeding trial and again after 8 weeks, blood
      samples will be collected and analyzed. During each visit to the lab, subjects will be
      weighed in minimal clothing, tested for body composition using dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and air displacement plethysmography (Bod
      Pod) and blood pressure, and measured for waist circumference. One 24-hour recall will be
      performed prior to initiation of the study; one recall will be performed throughout the
      feeding period, and one at the end of the 8 weeks. Dietary intake of energy, macronutrients,
      vitamins and minerals will be assessed to determine diet quality. All food records will be
      analyzed using the Nutritionist Pro (First DataBank) software. The potential benefits of the
      study include determining the effects of consistent snacking and particular snack foods on
      metabolism and weight management. There are no major risks to subjects in this study. There
      are minimal risks when performing venipuncture (blood draws) including bruising, perforation
      of the vein leading to hematoma under skin, light-headedness or dizziness due to fear of
      needles, and infection. This study will hopefully allow more understanding and insight into
      the diet of children and the effect of it on body makeup and blood sugar. It is hypothesized
      that the twice a day apple snack group will have decreased waist circumference, body
      adiposity, triglycerides and total cholesterol as well as, increased blood glucose uptake at
      the end of 8 weeks.

    <description>twenty four participants will be randomly selected for the apple group, in which they will receive 37.5 grams equal to 120kcal of dried apples twice a day for eight weeks. This snack of apples will be eaten once between breakfast and lunch and once between lunch and dinner and both will be consumed with an eight ounce bottle of water.</description>
