      Project Summary: Patients who have a length of stay four or more days in ICU and requiring
      mechanical ventilation assistance to breathe for more than 48 hours will be invited to
      participate. Participants will be randomised to either receive Functional Electrical
      Stimulation (eStimCycle) assisted cycling or standard care. As cycling in bed has previously
      been shown to improve physical function, patients who receive cycling as a treatment will
      have one leg that cycles and the other leg that cycles with assistance of electrical
      stimulation as we want to establish the effectiveness of the addition of electrical
      stimulation of muscle. Muscle bulk, strength and physical function outcome measures will be
      measured at baseline, weekly in ICU, ICU discharge and hospital discharge. Cognitive function
      will also be measured at hospital discharge, 6- and 12-month follow-up. A small group of
      patients in this study will be invited to provide samples of blood, urine and muscle at ICU
      admission and discharge to try and determine what happens to muscle in patients who are
      critically ill.

      Significance of the Project: This is an important study because the development of
      ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) can result in long term limitations in physical function.
      Early treatment to maintain strong muscles during an intensive care stay may help speed up
      recovery and enhance participation in other rehabilitation treatments and improve functional
      activities and cognition. These are important objectives for both patients and their
      families. In addition understanding why the muscles become so weak so quickly in patients in
      ICU will help to develop treatments that may help to maintain muscle strength.

      Study Hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: eStimCycle versus usual care rehabilitation will improve muscle strength at
      hospital discharge.

      Hypothesis 2: eStimCycle versus usual care rehabilitation will improve cognitive function at
      6 month follow up.

      Hypothesis 3: Patients receiving eStimCycle will have improved activity of anabolic
      signalling pathways and less atrophy of skeletal muscle fibre size compared with usual care
      rehabilitation.

    <description>Timeframe: Within 72 hours of ICU admission. Program: Standard care physiotherapy AND up to one hour of supine cycling daily using a cycle ergometer (RT300 supine model Restorative Therapies, Ltd or Letto 300.) attached to a six channel stimulator (SAGE) and 2 additional RT50 wireless stimulator channels.
One leg will undergo cycling alone without the electrodes turned on (sham) and the other leg will undergo cycling and muscle stimulation. Electrodes will be placed on all major lower limb muscles. Intervention will be provided individually and supervised by a physiotherapist in ICU only. Duration /Intensity: Up to 1 hour at least 5 times a week for 28 days or ICU discharge, if 20 sessions have not occurred at this time, intervention will continue until this is achieved. Intensity of muscle stimulation will be delivered at a level able to cause visible muscle contractions, confirmed by palpation.
A subgroup of 10 individuals will be involved in biomarker analyses.</description>
