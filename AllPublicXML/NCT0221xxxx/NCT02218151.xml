  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure a variety of
      malignant and non-malignant diseases. However, it is associated with significant morbidity,
      and treatment-related mortality. This is due in large part to the prolonged pancytopenia and
      immunosuppression associated with the preparatory regimen of chemotherapy and/or radiation
      and the wait until engraftment of the transplanted hematopoietic stem cells. During this
      vulnerable period, infectious complications are common. Historically HCT patients were kept
      in protected environments to safeguard their health during the pancytopenic phase; despite
      these measures, infectious complications and graft versus host disease (GVHD) remained common
      and lead to significant morbidity and mortality after HCT. Currently patients are still
      closely watched in the inpatient or day hospital environment, though recent practices allow
      patients more freedom. This study randomizes eligible patients to receive post-transplant
      care at home vs. in the hospital or clinic, per standard of care. The primary objective is to
      compare the incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD at 6 months in patients receiving
      patient-centered medical home (PCMH) vs standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is an exciting strategy that has the potential to
      revolutionize hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Traditionally, home care has
      been used for palliative care in end-stage cancer patients and in geriatrics. More recently
      the PCMH has gained increasing adoption for both primary care and care of medically complex
      patients. The core of the PCMH lies in the interaction between the healthcare team, the
      patient's family and support, and above all, the patient. These interactions can be enhanced
      through health information technologies such as the electronic health record (EHR) and
      videoconferencing via iPads. In addition, collection of patient reported outcomes (PRO) will
      allow feedback and adjustments.

      This integration is especially important when considering the multiple complicated needs of
      the HCT patient: navigating a Byzantine healthcare system that often requires input and
      coordination from multiple specialists including transplanters, hematologists, infectious
      disease physicians, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, pharmacists, social
      workers, financial coordinators, etc.; managing medication regimens to prevent infections,
      GVHD, and other complications (not to mention avoiding drug and food interactions); adjusting
      to multiple side effects including fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
      rashes, pain, anxiety, stress, organ failure, etc.; the sheer amount of time required for
      healthcare visits, lab draws, waiting for results, infusions, transfusions, etc.; physical
      and psychosocial struggles of living with a life-threatening disease; and the burdens of a
      treatment that often seems as debilitating as the disease. The PCMH provides
      patient-centered, comprehensive, accessible, and coordinated care and a systems-based
      approach to quality and safety: these attributes are essential to the successful care of the
      complicated HCT patient. this approach has the potential to lower overall costs while
      preserving or increasing the quality of care.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the incidence (number of events) of grade II-IV acute GVHD at 6 months. GVHD will be evaluated daily by advanced practice providers (APPs) according to standard criteria. The investigators will compare GVHD incidence rates between treatment arms using survival type regression modeling that takes competing risks into account. They will examine cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models as well as the proportional subdistribution hazard regression model developed by Fine and Gray. While the primary treatment comparison will be unadjusted, adjustment for covariates to explore the impact of various risk factors will also be performed.</description>

    <description>Shannon diversity index will be compared using unpaired two-sided Student's t tests with a more stringent cut-off of 0.0125 given multiple comparisons, by the Bonferroni correction for 4 time periods of independent comparisons. Comparisons of bacterial populations will be made by using the Adonis non-parametric method from within the Qiime package using UnifFrac distance matrices from the populations being compared. P values will be calculated with α= 0.05. Metastatistics will be used for further statistical analyses of population structure, membership, and diversity with metadata such as time from transplant and dietary measurements such as caloric intake. Changes in specific bacterial families of interest will be compared using a two-sided Student's t test, with normality confirmed by D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus test with p≤0.05. All other comparisons will be done using two-sided Mann-Whitney tests.</description>

    <description>Day-to-Day Care:
Advanced Practice Providers (APP) will travel to subjects' homes in the morning, where they will perform the same daily assessment as standard care. They will draw labs and bring them back to the hospital for processing. When results are available, a second home visit is made to deliver necessary interventions. Subjects will have internet access through cellular-networked iPads and have daily videoconferences with their physicians. Daily follow up at home will continue until discharge as per above criteria.
Caregivers: identified by the subject as the person taking primary care of them will answer surveys and also collect stool samples to analyze in conjunction with those from subjects.</description>

    <description>These subjects will begin as inpatients or outpatients, where advanced practice providers (APPs) (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) will perform histories and physical exams. Nurses will collect labs and providers will enter orders in our electronic health record (EHR). All steps will be repeated daily until discharge to home. Suitability for discharge is determined by standard clinical criteria including stable blood counts, freedom from active or severe complications (e.g. active infection, severe GVHD), and ability to care for self.
