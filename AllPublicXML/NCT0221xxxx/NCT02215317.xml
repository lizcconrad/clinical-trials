  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elucidating the effects of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on cardiovascular outcomes is
      crucial in risk assessments and therapeutic recommendations for affected individuals. The
      Sleep and Stent Study is a multi-center observational study investigating the relationships
      between OSA and cardiovascular outcomes in patients treated with percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data suggest that OSA may lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes after PCI.
      However, existing data were generated from small-scale, single-center studies. Therefore, in
      the Sleep and Stent Study, the investigators aim to conduct a large-scale multi-national
      cohort study to determine the association between OSA and the incidence of adverse
      cardiovascular outcomes over a long-term follow-up period. The investigators hypothesize that
      OSA is an independent risk factor for the development of major adverse cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in coronary artery disease patients treated with PCI. Results
      from the Sleep and Stent Study will advance the fundamental understanding of the burden and
      prognostic implications of OSA in patients undergoing PCI for coronary artery disease.
