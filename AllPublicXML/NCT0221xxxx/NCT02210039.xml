  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to test the feasibility and tolerability of a SECM imaging probe in
      patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE).

      A total of 12 subjects will undergo SECM probe imaging while they are under conscious
      sedation. Spiral SECM imaging will be performed continuously over a pre-determined length.
      Patients will later be asked for their feedback.

    <textblock>
      Subjects with a previous diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus will be recruited in the study and
      undergo SECM probe imaging while using conscious sedation, pulse oximetry and blood pressure
      monitoring. The probe will be inserted the predetermined required distance in the esophagus
      using a guide wire.

      Once the SECM imaging probe is in place, spiral SECM image data will be continuously
      collected over a pre-determined length (approximately 5cm).
