      The demographic data, mortality rates and clinical diagnoses of the patients who were
      evaluated, intubated and interned to ICU by the anesthesiology department due to an urgent
      consultation call from the emergency department in 2010-2011.

      Primary outcome: an examination of demographic data, predicted mortality rates and the
      clinical diagnosis of the patients Secondary outcome: to determine the terminal cancer ratio
      Inclusion criteria: patients throughout the hole hospital whom was intubated by the
      anaesthesiology team due to an emergency consultation call Exclusion criteria: patients who
      refused treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The demographic data and findings completed in the Emergency Department were obtained from
      the patient cards and information related to existing diseases was obtained from the patient
      records for the cases included in the study.

      Predicted mortality values were calculated for each patient with Apache II and SAPS II values
      using the worst or most critical physiological and laboratory parameters in the first 24
      hours in the Emergency Department.
