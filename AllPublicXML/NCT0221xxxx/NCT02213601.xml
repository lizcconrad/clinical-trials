  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to compare the efficacy of an 8-week yoga intervention, relative
      to a wait-list control (WLC) condition, for improving psychological functioning and
      health-related quality of life in depressed postpartum women. It was hypothesized that the
      yoga intervention would be significantly more efficacious than the wait-list control
      condition in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improving health-related
      quality of life, at the end of the 8-week yoga intervention.

    <measure>Change from baseline in depression on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) is a validated and reliable measure of the severity of depressive symptoms, and is used extensively in depression treatment studies. The 17-item HDRS is sensitive to treatment change in the postpartum population, and is a valid indicator of depression severity in postpartum depression despite the overlap between somatic HDRS items and typical experiences of postpartum women.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in panic symptoms on the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms Panic Scale (IDAS) at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) is a 64-item factor analytically derived, multidimensional inventory that uses a 5-point Likert scale to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety over the past 2 weeks (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely). The IDAS has strong internal consistency reliability, with median coefficient alphas greater than .80, and has been validated for use in a postpartum sample. The Panic scale is an 8-item measure that assesses symptoms traditionally linked to anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) is a 64-item factor analytically derived, multidimensional inventory that uses a 5-point Likert scale to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety over the past 2 weeks (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely). The IDAS has strong internal consistency reliability, with median coefficient alphas greater than .80, and has been validated for use in a postpartum sample. The Social Anxiety scale is a 5-item measure that assesses symptoms traditionally linked to anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in traumatic intrusion symptoms on the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms Traumatic Intrusions Scale (IDAS) at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) is a 64-item factor analytically derived, multidimensional inventory that uses a 5-point Likert scale to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety over the past 2 weeks (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely). The IDAS has strong internal consistency reliability, with median coefficient alphas greater than .80, and has been validated for use in a postpartum sample. The Traumatic Intrusions scale is a 4-item measure that assesses symptoms traditionally linked to anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in health-related quality of life symptoms on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) at week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a well-validated measure of Health-related Quality of Life and consists of 36 items reflecting 8 domains of health: 1) role-limiting physical, 2) role-limiting emotional, 3) physical functioning, 4) social functioning, 5) mental health, 6) energy and vitality, 7) pain, and 8) general health perceptions.</description>
