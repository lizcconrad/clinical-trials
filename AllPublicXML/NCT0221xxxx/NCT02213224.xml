    <textblock>
      The aim of this current study was to assess the therapeutic effects of perindopril and
      telmisartan for hypertensive patients with NAFLD and make comparison between the therapeutic
      effects of these two kind of drugs.

      This study is a randomized parallel control clinical trial which would be carried out in
      Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University.

      About one hundred and eighty patients would be randomly assigned to perindopril,telmisartan
      and amlodipine three groups.

      Inclusion criteria:

      18-70 years old patients who were diagnosed with mild-moderate hypertension and NAFLD; The
      patients did not take ACEIs or ARBs drugs six weeks before the inclusion; Patients agreed to
      participate in the trial and signed the informed consent.

      Exclusion criteria:

      There are no coexisting causes for chronic liver disease, such as viral,

      Patients with serious primary diseases; Patients with mental disorder or can not take the
      medicine regularly; Pregnancy and nursing mothers; Allergic constitution or intolerance to
      ACEIs or ARBs drugs. Outcome measures include Cap value of FibroScan,angiotensin
