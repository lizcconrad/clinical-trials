      The patients will receive hepatectomy as a 2 stage procedure. In the first surgical procedure
      liver segments 2-3 are removed and liver donor segments 2-3 inserted. After growth of donor
      segments 2-3, the remaining liver segments of the recipient are removed. The patient will at
      this time have only donor liver tissue in place.
