  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single rising oral doses of BI
      44370 TA in healthy male volunteers, to compare a drinking solution vs. a tablet formulation
      and to assess intra-individual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability by re-dosing two further
