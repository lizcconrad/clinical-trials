  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to widespread use of cross-sectional imaging modalities, pancreatic cysts are common in
      abdominal image. These lesions encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from benign to malignant.
      The diagnosing specific type of cystic lesion is limited in spite of recent advances of
      diagnostic modalities. Surgical resection is generally recommended for malignant and
      potentially malignant lesions. However, surgical resection has significant morbidity and
      sometimes mortality. Recently, a few study of EUS-guided ethanol lavage for cystic tumors of
      the pancreas reported that complete resolution was achieved in only one-third of patients.
      Ethanol lavage of pancreatic cysts may be alternative method to surgical resection.

      The purpose of this study is the double ethanol lavage is a safe and effective method for
      treatment in those with the indeterminate pancreas cysts.

    <description>A radial echoendoscope and a 22 gauge needle were then used for cyst fluid aspiration and ethanol lavage.
The 80 percent volume of cyst fluid was aspirated, and the pure ethanol was injected into the collapsed cyst until the original shape was restored. After 3-5 minutes, the reaspiration of the injected ethanol was then performed. The pure ethanol was reinjected into the collapsed cyst, followed by reaspiration of maximal possible volume for 3-5 minutes.</description>
