      The purpose of this study is to determine the usability of the Medical Information Device #1
      (MIND1) system in adults with schizophrenia who are treated with oral aripiprazole.

      Poor adherence to medication is a well-recognized problem in psychiatric patients. Although a
      variety of treatment models have been developed to improve management of patients in general
      and medication adherence in particular, poor medication adherence remains a major barrier to
      achieving optimal health.

      The MIND1 System includes a drug-device combination, a patch, and application software to
      convey level of activity and rest and to mark events through the act of ingestion.

      The purpose of this open-label study is to determine the usability of the Medical Information
      Device #1 (MIND1) System in adults with schizophrenia. Approximately 32 subjects with
      schizophrenia, between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive) who are currently prescribed and
      stabilized on oral aripiprazole, will be enrolled.
