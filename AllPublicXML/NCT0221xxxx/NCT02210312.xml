  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) describes a condition where cognitive functions
      such as attention, perception, concentration, learning, abstract thinking and problem solving
      are impaired postoperatively. These changes can be resolved after weeks and months. In some
      cases, changes are permanent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aetiology of POCD is multifactorial. One described risk factor is preoperative existing
      depressive symptoms in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      A total of 300 consecutive patients and 80 healthy controls will be enrolled in this study.
      Patients will be followed up at 7 days, 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. The co gnitive
      function will be tested and compared to tests done before surgery. Postoperatively - from the
      day of operation until the 7th day (except day 6) - grade of sedation, agitation, signs of
      delirium, pain, cardiac, respiratory, renal and infectious complications will be monitored.

      Next to preoperative depressive symptoms we will also evaluate a diagnosed depression,
      anxiety, pain, health-related quality of life, physical comorbidities, adrenal cortical
      insufficiency, type of anaesthesia, intraoperative blood loss, organ complications,
      postoperative delirium, baseline cognitive functioning and the number of
      operations/anaesthetics in the study period after the initial operation as further potential
      predictors of POCD.

      In addition, laboratory values and certain medications will be documented. These include:
      anaemia, hypercalcaemia, thyroidal gland hormones, electrolytes, creatinine, urea, glomerular
      filtration rate and cortisone therapy.

The items are answered on a 4-point rating scale from 0 to 3 with a scale score varying between 0 and 21. Higher scores represent higher distress (cut-off- scores: 0-7 = normal, 8-10 = borderline, 11-14 = severe symptoms, &gt;=15 = very severe symptoms).</description>
