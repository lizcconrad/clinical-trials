  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREHAB study is a clinical trial where frail patients waiting for heart surgery are
      randomly chosen to either receive the current standard of care or to participate in an 8-week
      exercise/education program at a community-based cardiac rehabilitation facility. Patients can
      wait for elective heart surgery for as long as 3-4 months. During this time, individuals are
      often fearful of making things worse, causing them to stop being active and further
      deteriorate their physical condition. This wait period presents a potential opportunity for
      health care providers to engage the patient to take control of their self-managed care prior
      to surgery with the intent of improving post-surgical outcomes. Patients randomized to the
      PREHAB intervention group will participate in supervised exercise twice per week in a program
      designed to improve physical functioning and exercise capacity. The investigators hypothesize
      that the PREHAB program for frail elderly patients awaiting an elective cardiac surgery will
      reduce frailty, improve exercise capacity, improve physical activity behaviour, improve
      in-hospital outcomes, improve clinical outcomes 3 months and 1 year postoperatively, and
      improve overall quality of life.

      PREHAB will be a three centre prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint (PROBE)
      controlled trial using assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. The study will be
      conducted at three academic, tertiary care hospitals (St. Boniface Hospital, Winnipeg, MB,
      Montreal Heart Institute. Montreal QC and Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax,
      NS) and one non-academic hospital (Saint John Regional Health Centre, Saint John, NB) that
      perform cardiac surgery. These sites were chosen based on similar patient populations and
      surgical waitlist times. Additionally, each of these sites are partnered with one or more
      community-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) centres, which are certified medical fitness
      facilities dedicated to improving the health of the community through health promotion,
      disease prevention and rehabilitation services. These facilities offer expert guidance from
      certified professionals, innovative health enhancement programs, and provide integrated
      medical, rehabilitative and fitness services. The investigators intend to recruit a total of
      244 participants to the study (122 per study arm), anticipating a 20% dropout rate to achieve
      an eventual sample size of 194 participants.

      Patients in the PREHAB group will receive, in addition to standard of care, an eight-week
      comprehensive exercise therapy and education program at a community-based CR facility. This
      program will target both the physical and psycho-social-cognitive aspects of cardiac disease
      and frailty. In brief, participants will be required to complete an intake health status
      assessment by the CR team including a physiotherapist, cardiovascular nurse, and dietitian
      and complete a symptom-limited graded exercise stress test according to the American College
      of Sports Medicine Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription 7th Edition. Patients
      will be asked to complete at least two sessions of supervised, structured exercise class plus
      have the option to attend one additional exercise class per week for eight-weeks, with
      progression to a moderate to high-intensity interval program based on the supervised
      assessment of the patient's capabilities. This has been shown to be safe and effective in
      unrepaired heart failure and elderly patients. PREHAB participants will also attend four
      education sessions on topics such as risk factor reduction, medication use, cardiovascular
      physiology, smoking cessation, healthy eating, exercise, and stress management and promotion
      of self-managed care.

    <description>Patients in the standard care group will receive care as is currently delivered to patients awaiting cardiac surgery at each site. At present, patients are advised to rest and participate in very light intensity physical activity while awaiting surgery. At 1-2 weeks prior to their scheduled surgical date, the patient attends a single three hour cardiac pre-assessment with a nurse practitioner and cardiac anesthesiologist. In addition, a cardiac nurse counsels each patient on healthy behaviors (e.g. smoking cessation, diet, exercise).</description>
