      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether SUDOSCAN is a valid, accurate clinical
      device for the the determination of sweat gland function in the pediatric population.

      Primary Objective: To measure sweat gland function in a pediatric population

      Secondary Objective: To determine thresholds on the SUDOSCAN scale for abnormal sweat gland
      function in the pediatric population
