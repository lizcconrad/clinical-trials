  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of allergic diseases, especially airway allergic diseases, has increased
      dramatically over the last twenty years all over the world including Lithuania. Allergic
      diseases are associated with significantly reduced quality of life and can sometimes cause
      death. Allergic diseases have turned into an important economic and social burden and
      nowadays take a more and more important place in the health system. Despite all intensive
      investigations, the pathogenesis of allergic airway diseases still remains unclear. As
      allergic diseases have a systemic pattern and multicomponent pathogenesis, it is important to
      investigate not individual cells, but examine various inflammatory cells instead, including
      their biological products and possible cellular interactions along the course of allergic
      diseases. This research focuses on the cells that are claimed to be important in the
      pathogenesis of allergic airway diseases, i.e. a newly found effector T helper cell subset
      (Th9 cells), which still lacks deeper investigation, and the main inflammatory cell,
      eosinophil. This study aims at determining the importance the way the Th9 lymphocytes
      perform, the eosinophil's activity, as well as molecular factors affecting these cells has in
      the process of prognostication of allergic airway diseases, namely allergic rhinitis and
      allergic asthma. An allergen challenge test will be performed in order to define the meaning
      of pathogenetic changes. The results of this research may reveal useful information in the
      course of allergic diseases and may be valuable when creating strategic principles of
      prophylaxis. The findings could be used for prevention and early diagnostics of allergic
      diseases and it could also open doors to discovering new and effective treatment.
