  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic and safety and tolerability
      profile of TAK-079 following a single intravenous (IV) infusion or subcutaneous (SC)
      administration at escalating dose levels in healthy participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is TAK-079. TAK-079 is being tested to find a safe and
      well-tolerated dose and to assess how TAK-079 is processed by the body. This study will look
      at pharmacokinetics, side effects, and laboratory results in people who take TAK-079 and is
      designed as a randomized single dose-rising study.

      Therefore, each subsequent cohort will not start until the previous cohort has completed and
      the results are reviewed. Each participant will receive TAK-079 or placebo once only as an IV
      infusion or by SC administration. The starting dose for IV will be 0.0003 mg/kg and SC dose
      of 0.01 or 0.03 mg/kg was determined based on the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL)
      results from the 13-week good laboratory practice (GLP) monkey toxicology study. If this dose
      is well-tolerated, the next group will receive a higher dose, etc, until a maximal tolerated
      dose is reached with the highest dose not to exceed 1.0 mg/kg.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 17 weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic,
      including one 10-day period of confinement in the clinic. All participants will be contacted
      by telephone 14 days after the last visit to the clinic for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. AE was assessed according to severity; mild (transient and easily tolerated by the participant), moderate (causes the participant discomfort and interrupts the participant's usual activities) and severe (causes considerable interference with the participant's usual activities).</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. AE was assessed according to severity; mild (transient and easily tolerated by the participant), moderate (causes the participant discomfort and interrupts the participant’s usual activities) and severe (causes considerable interference with the participant’s usual activities).</description>
