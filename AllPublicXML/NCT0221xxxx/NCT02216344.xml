  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to validate the proposed claims for the OxiCable
      device, for pulse rate and saturation accuracy in a diverse subject population over a
      specified saturation range.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general procedure of invasive controlled hypoxia clinical studies is to directly compare
      test pulse oximeter measurements to saturation measurements made by a multi-wavelength
      CO-oximeter taken from arterial blood samples from healthy human subjects. Following arterial
      cannulation, hypoxia is induced by reducing the percent of inspired oxygen the subject
      breathes while simultaneous measurements are recorded from the test pulse oximeters and
      arterial blood samples at targeted levels of saturation.

    <description>The pulse oximetry devices were placed on subjects per the protocol. The subjects underwent gradual hypoxia and the output of the devices under test was compared to the SaO2 value as measured by a CO-Oximeter (the reference value), as outlined by ISO 80601, to ensure that the devices meet the specified performance claims.</description>

             assistant (PA), or advanced practice nurse; including a 12 lead ECG, a medical
             history, and blood test (complete blood count and sickle cell trait/disease screening)

          -  Meets specific demographic requirements for the monitoring device under study

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

          -  Able to participate for the duration of the evaluation

             or diastolic pressure greater than 90 mm Hg

             Novocain) or heparin

          -  Recent arterial cannulation (i.e., less than 30 days prior to study date)

          -  Six or more arterial cannulations of each (right &amp; left) radial artery
