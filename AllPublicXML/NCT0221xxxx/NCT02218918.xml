    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation became a vital part of management in COPD patients in form of
      activity modification, dietary and pharmacological optimisation. But access to traditional
      supervised aerobic (treadmill) walking is debatable fact due to economical and staffing
      expertise in developing countries like India. The investigators designed a randomised
      controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of ground based walking over traditional
      treadmill walking in improving quality of life in COPD patients.

      Background: COPD is increasing mortality and morbidity globally. Pulmonary rehabilitation is
      a promising management in COPD management. Exercise training in form of aerobic (walking,
      cycling) and strength training is an important part of pulmonary rehabilitation. However
      access to traditional supervised exercise programs is questionable debate even in developed
      western countries. Unsupervised ground walk programs are often told by physicians but not
      properly prescribed.

      Objective: To assess whether ground or treadmill walk is better in improving functional
      capacity and quality of life in COPD patients Design: Randomised controlled trial Procedure:
      Two arms 1) supervised ground walk training 2) supervised treadmill walk training. The
      intensity and progression of walk is based on 6 minute walk test. Quality of life will be
      gauged through Chronic respiratory questionnaire and functional capacity through 6 minute
      walk test.

      Statistical analysis: Descriptive analysis for characterisation. Normality though Kolmogorov
      and Variables will be compared through paired and unpaired student t tests
