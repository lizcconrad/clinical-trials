      This is a proof of concept study that evaluates the response to oxidative stress in healthy
      men after taking plant concentrates.

      Sustained oxidative stress may cause hypertension, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome,
      cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions. Diets rich in natural antioxidants is
      associated with protective effects on the investigators health. The strategy to prevent
      chronic disease development and in making up the nutritional gap in the investigators diet
      has shifted from vitamins and minerals supplementation to whole foods and whole food
      products.

      The objectives is to evaluate the effect of oxidative stress response of plant concentrate
      blends. Also, we'll confirm that vitamins, minerals and plant concentrates will not influence
      the biomarker expression that were monitored in the oxidative stress biomarkers. Lastly,
      collecting additional information on whether blends of plant concentrate have other potential
      health benefits.

      This study will test the dose-response of blends of plant concentrates. Healthy men (n=60)
      with low fruit and vegetable intake will participate in a 32 day or 46 days. Each treatment
      duration lasts 14 days. Microarray assay and real time-polymerase chain reaction will be
      performed.Genes associated with oxidative stress will me monitored. The outcome of this study
      will help us understand how to design and develop future antioxidant related products.
