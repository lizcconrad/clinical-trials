  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pulsed electromagnetic energy field
      (PEMF) therapy is effective in the treatment of persistent pain following total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group prospective pilot study of
      the analgesic effectiveness of twice-daily PEMF therapy in the treatment of persistent
      post-operative pain following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). Following a run-in period of 10
      days to collect their baseline pain intensity scores, activity levels and opioid consumption,
      eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive therapy with an active PEMF
      device or an identical inactive Sham device. Subjects will self-treat twice daily for 60 days
      while at home. Subjects will collect electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data each
      morning through Day 75. Subjects will be evaluated at the research center for Interim Visits
      at Day 21, Day 41, Day 61 and Day 75 for assessment of safety, concomitant medications, range
      of motion, weight, peripheral edema, and quality of life outcomes. At Day 90, Day 150, and
      Day 240 assessment of pain intensity, opioid consumption, safety, review of concomitant
      medications and interval history will be performed, with data collected via telephone
      contact.

    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Day 60 as compared to Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from Baseline in Pain Intensity (PI): a validated 11-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) with scores (0-10) collected as patient-reported outcomes on an electronic diary (ePRO). A score of 0 represents 'No Pain' while a score of 10 represents &quot;Worst Pain Imaginable&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean change from Day 0 to Day 75</time_frame>
    <description>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): a validated knee-specific instrument that measures the short-term and long-term symptoms and function associated with knee injury. KOOS consists of 5 categories: pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation, and knee related quality of life. Patients are asked to answer questions relating to these categories and respond with Never/None/Not at all, Rarely/Monthly/Mild, Sometimes/Moderate/Weekly, Often/Severe/Daily or Always/Extreme/Totally/Constantly. Each response gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The mean change in score from baseline to Day 75 is displayed below.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Responders at Day 75 (compared to baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Responders: Defined as subjects with a 5-point decrease in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score.
BDI is a validated self-reported assessment of current symptoms of depressive disorders, with total scores ranging from 0 to 63. The BDI scale consists of 21 groups of statements with each score/response ranging from 0 to 3. Higher scores represent greater depression. The BDI was conducted at baseline prior to study device treatments and again at Day 61.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 75</time_frame>
    <description>Responder Analysis at Day 75 (patents stating they are &quot;Improved&quot; to &quot;Much Improved&quot;) using the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). PGIC is a 7-point validated categorical scale of overall change in status since initiation of treatment with the study device. PGIC allows subjects to integrate into one overall evaluation the different aspects of their response to treatment, including pain reduction, improvement in functioning and side effects. Subjects select one of the following response at the end of treatment: Very Much Worse, Much Worse, Minimally Worse, No Change, Minimally Improved, Improved, or Much Improved.</description>

          <title>Pain Catastrophizing Score</title>
          <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a validated assessment tool for the extent to which patients catastrophize their pain. The scale asks 13 questions about types of thoughts and feelings associated with pain. Responses are based upon a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4, where 0=not at all and 4=all the time. A total score is calculated ranging from 0 to 52. Higher scores represent a higher catastrophization of pain.
The PCS will be administered at the research center during the Screening Visit, and scored by research personnel.</description>

        <description>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): a validated knee-specific instrument that measures the short-term and long-term symptoms and function associated with knee injury. KOOS consists of 5 categories: pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation, and knee related quality of life. Patients are asked to answer questions relating to these categories and respond with Never/None/Not at all, Rarely/Monthly/Mild, Sometimes/Moderate/Weekly, Often/Severe/Daily or Always/Extreme/Totally/Constantly. Each response gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The mean change in score from baseline to Day 75 is displayed below.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</title>
          <description>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): a validated knee-specific instrument that measures the short-term and long-term symptoms and function associated with knee injury. KOOS consists of 5 categories: pain, other symptoms, function in daily living, function in sport and recreation, and knee related quality of life. Patients are asked to answer questions relating to these categories and respond with Never/None/Not at all, Rarely/Monthly/Mild, Sometimes/Moderate/Weekly, Often/Severe/Daily or Always/Extreme/Totally/Constantly. Each response gets a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. The mean change in score from baseline to Day 75 is displayed below.</description>
          <population>Discrepancy in Numbers of Participants Analyzed is due to the number of subjects completing the Day 75 assessment. Not all subjects that were enrolled and had baseline data captured completed the Day 75 assessment. Subjects without a Day 75 assessment were left out of the analysis.</population>

BDI is a validated self-reported assessment of current symptoms of depressive disorders, with total scores ranging from 0 to 63. The BDI scale consists of 21 groups of statements with each score/response ranging from 0 to 3. Higher scores represent greater depression. The BDI was conducted at baseline prior to study device treatments and again at Day 61.</description>

PGIC is a 7-point validated categorical scale of overall change in status since initiation of treatment with the study device. PGIC allows subjects to integrate into one overall evaluation the different aspects of their response to treatment, including pain reduction, improvement in functioning and side effects. Subjects select one of the following response at the end of treatment: Very Much Worse, Much Worse, Minimally Worse, No Change, Minimally Improved, Improved, or Much Improved.</description>

            <title>Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Device</title>
            <description>Pulsed Electromagnetic Field therapy device; self-administered at home twice daily for 30 minutes.
Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Device (Provant): The PEMF device delivers non-thermal, non-ionizing pulsed electromagnetic energy to the target tissue, using 27.12 megahertz pulses lasting 42 microseconds and delivered 1000 times per second. The system generates an electromagnetic field that is continuously monitored and regulated to ensure consistent dosing. The therapeutic electromagnetic field is delivered by means of an applicator pad that is placed against the treatment site. The active and sham devices will be identical in appearance and all other physical characteristics in order to maintain the masking of the treatment.</description>
