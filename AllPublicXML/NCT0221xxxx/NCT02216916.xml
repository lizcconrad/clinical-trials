  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer and more than 650,000 new cases are
      diagnosed each year worldwide. About 60% of the HNSCC patients present with unresectable
      locally advanced disease at diagnosis and treated with multimodality approach. Despite such
      approach, majority (70%) of patients develop local or/and regional recurrences. Additional
      10% of patients present with distant metastasis at diagnosis. Most patients with recurrent or
      metastatic disease are treated with single agent chemotherapy, combination chemotherapy or
      targeted therapies.

      Despite its public health magnitude, HNSCC in Asian countries has received a limited
      attention for the drug development and cancer-related research. In fact, HNSCC ranked 7th
      among men and 10th among women by incidence in China, the largest producer and consumer of
      tobacco and alcohol. Recently, Chen et al. documented a 1:1:2 subset distribution for cancers
      of oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx in China, similar to the distribution reported in Korea
      but quite different from the general distribution of 5:2:3 in whites. Ethnic disparities in
      HNSCC also include its prognosis and this is partly explained by HPV-active disease ratio and
      genetic factors. Therefore, there is a strong need for an additional research in patients
      with HNSCC in Asia.

      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is often over-expressed, and have been related to
      poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC. The association between EGFR-activated signaling
      pathways and tumor cell survival are well documented in many studies. EGFR targeting
      strategies showed clinical anti-tumor efficacy in patients with HNSCC, especially with
      monoclonal antibody, cetuximab. In the Extreme study, it was shown that the addition of
      cetuximab to platinum-5-FU significantly prolonged the median overall survival from 7.4
      months to 10.1 months compared to platinum-5FU alone in the first-line setting.

      HM781-36B is a irreversible pan-HER inhibitor. In preclinical studies, HM781-36B has much
      lower IC50 values than gefitinib in cell lines engineered to express EGFRvIII mutations and
      produces tumor growth inhibition in gefitinib-resistant xenografts. A phase I trial of
      HM781-36B in patients with advanced solid tumors showed clinically significant anti-tumor
      activity and a phase II trials of HM781-36B in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and
      advanced gastric cancer are currently ongoing.

      We suggest a phase II trial of HM781-36B in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who
      are resistant or ineligible/intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of current
      trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of HM781-36B and to identify
      biomarker to predict the tumor response to HM781-36B.
