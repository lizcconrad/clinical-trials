  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today about 80% childhood cancer patients become long-time survivors. In spite of the high
      cure rates the diagnosis cancer is associated with a variety of disease and treatment-related
      psychological and physical impairments mostly present into adulthood. So the attention has to
      focus on the improvement of these problems such as motor limitation, dysfunction of the
      cardiovascular system, reduced muscle strength, overweight, osteoporosis and diminished
      quality of life (Qol). Although exercisel intervention studies in this field are generally
      scarce, the results of these studies are promising. Up to now studies during the acute phase
      of treatment are missing almost completely. The aim of this feasibility study is to evaluate
      the potential benefits of a modular exercise intervention program for childhood cancer
      patients startunf in parallel with treatment and longlasting for one year. Across two years
      cancer patients of the Children's Hospital of the University Clinic of Heidelberg aged 5-21
      years, free of any contraindications for physical activity will be recruited. All
      participants are asked to complete a physical assessment battery (strength, endurance and
      balance capacity, posture control, functional mobility, range of motion) and additionally two
      questionnaires concerning Qol and motivation, at baseline and every three months following
      one year

    <description>During their inpatient hospitalization the participants perform 3-5x weekly guided training sessions about 15-30min. The intervention includes: game console-based training using Nintendo WiiÂ® (endurance, strength endurance and balance), age-specific resistance training and sessions of body awareness. During the outpatient phases the participants perform a home-based exercise training 3-5x weekly using a training manual. In addition, the patients obtain a movement diary and a pedometer for documenting their activity level.</description>
