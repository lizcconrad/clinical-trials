  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of intracardiac thrombi and their propensity for systemic embolism is a major
      concern in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) undergoing
      cardioversion and ablation procedures. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the clinical
      gold standard imaging modality for visualization of the right atrial appendage (RAA) and left
      atrial appendage (LAA) for detection of thrombi as well as risk factors associated with
      thrombus formation, including spontaneous echo contrast and low LAA velocity. However, TEE is
      a moderately invasive procedure that incurs additional risk, cost, and patient discomfort. In
      addition, thrombus detection via TEE may be ambiguous, and another tool capable of confirming
      uncertain TEE findings is desirable. This is particularly crucial in cases when adequate LAA
      imaging cannot be acquired or if TEE is clinically contraindicated, requiring alternative
      imaging modalities that can visualize these structures.

      Phased-array intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) provides high-imaging resolution and is
      routinely used during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures for transseptal puncture
      and periprocedural catheter visualization. A majority of imaging acquired during AF ablation
      is performed with the ICE catheter in the right atrium (RA). However, these standard views
      are often unable to provide sufficient visualization of the LAA structure due to the
      relatively long distance between the ICE catheter and LAA.

      Placement of the ICE catheter in the pulmonary artery (PA) provides improved visualization of
      the LAA over other locations by reducing the anatomic distance between the imaging catheter
      and structure of interest. Recent retrospective studies have confirmed improved assessment of
      the LAA with ICE imaging from the PA and equivocal sensitivity and specificity when compared
      with TEE for evaluation of LAA thrombus. However, these studies did not systematically
      evaluate the presence of SEC, flow velocity, the LAA dimensions, or the RAA.

      Although these studies support the use of ICE imaging from the PA to clarify or confirm TEE
      findings, a prospective and blinded study evaluating both the LAA and RAA in its entirety is
      required. We hypothesize that this prospective and blinded study will confirm ICE as
      non-inferior to TEE in the assessment of LAA and RAA structure and for the detection of
      thrombi.

      Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the clinical standard for diagnosis of left atrial
      appendage (LAA) and right atrial appendage (RAA) thrombi before cardioversion or
      instrumentation of the left atrium during ablation proce- dures.1-5 Occasionally, TEE cannot
      be performed because of anatomic limitations requiring an alternative imaging strategy to
      exclude LAA thrombi. Phased-array intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is routinely used
      during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures to guide transseptal puncture and detect
      complications. The standard position of the transducer is in the right atrium (RA). This
      allows adequate visualization of the interatrial septum and body of the left atrium (LA) but
      not of the LAA because of significant physical distance from the transducer. Imaging of the
      LAA from closer anatomic structures such as the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and
      pulmonary artery (PA) can improve visualization of the LAA. If ICE provided imaging of the
      LAA comparable to TEE with a good safety profile, it could potentially serve as an
      alternative to TEE in patients undergoing catheter ablation. Such an approach could reduce
      risk, cost, and patient discomfort associated with TEE combined with ICE. In this prospective
      blinded study, we sought to directly compare the sensitivity and specificity of TEE with ICE
      for detection of LAA and RAA anatomy and thrombus in patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias
      undergoing catheter ablation.

    <description>The right atrial appendage (RAA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) will be assessed for the presence or absence of intracardiac thrombi with the Siemens AcuNav Ultrasound catheter. This is also performed with the standard of care modality, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with both operators blinded to the opposing imaging modality. The presence of LAA thrombi requires cancellation of the clinical procedure. After a determination has been made by both operators regarding the presence or absence of thrombi will investigators be unblinded to the opposing imaging modality result. If intracardiac thrombi was detected, the procedure was cancelled according to standard clinical guidelines and practice. There is no follow-up data collected. Participants were followed during enrollment and the clinical ablation procedure which is an average of a 6 hour period.</description>
