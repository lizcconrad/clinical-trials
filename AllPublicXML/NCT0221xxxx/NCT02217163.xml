  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high risk multiple myeloma have shorter remission periods and reduced overall
      survival. Prognostic significance of minimal residual disease negative remission is being
      highlighted in many of the newer studies.

      The current phase 2 study investigates the combination of carfilzomib together with
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in patients with high risk multiple myeloma in younger
      transplantation eligible patients.

      Carfilzomib is administered over 30 minutes as an infusion. For cycle 1 only, Carfilzomib is
      administered at 20mg/m2 IV on days 1 and 2, followed by escalation to 56mg/m2 on days 8,9,15
      and 16 on a 28 day cycle. Patients who tolerate 56mg/m2 dose are kept at this dose for the
      subsequent cycles on Days 1,2,8,9,15,16 on a 28 day cycle. Dose and schedule modifications
      for intolerable side effects are detailed in the protocol. Additionally Cyclophosphamide is
      given a fixed dose of 500mg once per week orally, along with dexamethasone is given on the
      days of Carfilzomib administration, 30 minutes to 4 hours prior to Carfilzomib. Patients will
      undergo blood tests weekly and serum protein electrophoresis every 4 weeks during treatment.

      Within completion of the 8 cycles of treatment patients would undergo stem cell collection
      using chemotherapy and growth factor mobilization. After completion of up to 8 cycles of
      treatment autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) will be conducted. Patients who
      achieve stringent CR before 8 cycles will undergo bone marrow biopsy for minimal residual
      disease (MRD) analysis by flow cytometry (MPFC). If MRD negativity by MPFC has been achieved,
      they may proceed directly to autologous BMT if possible, or if MRD positive, continue to
      complete 8 cycles of treatment and proceed to autologous BMT . Following bone marrow
      transplantation, there will be staging investigations including blood and bone marrow
      investigations and MRD analysis MPFC. Patients who achieve MRD negativity by MPFC will be
      managed expectantly by watch and wait. Patients who are MRD positive at this stage will
      undergo further consolidation and maintenance for 2 years or disease progression. Follow up
      would extend till a minimum of 2 years from completion of the study.
