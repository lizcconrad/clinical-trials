  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy, dose-ranging and safety profiles of A006, an Albuterol dry
      powder inhaler (DPI), in the dose range of 110 to 220 mcg per dose in comparison to a DPI
      Placebo Control and an Albuterol metered dose inhaler (MDI) Active Control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of A006 and to assist in
      identifying the optimum dose of A006 for future clinical studies. Proventil® HFA MDI, a
      currently marketed Albuterol MDI product, will be used as an Active Control. The study also
      employs a Placebo Control DPI, which has the same configuration as the A006 DPI except that
      it contains no active ingredient.

    <description>The forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) is measured with a clinically accepted model of spirometer. Subjects perform a pre-dose baseline FEV1 prior to dosing and perform subsequent FEV1 tests at 5, 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after dosing during each treatment period. Area under the curve (AUC), from baseline to 6 hours post-dose, for the treatment period is calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Statistical analysis is performed using a one-sided t-test.</description>
