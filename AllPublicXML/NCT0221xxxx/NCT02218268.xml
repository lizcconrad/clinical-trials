  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using radial artery tonometry to study arterial stiffness, the plan is to study a cohort of
      65 children with Type I diabetes mellitus. This prospective, crossover study will help
      determine if there is an acute increase in arterial stiffness in children with Type I
      diabetes mellitus who do not give extra insulin to cover a meal. This will give more support
      to show why it is so critical to bolus every time they eat and to bolus on time to decrease
      cardiovascular consequences of poorly controlled diabetes. The hypothesis is that giving
      insulin before a meal compared to not giving insulin before a meal will be associated with
      lower arterial stiffness in children with type I diabetes.

      The subject will fast overnight (nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours). The subject
      will be asked to drink a mixed meal replacement drink (Boost) and will be randomized (like
      flipping a coin) to bolus insulin for the &quot;meal&quot; or to not bolus insulin using their standard
      insulin dose. Glucose will be monitored with a finger prick before they drink the meal
      replacement, 1 hour later and finally 2 hours after drinking the meal replacement.

      Stiffness of the blood vessel of the wrist will be determined using radial tonometry. Radial
      tonometry is safe and does not hurt. A pen like probe is placed on the blood vessel of the
      wrist. When the machine reads a good wave form the computer will calculate the stiffness of
      the blood vessel. This test will be done along with the glucose checks; before drinking the
      meal replacement drink, and 1 and 2 hours after drinking the meal replacement drink.

      During the next study visit, the subject will repeat the exact same study described above.
      However, this time they will receive the other insulin assignment they were assigned during
      the first study (either bolus or no bolus).

    <description>Determine the difference between acute effect of a mixed meal on radial artery stiffness in subjects with type I diabetes mellitus who do and who do not take an additional bolus of insulin. Radial tonometry is used to calculate the augmentation index (AI). AI is expressed as a percentage of the pulse pressure and represents the difference between the first and second peaks of the central arterial waveform. The stiffer the artery the more positive elevation of the AI and the machine will indicate stiffness using a color indicator (green less stiff and red being stiff). AI is measured using the SphygmoCor VX version 7.01 (AtCor Medical, Syndey, Australia). AI will be corrected to a heart rate of 75 to eliminate differences related to heart rate variation.</description>

They will be randomized either receive a pre-meal insulin bolus in conjunction with their Basal insulin bolus or receive their standard of care basal insulin bolus only. A mixed meal replacement (Boost) will be consumed. Glucose will be monitored with a finger prick before they drink the meal replacement, 1 hour later and finally 2 hours after drinking the meal replacement. Stiffness of the blood vessel of the wrist will be determined using radial tonometry and will be done at the same time as the glucose monitoring. This is a crossover study and all participants will take place in this arm after 3 months of their visit.</description>

        <title>Determine the Difference Between Acute Effect of a Mixed Meal on Radial Artery Stiffness in Subjects With Type I Diabetes Mellitus Who do and Who do Not Take an Additional Bolus of Insulin.</title>
        <description>Determine the difference between acute effect of a mixed meal on radial artery stiffness in subjects with type I diabetes mellitus who do and who do not take an additional bolus of insulin. Radial tonometry is used to calculate the augmentation index (AI). AI is expressed as a percentage of the pulse pressure and represents the difference between the first and second peaks of the central arterial waveform. The stiffer the artery the more positive elevation of the AI and the machine will indicate stiffness using a color indicator (green less stiff and red being stiff). AI is measured using the SphygmoCor VX version 7.01 (AtCor Medical, Syndey, Australia). AI will be corrected to a heart rate of 75 to eliminate differences related to heart rate variation.</description>

            <title>Pre-meal Bolus Then No Meal Bolus</title>
            <description>A meal replacement drink (Boost) and bolus of rapid insulin will be given to this group. Glucose will be monitored with a finger prick before they drink the meal replacement, 1 hour later and finally 2 hours after drinking the meal replacement. Stiffness of the blood vessel of the wrist will be determined using radial tonometry and will be done at the same time as the glucose monitoring.
Then 3 months later A meal replacement drink (Boost) will be given but the subject will not receive a meal bolus. Glucose will be monitored with a finger prick before they drink the meal replacement, 1 hour later and finally 2 hours after drinking the meal replacement. Stiffness of the blood vessel of the wrist will be determined using radial tonometry and will be done at the same time as the glucose monitoring.</description>
