  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of sustained virologic
      response (SVR) on cerebral metabolism as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
      and on neurocognition as measured by neurocognitive tests. This study will also evaluate the
      antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) for 12 weeks in treatment-naive or treatment-experienced adults.

      During the blinded treatment phase, participants will be randomized 2:1 to receive LDV/SOF
      FDC or placebo for 12 weeks. After the unblinding at the Posttreatment Week 4 visit,
      participants in the placebo group will be offered open-label treatment of LDV/SOF FDC for 12
      weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) Metabolic Ratio at 4 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy: NAA + NAAG</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Posttreatment Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>MRS was analyzed in the LCmodel program and measured in 3 specific areas of brain (basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). The cerebral metabolic signal N-acetylaspartate (NAA) + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) was analyzed. Spectroscopy results are expressed as metabolic ratio with creatine used as the control metabolite, so there are no units of measure.</description>

    <description>The BHS is a 20-item scale for measuring the extent of negative attitudes about the future (pessimism) as perceived by adolescents and adults. The BHS consists of 20 true-false statements. Each of the 20 statements is scored 1 or 0. Of the 20 true-false statements, 9 are keyed FALSE, and 11 are keyed TRUE to indicate endorsement of pessimism about the future. The item scores are summed to yield a total score that can range from 0 to 20 with higher scores indicating greater hopelessness.</description>

        <description>MRS was analyzed in the LCmodel program and measured in 3 specific areas of brain (basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). The cerebral metabolic signal N-acetylaspartate (NAA) + N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) was analyzed. Spectroscopy results are expressed as metabolic ratio with creatine used as the control metabolite, so there are no units of measure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neurocognitive Function at 4 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy: Memory T Score</title>
        <description>Neurocognitive function tests were administered by a licensed clinician. The sum of following neurocognitive test scores was used to determine the Memory T Score: visuospatial memory immediate total T score (BVMTTTs), visuospatial memory delayed T score (BVMTTDTS), verbal memory total T score (HVLTTTS), and verbal memory delayed T score (HVLTDTS).
For this analysis, Memory T Score (total) ranged from 80 to 320, with higher scores indicating better memory.</description>

          <description>Neurocognitive function tests were administered by a licensed clinician. The sum of following neurocognitive test scores was used to determine the Memory T Score: visuospatial memory immediate total T score (BVMTTTs), visuospatial memory delayed T score (BVMTTDTS), verbal memory total T score (HVLTTTS), and verbal memory delayed T score (HVLTDTS).
For this analysis, Memory T Score (total) ranged from 80 to 320, with higher scores indicating better memory.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Neurocognitive Function at 24 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy: Memory T Score</title>
        <description>Neurocognitive function tests were administered by a licensed clinician. The sum of following neurocognitive test scores was used to determine the Memory T Score: visuospatial memory immediate total T score (BVMTTTs), visuospatial memory delayed T score (BVMTTDTS), verbal memory total T score (HVLTTTS), and verbal memory delayed T score (HVLTDTS).
For this analysis, Memory T Score (total) ranged from 80 to 320, with higher scores indicating better memory.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a self-reporting, multi-item scale measuring 8 health concepts: 1) physical functioning, 2) role limitations due to physical health problems, 3) bodily pain, 4) general health, 5) vitality (energy/fatigue), 6) social functioning, 7) role limitations due to emotional problems and 8) mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). The first 6 concepts constitute the physical component summary. The total score is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 with lower scores representing more disability and higher scores representing less disability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life at 4 and 24 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy as Assessed by SF-36 Health Survey Scale - Mental Component Score</title>
        <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a self-reporting, multi-item scale measuring 8 health concepts: 1) physical functioning, 2) role limitations due to physical health problems, 3) bodily pain, 4) general health, 5) vitality (energy/fatigue), 6) social functioning, 7) role limitations due to emotional problems and 8) mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). The last 5 concepts constitute the mental component summary. The total score is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 with lower score representing more disability and higher scores representing less disability.</description>

CLDQ-HCV scores are calculated using participant responses to 29 questions divided into 4 domains: Activity/Energy, Emotion, Worry, and Systemic. An overall CLDQ-HCV score is calculated by taking the mean of all domain scores. Overall CLDQ-HCV scores range between 1 and 7, with higher scores representing better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life at 4 and 24 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy as Assessed by WPAI: Hepatitis C - Activity Impairment</title>
        <description>Activity impairment was measured using the WPAI: Hepatitis C questionnaire completed by participants during study visits throughout the study. This questionnaire measured the effect of hepatitis C on the ability to work and perform regular activities. Overall activity impairment is expressed as a percentage and ranges from 0% (no effect) to 100% (completely prevented from performing regular activities).</description>

        <description>The BHS is a 20-item scale for measuring the extent of negative attitudes about the future (pessimism) as perceived by adolescents and adults. The BHS consists of 20 true-false statements. Each of the 20 statements is scored 1 or 0. Of the 20 true-false statements, 9 are keyed FALSE, and 11 are keyed TRUE to indicate endorsement of pessimism about the future. The item scores are summed to yield a total score that can range from 0 to 20 with higher scores indicating greater hopelessness.</description>
