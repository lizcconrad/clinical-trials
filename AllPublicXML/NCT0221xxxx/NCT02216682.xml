      To compare oral (PO) to intravenous (IV) acetaminophen with postoperative pain scores, and
      consumptions of opiates, among orthopedic surgery patients undergoing total knee replacement
      with spinal anesthesia.

      Our hypothesis is that IV acetaminophen patients will have improved analgesia, less opioid
      consumption, a lower percentage of patients rescuing, or a longer time to first rescue with
      IV acetaminophen. The investigators will compare the efficacies of oral and intravenous
      acetaminophen for postoperative pain control, and utilization of opiates as rescue agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous acetaminophen has rapid onset and potent analgesic properties. Recent studies
      have shown several advantages of using intravenous acetaminophen perioperatively. However,
      due to its relatively high cost and limited clinical data concerning its efficacy compared
      with other agents, physicians are hesitant to use intravenous acetaminophen in the
      perioperative period.

      174 adult patients from the orthopedic surgeons undergoing total knee replacement with spinal
      anesthesia will be enrolled. The study will be double blind, randomized; placebo controlled
      comparing oral and IV acetaminophen to each other and a control (placebo). At the time
      patients arrive in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), Group 1 will receive IV 1 gram
      acetaminophen, and PO placebo; Group 2 will receive PO 1 gram acetaminophen and IV placebo;
      Group 3 will receive IV placebo and PO placebo.

      The primary outcome that will be assessed is pain scores, which will be recorded by using the
      numeric rating scale 1-10 every 15 minutes. Secondary outcomes include time to rescue
      analgesia (measured in minutes), time to PACU discharge (measured in minutes), and the total
      amount of hydromorphone (PO or IV) consumed within 6 hours postoperatively for adequate
      analgesia (total measured in milligrams) will be collected.

      The difference in pain scores will be assessed by a chi-square test. A multivariable
      regression model will be performed with the clinical and statistically significant variables
      to remove confounding.

        174 adult patients from the orthopedic surgeons undergoing total knee replacement with
        spinal anesthesia will be enrolled. Patients will be enrolled for the study the morning of
        their surgery. Subjects will randomly receive one of the three treatments. The study will
        be double blind, randomized; placebo controlled comparing PO and IV acetaminophen to each
        other and a control (placebo). At the time patients arrive in the PACU, Group 1 will
        receive IV 1 gram acetaminophen, and PO placebo; Group 2 will receive PO 1 gram
        acetaminophen and IV placebo; Group 3 will receive IV placebo and PO placebo.
