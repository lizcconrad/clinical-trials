  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective was to investigate the effect of concurrent dosing of 10 mg ramipril and
      80 mg telmisartan on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of telmisartan and ramipril.
      Therefore the relative bioavailability of telmisartan and ramipril given in combination was
      determined in comparison with either telmisartan or ramipril given alone.
