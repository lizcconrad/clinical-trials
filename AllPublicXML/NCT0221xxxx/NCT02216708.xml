    <textblock>
      The recommendation for correction of dehydration of severely malnourished children with
      diarrhoea includes oral rehydration and if parenteral rehydration is necessary (for example,
      in severe dehydration) to infuse intravenous fluids very slowly due to the concern of heart
      failure. There is not enough evidence to convince some of the physicians dealing with
      severely malnourished children with dehydrating diarrhoea (for example, cholera) that rapid
      rehydration per se is associated with increased incidence of over hydration and heart
      failure. And whether this approach is applicable in the management of severely malnourished
      children with severe cholera, which usually require rapid correction of water and electrolyte
      deficits for prevention of deaths due to hypovolaemic shock and other complications, has not
      been studied carefully. Recently, we have demonstrated that rapid intravenous rehydration
      (within 4 to 6 hours) of severely malnourished children with dehydrating cholera replacing
      appropriate amount of fluid was found to be safe. We feel that rapid rehydration would help
      in improving the renal function, acidosis and thus improve appetite and reduce ORS failure
      subsequently. Since our study was uncontrolled, so we have planned a randomised controlled
      study with adequate sample of 250 participants; 125 will be rehydrated slowly (over 10 to 12
      hours) following WHO guideline and 125 patients will be rehydrated with intravenous fluid
      over 6 hours. Children of either gender, age 6 to 60 months, severely malnourished (Wt for
      length &lt;-3 Z score of WHO growth chart or with nutritional oedema) with a history of watery
      of &lt;24 hours with signs severe dehydration attending the ICDDRB Dhaka hospital will be asked
      to participate in this study. After the parents'/Legal guardian's consent, the children will
      be transferred to the study ward and will be treated according to the protocol. All children
      will receive similar treatment except the mode of rehydration, different for the two groups.
      The children will be closely monitored throughout the study period. The primary outcomes
      incidence of over hydration and ORS failure and secondary outcomes improvement of renal
      function and improvement of appetite measured by the food intake will be compared between the
      groups.
