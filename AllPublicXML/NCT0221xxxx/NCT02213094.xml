    <textblock>
      This is an open labeled dose escalation safety study of vitamin B3-amide dietary
      supplementation in pregnant women with hypertensive complications of pregnancy. The
      investigators will enroll 5 pregnant women at 24-36 weeks' gestation with the diagnosis of
      hypertensive complications of pregnancy. If the woman is anticipated to remain undelivered
      for 48 hours after diagnosis she will receive vitamin B3-amide, 500 mg/day in a single daily
      dose, continuing for two weeks or until delivery, which ever occurs first. Maternal blood
      will be collected at baseline and 2 times per week to measure maternal LFTs and study markers
      (nicotinamide metabolites, sFlt-1-Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and PlGF). The objective
      of this dose escalation safety study is to determine the safety of vitamin B3 amide dietary
      supplementation during expectant management of hypertensive complications of pregnancy.
