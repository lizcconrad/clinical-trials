    <textblock>
      The puropose of this study is to gain an understanding of the actual use of candesartan
      cilexetil (Blopress) in patients with hypertension, and to examine the changes in parameters
      such as blood pressure.

      This special drug use surveillance was planned to gain an understanding of the actual use of
      candesartan cilexetil in the new anti-hypertensive treatment environment where angiotensin
      receptor blocker (ARB) combination drugs have become commercially available. The surveillance
      will also investigate the background factors of patients continuing treatment with
      candesartan cilexetil and patients who switched from candesartan cilexetil to ARB combination
      drugs, as well as changes in parameters such as blood pressure.

      The usual adult dosage of Candesartan cilexetil is 4 to 8 mg, administered orally, once
      daily.The dose may be increased up to 12 mg as necessary. However, treatment should be
      started at 2 mg once daily in patients with renal impairment and the dose may be increased up
      to 8 mg as necessary.

    <description>Frequency, severity, and time to onset of adverse drug reactions tabulated by each symptom. Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product reported from the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study drug. Among these, events which are considered possibly associated with a medicinal product are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>
