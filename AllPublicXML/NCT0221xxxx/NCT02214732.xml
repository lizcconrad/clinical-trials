  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety, stress and depression are common during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The
      lack of empirically supported, non-pharmaceutical interventions for psychological distress in
      pregnancy is a significant gap in the literature, especially given many pregnant women's
      preference for non-pharmaceutical treatments. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program in reducing measures of psychological
      distress (e.g., symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety) in a group of pregnant women
      endorsing high levels of distress.

    <measure>Change in Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale scores from baseline to 3 months follow-up postpartum</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-Treatment (Week 10), 3 months follow-up postpartum (3 months after the birth of a person's baby)</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of depression will be assessed using the 10-item, self-report Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). The EPDS has been validated against interview schedules and other self-report instruments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pregnancy Related Anxiety Measure scores from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-Treatment (Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pregnancy Anxiety Measure, a 10-item instrument will be used to examine the extent to which women are worried about their own and baby's health, labour, delivery and caring their new baby.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) scores from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-Treatment (Week 10), 3 months follow-up postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire will be used in assessing the perception of stress. The questions are in regards to participant's feelings and thoughts during the previous month. It was designed to be used in community samples. The items are assessing perceived helplessness and self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-Treatment (Week 10), 3 months follow-up postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI instrument will be used in assessing participant's sleep quality. There are seven components of the PSQI and these are subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in objective measures of sleep using Wrist Actigraphy from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-Treatment (Week 10), 3 months follow-up postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy monitoring provides objective information on circadian rhythm amplitude, acrophase, as well as indices of sleep efficiency, sleep latency, total sleep time, and number and frequency of awakenings. The use of actigraphy has been demonstrated sensitive to treatment effects, while being less costly and intrusive than polysomnography.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in salivary cortisol profile from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-Treatment (Week 10), 3 months follow-up postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>All samples are assayed for salivary cortisol using a highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in measures of blood pressure (BP) from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-Treatment (Week 10), 3 months follow-up postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>BP data will be collected using an automatic, calibrated, oscillometric BP monitor and a BP cuff on the upper part of the dominant arm.</description>

    <measure>Changes in measures of heart rate variability from baseline to 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-Treatment (Week 10), 3 months follow-up postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of heart rate (bpm) will be recorded noninvasively using a HIC-2000 Bio-electric Impedance Cardiograph and the Cardiac Output Program, developed by Bio-Impedance Technology.</description>

    <description>The modified MBCT program for pregnant women is an 8-session group intervention that aims to help women change their relationship to the thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that can lead to psychological distress. Participants are guided to recognize and disengage from unhelpful mind states characterized by self-perpetuating patterns of ruminative thought. The intervention was modified to address pregnant women's physical and emotional needs, as well as their risk of perinatal mood episodes.</description>
