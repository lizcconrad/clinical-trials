  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective observational research study registry is to examine whether
      two GERD surgeries (Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication (LNF) or Transoral Incisionless
      Fundoplication (TIF)) have similar outcomes in effectiveness, safety, post-operative side
      effects and post-procedure costs associated with episodes of care and any ensuing
      complications.

      This registry will prospectively enroll 500 patients undergoing TIF and LNF from
      approximately 20 United States centers proficient in these procedures that have provided
      informed consent for the above mentioned data collection (symptom questionnaires, medical
      treatments, complications, side-effects and costs). The observational registry will obtain
      the patients clinical data related to gastrointestinal symptoms for three years post-consent.

      At baseline and for a three-year period following a clinically indicated TIF or LNF
      procedure, data will be obtained from phone calls and/or during office-visits made at
      specified intervals. During these data collection periods, patients will be asked to complete
      standard validated symptom questionnaires as well as report on episodes of care related to
      their procedures along with financial costs of care.

        Adults who meet clinical criteria and have decided to treat their GERD through one of two
        surgical procedures, (LNF or TIF) and agree to have their standard GI medical data for 3
        years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  GERD symptoms (heartburn, defined by a sub-sternal burning discomfort arising from the
             upper abdomen into the chest, and or regurgitation, defined as the effortless arising
             of liquid material into the chest or mouth) two or more times a week (when not on
             anti-secretory medication) that adversely affects the patient's quality of life.
             Additionally, patients will have to have responded to medical therapy (adequate relief
             of symptoms) as indicated by GERD-HRQL and regurgitation scores on medical therapy. In
             this context, scores â‰¤ 2 on each GERD-HRQL and regurgitation question (while on
             medication) indicate absence of daily bothersome symptoms and therefore these patients
             are considered responsive to medical therapy. Furthermore, patients will have to have
             objective evidence of GERD documented (esophagitis on endoscopy or pathological
             intraesophageal acid exposure on prolonged ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring).

          -  Age 18-80 years

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Meet the clinical criteria for treatment of GERD with TIF or LNF and undergo TIF or
             LNF within 90 days of providing consent.

               -  Dependent upon PPIs for control of heartburn for &gt; six months or patient
                  determined to have an inadequate response of regurgitation symptoms despite
                  heartburn control with PPIs

               -  Hiatal hernia axial length is no larger than 2 cm and the transverse dimension
                  should not exceed 2.0 cm

               -  Gastroesophageal junction with a Hill Grade I-II

                  --- Patient willing to provide informed consent, cooperate with post-operative
                  dietary recommendations and follow-up assessment tests

               -  Objective documentation of pathological acid-reflux by either a) increased
                  intraesophageal acid exposure on prolonged ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring
                  (pH&lt;4 for 4.5% or greater of the time) with or without impedance b) or the
                  presence of erosive esophagitis (LA Grade A or B) on endoscopy

               -  Absence of a severe esophageal motility disorder (note: mild abnormalities in
                  esophageal motility are common in GERD such as small breaks, etc.) including
                  achalasia, esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, frequent failed
                  peristalsis, diffuse esophageal spasm, nutcracker or jackhammer esophagus etc. on
                  high-resolution esophageal manometry using the Chicago classification system or
                  evidence of incomplete bolus clearance on 30% or more of swallows by impedance
                  testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hiatal hernia &gt; 2 cm (defined as longitudinal length measured endoscopically between
             the proximal margin of the gastric folds and the diaphragmatic pinch)

          -  Esophagitis LA Grade C or D
