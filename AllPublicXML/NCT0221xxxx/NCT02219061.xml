      Maternal antibodies (measles and meningitis C) may wane in the first six months after birth.

        -  Geometric mean titers(GMTs) of measles and meningitis C.

        -  Follow-up on 0 month, 3rd month,5th month and 7th month after birth.

      Measles and meningitis C are hot topics in China in recent years. Although China had set the
      goal of measles elimination, many measles cases were found to be those aged &lt; 8 months and
      meningitis C is becoming public health issue since meningitis group A has been controlled at
      a very low level and little is known on C group. So the investigators designed the
      observation study on the two antibodies.

      Maternal antibodies are supposed to wane after birth. Serums of the placenta(0 month),
      children of 3 months, 5 months and 7 months old will be collected and the geometric mean
      titers (GMTs) of measles and meningitis C will be confirmed by using the ELISA test.
