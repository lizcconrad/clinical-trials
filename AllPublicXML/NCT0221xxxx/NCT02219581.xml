  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of two small doses of intravenous (IV)
      steroids around the time of knee replacement surgery decrease a patient's pain or use of pain
      medication. The investigators will also determine if the subjects receiving the steroid will
      have better pain control and better postoperative outcomes after their surgery.

    <textblock>
      Adequate pain control after total knee replacement (TKA) is of great importance not only to
      maximize patient comfort, but also to ensure optimal outcomes after surgery. This study is
      designed to assess whether the use of two small doses of intravenous (IV) steroids around the
      time of surgery decrease a patient's pain or use of pain medication. Secondly, the
      investigators will also determine if the use of these steroids as part of a multimodal pain
      management strategy leads to improved patient outcomes, including pain, nausea and vomiting,
      knee function and length of stay in the hospital after surgery. The study will compare the
      effect of two different doses of IV dexamethasone given preoperatively before TKA, when
      compared to placebo.

    <measure>Change in pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 hours post-operatively (average length of inpatient stay)</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain will be assessed using the well-standardized and accepted visual analog pain scale. The scale shows a series of faces ranging from a happy face at 0= &quot;No hurt&quot;, to a crying face at 10= &quot;Hurts worst&quot;. The subject will be asked to choose the face that best describes their level of pain and their responses will be recorded. Higher scores indicate higher intensities of pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of each subject's postoperative opioid analgesic usage (converted into milligrams of morphine equivalents per day) will be recorded. The subjects will be asked to use a pain medication usage log to track the use of both prescribed narcotic medications and over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications for knee pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Soft tissue swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 day post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Soft tissue swelling will be evaluated using a measurement of knee circumference at the midpoint of the patella, with the knee in the maximum amount of extension allowed by the patient. This measurement will be completed twice, and the average of the two measurements will be used as the value for that day.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' functional ability will be assessed using the Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire. The Short Form-36 Health Survey is a 36-item, self-reported survey of patient health and is a measure of health status. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability.</description>
