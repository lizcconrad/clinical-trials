  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary caregiver thoracic ultrasound (U/S) is a skill which is growing in utility in
      critical care. First introduced for volume assessment in nephrology and cardiology, it is now
      being researched in emergency and critical care. Data is still evolving in its use in initial
      trauma evaluation. Inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter correlates with outcome in trauma, but
      utility of its measurement on U/S in the emergency department still has some controversy. In
      trauma specifically, small studies suggests benefit to the use of U/S to predict volume
      status, and most of these data are from one author. It is not known if this can be applied
      more broadly. The prognostic value of findings on limited transthoracic echocardiogram (LTTE,
      SonoSite Ultrasound) has been studied in several small studies, and only one small randomized
      controlled trial has proven benefit to its use. Due to inter-rater reliability and the fact
      that all reports on credentialing of thoracic ultrasound use in the trauma bay are from one
      group, it is not known if it can be applied to all trauma populations.

      Research question:

      Does LTTE (SonoSite Ultrasound) predict mortality, emergency surgery, intensive care unit
      (ICU) stay, hospital stay, time on ventilator, number of transfusions, or renal failure as
      well as or better than other methods of organ perfusion?

      Hypotheses:

        1. Use of LTTE is associated with improved outcomes (less organ failure, decreased hospital
           and ICU stays, transfusions, and mortality).

        2. LTTE predicts mortality, emergency surgery, ICU stay, hospital stay, time on ventilator,
           number of and transfusions better than other methods of organ perfusion (tachycardia,
           hypotension, lactate, lactate clearance, creatinine, base deficit).
