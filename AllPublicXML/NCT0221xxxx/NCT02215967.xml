      Background:

      - T cells are white blood cells that fight several cancers. One cancer therapy involves
      removing a person s T cells, changing them in a lab, and then returning them to the person.
      Researchers want to see if this helps people with multiple myeloma.

      Objective:

      - To test the safety of giving anti-B-Cell Maturation Antigen T cells to people with multiple
      myeloma.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults ages 18 70 with multiple myeloma that has not responded to standard therapies.

      Design:

        -  Participants may be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Heart tests

        -  Bone marrow sample

        -  Multiple scans and X-rays

        -  Participants will have apheresis. Blood is removed through a needle in an arm. T cells
           are removed. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.

        -  The cells will be changed in a laboratory.

        -  Participants will get 2 chemotherapy drugs over 3 days.

        -  Two days later, participants will check into the hospital. They will get an intravenous
           (IV) catheter in an arm or chest vein. They will get the T cells through the IV in 1
           infusion.

        -  After this, participants will stay in the hospital for at least 9 days and stay nearby
           for 2 weeks. Then they will have blood tests and see a doctor.

        -  Participants will visit the clinic 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 months after the infusion, then
           every 6 months. A bone marrow sample will be taken at the 2-month visit.

        -  Participants blood will be collected for several years. Participants will have an annual
           physical at NIH for 5 years after the infusion. Then for 10 years they will answer
           health questionnaires.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of plasma cells.

        -  MM is nearly always incurable.

        -  T cells can be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that
           specifically target malignancy-associated antigens.

        -  Autologous T cells genetically modified to express CARs targeting the B-cell antigen
           CD19 have caused complete remissions in a small number of patients with leukemia or
           lymphoma. These results demonstrate that CAR-expressing T cells have anti-malignancy
           activity in humans.

        -  B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a protein expressed by normal plasma cells and the
           malignant plasma cells of multiple myeloma.

        -  BCMA is not expressed by normal cells except for plasma cells and some mature B cells.

        -  We have constructed an anti-BCMA CAR that can specifically recognize BCMA-expressing
           target cells in vitro and eradicate BCMA-expressing tumors in mice.

        -  Anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cells have not been previously tested in humans.

        -  We hypothesize that anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cells will specifically eliminate

      BCMA-expressing MM cells in patients

      -Possible toxicities include cytokine-associated toxicities such as fever, hypotension, and
      neurological toxicities. Elimination of normal plasma cells and unknown toxicities are also
      possible.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      -Determine the safety and feasibility of administering T cells expressing an anti- BCMA CAR
      to patients with MM.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the in vivo persistence of anti-BCMA CAR T cells

        -  Assess for evidence of anti-myeloma activity by anti-BCMA CAR T cells

      ELIGIBILITY

        -  Patients must have measurable MM defined as a serum M-protein greater than or equal to
           0.4 g/dL or a urine M-protein greater than or equal to 200 mg/24 hours or an involved
           serum free light chain (FLC) level greater than or equal to 10 mg/dL (provided FLC ratio
           is abnormal) or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma.

        -  Patients must have previously received at least 3 different treatment regimens for MM.

        -  Patients must have a normal creatinine and a normal cardiac ejection fraction.

        -  An ECOG performance status of 0 -2 is required.

        -  Patients on any anticoagulant medications except aspirin are not eligible.

        -  No active infections are allowed.

        -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/ L, platelet count greater than
           or equal to 45,000/ L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8g/dL

        -  ALT and AST less than or equal to 2.5-fold higher than the upper limit of normal

        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including
           corticosteroids) and the required leukapheresis.

        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including
           corticosteroids) and initiation of protocol treatment.

        -  Bone marrow plasma cells must be 30% or less of total bone marrow cells 30 days or less
           prior to the start of protocol treatment.

        -  The patient s MM will need to be assessed for BCMA expression by flow cytometry or
           immunohistochemistry performed at the NIH. If unstained, paraffinembedded bone marrow or
           plasmacytoma sections are available from prior biopsies, these can be used to determine
           BCMA expression by immunohistochemistry; otherwise patients will need to come to the NIH
           for a bone marrow biopsy or other biopsy of a plasmacytoma to determine BCMA expression.
           The sample for BCMA expression can come from a biopsy obtained at any time before
           enrollment.

      DESIGN:

        -  This is a phase I dose-escalation trial

        -  Patients will undergo leukapheresis

        -  T-cells obtained by leukapheresis will be genetically modified to express an anti- BCMA
           CAR

        -  Patients will receive a lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen with the
           intent of enhancing the activity of the infused anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cells.

        -  The chemotherapy conditioning regimen is cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 daily for 3 days and
           fludarabine 30 mg/m2 daily for 3 days. Fludarabine will be given on the same days as the
           cyclophosphamide.

        -  Two days after the chemotherapy ends, patients will receive an infusion of anti-
           BCMA-CAR-expressing T cells.

        -  The initial dose level of this dose-escalation trial will be 0.3x106 CAR+ T cells/kg of
           recipient bodyweight.

        -  The cell dose administered will be escalated until a maximum tolerated dose is
           determined

      for patients in which less than 50% of total bone marrow cells are plasma cells. With

      Amendment C, all patients with 50% or greater bone marrow plasma cells will receive 3x10(6)

      anti-BCMA CAR T cells/kg.

        -  Following the T-cell infusion, there is a mandatory 9-day inpatient hospitalization to
           monitor for toxicity.

        -  Outpatient follow-up is planned for 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after
           the CAR T-cell infusion.

        -  Repeat treatments are possible for patients with residual MM and no greater than grade 2
           toxicity with an initial treatment.

        -  Re-enrollment will be allowed for a small number of subjects.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        2.1.1.1 Multiple Myeloma criteria

          -  Clear BCMA expression must be detected on greater than 50% of malignant plasma cells
             from either bone marrow or a plasmacytoma by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry.
             These assays must be performed at the National Institutes of Health. It is not
             required that the specimen used for BCMA determination comes from a sample that was
             obtained after the patient s most recent treatment. BCMA expression will need to be
             documented on the majority of malignant plasma cells at some time after the original
             anti-BCMA CAR T-cell infusion in all patients undergoing a second anti-BCMA CAR T-cell
             infusion. If paraffin embedded unstained samples of bone marrow involved with MM or a
             plasmacytoma are available, these can be shipped to the NIH for BCMA staining,
             otherwise new biopsies will need to be performed for determination of BCMA expression.

          -  Bone marrow plasma cells must make up 30% or less of total bone marrow cells based on
             a bone marrow biopsy performed within 30 days of the start of protocol treatment.

               -  A biopsy-proven plasmacytoma

          -  Patients must have multiple myeloma that meets the criteria for one of the following
             Disease categories: (1) progressive disease or (2) relapse from CR as described in the
             International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma and as listed below.

               1. Progressive Disease (which requires 1 or more of the following)(A):

                  Increase of greater than or equal to 25% from the lowest response value (nadir)
                  in any one or moreof these parameters:

                    1. Serum M-component (the absolute increase must be greater than or equal to
                       0.5 g/dL) (B) and/or

                    2. Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be greater than or
                       equal to 200 mg/24 h)

                    3. Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels; the
                       difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. The absolute increase
                       must be &gt; 10 mg/dL.

                    4. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; the absolute percentage must be greater
                       than or equal to 10%

          -  Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite
             increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas (defined as
             50% or greater increase in the sum of the products of the cross-diameters of target
             lesions)

          -  Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L)
             that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder

             2. Relapse from complete remission (A)

          -  Defined as one or more of the following; must be attributable to myeloma:

               1. Reappearance of serum or urine M-protein by immunofixation or electrophoresis

               2. Development of greater than or equal to 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow

               3. Appearance of any other sign of progression (i.e., new plasmacytoma, lytic bone
                  lesion, or hypercalcemia)

        (A)All relapse and progression categories require two consecutive assessments made at any
        time before classification as relapse or disease progression and/or the institution of any
        new therapy.

        (B)For progressive disease, serum M-component increases of greater than or equal to 1 gm/dL

        g/dL.

        2.1.1.2 Other inclusion criteria:

          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 73.

          -  Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.

          -  Clinical performance status of ECOG 0-2

          -  Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time of
             enrollment on this study and for four months after receiving the preparative regimen.

          -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus.

          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can
             have decreased immune -competence and thus are less responsive to the experimental
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, positive hepatitis B tests can be further
             evaluated by confirmatory tests, and if confirmatory tests are negative, the patient
             can be enrolled.

          -  Seronegative for hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C antibody
             test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR
             and be HCV RNA negative.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm3 without the support of
             filgrastim or other growth factors.

          -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 45,000/mm3 without transfusion support

          -  Hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dl.

          -  Less than 5% plasma cells in the peripheral blood leukocytes

          -  Serum ALT and AST less or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of the institutional
             normal.

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.3 mg/dL.

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl, except in patients with Gilbert s
             Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

          -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time the
             patient starts the cyclophosphamide and fludarabine conditioning regimen, and patients
             toxicities must have recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as
             alopecia or vitiligo).

          -  Because this protocol requires collection of autologous blood cells by leukapheresis
             in order to prepare anti-BCMA-CAR T cells, systemic anti-myeloma therapy including
             systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid are not allowed within 2 weeks prior to the
             required leukapheresis.

          -  Normal cardiac ejection fraction (greater than or equal to 50% by echocardiography)
             and no evidence of hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion as determined by
             an echocardiogram within 6 weeks of the start of the treatment protocol.

          -  Patients should not take corticosteroids including prednisone, dexamethasone or any
             other corticosteroid for any purpose at doses higher than 5 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid 2 weeks before apheresis and within 2 weeks
             prior to CAR T-cell infusion, and at any time after the CAR T cell infusion.

        2.1.2 EXCLUSION CRITTERIA:

          -  Patients on any anticoagulants except aspirin are not eligible.

          -  Patients that require urgent therapy due to tumor mass effects or spinal cord
             compression.

          -  Patients that have active hemolytic anemia.

          -  Patients with second malignancies in addition to multiple myeloma are not eligible if
             the second malignancy has required treatment within the past 3 years or is not in
             complete remission. There are two exceptions to this criterion: successfully treated
             non-metastatic basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant.

             medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal,
             gastrointestinal, genitourinary or immune system, history of myocardial infarction,
             active cardiac arrhythmias, active obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.

          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          -  Systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent dose of another corticosteroid are not allowed within 2 weeks prior to
             either the required leukapheresis or the initiation of the conditioning chemotherapy
             regimen.

          -  History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study.

          -  History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation
