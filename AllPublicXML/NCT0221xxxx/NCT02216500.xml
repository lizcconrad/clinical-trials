  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately a fourth of children with seizures do not respond adequately to available
      therapy. Ketogenic therapy has a long history as treatment for intractable epilepsy, but
      there is no agreement concerning how it works and what is the best way to administer it. This
      natural history study will collect data pertaining to both questions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The basis of Ketogenic Therapy is an altered macronutrient intake. It is based on a ratio of
      fat: protein+carbohydrate in which protein intake is adequate and carbohydrate is minimal. On
      Ketogenic Therapy, the body metabolizes fat, producing ketones as an energy source for the
      brain. Induction of ketosis has been shown to correlate with the reduction of seizures
      observed with Ketogenic Therapy. A major challenge of Ketogenic Therapy in children is that
      the compounds provided to stop seizure activity are the same compounds provided for growth
      and development. The altered macronutrient ratio that is the basis of Ketogenic Therapy is
      also a potential risk factor for dyslipidemia and may adversely affect growth. The
      investigators will evaluate efficacy of Ketogenic Therapy by assessing seizures and
      requirements for antiepileptic drugs. The investigators will evaluate adverse effects of
      Ketogenic Therapy by assessing dyslipidemia and growth. The investigators will foster optimal
      daily administration of therapy with structured training programs for caregivers.
