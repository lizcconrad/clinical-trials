  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis (severe pain in the heel) is a common problem that has a significant impact
      on quality of life. There is some evidence to support the use of orthoses and stretches in
      the conservative management of plantar fasciitis but current orthotic management may not be
      optimal. More prolonged stretching with night splints may achieve better results but such
      splints are clinically not well tolerated. Therefore, there is a potential need to apply
      prolonged stretching during the day and during dynamic tasks such as walking. This has led to
      the development of other rigid and semi-rigid splints that have shown promising results in
      small scale clinical trials. There are disadvantages however with the more rigid bracing and
      orthoses seen in these types of splints. For example, they are often difficult to accommodate
      with a person's available shoes; this can be particularly difficult for women and thus limits
      their compliance with the intervention. Further, more rigid bracing can be uncomfortable
      during fast walking and running and so limits participation in such activities.

      Recently a novel orthotic, a customised dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses (DEFO), has been
      developed. Being made from lycraÂ® based materials the sock-like splint is lightweight and
      discrete, allowing it to be accommodated easily into most shoe types and potentially better
      tolerated when worn at night compared to currently available splints. Its design further
      allows it to be used comfortably during dynamic tasks such as walking and running as
      supported by initial anecdotal evidence in athletes. To date there has been no evaluation
      into the effectiveness of the DEFO in the general population with plantar fasciitis.

      This study will look at the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial into the
      use of a DEFO compared to an off-the-shelf orthoses as an adjunct to usual care.

  <detailed_description>

      Plantar fasciitis is the most common foot and ankle pathology that affects the general
      population. It affects over 1 million people in the USA equating to ~0.2 million in the UK.
      It is characterized by severe pain felt on the plantar aspect of the heel around the plantar
      fascia origin which is significantly thicker than normal.

      Usually conservative treatment comprises a referral to physiotherapy and provision of
      orthotics. Physiotherapy consists of teaching a home program of calf and plantar fascia
      stretches in addition to weight management and footwear advice.

      Orthotic management includes the provision of off-the-shelf orthotics or customised
      orthotics. Some studies of customised orthoses demonstrate significant improvements in foot
      pain related function at 3 and 12 months in people with plantar fasciitis compared to a sham
      intervention. However, a systematic review of the randomised controlled trials found no
      evidence to support their use on short or long term foot pain, pain related function or
      disability.

      Dynamic elastomeric fabric orthoses (DEFOs) have been successfully used in a variety of
      patient groups. The plantar fasciitis DEFOs is a custom-made close-fitting sock of
      elastomeric construction. It is worn next to the skin where the sock can exert an external
      torsional, compressive, and supportive effect, thus positively influencing the biomechanics
      of the heal.

    <measure>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a patient reported questionnaire asking about the impact of the foot and ankle on 21 activities of daily living and 8-sport related activities. It has demonstrated validity for this client group (correlating with physical function subscales of the SF-36) and shows good test-retest reliability</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue / Numerical rating scales are commonly used to measure pain in clinical trials, having demonstrated good validity, reliability and responsiveness. Patients will indicate (a) their current heel pain and (b) their worst pain over the last 48 hrs using a numerical rating scale. 0 will indicate no pain at all and 10 will indicate their worst imaginable pain and numbers from 0-10 will be shown.</description>
