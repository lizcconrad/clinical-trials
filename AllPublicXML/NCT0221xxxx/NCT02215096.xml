    <textblock>
      This Phase I, open-label, dose-finding, multicenter study is designed to determine the
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination of an orally administered
      Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase beta (PI3K-beta) inhibitor (GSK2636771) with
      enzalutamide. Subjects with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are receiving a stable dose of enzalutamide
      with a recently demonstrated progression (either by RECIST [Response Evaluation Criteria In
      Solid Tumors] version 1.1, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] progression, and/or progression in
      bone) per the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria will be enrolled. Eligible
      subjects will be enrolled in the Dose-Escalation Phase to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of the combination therapy using a modified 3+3 dose escalation procedure. The
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical efficacy will also be assessed to guide the
      selection of the RP2D. The starting dose will be GSK2636771 300 mg once daily in combination
      with the recommended dose (160 milligram [mg] once daily) of oral enzalutamide. Once the RP2D
      has been established, additional subjects will be enrolled in the Dose Expansion Phase to
      further evaluate the safety, PK and preliminary clinical activity. Safety assessments will be
      performed throughout the study including physical examinations, vital signs, clinical
      laboratory tests, 12 lead electrocardiograms and monitoring of adverse events. Blood samples
      will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Subjects will continue treatment until an
      unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent or death occurs. A
      post-treatment follow-up visit will be performed within 30 days of the last dose of study
      treatment. Xtandi is a registered trademark of Astellas Pharma Inc

    <description>Subject receiving a stable dose of enzalutamide 160 mg once daily will receive GSK2636771 following a modified 3+3 dose escalation procedure (Cohort -1: 200 mg, Cohort 1: 300 mg and Cohort 2: 400 mg) to evaluate the safety and PK for each combination dose level and to guide selection of the RP2D of the combination. If the combination doses in Cohort 1 are not tolerable, lower doses as defined in the de-escalation cohort (Cohort -1) will be evaluated. If the de-escalation cohort (Cohort -1) is not tolerable, further dose-escalation using a continuous daily dosing schedule for both compounds simultaneously will be terminated. Additional dose levels of GSK2636771 or alternative dosing schedules may be explored based upon ongoing assessment of safety and PK. Dose modification decisions will be made utilizing all available data at the end of each DLT determination period (28 days).</description>
