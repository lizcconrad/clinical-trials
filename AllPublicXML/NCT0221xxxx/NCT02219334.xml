  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine the safety, efficacy, length of stay and parental
      satisfaction of the NoseFrida in comparison to a suction device used in the hospital setting
      in patients with bronchiolitis admitted under observation status.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a viral illness and a common cause for admission to the hospital. Most
      patients with bronchiolitis are managed at home. The indications of hospitalization are poor
      feeding (due to increased mucus production) and respiratory distress with and without
      hypoxia. The acute care setting is a common destination of patients with bronchiolitis.
      Patients are admitted to the acute care setting for respiratory monitoring, suctioning and
      poor oral intake. The management of bronchiolitis is mostly supportive which includes
      frequent feedings, nasal suctioning, intravenous fluids and oxygen if necessary. The patients
      admitted to the acute care setting receive frequent nasal suctioning by a suction device
      (NeoSucker) and deep suctioning as needed. Since young infants are &quot;nose breathers,&quot; the use
      of nasal suctioning helps to relieve nasal congestion/upper airway obstruction and assists
      with their ability to breathe and feed. Suctioning can be accomplished by the use of the bulb
      suction, nasal aspirators and/or suction catheters connected to pressure devices.

      The role of the type of suctioning device in the management of bronchiolitis has not been
      studied extensively. In our study, a nasal aspirator (developed in Sweden by an Ear, Nose and
      Throat specialist) by the brand name of NoseFrida will be compared to the NeoSucker, a
      suction catheter currently used in our hospital setting which requires both a nurse and a
      pressure device. Nasal suctioning is less traumatic and does not cause the discomfort,
      bleeding and rebound swelling that deep suctioning can. Upon admission, patients will be
      randomized to either the NoseFrida or NeoSucker group. After consent is obtained for agreed
      participation, the patients parents randomized to the NoseFrida group will be given a
      NoseFrida/filters and instructions on usage (instructional video/postcard). The parents will
      be encouraged to use the NoseFrida suction device as often as they want, especially before
      feeds and sleep. The patients randomized to the NeoSucker group will be given the current
      standard of care and nasal suctioned by a nurse. Both groups will be deep suctioned as
      clinically needed.

    <description>The NeoSucker (used for nasal suctioning) is part of the current standard of care for patients with bronchiolitis. The NeoSucker is used for removing nasal secretions by a nurse or respiratory therapist. The NeoSucker is a plastic tube which is used to suction the secretions. The bedside nurse will continue to use the NeoSucker as needed. NoseFrida will not be used for this sub group of patients.</description>

    <description>The NoseFrida has four components, the collection container, an interchangeable filter, flexible tubing and a mouth piece. The end of the collection devise is placed on the patient's nostril, a tight seal is made via the vacuum created from suctioning of the mouth piece and secretions are easily aspirated. This device disassembles for quick disinfecting and cleaning.</description>
