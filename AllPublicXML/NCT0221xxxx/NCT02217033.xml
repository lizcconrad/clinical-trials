    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of consuming &quot;R&quot; on quality of life in
      the areas of insomnia, fatigue, and depression in female breast cancer patients receiving
      multi-cycle adjuvant chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Female breast cancer patients eligible for adjuvant therapy with four cycles of Taxotere and
      Cytoxan chemotherapy after surgery will be enrolled for the study.

      Eligible subjects will begin to consume either &quot;R&quot; or purified water (placebo) just prior to
      the 1st cycle of chemotherapy. Subjects will continue to consume either &quot;R&quot; or placebo
      through Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, and for an additional 12 weeks after completing
      chemotherapy.

      Study procedures will include clinical lab assessments, analysis of inflammatory markers, RNA
      biomarkers, adverse events, subject diary, and quality of life measurements for insomnia,
      fatigue and depression.
