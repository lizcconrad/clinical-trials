  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the widespread use of anticonvulsants in the pediatric chronic pain population and the
      absence of scientific data supporting their use, the investigators propose a randomized,
      double blind, two group parallel design in which a broad group of children and adolescents
      with chronic neuropathic pain would be randomized to receive either Gabapentin or
      Oxcarbazepine.

      The Primary Aim of the Study is to assess the frequencies of successful treatment of
      pediatric patients with neuropathic pain treated with either Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine.

      The Primary Hypotheses are as follows:

      Hypothesis I: Both Gabapentin and Oxcarbazepine will result in significant reduction in pain
      scores when compared to each patient's baseline.

      Hypothesis II: Patients who continue on active drug (Gabapentin or Oxcarbazepine) during the
      second phase of the trial will report greater pain reduction relative to baseline than
      patients who are randomized onto placebo at this randomization point.

      Secondary Aims of the Study are to compare groups treated initially with Gabapentin or
      Oxcarbazepine with regard to reduction in pain scores (both at rest and with evoked
      maneuvers), functional disability scores, tolerability, and measures of mood and cognitive
      functioning.

      Secondary Hypotheses are that Gabapentin and Oxcarbazepine differ in their effects on:

        1. Pain scores at rest and with evoked maneuvers

        2. Functional disability scores

        3. Tolerability (frequencies of side-effects)

        4. Depression and anxiety scales

        5. Neuropsychological measures of cognitive processing speed, working memory, and
           attention.

    <description>Common side effects include headaches and feeling sleepier in the morning and having less energy. Side effects that can occur, but are not common, include gastrointestinal side effects (upset stomach or throwing up, diarrhea or constipation, and weight gain), feeling lightheaded, having blurred eyesight, shakiness or changes in balance.
Very rarely, patients taking these medicines may experience memory problems, sadness, nervousness, and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).
Routine laboratory testing will be conducted as part of the safety profile assessment.</description>

    <description>As both study medicines may be associated with mood changes and as pain itself sometimes is co-morbid with anxiety and depression, the investigators will perform self-report measures of anxiety and depression (Children's Depressive Inventory and The Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale) pre and post-assigment of the intervention.</description>
