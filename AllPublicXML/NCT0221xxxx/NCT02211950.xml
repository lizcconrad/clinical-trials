  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives were to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI 44847 in different
      racial groups (white, Asian, and African subjects) and to investigate the effect of different
      types of diet and acarbose coadministration on the bioavailability of BI 44847 in white
      subjects.
