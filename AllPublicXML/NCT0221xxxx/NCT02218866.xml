    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is understand if obesity is a major factor for neuropathy
      development in patients with and without Type 2 diabetes. This study will examine the
      relationship between weight, metabolism, and nerve function and regeneration.

    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy causes progressive injury to the longest nerves of the body, starting
      in the toes, then progressing slowly up the leg. Neuropathy often causes pain, numbness, and
      weakness if the feet and can lead to reduced mobility, foot ulcers, and even amputation. The
      most common cause is diabetes, but work at the University of Utah finds that prediabetes and
      other consequences of obesity, including abnormal cholesterol levels, may be associated with
      neuropathy. Research has shown that these risk factors may damage nerves and interfere with
      the ability of nerves to grow back after an injury.

      This study aims to

        1. characterize peripheral nerve function and cutaneous nerve structure in obese bariatric
           surgery candidates;

        2. evaluate peripheral nerve regeneration capacity (and other nerve function measures)
           before and after bariatric surgery in obese subjects with no or mild neuropathy;

        3. examine the relationship between ectopic lipid accumulation, lipotoxic mediators,
           neuropathy and regeneration capacity in surgical candidates before and one year after
           surgery.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group 1</arm_group_label>
    <description>All participants will be examined by a neurologist to test sensation, reflexes, and strength and complete a few questionnaires. Tests will be performed to measure nerve function and small punch skin biopsies will be taken to assess nerve fiber density. Blood and urine tests will measure various markers of interest. Participants will be seen before and after their bariatric surgery.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group 2</arm_group_label>
    <description>In addition to the procedures described for Group 1, participants in Group 2 will have the following procedures:
During bariatric surgery, a small biopsy from the liver and abdominal fat will be taken to examine how fat is processed within the body.
At the first visit, after a skin biopsy is taken, a small capsaicin patch will be placed on the lower thigh. The patch will remain in place for 48 hours and will cause the nerves in the immediate area to pull back from the skin. A biopsy will be taken from the patch area 48 hours, 1 month, and 3 months after the initial biopsy. This procedure will be repeated after surgery.
MRIs may be performed before and after bariatic surgery.
Participants may be asked to complete additional tests to evaluate nerve function</description>
