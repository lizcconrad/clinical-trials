  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of 1448 patients scheduled for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      with a native coronary stenosis suitable for DES implantation and IVUS imaging are openly
      randomized 1:1 to either IVUS guidance or angiographic guidance groups.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is prospectively conducted at 8 high-volume PCI centers in China with IVUS
      expertise. Clinic follow-up are planned in all patients 12 months after implantation of drug
      eluting stents. Primary endpoint is target vessel failure. The study is powered for primary
      endpoint, which are likely to reach significance at the level P &lt; 0.05 even at a follow-up
      drop-out rate up to 10%.
