    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma versus
      hyaluronic acid intra-articular injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis of knee joint.

      The hypothesis is that PRP intra-articular injection is comparable or even better than
      hyaluronic acid injection.

      Osteoarthritis (OA) has a significant impact on our society. The limited regenerative
      capacity of cartilage is part of this problem. Existing degenerative lesions lead to
      accelerated deterioration of the articular (joint) surface leading to end-stage arthritis. In
      particular, the most recent knowledge regarding tissue biology highlights a complex
      regulation of growth factors (GFs) for the normal tissue structure and the reaction to tissue
      damage. The influence of GFs on cartilage repair is now widely investigated in vitro and in
      vivo. Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is a simple, low- cost and minimally- invasive method that
      allows one to obtain a natural concentrate of autologous GFs from the blood, and it is
      increasingly applied in the clinical practice to treat knee degenerative pathology, such as
      chondropathy and early OA. The biological rational of PRP is that platelets contain storage
      pools of GFs, cytokines, chemokines and many other mediators.Although its widespread
      application, there are little high level studies in the literature to demonstrate the real
      efficacy of PRP.

      The investigators hypothesized that intra-articular injections of PRP to treat knee
      osteoarthritis could determine pain relief and recovery of knee function with overall
      clinical outcome comparable or even better than viscosupplementation, which is a common
      injective approach applied in this kind of pathology. To this purpose the investigators
      designed a double blind randomized controlled trial comparing PRP vs viscosupplementation.
