  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statins are the first-line and most commonly prescribed drugs for the prevention of
      cardiovascular diseases and stroke in the world. Our preliminary studies suggest that
      Caucasians might have a higher risk of developing potentially life-threatening drug-drug
      interactions than Asians when taking statins. Drug-drug interactions occur in the body when
      two or more drugs interact in a way that alters their effectiveness and/or toxicity. These
      interactions are becoming an increasingly severe problem with statin usage since patients at
      higher risk for cardiovascular diseases also take statins combined with many other drugs,
      such as antihypertensive and diabetic drugs. Our study is aimed at understanding the
      molecular factors and providing a sound basis for the interethnic dosage and response
      differences for statins.

      Drug-transporting proteins in intestine and liver tissues are responsible for taking up
      statins into the blood. It is hypothesized that there are interethnic function differences of
      these proteins and that they account for differences in statin blood levels between
      Caucasians and Asians and the frequency and/or severity of their respective drug-drug
      interactions. A clinical study will be conducted with Caucasian and Asian subjects undergoing
      gastric bypass surgery so excess intestine and liver tissue can be acquired as part of the
      standard procedure. Protein levels will be quantified in the tissues and correlate them with
      different statin blood levels.

    <description>Changes in oral clearance of rosuvastatin within gastric bypass surgery will be analyzed using the ratio of areas under the systemic concentration curves (AUCs) from before to after surgery using the bioequivalence criteria of 80-125%. The oral clearance will be calculated based on the plasma data from each of the blood draws after the dosing period is completed (48hr). The pre and post surgery period are separated by at least a 8-week recovery period.</description>
