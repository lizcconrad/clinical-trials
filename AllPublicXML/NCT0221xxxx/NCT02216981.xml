  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how feasible and acceptable it is to deliver a
      talking treatment called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in two different formats for
      people who have had treatment for OCD in the past but it didn't work out for them.

      The two different treatment formats are CBT delivered on a weekly basis (which is
      approximately 12-18 hours of therapy delivered weekly for 60-90 minutes each session,
      followed by 1-3 monthly follow up sessions as needed) and CBT offered in an intensive format
      (which is having approximately 12-18 hours of therapy all in a 3-week period, followed by 1-3
      monthly follow up sessions as needed).

      The main aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Intensive CBT
      for treatment resistant OCD when participants are randomized to this format.

      This study aims to establish an estimate of the relative efficacy of both Intensive and
      Weekly CBT when compared individually to wait list, for participants with a diagnosis of OCD,
      who have previously not responded to CBT.

    <description>The Y-BOCS is Clinician administered and the OCI is self report, both measures assess the severity of OCD symptoms.
These measures will be used to assess change in symptom severity from base line to end of treatment and to assess if there has been a change at end of treatment, if this is maintained at 3 and 6 months following the completion of treatment.</description>
