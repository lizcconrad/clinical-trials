  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The enormous burden of hypertension (HTN) creates a need for effective, scalable, low risk
      interventions. The DASH program of diet and exercise based lifestyle change is the most
      well-established, evidence-based behavioral intervention to control HTN. Its recommendations
      are central to HTN control national guidelines and consumer health products aimed at
      behavioral management of HTN. However, translating these recommendations into
      population-wide, inexpensive, sustainable programs have to date proven largely unrealized.
      The objective of the proposed study is to determine the efficacy of a HTN intervention
      behavior change platform, 'DASH Mobile', in which patients with HTN receive counseling about
      the DASH diet, physical activity and HTN related behaviors from health coaches trained in
      evidenced-based behavioral counseling methods. DASH mobile has two primary components: 1) a
      smartphone app that captures patients' behavioral data using intuitive self-tracking for DASH
      diet intake and Bluetooth wireless sensors for blood pressure, weight and physical activity
      and 2) a web-based coaching portal through which health coaches view and respond to patients'
      behavioral data and assist them in setting goals for changing behaviors consistent with their
      HTN behavior change plan. We aim to conduct a pilot trial of 30 HTN patients to determine
      improvement from baseline to 3-month follow-up in physiological (blood pressure, weight);
      behavioral (diet &amp; physical activity); and psychological (e.g., quality of life) measures
      over a 3-month intervention. Completing this research will result in preliminary feasibility
      and efficacy data for a larger randomized efficacy trial.
