      Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and tolerability when BI 2536 was
      given on Day 1 and Day 15 in combination with gemcitabine given on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15
      every 28 days in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
      characterisation the antitumor activity, pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and CA 19-9 tumor
      marker response in response to the combination of BI 2536 with gemcitabine in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

               1. have not received gemcitabine chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic
                  pancreatic cancer or

               2. have progressive disease not before at least 6 months from cessation of adjuvant
                  gemcitabine chemotherapy following curative surgical tumor resection

          -  Male or female patient aged 18 years or older

             with a long (years) history or recurrent venocclusive disease clearly preceding the
             diagnosis of pancreatic cancer will be excluded from the study. Patients with recent
             hypercoagulable state (ie deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) due to
             pancreatic cancer who are clinically stable on low molecular weight heparin will not
             be excluded)
