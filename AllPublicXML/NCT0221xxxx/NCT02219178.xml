               -  A monoclonal protein (paraprotein) in either serum or urine ( except in the cases
                  of non-secretory myeloma).

             If no monoclonal protein is detected (non-secretory disease), then ≥ 30% monoclonal
             bone marrow plasma cells and/or a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma required.

               -  Evidence of end-organ damage felt related to the plasma cell disorder related
                  organ or tissue impairment (ROTI), commonly referred to by the acronym 'CRAB':

                    -  Hypercalcaemia: serum calcium (corrected for albumin) &gt;
                       10.5mg/sL/&gt;2.65mmol/L or upper limit of normal

                    -  Renal insufficiency defined as serum creatinine &gt; 2mg/sL/177μmol/L

                    -  Anaemia: Normochromic, normocytic with a haemoglobin value &gt; 2g/dL below the
                       lower limit of normal or a haemoglobin &lt; 10g/dL

                    -  Bone lesions (lytic lesions, severe osteopenia or pathologic fractures) as
                       shown by CT scan and/or skeletal survey

          2. Patient has received no prior treatment with any systemic therapy for the treatment of
             multiple myeloma.

               -  Prior treatment of hypercalcaemia or spinal cord compression with corticosteroids
                  does not disqualify the patient (the dose should not exceed the equivalent of 160
                  mg of dexamethasone in a 2 week period)

               -  Bisphosphonates are permitted

                  eligible. Two weeks must have lapsed since last date of radiotherapy, which is
                  recommended to be a limited field. Patients who require concurrent radiotherapy
                  should have entry to the protocol deferred until the radiotherapy is completed
                  and 2 weeks have passed since the last date of therapy.

             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care

          4. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of signing Informed Consent

             childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with
             a sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/mL 10 to14 days prior to therapy and repeated again
             within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be
             filled within 7 days as required by Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management
             Plan) and must either commit to complete abstinence from heterosexual contact or begin

             additional effective (barrier) method, AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she
             starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men
             must practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with
             a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All study participants must be

             mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the
             uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not
             been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out
             childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. has had menses at any
             time during the preceding 24 consecutive months)
