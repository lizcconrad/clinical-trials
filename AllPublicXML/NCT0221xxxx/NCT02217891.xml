  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study, IFACT - Incidental Findings in Advanced Cancer Therapy, will address this
      research gap by examining MSK patients' attitudes, preferences, and information needs
      regarding incidental findings arising from tumor genomic profiling.

    <textblock>
      Part 1, the investigators will recruit 40 participants from those already enrolled in
      existing MSK IRB protocol #12-245 (PI: David Hyman, MD) including male and female patients
      who have been diagnosed with late-stage breast, colorectal, bladder, and lung cancer (some of
      the most common cancers in this study population).

      Part 2, the investigators will recruit 20 participants from those who have actually received
      incidental germline findings from MSK IRB protocol #12-245 Consent Part C in order to
      cognitively test novel survey items about their knowledge and perceived utility of their
      incidental findings (note that the content of these items will be derived from the data
      collected in Part 1)

    <description>Participants' responses regarding the benefits and harms of incidental findings arising from tumor genomic profiling will be used to generate novel questionnaire items to assess the construct of perceived personal and clinical utility, which will be tested, along with items designed to assess knowledge about tumor genomic profiling and incidental findings.
Part 2, the investigators will conduct 30-minute cognitive interviews to assess participants' understanding and opinions about the novel items designed to assess perceived personal and clinical utility of incidental findings and knowledge about incidental findings arising from tumor genomic profiling.</description>

    <description>Pts will participate in a 45-60-minute, one-on-one, audio-recorded interview. They will be conducted over the telephone or in person at the MSK Counseling Center. They will be conducted in accordance with a semi-structured interview guide developed by our study team of experts in clinical genetics, health psychology, &amp; qualitative methodology. Topics to be covered in the interview include: 1) perceived potential benefits &amp; harms of tumor genomic profiling; 2) interest in &amp; perceived benefits &amp; harms of incidental findings arising from tumor genomic profiling; 3) anticipated process &amp; needs for decision-making about learning incidental findings; 4) interest in learning specific kinds of incidental findings (including those related to treatable diseases, different cancers, non-treatable diseases, &amp; those that only have meaning for family members); 5) preferences about sharing incidental findings with other people; &amp; 6) implications of &amp; concerns about incidental findings for family.</description>
