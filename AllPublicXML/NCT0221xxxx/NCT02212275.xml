    <textblock>
      The investigators overarching aim is to obtain preliminary data to support a larger grant to
      validate a novel objective, physiologically-based outcome measure for clinical trials in
      autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) called the cortical metric. Absence of such an outcome
      measure has greatly hindered the development of treatments for core symptoms of ASD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cortical metric is a single numeric measurement that is calculated using a
      multi-parametric mathematical approach from a series of measurements of the speed, intensity,
      diameter, and distance between two vibrations with which a person reacts to and can
      distinguish vibrations from small brushes that touch the top side of fingers on the left hand
      under multiple conditions designed to elicit cortical adaptation The cortical metric is based
      on the neurobiological principle that the nerves in the fingertips project to adjacent groups
      of neurons that work together to continuously optimize perceptions of touch under varying
      conditions. Such perceptual optimization reflects the shifting excitatory and inhibitory
      actions of individual neurons. We hypothesize that the brain's processing of vibration is
      similar to its processing of other kinds of information. We also hypothesize that in people
      with ASD adjacent groups of neurons work together less well to process information.

      Specific Aim 1: Obtain evidence regarding the ability of the &quot;cortical metric&quot; to distinguish
      between 8-12 year-olds with typical development and with high functioning autism spectrum
      disorders (ASDs).

      Hypothesis 1: The cortical metric of children with ASD will differ from that of age matched,
      typically developing children. This difference will be consistent with lower than normal
      local functional connectivity.

      Specific Aim 2: Validate the test-retest reliability of the cortical metric by examining its
      stability of over an average of 3 weeks with no intervening interventions in both groups of
      children.

      Hypothesis 2: Test-retest reliability will be highly correlated in both groups of children.

      Specific Aim 3: Obtain preliminary proof of mechanism data that the cortical metric assesses
      the excitatory: inhibitory balance of intra-cortical connections by examining the effect of
      acute exposure to dextromethorphan (DXM), which transiently blocks one type of excitatory
      neurotransmission

      Hypothesis 3: DXM will alter the cortical metric consistent with reduced adaptation.

      The completion of these aims will be essential to design a larger federally funded trial to
      validate the cortical metric as an outcome measure in a more heterogeneous pediatric ASD
      sample. Specifically, we will aim to demonstrate that 1) the cortical metric differs between
      children with ASD and with normal development, 2) that the cortical metric has minimal
      variability over time in the absence of fno major changes in brain function, and 3) that the
      cortical metric changes in response to a specific, temporary reduction in excitatory
      stimulation caused by a single DXM dose.

      A larger grant could focus on determining how sensitive and clinically relevant changes in
      the cortical metric are.

      If we are not able to demonstrate the potential for the cortical metric to be changed by
      agents that reduce excitatory stimulation acutely or if the variability of the cortical
      metric over 3 weeks is too great, no further examination of the cortical metric as an outcome
      measure in ASD trials would be pursued. If there are not differences in the cortical metric
      of children with and without ASD, we would be less interested in further examining the
      cortical metric.

    <description>At visit 2 the cortical metric will be measured 20 min prior to a single dose of DXM and 2hrs after the dose of DXM. . This addresses Specific Aim 3 of the trial. There are 3 primary outcomes all involving the cortical metric because the tool will not be useful to detect treatment changes unless all three outcomes demonstrate the desired response.

    <description>The difference between the cortical metric measured 20 minutes before DXM treatment at visit 2, which occurs 3 weeks after the baseline = time 0 visit, and the cortical metric measured 3 weeks earlier at the baseline visit = time 0. We presume their will be no major changes in brain functioning over 3 weeks.
This addresses Specific Aim 2 of the trial, regarding test retest stability. There are 3 primary outcomes all involving the cortical metric because the tool will not be useful to detect treatment changes unless all three outcomes demonstrate the desired response.</description>

    <measure>The Cortical Metric</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline = time 0</time_frame>
    <description>The cortical metric will be measured at the baseline of the study = time 0. We will compare the mean cortical metric and the range of the cortical metric between the ASD and typically developing groups.
This addresses Specific Aim 1 of the trial. There are 3 primary outcomes all involving the cortical metric because the tool will not be useful to detect treatment changes unless all three outcomes demonstrate the desired response. The goal of this aim is to replicate the findings of the John Hopkins University group that found differences in the cortical metric between groups of children 8-12 years old with ASD and with typical development.</description>

    <description>The ABC focuses on problem behaviors in five subdomains: irritability, attention, repetitive behaviors, unusual speech, and social withdrawal and will be completed by subject's parent/guardian or caregiver.
We will examine the correlation between the ABC Total score and the cortical metric.</description>

    <measure>Pervasive Developmental Disorders Behavior Inventory - Screening Version Score (PDDBI-SV) Social Deficit Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline = time 0</time_frame>
    <description>The PDDBI-SV examines both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors related to autism. The adaptive items are reverse scored and then all items are summed to generate the social deficit score. It is not age specific. This questionnaire will be completed by subject's parent/guardian or caregiver. The correlation between the PDD-BI SV Social Deficit score and the cortical metric will be examined.</description>

    <measure>Social Responsiveness Scale, Version 2 Total Score (SRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time 0 = Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This 65-item rating scale measures the severity of autism spectrum symptoms as they occur in natural social settings (Constantino, Davis et al. 2003). Completed by a parent or teacher in just 15 to 20 minutes, the SRS provides a clear picture of a child's social impairments, assessing social awareness, social information processing, capacity for reciprocal social communication, social anxiety/avoidance, and autistic preoccupations and traits. It is appropriate for use with children from 4 to 18 years of age. The SRS measures impairment on a quantitative scale across a wide range of severity--which is consistent with recent research indicating that autism is best conceptualized as a spectrum condition rather than an all-or-nothing diagnosis. This will be completed by the subject's parent/guardian or caregiver.
The correlation between the SRS Total score and the cortical metric will be examined.</description>
