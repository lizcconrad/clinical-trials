  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether specific patterns of circulating
      micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are associated with aortic aneurysm and dissection in
      patients with hereditary aortopathy syndromes. The most common of these syndromes is Marfan
      Syndrome (MFS), but several other recognized aortopathy syndromes are well characterized. The
      investigators propose the use of a simple blood test, from which miRNA profiles can be
      measured in individuals with aortopathy syndromes to be compared with miRNAs observed in a
      control population that has no known predisposition for aortic disease. The investigators
      hypothesize that microRNA profiles in individuals with Marfan syndrome, and related
      disorders, will be distinct from those seen in a control group. The investigators predict
      that up- or down-regulation of certain miRNAs will correlate with the presence and severity
      of aortic aneurysm, responses to medical therapy, and ultimately could be used to determine
      when an individual may be at risk of dissection.

        All individuals up to 60 years seen in the Children's Hospital of Colorado and University
        Hospital Marfan Syndrome Clinics will be eligible for enrollment in this study. Individuals
        with a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome with or without genetic confirmation will be
        included as will patients with recognized aortopathy syndromes or family history of
        aortopathy with evidence of aorta disease. Subjects will be primarily recruited through the
        Heart Institute at Children's Hospital Colorado and through the cardiology team at the
        University of Colorado Hospital. Pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome and related
        aortopathy syndromes are primarily followed in the Principal Investigator, Dr. Chatfield's,
        Cardiac Genetics Clinic at Children's Hospital Colorado and will be recruited from this
        clinic. Adult patients with aortopathy syndromes are followed primarily in the Adult
        Congenital Heart Disease Clinic at University of Colorado Hospital.
