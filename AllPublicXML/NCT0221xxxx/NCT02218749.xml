  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether initial triaging to physiotherapists of
      patients with musculoskeletal disorders who seek health care from primary care clinics
      affects the patients health and/or health care utilization differently than initial
      consultation with a general practitioner.
