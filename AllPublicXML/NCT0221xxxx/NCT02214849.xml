  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a two-way texting platform to be used as an
      adjunct tool for breastfeeding peer counselors can improve breastfeeding behaviors among
      women enrolled in the WIC program in Connecticut. The hypothesis of the study is that
      providing additional information and support through text messaging starting in pregnancy and
      continuing after the birth of the child will increase exclusive breastfeeding rates during
      the first six months of life.

    <measure>Change in breastfeeding self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks after birth</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy refers to an individuals' confidence in their capability to initiate, maintain, and (if stopped) re-start breastfeeding. It will be measured with the scale proposed by Schwarzer. Self-efficacy scale includes 5 questions, each with 4 response options ranging from &quot;very false&quot; to &quot;very true&quot;. Average score will be generated by summing responses to questions 1 through 5 and dividing by the total number of questions. Average scores will range from 1 to 4. The higher the score the better the level of self-efficacy.

    <description>Action planning refers to the &quot;when&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, and &quot;how&quot; of the behavior or the sequence of events making up breastfeeding behaviors. It will be measured with the scale proposed by Schwarzer. Action planning scale includes 7 questions, each with 4 response options ranging from &quot;very false&quot; to &quot;very true&quot;. An average score will be generated by summing responses to questions 1 through 7 and dividing by the total number of questions. Average scores will range from 1 to 4. The higher the score the better the level of action planning.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Coping planning refers to the identification of potential barriers to engaging in and maintaining breastfeeding behavior and the extent to which an individual has developed strategies to cope with those barriers. It will be measured with the scale proposed by Schwarzer. Coping planning scale includes 6 questions, each with 4 response options ranging from &quot;very false&quot; to &quot;very true&quot;. An average score will be generated by summing responses to questions 1 through 6 and dividing by the total number of questions. Average scores will range from 1 to 4. The higher the score the better the level of coping planning.

    <description>Women enrolled in the WIC program and receiving breastfeeding peer counseling services will receive text messages to support them with their breastfeeding intentions. They will start receiving automated text messages starting in pregnancy and continuing throughout the first 6 months after giving birth. Messaging during pregnancy will emphasize what to expect in the hospital, the onset of lactation, skin-to-skin contact with baby, early and often breastfeeding in post-partum period, milk transfer (suck &amp; swallow), positioning (with links), common breastfeeding problems and how to seek help. Throughout the study, participants will be able to respond to automated text messages with specific questions that will be received and answered by their WIC program peer counselors. Texting will also have prompts to respond occasionally (at minimum once every two weeks) to ensure that phone is still in service and that the participant in the intervention arm are receiving intervention.</description>
