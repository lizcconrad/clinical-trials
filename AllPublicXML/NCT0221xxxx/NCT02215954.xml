      This was a phase III, randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-arm, multicenter, study in
      Japanese patients. Patients, who signed an informed consent and fulfilled all screening
      criteria, were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following 3 treatment groups: &quot;FE
      999169 Split Dosing Schedule&quot;, &quot;FE 999169 Day Before Dosing Schedule&quot; and &quot; Niflec On the Day
      Dosing Schedule&quot; in subjects requiring colonoscopy.

    <measure>The Efficacy Rate Based on the Overall Colon Cleansing Effect as Assessed by the Independent Central Judging Committee Using the Japanese Colon Cleansing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (day of colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy rate was based on the overall colon cleansing effect as assessed by the independent central judging committee: the rate of responders who were defined as subjects with a 1 or 2 rating in each colon segment on the Japanese colon cleansing scale, which has scale of 1 (Excellent observation) to 5 (Unable to judge). One of the 5 ratings to each of the colon segments (rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, and ascending colon/cecum) was given according to the description and the representative pictures of each rating. A subject who had a 1 or 2 rating in each colon segment was counted as a responder in the overall colon cleansing effect. Otherwise they were counted as a non-responder.</description>

    <measure>The Efficacy Rate Based on the Overall Colon Cleansing Effect Assessed by the Investigators at the Sites Using the Japanese Colon Cleansing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (day of colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy rate was based on the overall colon cleansing effect as assessed by the investigators at sites: the rate of responders who were defined as subjects with a 1 or 2 rating in each colon segment on the Japanese colon cleansing scale, which has scale of 1 (Excellent observation) to 5 (Unable to judge). One of the 5 ratings to each of the colon segments (rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, and ascending colon/cecum) was given according to the description and the representative pictures of each rating. A subject who had a 1 or 2 rating in each colon segment was counted as a responder in the overall colon cleansing effect. Otherwise they were counted as a non-responder.</description>

    <measure>The Total Scores of the Colon Cleansing Effect by the Investigators at Sites Using the Ottawa Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (day of colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The total Ottawa scale score was calculated by adding the ratings (0 to 4) for each of the three colon segments, Ascending colon (ascending, cecum), Mid colon (transverse, descending), and Recto-sigmoid colon, in addition to the overall fluid quantity rating (0 (small), 1 (medium), or 2 (large) ). This gave a sum of 0 (best) to 12 (worst) for overall assessment of colon cleansing, and an additional 0 to 2 for the global fluid quantity rating. The final range of the score was from 0 (excellent) to 14 (solid stool in each colon segment and lots of fluid).</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Acceptability of the Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) by Subjects Using a Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 - Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The mean score of subjects who gave favourable impression on their assigned IMPs with 3 or 5 points scales, and the frequency of the response for yes/no questions was summarized in each of question for each treatment arm.
Ease of consuming the assigned IMPs with a scale of 1(Very easy) to 5 (Very difficult)
Overall impression of the assigned IMPs with a scale of 1(Excellent) to 5 (Bad)
Taste of the assigned IMPs with a scale of 1 (Excellent) to 5 (Bad)
Volume of the assigned IMPs with a scale of 1(Very much) to 3 (No problem)
Impression of the assigned IMPs compared with other colon cleansing products with a scale of 1 (Much better) to 5 (Much worse)</description>

        <title>The Efficacy Rate Based on the Overall Colon Cleansing Effect as Assessed by the Independent Central Judging Committee Using the Japanese Colon Cleansing Scale</title>
        <description>The efficacy rate was based on the overall colon cleansing effect as assessed by the independent central judging committee: the rate of responders who were defined as subjects with a 1 or 2 rating in each colon segment on the Japanese colon cleansing scale, which has scale of 1 (Excellent observation) to 5 (Unable to judge). One of the 5 ratings to each of the colon segments (rectum, sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, and ascending colon/cecum) was given according to the description and the representative pictures of each rating. A subject who had a 1 or 2 rating in each colon segment was counted as a responder in the overall colon cleansing effect. Otherwise they were counted as a non-responder.</description>

        <title>The Total Scores of the Colon Cleansing Effect by the Investigators at Sites Using the Ottawa Scale</title>
        <description>The total Ottawa scale score was calculated by adding the ratings (0 to 4) for each of the three colon segments, Ascending colon (ascending, cecum), Mid colon (transverse, descending), and Recto-sigmoid colon, in addition to the overall fluid quantity rating (0 (small), 1 (medium), or 2 (large) ). This gave a sum of 0 (best) to 12 (worst) for overall assessment of colon cleansing, and an additional 0 to 2 for the global fluid quantity rating. The final range of the score was from 0 (excellent) to 14 (solid stool in each colon segment and lots of fluid).</description>
