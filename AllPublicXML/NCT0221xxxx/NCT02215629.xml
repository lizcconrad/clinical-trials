  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of VS-4718 in two types of
      leukemia patients and to find the right dose of VS-4718 for future clinical trials.

      Other purposes of this study include:

        -  Testing for study drug VS-4718 levels in blood over time and what happens to the study
           drug in patients.

        -  To find out if there are certain biomarkers in leukemia patients that predict if and how
           4718 study drug may or may not work.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To find the maximum tolerated dose of VS-4718</measure>
    <time_frame>Dose Escalation will occurr according to the standard 3+3 design where three subjects are dosed with the same dosage in the first Cycle (of 28 days); subjects will be evaluated for DLTs on Days: 1, 8, 15, 22 and 28 of first Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>In the absence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), each subject will receive VS-4718 for a minimum of 28 days of continuous daily dosing (1 cycle), and may continue to receive additional cycles until disease progression or other treatment discontinuation criteria have been met. It is estimated that subjects could potentially receive VS-4718 for up to an additional 2-3 cycles before withdrawal criteria apply.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and Tolerability of VS-4718 Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety and tolerability of VS-4718 will be evaluated in each Cycle of 28 days; more specifically, evaluations will occur at a minimum on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 28 of the first Cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Specific key measures/observations used to assess safety and tolerability will be: serious adverse events, incidence and severity of adverse events, physical exams (including vital sign measurements), ECGs, and clinical laboratory evaluations (chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure Pharmacokinetics of VS-4718</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured concentrations during Cycle 1 on Days 1, 2, 15, and 16. Also on Cycle 2 Day 1 for subjects that continue on study after Cycle 1.</time_frame>
