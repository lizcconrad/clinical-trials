  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess comparative bioavailability of a test formulation
      of Metformin HCl 1000 mg granules manufactured by Indeus Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai
      India (An Affiliate Of Disphar International B.V., The Netherlands) relative to Glucophage
      1000 mg film-coated tablets of Merck GmbH, Austria in 54 healthy adult subjects under fed
      conditions. The second aim is to asses the safety of subjects and to determine other
      pharmacokinetic data.
