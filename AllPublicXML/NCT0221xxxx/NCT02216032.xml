      Thirty Million Words Home Visiting: A Longitudinal RCT is a longitudinal, randomized control
      trial, which is required to confirm whether the parent behavior changes seen during the
      feasibility trial are sustainable, and, critically, whether those changes translate into
      positive impacts on child language outcomes, child social-emotional development, and
      subsequent school readiness. The investigators will deliver the Thirty Million Words (TMW)
      Curriculum to 100 Treatment families, and the investigators will be following the children
      through kindergarten in order to measure the effects and sustainability of the curriculum.
      The investigators will deliver a Nutrition Curriculum to 100 Control families in order to
      control for the possible attentional effects experienced by those in the Treatment group.
      Moreover, as an ethical consideration, the investigators wish to also provide families in the
      Control condition with valuable education that may enhance their children's development.

      The investigators hypothesize that the primary effects of the TMW Intervention will
      significantly 1) improve low-SES parents' understanding of the importance of parent language
      in a child's development, 2) increase parents' linguistic interaction, responsiveness, and
      overall engagement with their children, and 3) increase children's language output.
      Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that increased parental interaction will result in
      4) an improvement in children's social-emotional development. Finally, the investigators
      hypothesize that these social-emotional and linguistic gains through early development, along
      with sustained increased parental engagement, will be expressed in 5) increased child school
      readiness upon kindergarten entry.

      Thirty Million Words Home Visiting: A Longitudinal RCT is a longitudinal, randomized control
      trial that will take place over the course of five years. The study will consist of two
      groups, the Treatment group and the Control group. Timelines and measurements are consistent
      across both groups. (Please see Study Procedures for a more detailed explanation of each
      phase.) During the Recruitment Phase, a TMW research assistant (RA) will recruit participants
      for the study. If interested in joining the study, participants will complete the Preliminary
      Enrollment Consent. From this point forward, all study activities will take place in the
      participant's home. To follow the completion of the Preliminary Enrollment Consent,
      participants will be asked to complete a series of baseline measurements over a four-week
      time period. RAs will facilitate the collection of these measures. Following satisfactory
      completion of the baseline measures, participants will move on to the Enrollment Phase at
      which point they will complete the Enrollment Consent. Additionally, participants will
      complete Video 1, administered by an RA. Following the Enrollment Phase, participants will
      move on to the Intervention Phase. During the Intervention Phase, participants will first
      complete Assessment 1. A staff member of the National Opinion Research Center at the
      University of Chicago (NORC) will conduct this and all subsequent assessments. Following
      Assessment 1, participants will receive 12 bi-weekly home visits over a six-month period from
      trained TMW Home Visitors. During the home visits, Home Visitors will deliver one of two
      different curricula to the respective groups. The Treatment group will receive the TMW
      Curriculum. The Control group will receive the alternative Nutrition Curriculum, which
      provides information about the importance of healthy nutrition for child development,
      strategies for healthy eating, and meal preparation. In addition to receiving the home
      visits, participants will also complete LENA recordings on a bi-weekly basis, alternating
      weeks with the home visiting schedule. Following the Intervention Phase, participants will
      move on to the 42-month Follow-up Phase. In this phase, participants will complete 4
      curricula supplementation 'Boosters,' 6 video sessions, 6 Assessments, and 8 more LENA
      recordings.

    <description>We will deliver the TMW Curriculum to 100 Treatment families. The TMW Curriculum is comprised of 1) 12 educational modules, 2) animations and videos of real parent-child interactions to teach parents about the science behind child brain development, and model strategies for improving parents' child-directed speech, 3) video modeling and collaborative goal setting, and 4) quantitative linguistic feedback from Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) recordings.</description>
