      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the use of multiple subcisions over several
      visits will improve the appearance of rolling acne scars compared to no treatment.

      This study was a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.

    <description>At the start of the procedure, a straight vitrectomy knife will be inserted subdermally and will be slowly advanced parallel to the dermis. Rapid advancement and retraction of the needle under the scarred area in a lancing motion will be performed to abrade the underside of the dermis followed by side to side sweeping motions attempting to break any fibrous attachments to the deeper tissues.</description>
