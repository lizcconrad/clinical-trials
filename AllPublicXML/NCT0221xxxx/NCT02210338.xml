  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the better device to facilitate intubation in patients with a
      limited neck movement and small mouth opening. This may help anesthesiology as well as
      emergency medicine practitioners and departments to decide when choosing between these two
      conceptually similar device. The hypothesis to be tested is that the C-MACÂ® is more superior
      when compared to the Bonfils Intubation Fibrescope in success of intubation, time to
      intubation and complication rate in patients with a fixed cervical collar.

Adequate muscle relaxation will be confirmed by the use of a standard neuromuscular Train-of-Four monitor, showing no twitch. Intubation will then proceed with the assigned airway device. A successful outcome at intubation will involve being able to pass an appropriately sized endotracheal tube pass the vocal cords into the trachea on the first try, as evidenced by the presence of end tidal carbon dioxide on a capnograph.</description>

Adequate muscle relaxation will be confirmed by the use of a standard neuromuscular Train-of-Four monitor, showing no twitch. Time to successful intubation will then be measured from the first handling of the airway device, until successful intubation with an endotracheal tube is confirmed by the presence of end tidal carbon dioxide on a capnograph trace.</description>
