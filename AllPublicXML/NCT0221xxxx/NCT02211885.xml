    <textblock>
      Study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 14C-radiolabeled BIRB 796 BS and its
      metabolites including excretion and mass balance of parent compound and radioactivity; to
      isolate, identify and quantify major radiolabeled metabolites of BIRB 796 in plasma, urine
