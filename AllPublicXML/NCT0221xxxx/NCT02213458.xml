  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3 year clinical trial evaluating the benefits of a program that supports model care
      for patients with dementia and their family caregivers. Subjects will be recruited from
      several sites in San Francisco. Subjects determined to be eligible will be consented and
      randomized into one of two groups. Two thirds of patients will be enrolled into Navigated
      Care that provides them with assistance in meeting important benchmarks in their care, for
      example completion of legal and financial planning and strategies for minimizing caregiver
      burden. One third of patients will be enrolled to a control group, entitled Survey of Care.
      Outcomes include quality of life, health care utilization, caregiver burden, and satisfaction
      with care.

    <description>Navigated Care emphasizes continuous and personalized care and is based on 3 modules: the Caregiver Module that includes educational interventions and connects families with community resources, the Decision-Making Module that facilitates proactive medical, financial, and safety decisions, and the Medication Module that identifies inappropriate medication usage via pharmacist review. Innovative technology in the form of a &quot;dashboard&quot; functions as a patient care management system used by Care Team Navigators (CTNs).</description>
