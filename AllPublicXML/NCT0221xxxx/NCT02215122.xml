  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover study to assess the systemic pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate
      (FP) and salmeterol (SAL). Study medication will be administered as fixed dose combinations
      (250 µg FP and 50 µg SAL) from the Advair® Diskus®, Seretide™ Accuhaler™ and CRC749 inhalers.

      Study drug will be administered through the inhaled route to healthy subjects in single doses
      (three inhalations, i.e. total dose 750 µg FP and 150 µg SAL).

      Each subject will receive the following treatments in a random order:

      A. MGR001 B. Seretide™ Accuhaler™ C. Advair® Diskus® There will be a wash out of 3 7 days
      between treatment periods. Pharmacokinetics will be assessed by the measurement of plasma
      concentrations of FP and SAL over the 48 hours following dosing. Adverse Events will be
      collected throughout the study.

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,

             units/week for males (1 unit = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

             protocol.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory

             study results.

          -  Evidence or significant history of childhood or adult asthma, or any significant
             history of wheeze, chronic cough, dyspnea at rest or acute bronchospasm.

          -  Subjects with abnormal lung function tests at screening, defined as an FEV1 and/or FVC
             which is &lt;80% of predicted.

          -  Subjects who are current smokers. Ex-smokers who have given up smoking for &lt;6 months
             and/or have a smoking pack history of ≥10 pack years.

          -  Subjects with a lower respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to lactose or sensitivity to the ingredients of
             Advair®/Seretide™, including subjects with severe milk protein allergy in whom Advair®

          -  Subject is the Investigator or a sub-Investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
