  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the benefits of expressive compared to
      neutral writing in individuals with Parkinson's Disease and their support persons.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to complete three, 20 minute sessions of expressive or
      neutral writing. Participants will complete evaluation of outcomes at baseline, immediate
      post, 4 month and 10 month follow ups to establish if benefits remain over time. Impact of
      these therapies on thinking abilities, physical health, and patient and support person
      ratings of thinking skills, mood and quality of life will be evaluated. Expressive writing is
      hypothesized to result in greater improvements and/or stability of function on
      neuropsychological tests of attention, working memory, learning, and memory skills compared
      to the neutral writing condition.

      Results from this study will determine whether brief writing exercises are easily used by and
      beneficial for individuals with Parkinson's Disease and their support persons. If positive
      benefit is observed, information from this study will be used to further optimize these
      therapies for larger trials designed to evaluate the value of the therapies for individuals
      with Parkinson's Disease and their support persons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The expressive writing condition asks participants to write about the most stressful or
      traumatic experience of their entire lives over three, 20 minute private writing sessions.
      The neutral control writing conditions asks participants to write about how they spent their
      time the day before.
