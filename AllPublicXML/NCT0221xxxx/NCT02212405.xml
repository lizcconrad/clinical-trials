  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Findings from this study may demonstrate how the insula contributes to reward pathways
      involved in addiction. There are three main hypotheses for this trial. The first is that
      inhibiting the insula using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will not cause noticeable
      changes of dopamine release in the striatum. The second is that stimulating the insula with
      TMS will increase dopamine release in the striatum, and will be visualized on PET imaging as
      decreased radiotracer binding. The third hypothesis is that the participants will not
      experience major side effects from TMS on the insula.

      This project will take advantage of the recently developed Deep rTMS coil to target the
      insular cortex. Few studies have examined the possibility of using repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for nicotine addiction and none so far have explored the use of a
      coil that specifically targets the insular region. The objective of this study is to test
      whether low and high-frequency rTMS of the insula modulates striatal dopamine (DA) release in
      healthy humans. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with [11C]-(+)-PHNO, a radiotracer which
      is very sensitive to fluctuations in DA transmission in the human brain, will be used to
      assess the impact of rTMS on dopamine levels. This project will yield the first data in
      humans linking the insula to the DA system in vivo. These findings could lead to the
      identification of optimal parameters for Deep rTMS to use secondarily in a proof of principle
      clinical study in smokers.
