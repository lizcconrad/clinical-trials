    <textblock>
      The proposed study will test the efficacy of a cognitive training program to improve working
      memory in a sample of HIV-infected persons. Investigators will assign 40 HIV-infected adults
      with poor medication adherence to one of two conditions (20/group): the experimental
      cognitive training intervention or a control training condition. Participants will complete
      12 training sessions across 10 weeks and will complete assessments at baseline and
      post-training. The specific aims are to:

        1. Investigate the effects of the cognitive training intervention on working memory and
           delay discounting in HIV-infected persons.

           Hypothesis 1: Participants assigned to active cognitive training, compared to those in
           the attention-matched control group, will have greater improvements in working memory
           and reductions in delay discounting.

        2. Characterize adherence to antiretroviral medications in this population and examine
           medication adherence after cognitive training.

      Hypothesis 2: Participants assigned to active cognitive training, compared to those in the
      attention-matched control group, will have greater improvements in medication adherence.

      This study tests the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a computerized cognitive
      training program to improve working memory and decrease impulsivity among HIV-infected
      individuals with poor medication adherence. The specific aims are to: (1) Investigate the
      effects of the cognitive training intervention on working memory and delay discounting in
      HIV-infected persons; and (2) Characterize adherence to antiretroviral medications in this
      population and examine medication adherence after cognitive training.

      The research design includes two parts: an eligibility screening and the Cognitive Training
      study. In Part 1, Eligibility Screening, participants will complete a 2-3 hour battery of
      standardized measures to assess for study eligibility. Eligible individuals will then be
      invited to enroll in Part 2, Cognitive Training Study. Part 1 of the study will involved
      screening approximately 60 participants, with an estimated eligibility rate of 67% for Part
      2. In Part 2, participants will be assigned to one of two groups (active cognitive training
      or control training; 20 participants per group) and will complete 12 training sessions over
      10 weeks. Participants assigned to the active cognitive training group will complete
      computerized modules designed to enhance working memory, while those assigned to the
      attention-matched control group will complete inactive modules that are not designed to
      enhance memory. All Part 2 participants will complete assessments at baseline and
      post-training to evaluate the impact of the training program.

    <description>Standardized neuropsychological tests of working memory used in this study were the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task-50 and Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Digits Forward/Digits Backward Test. Using the most up-to-date published normative data, raw test scores were converted to T-scores that corrected for demographic factors such as age and education. T scores can range from 0 to 100, with 50 being average and higher scores indicating better function. The overall working memory score was computed by averaging T-scores of each of the individual tests. To examine intervention effects on working memory outcomes, we conducted a 2 (Arm: ACT vs. CON) × 2 (Time: Baseline vs. Post) mixed-model general linear model analyses. Time was the within-subjects factor defined by baseline versus 10 week follow-up, and study arm was the between-subjects factor. Age and years of education were included as covariates. The means reported here are the mean scores at 10 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Delay Discounting</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Monetary-Choice Questionnaire (MCQ), a standardized task that measures delay discounting. Participants are presented with choices between smaller, immediate rewards and larger, delayed rewards (e.g., &quot;Would you prefer $54 today or $80 in 30 days?). Participants' hyperbolic discount parameter (k value) is determined by fitting data to the following discount function equation: Vimmediate = Vdelayed / (1 + kD), in which V is the reward value in dollars and D is delay in days. K-values on this scale can range from 0.00016 to 4.00 and to normalize scores, these values were ranked from 1 to 13 for analyses. A higher rank indicates greater delay discounting.</description>

    <description>The ACT group will complete 12 individual sessions across 6-10 weeks. Sessions will utilize four commercially available memory-training programs from PSSCogRehab 2012, published by Psychological Software Service. The four programs used will be: (1) Sequence recall of digits - auditory (SRD-A), (2) Sequenced Recall Reversed Digits - Auditory (SRRD-A), (3) Sequenced Recall of Words - Visual (SRW-V), and (4) Verbal memory - categorizing (VM-C). In each training session, participants will complete each of the four memory training programs twice.</description>

However, the control program will identify the correct responses to participants, such that they do not need to engage their working memory to answer the questions correctly.</description>

        <title>Change in Working Memory</title>
        <description>Standardized neuropsychological tests of working memory used in this study were the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task-50 and Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Digits Forward/Digits Backward Test. Using the most up-to-date published normative data, raw test scores were converted to T-scores that corrected for demographic factors such as age and education. T scores can range from 0 to 100, with 50 being average and higher scores indicating better function. The overall working memory score was computed by averaging T-scores of each of the individual tests. To examine intervention effects on working memory outcomes, we conducted a 2 (Arm: ACT vs. CON) × 2 (Time: Baseline vs. Post) mixed-model general linear model analyses. Time was the within-subjects factor defined by baseline versus 10 week follow-up, and study arm was the between-subjects factor. Age and years of education were included as covariates. The means reported here are the mean scores at 10 weeks.</description>

            <description>The ACT group will complete 12 individual sessions across 6-10 weeks. Sessions will utilize four commercially available memory-training programs from PSSCogRehab 2012, published by Psychological Software Service. The four programs used will be: (1) Sequence recall of digits - auditory (SRD-A), (2) Sequenced Recall Reversed Digits - Auditory (SRRD-A), (3) Sequenced Recall of Words - Visual (SRW-V), and (4) Verbal memory - categorizing (VM-C). In each training session, participants will complete each of the four memory training programs twice.

        <title>Change in Delay Discounting</title>
        <description>Measured by Monetary-Choice Questionnaire (MCQ), a standardized task that measures delay discounting. Participants are presented with choices between smaller, immediate rewards and larger, delayed rewards (e.g., “Would you prefer $54 today or $80 in 30 days?). Participants’ hyperbolic discount parameter (k value) is determined by fitting data to the following discount function equation: Vimmediate = Vdelayed / (1 + kD), in which V is the reward value in dollars and D is delay in days. K-values on this scale can range from 0.00016 to 4.00 and to normalize scores, these values were ranked from 1 to 13 for analyses. A higher rank indicates greater delay discounting.</description>

          <title>Active Cognitive Training (ACT)</title>
          <description>The ACT group will complete 12 individual sessions across 6-10 weeks. Sessions will utilize four commercially available memory-training programs from PSSCogRehab 2012, published by Psychological Software Service. The four programs used will be: (1) Sequence recall of digits - auditory (SRD-A), (2) Sequenced Recall Reversed Digits - Auditory (SRRD-A), (3) Sequenced Recall of Words - Visual (SRW-V), and (4) Verbal memory - categorizing (VM-C). In each training session, participants will complete each of the four memory training programs twice.

          <title>Control (CON)</title>
          <description>The CON group will also complete 12 total sessions across 6-10 weeks. The same four computer programs from PSSCogRehab 2012, published by Psychological Software Service, will be used in the control group sessions. However, the control program will identify the correct responses to participants, such that they do not need to engage their working memory to answer the questions correctly.
