    <textblock>
      The investigators want to carry out a prospective study of 400 infertile Caucasian and Indian
      women who will undergo a controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). The
      investigators will collect data about ovarian reserve markers and also the results after
      ovarian stimulation in both ethnic groups.The aim is to identify differences in ovarian
      response after IVF stimulation between both groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 200 Caucasian patients and 200 Indian patients who will attend the first or second
      IVF cycle will be included.

      The date we will collect in both groups include the age, the body mass index, and the ovarian
      reserve markers like the antral follicle count (AFC), the follicle stimulation hormone (FSH)
      and antimullerian hormone (AMH) serum levels.

      The investigators will also determine the number of oocytes retrieved and the metaphase two
      oocytes in both groups after IVF stimulation.
