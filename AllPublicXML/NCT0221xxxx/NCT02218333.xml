    <measure>Change in muscle mass, strength and performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and after 12 weeks (end-of-study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in muscle is mass measured by DXA. Muscle strength and performance are measured by several physical tests such as repeated chair stands, handgrip strength, step stair test and strength in legs and torso and gait speed and are considered as the clinical relevant outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in levels of inflammatory markers</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and after 12 weeks (end-of-study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in levels of inflammatory markers in circulation and at PBMC gene Expression Level such as i.e. CRP, IL-6, TNFa, IL-8, IL-18, ICAM, VCAM.</description>

    <measure>Effect on PBMC whole genome transcriptomics</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and after 12 weeks (end-of-study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of PBMC Whole genome transcriptomics will be performed.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in body composition (including bone mineral density)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and after 12 weeks (end-of-study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in body composition are measured by DXA.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the level of appetite regulatory hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and after 12 weeks (end-of-study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the level of appetite regulatory hormones such as i.e. adiponectin, glucagon-like protein (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), ghrelin, Peptide YY (PYY) and cholecystokinin (CCK)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Lymphocyte DNA damage and repair system</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and after 12 weeks (end-of-study visit)</time_frame>
