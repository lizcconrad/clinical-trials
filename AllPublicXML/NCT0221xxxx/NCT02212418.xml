  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal hypopressive technique (AHT) is a therapy created for the treatment of the pelvic
      floor dysfunctions in the postpartum. In the last years it has been extended out of such
      medical context but there is a lack of scientific evidence, and the endurability of the
      effects of this technique are unknown. The investigator´s aim was to evaluate the effect of a
      12 weeks AHT program on 1) the tone of the pelvic floor muscles and 2) on urinary
      incontinence, in women out of the postpartum phase. In addition the investigators looked for
      the endurability of its effect.

      Methods: The investigators performed a cross-over blinded intervention study of 4 month
      duration, in which women, stratified by age, were randomly assigned to a sequence of AHT-no
      AHT or no AHT-AHT. The AHT program consisted of 30 minute sessions, 3 days per week during 2
      months. The investigators compared the effect of AHT versus no AHT, and of no AHT after 2
      months versus AHT.

      The endpoints were the differences in perineal tonometry, and urinary incontinence symptoms,
      as measured by the ICIQ_SF. Comparisons were tested with student t tests, paired or unpaired
      as adequate.

    <description>Pelvic floor tone was measured by a tonometer (PhoenixTM USB2, France) in a PelvimètreTM, and results are expressed in g/cm2. A physiotherapist specialist in urogynecology did the measurement. This measure was not available for women in their first three days of menstruation or virgins</description>
