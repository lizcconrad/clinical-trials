      The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical response to fidaxomicin oral
      suspension or tablets and vancomycin oral liquid or capsules in pediatric subjects with
      Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). It will also investigate the
      recurrence/sustained clinical response to and safety of fidaxomicin and vancomycin, as well
      as acceptance of the fidaxomicin oral suspension formulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is diagnosed with CDAD according to local diagnostic criteria. As a minimum
             there must be positive detection, within 72 hours prior to randomization, of either
             toxin A and/or toxin B in stool or positive detection of toxigenic C. difficile in
             stool and:

               -  Subject from Birth to &lt; 2 years: watery diarrhea in the 24 hours prior to
                  screening.

               -  Subject ≥ 2 years to &lt; 18 years: ≥ 3 unformed bowel movements in the 24 hours
                  prior to screening.

               -  Male and female subjects aged from birth to &lt; 18 years: Note that in the United
                  States of America subjects can only be included if aged ≥ 6 months to &lt; 18 years.

          -  For subjects &lt; 5 years: Negative rotavirus test.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential:

               -  must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening, and

               -  must use two forms of birth control (at least one of which must be a barrier
                  method) starting at Screening and throughout the study period and for 28 days
                  after the final study drug administration.

          -  Female subject must not be breastfeeding at Screening or during the study period, and
             for 28 days after the final study drug administration.

          -  Female subject must not donate ova starting at Screening and throughout the study

             before knowing the laboratory result for toxigenic C. difficile, up to four doses but
             no more than 24 hours of treatment with metronidazole, oral vancomycin or any other
             effective treatment for CDAD are allowed.

          -  Subject has pseudomembranous colitis, fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon or ileus.

             Crohn's disease etc.).

          -  Subject has diarrhea caused by an agent other than C. difficile (e.g. infections,
             infestations, drugs etc.).

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity to fidaxomicin, vancomycin or their excipients or
             to teicoplanin.

          -  Subject has received an investigational therapy within 28 days, prior to Screening,
             with the exception of studies with primary treatment for cancer without novel
             Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) and which do not affect the assessment of
