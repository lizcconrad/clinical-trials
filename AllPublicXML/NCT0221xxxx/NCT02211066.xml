  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-centre, randomized, active controlled, open label clinical trial. The
      primary hypothesis is that ticagrelor will show superiority over clopidogrel immediately
      after CTO-PCI (chronic total occlusion - percutaneous coronary intervention)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is tested in the first randomization. Both antiplatelet therapy will be used
      in both arms at the approved doses and for the approved duration therapy of 1-year. The
      secondary hypothesis will test the role of ticagrelor/clopidogrel alone and together with
      ABSORB BVS implantation in the recovery of vascular function at long-term. This hypothesis is
      tested in the second randomization. The angiographic follow-up will be scheduled at 1 or
      3-year follow-up in order to test the secondary hypothesis either at the moment of the end of
      the antiplatelet therapy or at the moment of scaffold bioresorption.

          -  Known major hematologic, neoplastic, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine
             dysfunction, which, in the judgment of the Investigator, may affect the patient's
             ability to complete the study.

          -  History of malignancy, except in patients who have been disease-free &gt;5 years or whose
             only malignancy has been basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma.
