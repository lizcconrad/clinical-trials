  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-centre, randomized, active controlled, open label clinical trial. The
      primary hypothesis is that ticagrelor will show superiority over clopidogrel immediately
      after CTO-PCI (chronic total occlusion - percutaneous coronary intervention)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is tested in the first randomization. Both antiplatelet therapy will be used
      in both arms at the approved doses and for the approved duration therapy of 1-year. The
      secondary hypothesis will test the role of ticagrelor/clopidogrel alone and together with
      ABSORB BVS implantation in the recovery of vascular function at long-term. This hypothesis is
      tested in the second randomization. The angiographic follow-up will be scheduled at 1 or
      3-year follow-up in order to test the secondary hypothesis either at the moment of the end of
      the antiplatelet therapy or at the moment of scaffold bioresorption.

          -  Known major hematologic, neoplastic, metabolic, gastrointestinal or endocrine
             dysfunction, which, in the judgment of the Investigator, may affect the patient's
             ability to complete the study.

             only malignancy has been basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma.
