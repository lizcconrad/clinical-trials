  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a most frequent complication of hemodialysis (HD) and may
      contribute to cardiovascular events and high mortality. The etiology of IDH is
      multifactorial; therefore, it remains a challenging problem in the management of HD patients.
      Because moxibustion (MO) at specific points can influences hemodynamics, we hypothesize that
      Tianjiu (auto-MO) at the traditionally used meridian points will reduce the severity of
      hypotension in patients who undergo HD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical trial, 45 patients had IDH were divided randomly into two (auto-MO therapy
      and control) groups for 4 weeks. In the Tianjiu (auto-MO) group, the patients were applied at
      3 points (Conception Vessel 4, and Kidney 1) for 3-4 h during HD sessions. All number of
      episodes complicated by symptomatic IDH during HD sessions and the number of IDH-related
      nursing interventions (Trendelenburg position, manual reduction of ultrafiltration rate,
      infusion of isotonic saline or hypertonic fluid, lowering of dialysate temperature) in a
      session were recorded. Pre- and post-dialysis systolic and diastolic BP, pre- and
      post-dialysis body weights, interdialytic weight gain, percentage of target ultrafiltration
      achieved, patient's subjective assessment of the degree of fatigue after dialysis (scale from
      0 to 10; 0, not at all, 10, extremely) and recovery time from fatigue after dialysis were
      measured at the 0, 2nd, 4th and 6th week.
