  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Great controversy exists with respect to the optimal or the minimum volume, intensity, and
      frequency of physical activity capable of attenuating the hazards of prolonged sitting on the
      metabolic profile. Thus, our study aims to comprehensively investigate the effects of
      disrupting prolonged sitting with different physical activity protocols on metabolic risk
      factors in sedentary males.

      Ten sedentary males will take part in this randomized cross-over trial consisting of four
      27-h conditions. All conditions will be identical except for the physical activity: prolonged
      sitting intervention (SIT) participants will sit continuously for 9 hours; prolonged
      sitting+interval standing intervention (STAND), participants will stand for 15 min every 30
      minutes (total 270 min) during the 9 hours of sitting; prolonged sitting+moderate-intensity
      exercise bout (MVPA) participants will perform a 30-min moderate-intensity exercise bout on a
      treadmill (energy-matched to STAND), after which they will sit for the remaining time; and
      prolonged sitting+moderate-intensity exercise bout +interval standing intervention
      (MVPA-STAND), participants will perform a 30-min moderate-intensity exercise bout on a
      treadmill (energy-matched to STAND), after which they will stand for 15 min every 30 minutes
      (total 240 min) during the remaining 8 hours of sitting. Blood glucose, insulin, lipids and
      cytokines will be determined.

      The investigators expect that disrupting prolonged sitting with intermittent standing and a
      moderate-exercise bout will positively affect the metabolic profile of the participants.
      Furthermore, we will investigate if combined, these strategies will have an additive effect.
