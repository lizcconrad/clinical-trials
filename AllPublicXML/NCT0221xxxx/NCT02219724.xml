  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MOXR0916 administered
      intravenously in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have
      progressed after all available standard therapy or for which standard therapy has proven to
      be ineffective or intolerable, or is considered inappropriate. This study will consist of a
      screening period, an initial treatment period, a re-treatment period (for participants who
      discontinue MOXR0916 after demonstration of prolonged clinical benefit), and a post-treatment
      follow-up period. Participants will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an
      expansion stage. The planned duration of the study is approximately 3 years.
