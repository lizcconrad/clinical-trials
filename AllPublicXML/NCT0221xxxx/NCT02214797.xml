  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess visual performance of prototype soft contact lens designs
      compared to commercially available contact lenses over one-week of lens wear.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, participant-masked, multiple arm, crossover dispensing clinical trial where
      participants will wear prototype (test) and commercial (control) lenses bilaterally.
      Participants will be stratified based on their refractive error into either presbyopic or
      non-presbyopic group. Each of the stratified group will have a maximum of 4 parallel arms. Up
      to 4 test lens designs will be assessed against the control/s in each parallel arm in a
      randomized cross over fashion, with a minimum 2 day washout period between the lens types.
      Each lens assessment will require 2 scheduled clinic attendances - a fitting visit and an
      evaluation visit.

    <measure>Change in visual performance over 1-week lens wear</measure>
    <time_frame>after about 20 minutes of lens wear and after about 1 week of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Acuity Visual acuity will be recorded on an interval scale. Data will be summarised as means ± standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Visual acuity will be compared between test and control lens types and time across 1 week. Interactions will be tested and, if present, the significance of lens types will be determined at each time point and over time for each lens type. Visual acuity will be analysed using linear mixed model with subject random intercepts and / or paired t-test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective response over 1-week of lens wear</measure>
    <time_frame>After about 40 mins of lens wear and after 2 days, 4 days and 1 week of lens wear</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective ratings Questionnaire Subjective ratings will be recorded on a scale of 1 to 10 on steps of 1. Data will be summarised as means ± standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Subjective ratings will be compared between test and control lens types and time across 1 week. Interactions will be tested and, if present, the significance of lens type will be determined at each time point and over time for each lens type. Subjective ratings will be analysed using linear mixed model with subject random intercepts and / or paired t-test.</description>

             disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis,
             Sjögrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic
             hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants

          -  Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment
             and/or during the clinical trial

          -  Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter
             normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participant's ocular health /
             physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at
             enrolment and/or during the clinical trial NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on
             an &quot;as needed basis&quot;, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and
             at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used

          -  Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.

          -  Previous corneal refractive surgery

          -  Contraindications to contact lens wear

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products

        The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, exclude anyone who they believe may not be
        able to fulfil the clinical trial requirements or it is believed to be in the participant's
        best interests
