  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Test the walking functionality of people following Acquired brain injury (ABI)

        2. Suggesting a new treatment for their walking impairments

        3. Follow-up of motor learning ability and balance after intervention within this
           population

      The investigators intend to target dynamic stability and gait after ABI, in a group of
      individuals with ABI who have persistent balance and mobility deficits despite being able to
      walk independently and having high scores on standard clinical balance measures.

      Interventions: Training with Re-Step system shoes.

      In this study there is no control group.

      Study design:

      Type of research: Prospective, exploratory, clinical, interventional trial

      Specific objectives are:

      To explore the efficacy of Re-step rehabilitation technology to improve dynamic balance in
      gait of people after Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).

      The investigators suggest a new technology of intervention that will induce unexpected
      changes of underfoot slopes, with Re-Step shoes, during walking and will force the central
      nervous system (CNS) to react and solve walking problems in real time.

      The investigators propose that the new approach will have a significantly motor function
      improvement on balance in gait, transferred to real environmental settings and be retained
      for long periods of time.

      Research methods:

      Subjects:

      A total of 60 subjects of ABI victims will be studied in one treatment group-Re-Step shoes
      walking training

      Time flow protocol:

      Telephone calls to patients of rehabilitation clinics and call for participation in the
      papers

      Recruiting subjects according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, after medical examination and
      consent of subjects

      Tests and measures (see outcome measures) will be applied to measure changes

        -  TO - before starting the intervention to form a base line

        -  T1 - after 20 sessions of intensive treatments 60 min each, 2-3 sessions a week. For
           each subject 10-12 weeks of treatment.

        -  T2 - 6 months after T1, a period of normal daily schedule of subjects, of no
           interventions, to check retaining of training results.

      For each subject 10-12 weeks of treatment.

      The treatments will start in a week from T0; the T1 will be performed in a week after
      training was completed; T2 will be performed 6 months (take or leave 2 weeks) after T1.

      The recruitment and training of participants will go on according to availability of
      facilities not more than 24 months.

    <description>CB&amp;M was designed to evaluate balance and mobility in patients who, although ambulatory, have balance impairments which reduce their full engagement in community living. 13 items of dynamic balance are graded 0-5 by physiotherapist. The CB&amp;M is a reliable and valid clinical outcome measure for evaluating change in ability in the higher functioning ambulatory patient with TBI.</description>

    <description>Descriptive system self reported:
The questions in the questionnaire are of 5 grades:
&quot;This survey asks for your views about your health. This information will help you keep track of how you feel and how well you are able to do your usual activities.&quot;
The QOLIBRI consists of 6 dimensions: &quot;Cognition&quot;, &quot;Self&quot;, &quot;Daily life and Autonomy&quot;, &quot;Social Relationships&quot;, &quot;Emotions &quot;and &quot;Physical Problems&quot;.
The first four scales assess 'satisfaction' and the final two scales 'feeling bothered' with key aspects of life.
The QOLIBRI scores are reported on a 0-100 scale , where 0=worst possible quality of life and 100=best possible quality of life.</description>

The CIQ was designed to assess community integration in patients living at home.
Dimension: 1. home integration. 2. social integration. 3. integration in productive activities.
Total: 15 items. The total CIQ score = Home integration score + social integration score + productivity score</description>

    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Recruitment stage</time_frame>
    <description>Widely used method for assessing cognitive mental status both in clinical practice and in research.
It is a brief, standardized method to grade patients' cognitive mental status. It assesses orientation, attention, immediate and short-term recall, language, and the ability to follow simple verbal and written commands. It provides a total score that that places the individual on a scale of cognitive function.
The MoCA places the individual on a scale of cognitive function and has a high sensitivity for detecting cognitive dysfunction</description>

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging or functional MRI (fMRI) is a functional neuroimaging procedure using MRI technology that measures brain activity by detecting associated changes in blood flow. This technique relies on the fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled. When an area of the brain is in use, blood flow to that region also increases.</description>

Time is measured while the individual walks the set distance (often the individual is given space to accelerate to his/her preferred walking speed (this distance is not included when determining speed). The distance covered is divided by the time it took the individual to walk that distance.</description>

16-item self-report measure in which patients rate their balance confidence for performing activities. This stem is used to lead into each activity considered: &quot;How confident are you that you will not lose your balance or become unsteady when you...&quot; Items are rated on a rating scale that ranges from 0 - 100 Score of zero represents no confidence, a score of 100 represents complete confidence Overall score is calculated by adding item scores and then dividing by the total number of items</description>
