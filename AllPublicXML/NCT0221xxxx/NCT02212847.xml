  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial orientation is achieved through central integration of various sensory inputs and
      prior knowledge in a statistically optimal way based on the reliability of the different
      signals. When upright, the subjective visual vertical (SVV) is accurate and precise in
      healthy human subjects. However, when roll-tilted, both systematic physiologic, roll-angle
      dependent errors (termed A- und E-effect) and a decrease in precision of SVV estimates have
      been described. In case of a sudden unilateral vestibular deficit (UVD) a significant
      imbalance between the two vestibular organs occurs at the level of the vestibular nuclei,
      disrupting the percept of vertical. The most frequent cause for such a unilateral vestibular
      deficit is an inflammation of the vestibular nerve by viral infection, termed vestibular
      neuritis (VN). While in the acute stage these patients are usually immobilized due to the
      severity of symptoms, recovery is overall good and most patients return to their daily
      activities within a few weeks. Central compensation is considered the most important
      contributor to recovery in these patients, while recovery of the damaged vestibular nerve
      occurs only in a minority of cases. While acute VN presents with sudden UVD, bilateral
      vestibular deficits (BVD) typically evolve more slowly and re-sult in distinct complaints.

      The percept of vertical can be quantified by assessing the subjective visual vertical or SVV,
      which is usually done by letting subjects adjust a luminous line along perceived direction of
      gravity. Modifications of this paradigm which are independent from retinal input are e.g.
      adjustments of a rod along perceived vertical in complete darkness (termed subjective haptic
      vertical or SHV) and self-alignments along perceived vertical (subjective postural vertical
      or SPV) and perceived horizontal (subjective postural horizontal or SPH) in complete
      darkness. Previous research has proposed no unified percept of vertical as errors assessed in
      different domains (visual, haptic, postural) were diverging in patients with acute UVD. While
      errors were profound for the SVV, the SPV remained accurate.

      Here the investigators aim to quantify verticality perception in patients with either acute
      or chronic UVD and patients with BVD both in upright and roll-tilted positions. Specifically,
      the investigators will use different paradigms to address the ques-tion whether there is a
      unified percept of vertical and how a bias in this percept changes over time.

    <description>The accuracy of verticality perception is defined as the individual median value of a series of line adjustments along perceived direction of gravity (units: degrees). this results in a report of the participants perceived direction of gravity relative to true earth-vertical. Repetitive adjustments will be collected while on the turntable, each adjustment lasting up to 15seconds.</description>

    <description>The precision of verticality perception is defined as the individual median absolute deviation of single line adjustments along perceived direction of vertical (units: degrees). Repetitive adjustments will be collected while on the turntable, each adjustment lasting up to 15seconds. The resulting value reflects the amount of trial-to-trial variability in a given subject, which is inverse correlated to the precision.</description>
