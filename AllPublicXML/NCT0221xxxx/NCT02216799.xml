  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia increases the risk of complications in surgical patients. Focus on poor
      glycemic control as a contributor to adverse outcomes in settings outside the intensive care
      unit (ICU) is often dismissed. Total parenteral Nutrition (TPN) has been used in providing
      surgical patients with nutrition to prevent deterioration of nutritional status. However,
      many diabetic patients receiving TPN develop exaggerated hyperglycemia that requires frequent
      insulin administration via sliding scale. Providing diabetic patient's receiving TPN basal
      insulin is a known strategy to aid in blood sugar control and prevention of high blood sugar
      spikes. Many strategies for basal insulin provision have been utilized clinically during the
      administration of TPN; this includes the incorporation of insulin with TPN solution or
      administration of long acting insulin such as glargine. However, no study has compared any of
      these strategies aiming for selecting the optimum modality for controlling blood glucose in
      diabetic surgical patient's receiving TPN. We will conduct a study to compare the efficacy of
      once daily insulin glargine versus continuous regular insulin incorporated TPN in controlling
      blood glucose in non-critically ill diabetic surgical patients receiving TPN.
