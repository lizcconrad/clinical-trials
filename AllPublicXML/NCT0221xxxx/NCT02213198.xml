  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cost of serious mental illness (SMI) in the U.S. is $317 billion annually. This
      translates to more than $1000 for every man, women, and child in the U.S. Hospitalization and
      Emergency Room (ER) visits have the highest costs. Outpatient services are overburdened.
      There is a push to get people out of hospitals quickly, while they are still quite ill. These
      factors cause patients to be lost in the transition from inpatient to outpatient care. Many
      individuals are repeatedly rehospitalized or continue to clog emergency rooms in an attempt
      to receive care. The importance of transitional care between inpatient/ER facilities and
      outpatient services to prevent this revolving door phenomenon has been continually stressed.
      There is little research on the best way to accomplish smooth transition to outpatient care.
      We developed a 90-day transitional care clinic (TCC) to address this need. We propose a
      randomized treatment outcome study comparing two transitional service packages within our
      TCC: a Standard Care package versus an Engagement-Focused package that features a novel
      intake procedure and a Shared Decision-Making intervention: Access Group is an intake
      procedure designed to address many of the problems of traditional approaches to post-acute
      treatment engagement, including failure of patients to reach intake appointments. Shared
      Decision-Making (SDM) is a structured approach to provider-patient communication that has
      been shown to increase patient involvement in care and improve outcomes. Despite SMI
      patients' desire to be more involved in their treatment decisions and promising early
      evidence of SDM's effectiveness in SMI, SDM has not been systematically evaluated in
      transitional psychiatric care. In the proposed study, patients referred to TCC will be
      randomized to either Engagement-focused Care or Standard Care. The relative benefit of these
      two approaches will be evaluated in 300 individuals who will be randomized to these two
      treatments in a 2:1 ratio. We hypothesize that attendance at appointments, reported
      satisfaction, shared decision making and quality of life will be higher for engagement
      focused care. The new treatment package is designed to get individuals into treatment quickly
      and to teach them how to be good consumers of mental health treatments going forward.

      Aim 1: To compare EFC to SC with respect to linkage to TCC services. Hypothesis A: Patients
      referred to EFC will exhibit a significantly greater rate of attendance at their TCC intake
      appointment than SC patients.

      Aim 2: To compare EFC to SC with respect to patient participation in outpatient treatment.

      Hypothesis B: Patients referred to EFC will report significantly greater shared
      decision-making in their TCC prescriber appointments than SC patients.

      Hypothesis C: Patients referred to EFC will exhibit significantly greater attendance at
      post-intake scheduled TCC appointments than SC patients.

      Hypothesis D: Patients referred to EFC will exhibit a significantly greater rate of
      attendance at initial post-TCC scheduled mental health appointments than SC patients.

      Aim 3: To compare Engagement-focused Care (EFC) to Standard Care (SC) with respect to
      patients' long term quality of life.

      Hypothesis E: Patients who receive EFC will exhibit significantly greater quality of life
      than SC patients six months after TCC termination.

    <description>The Quality of Life Interview (QOLI; 91) is a 45-minute structured interview that assesses quality of life in the domains of family, social relations, leisure activities, finances, legal/safety issues, work/school, and health. It is one of the most psychometrically sound QoL instruments for use in mental illness. The subjective scale assesses quality of life from the perspective of the patient. Subjective QOL = Mean of items 1,3,8,9,11,13,16,18,20,21 . Scores range from 1-7. Higher scores indicate better quality of life</description>

        <title>Subjective Quality of Life</title>
        <description>The Quality of Life Interview (QOLI; 91) is a 45-minute structured interview that assesses quality of life in the domains of family, social relations, leisure activities, finances, legal/safety issues, work/school, and health. It is one of the most psychometrically sound QoL instruments for use in mental illness. The subjective scale assesses quality of life from the perspective of the patient. Subjective QOL = Mean of items 1,3,8,9,11,13,16,18,20,21 . Scores range from 1-7. Higher scores indicate better quality of life</description>
