  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cholecystitis commonly occurs in elderly patients that are high-risk candidates for
      surgery. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is frequently employed for gallbladder drainage in
      these patients. Recently, the feasibility of EUS-guided gallbladder drainage (EGBD) in
      treatment of this condition has been demonstrated but how the two procedures compare to one
      another is uncertain.

      The aim of this study is to compare EGBD versus PC as a definitive treatment, in high-risk
      patients suffering from acute cholecystitis in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize
      that EGBD can reduce the morbidity, re-intervention and mortality when compared to PC.

    <description>The gallbladder would be identified by a linear echoendoscope (EUS) and a suitable puncture site in the stomach or the duodenum without intervening blood vessels would be located. The gallbladder would be punctured with a 19-gauge needle and a guidewire would be passed through the needle and looped in the gallbladder. The Hot AXIOS stent would then be inserted. A naso-gallbladder drain or a 5-7Fr double pigtail stents can be inserted into gallbladder if the effluent failed to clear after irrigation. This would be performed to improve drainage and avoid obstruction of the stent.</description>

    <description>Trained interventional radiologists in the respective hospitals would perform the procedure under local anesthesia. A transhepatic route would be used in all patients to decrease bile leakage. An 8.5 Fr pigtail drainage catheter would be placed between the 8th or 9th intercostal space under sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance. The pigtail catheter would be drained to a bedside bag.</description>
