  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of single and multiple once daily doses of
      50 milligram (mg) of JNJ-54861911 on pharmacokinetics (PK) (study of the way a drug enters
      and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of caffeine, midazolam, and tolbutamide in
      healthy male participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label (participants and researchers are aware about the
      treatment, participants are receiving), fixed-sequence study in healthy male participants.
      The study consists of 3 phases: Screening Phase (within 21 to 2 days prior to the first dose
      administration on Day 1), Open Label Treatment Phase (Day 1 up to Day 9), and Follow-up Phase
      (7 to 14 days after discharge from the study unit on Day 10 or at early withdrawal). The
      maximum duration of study will be 7 weeks per participant. During the Open-Label Treatment
      Phase, participants will receive JNJ-54861911, 50 mg (2*25 mg tablets) orally once daily from
      Day 2 to Day 9 along with caffeine 100 mg (2*50 mg tablets), midazolam 2 mg (1 milliliter
      [mL], 2 mg/mL solution), and tolbutamide 500 mg tablet, orally on Day 1, 2, and 9. Blood
      samples will be collected pre-dose (Day 1) up to Day 10 to understand the PK characteristics
      of midazolam, 1-hydroxy midazolam (midazolam metabolite), caffeine, paraxanthine (caffeine
      metabolite), tolbutamide, 4-hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide (tolbutamide
      metabolites). In addition, a blood sample will be collected on Day -1 from all enrolled
      participants to study genetic factors that may influence the PK, safety, and/or tolerability
      of JNJ-54861911 and co-medications. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
