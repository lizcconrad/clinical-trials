  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to evaluate the relative oral bioavailability and
      pharmacokinetics of BI 44370 TA drinking solution (100 mg and 200 mg) and BI 44370 TA tablets
      (100 mg as two 50 mg tablets) with and without a high fat meal and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of the substances.
