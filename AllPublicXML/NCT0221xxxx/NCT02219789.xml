  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of alisertib when given together
      with fulvestrant in treating patients with hormone positive breast cancer that has spread to
      other parts of the body or has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes
      and cannot be removed by surgery. Alisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen and progesterone are type of hormones
      made by the body and they can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen or progesterone the
      body makes. Giving alisertib together with fulvestrant may be a better treatment for breast
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of alisertib in combination with fulvestrant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety and tolerability of alisertib in combination with fulvestrant.

      II. To examine tumor response in postmenopausal women treated with alisertib in combination
      with fulvestrant.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess aurora A kinase expression in archived breast cancer tissue biospecimens of
      participants, and to describe levels in those who do or do not experience dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) or objective response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on day 1 (days 1 and 15 of course 1 only)
      and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of alisertib in combination with fulvestrant graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is defined as the highest dose level among those under consideration where at most 1 of 6 patients develops a dose limiting toxicity and 2 or more of the 3-6 patients treated at the next higher dose level develop a dose limiting toxicity. The maximum grade of each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient. For each toxicity reported by dose level, the percentage of patients developing any degree of that toxicity as well as the percentage of patients developing a severe degree (grade 3 or higher) will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Tumor response (complete or partial response) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post-treatment</time_frame>

    <measure>Aurora A kinase (AURKA) expression levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients who develop a DLT among those who have high AURKA expressing breast cancer and those who do not will be tabulated. The progression free survival times of those who have high aurora A kinase expressing breast cancer and those who do not will be determined and visually compared and contrasted.</description>

    <measure>Expression levels of ER-alpha, SMAD family member 5 (P~SMAD5), (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX-2), E-cadherin, vimentin, cluster of differentiation (CD)44, CD24, and protein C receptor, endothelial (PROCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cross tables of AURKA expression levels with expression levels of ER-alpha, P~SMAD5, SOX2, E-cadherin, Vimentin, CD44, CD24, and PROCR will be constructed to examine patterns of association between the biomarkers.</description>
