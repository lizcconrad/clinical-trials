    <description>The non-invasive tear film break-up-time (NIBUT) is the time elapsed (in seconds) between eye opening after a blink, and the appearance of the first dark spot within the tear film when observed with the wide diffuse light source of the Tearscope.

    <description>The Time Controlled Visual Acuity test is a proprietary test part of MG Vision Advanced Visual Performance Assessment. The test for distance vision is carried out at 4m under high contrast and dim luminance. The test is presented on a fast response 17&quot; LCD screen (1280 by 1064). The test for intermediate vision is carried out at 64cm under high contrast dim luminance. The test was presented on a fast response 13.3&quot; LCD screen (3200 by 1800). Visual acuity will be measured in a controlled environment using logMAR units.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must be 18 years of age and less than 51 years of age;

          2. The subject must have read and understood the Participant Information Sheet;

          3. The subject must have read, signed and dated the Informed Consent;

          4. The subject must be a current planned replacement soft contact lens wearer;

          5. The subject must be a regular user of devices (computer, tablet and/or smart phone)
             for a minimum average of 5 Â± 1 hours per day in a typical week

          6. The subject must have a refractive error within the range of correction of both study
             contact lenses;

          7. The subject must have a best-corrected visual acuity of 6/9 (20/30, 0.18 LogMAR) or
             better in each eye;

          8. The subject must demonstrate an acceptable fit with both study contact lenses;

          9. The subject must agree to wear their contact lenses as directed for the duration of
             the study (every day or for at least a minimum of five days per week for a minimum of
             six hours per day and be willing and able to adhere to the instructions set in the
             clinical protocol and maintain the appointment schedule;

         10. The subject must have normal eyes with the exception of the need for visual
             correction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any known sensitivity or intolerance to any of the contact lenses or adjunct products
             to be used.

          2. Monocular vision (only one eye with functional vision or only one eye fitted with
             contact lenses).

          3. Use of systemic or ocular concomitant medications which, as determined by the
             investigator, might contraindicate or interfere with contact lens wear.

          4. Ocular anterior segment infection, inflammation, abnormality, or active disease, which
             would contraindicate contact lens wear.

          5. Any moderate or severe ocular condition observed during slit lamp examination at the
             enrollment visit.

          6. A history of herpetic keratitis, ocular surgery or irregular cornea(s).

          7. Known pregnancy or lactation during the study period.

          8. Enrollment of investigator's office staff, relatives, or members of their respective
             households.

          9. Participation in any clinical trial within 30 days of the enrollment visit.

          <title>Time Controlled Visual Acuity</title>
          <description>The Time Controlled Visual Acuity test is a proprietary test part of MG Vision Advanced Visual Performance Assessment. The test for distance vision is carried out at 4m under high contrast and dim luminance. The test is presented on a fast response 17â LCD screen (1280 by 1064). The test for intermediate vision is carried out at 64cm under high contrast dim luminance. The test was presented on a fast response 13.3â LCD screen (3200 by 1800). Visual acuity will be measured in a controlled environment using logMAR units.</description>
          <population>The analysis population consists of subjects that completed all study visits without a major protocol deviation. The analysis was conducted for each lens at both near (40cm) and far distance (4m).</population>
