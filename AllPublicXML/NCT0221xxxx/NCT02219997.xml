    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the reaction time (as measured by braking reaction
      time in seconds during simulated driving) under glare and no-glare conditions in subjects
      implanted with ACRYSOF® IQ intraocular lenses (IOLs) to subjects implanted with clear IOLs.
      This study will enroll subjects previously implanted with IOLs in both eyes for at least 3
      months.

    <measure>Change in Braking Reaction Time From No-glare to Glare</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 2, up to Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Braking reaction time (time to brake, in seconds) was assessed using a driving simulator in no-glare and glare conditions. The subject was presented with a driving scenario during which an obstruction (car pulling over from either side of the road in a random fashion) was presented. Subjects braked in an attempt to avoid colliding with the obstruction, and the braking reaction time was recorded. The experiment was repeated with a glare source present. Both assessments (no-glare and glare) occurred on the same day. Change in braking reaction time was calculated as glare minus no-glare.</description>

        <title>Change in Braking Reaction Time From No-glare to Glare (Clear IOLs)</title>
        <description>Braking reaction time (time to brake, in seconds) was assessed using a driving simulator in no-glare and glare conditions. The subject was presented with a driving scenario during which an obstruction (car pulling over from either side of the road in a random fashion) was presented. Subjects braked in an attempt to avoid colliding with the obstruction, and the braking reaction time was recorded. The experiment was repeated with a glare source present. Both assessments (no-glare and glare) occurred on the same day. Change in braking reaction time was calculated as glare minus no-glare. This outcome measure was pre-specified for Clear IOL only.</description>
