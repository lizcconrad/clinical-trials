             determined by medical history, physical examinations, ECG, or laboratory tests. Such
             conditions may include:

             interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts, or behavior) if the attempt or
             acts were performed within 1 year of screening, or subjects who, in the opinion of the
             investigator, present a serious risk of suicide

          -  Patients with known intracranial neoplasms, vascular malformations, or intracranial
             hemorrhage
