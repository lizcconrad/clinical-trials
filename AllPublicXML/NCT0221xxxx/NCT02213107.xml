      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of enzalutamide and
      dutasteride on the time to prostatic-specific antigen progression in patients aged 65 or
      older receiving this combination as first line treatment for systemic prostate cancer.

      To determine the safety and toxicities of the study drug combination.

      To determine the time to prostatic-specific antigen nadir from the start of study treatment
      and to evaluate the absolute prostatic-specific antigen nadir as a result of the study drug
      combination

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without
        neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features.

        Patients with systemic prostate cancer as defined by either a) hormonal naïve metastatic
        prostate cancer with radiographic evidence of visceral or osseous metastasis or b)
        biochemical recurrence prostate cancer that fulfills all of the following criteria:

        A minimum of three rising prostatic-specific antigen levels with an interval of =/&gt; 1 week
        between each test, The prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) value at the screening visit should
        be =/&gt; 2 ng/ml prostatic-specific antigen doubling time ≤ 9 months.

        Patients should be 65 years or older. Patients who are deemed &quot;not fit&quot; by comprehensive
        geriatric assessment or at high risk for side effects as determined by the treating
        physician. A case report form will be used to document the specifics of why each eligible
        patient is not considered an ideal candidate.

        Serum testosterone level &gt; 1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) at the screening visit (non- castrate).

        Patients could have received hormonal therapy as part of definitive treatment for previous
        localized prostate cancer. However, they should be off any hormonal therapy for greater
        than six months prior to entry to clinical trial.

        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2. Able to swallow the study
        drug and comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Severe concurrent disease or infection that, in the judgment of the investigator, would
        make the patient inappropriate for enrollment.

        Known brain metastases. Brain imaging studies are not required for eligibility if the
        patient has no neurologic signs or symptoms suggestive of brain metastasis. However, if
        brain imaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease.

        Patient is receiving treatment for another active malignancy excluding localized cutaneous
        squamous or basal cell carcinoma.

        Prior treatment for systemic prostate cancer. Prior treatment with enzalutamide. Treatment
        with androgen receptor antagonists (bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide,), ketoconazole,
        abiraterone, finasteride, dutasteride, estrogens, or chemotherapy in an adjuvant setting
        within 6 months of enrollment (Day 1 visit) or plans to initiate treatment with any of
        these treatments.

        Treatment with therapeutic immunizations for prostate cancer (e.g., PROVENGE®) or plans to
        initiate treatment with any of these treatments during the study period.

        Use of herbal products that may decrease prostatic-specific antigen levels (e.g., saw
        palmetto) or systemic corticosteroids greater than the equivalent of 10 mg of
        prednisone/prednisolone per day within 4 weeks of enrollment (Day 1 visit) or plans to

        ejection fraction that is =/&gt; 45%, hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt; 86 millimeters of
        mercury [mmHg] or bradycardia with a heart rate &lt; 50 beats per minute, uncontrolled
        hypertension as indicated by a resting systolic blood pressure of 170 mmHg or diastolic
