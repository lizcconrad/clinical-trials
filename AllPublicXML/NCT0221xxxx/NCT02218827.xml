    <textblock>
      Many patients refer to an oculoplastic or corneal clinic examination due to dry eye symptoms.
      epidemiologic studies estimate that as many as 15% of the population over 60 years suffer
      from dry eye. the disease can be treated both topically through several drugs or through
      mechanical closure of the lacrimal drainage system. in the past decade a few studies
      demonstrated the efficacy of anti inflammatory treatment on dry eye disease due to the
      inflammatory process that occurs in it. this treatment rises goblet cell counts but in the
      meantime elevates the intra ocular pressure and elevates the risk for infections. steroids
      that cause a lower increase in intraocular pressure have not been thoroughly evaluated in dry
      eye disease. we with to subjectively and objectively evaluate an FDA approved topical
      steroidal drug in the treatment of dry eye.

      30 patients 21 year or older, from both sexes with no previous eyelid or corneal surgeries,
      refered to our outpatient clinics will be recruited and evaluated.

      the initial examination will include schirmer1 test, Tear break up time test, a full
      ophthalmologic evaluation and a dry eye questionaire.

      after signing a concent form patient will be treated with Loteprednol Etabonate four times a
      ady for a month, then a second examination will take place. after that and according to
      necessity patients will be treated with Loteprednol Etabonate two times daily for another
      month and return for a follow up examination. intraocular pressure will be evaluated in each
      follow up visit as well as dry eye symptoms, schirmer 1 test and tear break up time test.
