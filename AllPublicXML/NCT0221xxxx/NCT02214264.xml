  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of several brief
      trainings based on contemplative practices and positive psychology to buffer against the
      negative effects that acute stress has on behavior and cognitive abilities. The investigators
      hypothesize that training will buffer against negative effects of acute stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be taught a stress reducing training (breath awareness, loving kindness
      practice, gratitude exercise) and will practice using this technique for 10-15 minutes.
      Following this, all participants will undergo the Cold Pressor Task (CPT) for up to 3
      minutes.

      Before and after these tasks, participant data related to attention, working memory, self
      regulation, affect, and prosociality will be collected.
