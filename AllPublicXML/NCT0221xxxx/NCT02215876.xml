                  discontinued at least 2 weeks before starting study therapy.

               5. Subjects who received radiotherapy for DCIS may enroll.

               6. Disease free of prior malignancy for ≥ 5 years with the exception of curatively
                  treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

               7. ECOG PS of 0 or 1.

               8. Accessible for treatment and follow-up.

               9. Baseline cardiac echocardiogram scan with LVEF of ≥ 50%.

              10. Adequate recovery from recent surgery. At least one week must have elapsed from
                  minor surgery (placement of venous access device or fine needle aspiration) and
                  at least 4 weeks from major surgery.

          3. Laboratory Parameters

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3

               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               3. AST or ALT ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               4. Platelets ≥ 100,000/ mm3.

               5. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or 24-hour creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min
                  (measured or calculated by Cockcroft-Gault method).

               6. Normal PTT and either INR or PT &lt; 1.5 x ULN.

          4. Age and Sex Women, at least 21 years of age. a) Women of childbearing potential
             (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy
             throughout the study and for up to 8 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy in such
             a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.

        WOCBP include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful
        surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation,or bilateral oophorectomy)
        or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months; or women on
        hormone replacement therapy [HRT] with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
        level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Even women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal
        contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or
        mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms,
        spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or whose partner is sterile
        (vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

        WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or
        equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the first dose of investigational product.

                  chemotherapy.

               2. Women who are pregnant (including positive pregnancy test at enrollment or prior
                  to study drug administration) or breastfeeding.

          2. Target Disease Exceptions

               1. Evidence of metastatic breast cancer following a standard tumor staging work-up.

               1. Known human immunodeficiency viral (HIV) infection.

               2. Serious intercurrent infections or non-malignant medical illnesses that are

               3. Psychiatric disorders or other conditions rendering the subject incapable of
                  complying with the requirements of the protocol.

               4. Clinically significant history of cardiovascular disease (history of unstable
                  angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial
                  infarction or valvular heart disease).

               5. Subjects unfit for breast and/or axillary surgery (complete fixation of tumor,
                  skin infiltration, erythema of the breast, and/or ulceration).

               6. Current participation in another drug trial.

               7. Subjects who received prior anthracycline therapy.

               8. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated)
                  for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness (e.g., infectious
                  disease) must not be enrolled into this study.

             Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the
             safety of the study subjects and to ensure that the results of the study can be used.
             It is imperative that subjects fully meet all eligibility criteria.

             a) Known allergy to any of the study drugs
