  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an unproven assumption that at least 2 cryoablations is necessary in each pulmonary
      vein for successful ablation of atrial fibrillation. The investigators hypothesize that a
      single cryoablation in each pulmonary vein that achieves isolation may leads to equivalent
      efficacy with decreased risk. The One Freeze Study evaluates this hypothesis.

      This study compares one 3-minute cryoablation per pulmonary vein versus two 3-minute
      cryoablations per pulmonary vein during atrial fibrillation ablation procedures.

    <description>Composite score of adverse events (Range 0-20 points) will be calculated after the patient has completed follow-up. Higher scores indicate greater severity.
Luminal Esophageal Temperature (LET) (0-2 points): 1-point if ≤20 degrees C, 2-points if ≤15 degrees C
Phrenic nerve injury (0-3 points): 1-point if ≥30% decrease in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) or loss of phrenic nerve capture resulting in cessation of freeze (without movement of pacing catheter), 2-points if Phrenic nerve palsy lasting&gt; 1 minute resolving on table, 3-points if Phrenic nerve palsy not resolving on the table
Pulmonary (0-4 points): 1-point if persistent dry cough &gt; 1 week post ablation, 4-points if Hemoptysis
Gastrointestinal (GI) (0-6 points): 1-point if Gastroparesis symptoms, 3-points if Esophageal ulceration, 6-points if left atrial-esophageal fistula
Pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis (0-5 points): 1-point if ≥50% luminal area, 4-points if ≥90% luminal area, 5-points if total occlusion</description>
