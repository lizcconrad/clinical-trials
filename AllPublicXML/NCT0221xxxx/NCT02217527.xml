      The study will assess a novel active drug vs. placebo on ability to reduce smoking and aid
      cessation during a one-week &quot;practice&quot; quit period for each condition in smokers with a high
      interest in quitting (i.e. crossover design). Medication effects on reducing craving,
      withdrawal, and cognitive impairment will help assess the mechanism to support quit smoking
      attempts.
