      The word lithium frequently conjures images of catatonic psychiatric patients and side
      effects so severe that premature death is commonplace. But naturally occurring lithium is a
      far cry from pharmaceutical grades. Found in the soil, water and certain foods, it is an
      essential mineral for maintaining physical and mental health. When exposure is low, suicide
      rates, mental illness and violent crime increase

      Lithium has a long history of use in the treatment of mental disorders. However, it hasn't
      been until recently that scientists began exploring the psychiatric implications of naturally
      occurring lithium in the water supply.

      As stated in the article, Foods Rich in Lithium And Lithium Supplements:

      &quot;Research suggests that locations with the highest concentration of lithium tend to have the
      lowest rates of depression and violent crime. These studies have been conducted across the
      globe in different climates with different natural habits and diets. Researchers have
      therefore concluded that this phenomenon is fairly universal.&quot;

      A study in the United States agrees with these findings. According to Everything Addiction:

      &quot;In a 1990 study of 27 Texas counties, researchers found an &quot;inverse association of tap water
      lithium content in areas of Texas with the rates of mental hospital admissions, suicides,
      homicides, and certain other crimes.&quot; It was also discovered that young men incarcerated for
      violent crimes in some parts of Texas had disproportionately low lithium levels. Schrauzer
      and Shrestha discovered that the negative correlation was confirmed,&quot; especially in the
      south-central region of the state where high suicide mortality rates correspond to low
      lithium concentrations.&quot;'

      Another study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry had similar results. Researchers
      at Oita University examined the suicide rates in Japan's Oita prefecture. The team discovered
      that cities with higher levels of natural lithium in the public water supply had lower rates
      of suicide overall.

    <description>During the next study we will analyze the behavior of violent tendencies in three counties of New Jersey (ESSEX, Hudson and Passaic) during the years 2010-2013, different parameters were identified such as:
Firearms violence Domestic violence Killings Rape Theft Suicides Alcoholism Substance abuse We will Identify 400 individuals randomly with one or more of these known behaviors, which are invited to participate in the study, we will administer them a psycho-social test, a history clinical psycho-social study, levels of lithium in blood test and associated general tests, in addition to EEG, and neuro-physiological studies.
500 mcg will be given to one group which will indicate them a daily supplement of lithium water while the other group will only receive mineral spring water as a placebo.</description>

    <description>The Long term goal of this research project is the implementation of an effective, inexpensive therapy in communities with high risk of violence. Therapy will be based on a daily dietary supplement LIWA at appropriate doses.
The short-term objective is to prove that Lithium water (LIWA) as a daily supplement is an intervention that prevents gun violence from occurring, and is a factor that decrease the violence for gun in our communities Gun violence poses a serious threat to America's children and youth. Existing data clearly point to the need for improved strategies for keeping guns out of the hands of children and youth and those who would harm them.</description>
