    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare two different techniques (portal vein embolization and
      radiofrequency assisted liver partition with portal vein ligation) for increasing liver
      volume prior to major liver resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection remains the gold standard treatment for patients with liver tumours providing
      them the only chance for long-term survival. In up to 45% of cases that are amenable to
      surgical resection, an extended hepatectomy (removal of part of the liver) is usually
      necessary to achieve a clear resection margin. However, there must be enough liver left
      behind to meet the demands of the body. Indeed, liver failure due to insufficient remnant
      liver volume is still the principal cause of postoperative death following a major liver
      resection.

      The liver receives its main blood supply from two vessels (the portal vein and the hepatic
      artery). In order to decrease the complications and improve the safety of extensive liver
      surgery in patients with insufficient future liver remnant volume (FLRV), pre-operative
      embolization (i.e. blockage) of part of the portal vein can be undertaken.

      This has the effect of inducing growth of the liver on the unaffected side. Thus, when the
      resection is carried out, an increased FLRV (of around 12%) reduces post-operative liver
      failure. An alternative technique is to perform surgical ligation of the portal vein along
      with splitting of the liver.

      The diseased portion of liver is left in the body for 7-10 days while the healthy side is
      induced to grow. During this time, the diseased portion continues to support the body's
      requirement for liver function and reduces the risk of liver failure. FLRV has been shown to
      increase by around 74% with this technique.

      However, there are more postoperative complications with the alternative technique such as
      bile leaks. The aim of this study is to test a new way of splitting the liver so that the
      increased FLRV can be achieved without the increased complication rate.

    <description>Patients allocated to the PVE group will receive pre-intervention blood tests and a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. They will then have their portal vein embolized radiologically once their pre-intervention investigations have been completed and reviewed by the clinical team.
Post-intervention investigations (blood tests and CT scan) will take place 4 weeks after the completion of the PVE. At this point, they will be listed to receive their definitive surgical hepatectomy.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Radiofrequency assisted liver partition and ligation (RALPP)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients allocated to the RALPP group will receive pre-intervention blood tests and a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. They will then have their right portal vein surgically ligated followed by radiofrequency ablation in situ splitting of the liver. Certain patients may additionally have a tumourectomy or wedge resection of the left liver lobe if clinically indicated. The RALPP procedure will occur once the patient's pre-intervention investigations have been completed and reviewed by the clinical team.
Post-intervention investigations (blood tests and CT scan) will take place 2 weeks after the completion of the RALPP. At this point, they will be listed to receive their definitive surgical hepatectomy.</description>
