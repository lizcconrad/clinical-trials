  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to investigate how well Bright White Light Therapy will work in the acute
      inpatient rehabilitation units for people whom have experienced a traumatic brain injury for
      the purpose of treating sleep disruption. Participants will be assessed based on sleep
      efficiency, thinking abilities, therapy participation, and perception of fatigue/sleepiness.
      In previous studies dim red light has not had the same effects on function as bright white
      light, and will be chosen for use as a placebo. Each subject will be randomized to receive 30
      minutes of either Bright White Light Therapy or Red Light Treatment each morning for 10 days.

      To measure the effect of this treatment, the investigators will measure the each participants
      sleep daily by using an actigraph watch. This watch will record movement continuously. The
      investigators will also measure the subjects' report of how well they slept, whether fatigue
      is present, and how attentive they are before and after treatment.

      Research Hypothesis:

      In persons with TBI, prospectively compare overnight sleep in a cohort exposed to morning
      Bright White Light with a comparison group exposed to Red Light in an acute inpatient
      rehabilitation setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)
      on admission to intensive rehabilitation units. Consented participants (who meet all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria) will wear an actigraphy watch for 2 nights to obtain a
      baseline for sleep pattern identification. Prior to treatment, baseline measures (detailed
      below) will be obtained. Participants will be randomized to receive either Bright White Light
      (BWL) or Red Light (RL) treatment. Light therapy treatments will be given for 30 minutes
      daily in the morning for 10 days, and an Actiwatch will be worn continuously during that
      period. At the end of 10 days, outcome measures will be obtained (as below). The specific
      period of treatment may be affected by the length of stay on the rehabilitation unit. For
      lengths of stay less than the 10 days, subjects will receive the intervention until the day
      of discharge at which time the outcome measures will be administered. The investigators
      primary outcome measure with be the actigraphic measurement of sleep efficiency. Other
      secondary measures will be participation in therapy, sleepiness, and attention. The
      investigators will also evaluate the anticipated device costs and clinical staff burden
      involved in utilizing light therapy exposure in an inpatient rehabilitation clinical setting.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphy data</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 10 days of light exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency scores derived from actigraphy data will be the primary outcome. We will set the Actiwatch to record activity data in 60-second intervals. Actigraphy data will be automatically scored with Actiware software (Respironics, Philips Healthcare), which uses validated algorithms to determine whether an epoch of activity is &quot;sleep&quot; or &quot;wake&quot; (Cole RJ, 1992). Typically there is a lack of a consistent sleep/wake cycle in the study population, therefore we will be using sleep efficiency and total sleep time scores obtained during a set night-time interval (2200 to 0600) as the primary index of sleep function, as has been used in previous publications[39, 40]. We will be comparing average between group differences between the BWL and RL groups at baseline and after 10 days of light therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Makley Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>A sleep log will be completed every 2 hours during the night (2200 until 0600) on each patient by the unit nursing staff hours for 12 nights or until discharge from the hospital (2 nights baseline and 10 nights of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Makley scale is a 4-point ordinal scale which allows staff to score sleep as follows:
0 = asleep; 1 = drowsy/falling asleep; 2 = drowsy/waking up; 3 = awake.</description>

    <measure>Barrow Neurological Institute Fatigue Scale (BNI-FS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at baseline prior to intervention and at Day 10 after completion of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The BNI-FS is a scale that was designed to examine fatigue during acute recovery from TBI. We will ask the clinical staff involved in the care of these subjects to rate the phototherapy intervention for ease of use, perceived relevance to rehabilitation care, and impression of effectiveness.</description>

    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at baseline (admission to unit) and after Day 10 of intervention (or at the day of discharge from the rehabilitation unit)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is the most widely accepted functional assessment measure in use in the rehabilitation community. The FIM is an 18-item ordinal scale, used with all diagnoses within a rehabilitation population.</description>

    <measure>Symbol Digit Modalities Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at baseline and after Day 10 of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The SDMT is a pencil and paper test for attention that takes approximately five minutes to administer and is frequently used in evaluations after TBI. The SDMT will be administered at enrollment and after intervention. The Interagency Workgroup on TBI Outcomes selected the Symbol Digit Modalities Test as CORE common data elements in TBI outcomes research.</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at baseline and after Day 10 of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), developed with a sample of undergraduate students and validated with adult populations, comprises two mood scales, one measuring positive affect and the other measuring negative affect. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = very slightly or not at all to 5 = extremely to indicate the extent to which the respondent has felt this way in the indicated time frame.</description>
