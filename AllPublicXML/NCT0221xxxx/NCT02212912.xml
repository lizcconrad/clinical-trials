  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a multifaceted quality improvement
      intervention can improve the adherent rate of individual and composite of evidence-based
      performance measures for patients with acute ischemic stroke within the first 7 days of
      symptom onset and reduce the incidence of a new clinical vascular event, disability, and
      all-cause mortality at discharge and long term clinical outcome.

      Study population:

      patients with acute ischemic stroke who were admitted to the hospital within 7 days after the
      initial symptom onset.

      Program:

      There are multifaceted quality improvement interventions including:

        1. Evidence-based clinical pathway

        2. Standard operating procedures (SOP) of performance indicators

        3. A quality coordinator

        4. Monitoring and feedback system of performance measures

      Endpoints:

      Primary outcome:increase of adherence of evidence based treatment in clinical practice;
      Secondary outcome: total mortality, disability, and major cerebrovascular events

    <description>The primary end point was all-or-none measure of evidence-based performance measures in patients without contraindications, at the emergency department (Intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in patients who arrive within 2 hours after initial symptom onset and treated within 3 hours), during 48 hours after admission (antithrombotic drugs; dysphagia screening; deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis including pneumatic compression devices, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or full-dose anticoagulation (e.g., with heparin or warfarin)) , and at discharge (antithrombotic therapy, discharge on anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation, and discharged on statin, antihypertensive, and hypoglycemic medications). An all-or-none measure of care was used, which is defined as the proportion of patients who received all of the performance measure interventions for which they were eligible.</description>

    <description>The secondary primary end point was a new clinical vascular event (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death) , disability (disability defined as Modified Rankin Score (mRS) ≥ 2) , and all-cause mortality at discharge,3, 6, 12-months after initial symptom onset.</description>

    <description>Evidence-based clinical pathway: It contained general guideline-based recommendations about acute stroke management. Standard operating procedures (SOP) of performance indicators. A quality coordinator:The role of the quality coordinator includes interacting with physicians once gaps in the incorporation of evidence-based interventions are identified, ensuring that all components of the quality improvement intervention are being used for every acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patient.Monitoring and feedback system of performance measures.
The system could view the level of implementation of prespecified performance measures at any time (per week recommended) , compare with the previous record of own study site and level of other clusters.</description>
