      Multicenter, prospective, observational study to collect relevant clinical data from 167
      subjects implanted with the Journey II BCS Knee System. Data from eligible subjects, who have
      provided written informed consent for the collection of their coded data will be recorded
      from the patient's medical file on specially designed case report forms (CRF's).

      Total study duration for participants will be 10 years with follow-up visits planned at 3
      months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years post-surgery. An interim analysis describing
      the clinical outcome is planned after 5 years.

    <description>The goal of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of the Journey II BCS knee prosthesis by demonstrating non-inferiority of the cumulative percent success in subjects implanted with the JOURNEY II BCS Total Knee System compared to a literature reference rate of 94.3% (AOA annual report 201121) at 10 years. &quot;Success&quot; is defined as 10 year survival of the study device without revision for any reason.</description>
