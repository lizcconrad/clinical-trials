    <measure>Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) of tolvaptan over 36 hours post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 36 hours from drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax will be derived from plasma concentrations versus time using a validated LS/MS/MS assay is sodium heparinized plasma. The tolvaptan assay has a range of 1.00 - 200 mg/mL. Blood samples will be collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30 and 36 hours after the dose of tolvaptan is administered. The first 15 patients will receive single dose 15mg of tolvaptan via a gastric tube and if determined not bioequivalent and no clinical response to oral administration and safe to administer, then last 15 patients will receive 30mg single dose via a gastric tube.</description>

    <measure>Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of tolvaptan from time zero to 36 hours post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 36 hours from drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>AUC will be computed from 0 to 36 hours using the linear-log trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity. Tolvaptan concentrations will be determined using a validated LS/MS/MS assay is sodium heparinized plasma. The tolvaptan assay has a range of 1.00 - 200 mg/mL. Blood samples will be collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30 and 36 hours after the dose of tolvaptan is administered.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The clinical response of tolvaptan administered through the nasogastric tube in acute brain injured patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 36 hours from drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a change in serum sodium of 4 - 6 mEq/L</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety of tolvaptan administered via a nasogastric tube in acute brain injured patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 36 hours from drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessments will include: vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, concomitant medications, and reported or observed adverse events. The rate of sodium correction will also be assessed. Excessive correction in sodium is defined as ≥ 12 mE/L increased in serum sodium within 24 hours of the dose. Excessive drop in blood pressure will be defined as &gt;20% reduction in MAP from baseline.</description>

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic sampling will be collected in serum separator tubes at 0,
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30 and 36 hours after the dose of study drug is
      administered. Serum sodium will be collected at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 36 hours
      after study drug administration. Approximately 180 mL of blood will be collected over 36
      hours. Urinary output and urine specific gravity will be collected 0-2, 2-4, 3-6, 6-8, 8-12,
      and 12-24 hours after tolvaptan administration.
