  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the ultrasound detectable variations in nerve, tendon and SSCT mobility
      in patients with CTS may be useful clinically, not to diagnose CTS, but instead as functional
      biomarkers that correlate with, and thereby serve as predictors for, treatment response. To
      test this hypothesis, we propose a longitudinal clinical study in which patients presenting
      for treatment of CTS will be monitored by ultrasound and by clinical assessment before and
      after non-surgical and surgical treatment. We will correlate the clinical outcomes with the
      initial ultrasound motion patterns that we have found to be most variable in CTS patients. We
      will also test the hypothesis that successful treatment results in a change towards normal in
      the affected ultrasound variables.
