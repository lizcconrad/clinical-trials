    <textblock>
      Camel milk as the new modality for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate effectiveness and safety of camel milk in combination with Peginterferon
      Alfa-2a and Ribavirin in genotype 2,3 chronic hepatitis C virus .

      The investigators enrolled 40 patients into the study. Group 1(Intervention ) : received
      PEGASYS( Peginterferon ) One subcutaneous injection containing 0.5 ml solution with180 mcg
      per week plus COPEGUS( Ribavirin ) tablets (body-weight adjusted dose: &lt; 75 kg = 1000 mg and
      ≥ 75 kg = 1200 mg) taken orally (by mouth) once daily and 250 ml of raw camel milk will be
      consumed in 10 minutes orally twice daily for 12 weeks.

      Group 2 ( control ): received PEGASYS( Peginterferon ) One subcutaneous injection containing
      0.5 ml solution with180 mcg per week plus COPEGUS( Ribavirin ) tablets (body-weight adjusted
      dose: &lt; 75 kg = 1000 mg and ≥ 75 kg = 1200 mg) taken orally (by mouth) once daily for 12
      weeks.

      Follow up period is 1,2,3 months after treatment. The patients are visited every 4 weeks with
      biochemistry lab tests. The patients are checked with quantitative HCV RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)
      on the first months after initiation of the treatment to assess early virologic response and
      at the end of the study for complete response rate and on the third month after treatment
      completion for sustained response rate. The patients with undetectable HCV RNA are considered
      as responders.
