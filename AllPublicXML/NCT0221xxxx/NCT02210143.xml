  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the avascular root surface area as a
      prognostic identification criterion for gingival recessions and to compare the predictive
      value of the Miller classification and avascular root surface area (AERSA) calculation on the
      final root coverage outcomes.
