  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) resection of lung cancer will
      receive standard therapy including lobectomy or sub-lobar resection and mediastinal lymph
      node dissection. After completion of the standard of care, intraoperative ultrasound will be
      used to evaluate lymph node stations for the presence of any missed lymph nodes with
      particular focus on lymph nodes which may appear pathologic on ultrasound evaluation. Data
      will be reviewed for rates of pathologic upstaging, and sensitivity and specificity of
      ultrasound as an additional diagnostic tool in the operating room will be evaluated. It is
      hypothesized that Intra-operative thoracoscopic ultrasound following standard video-assisted
      thoracoscopic (VATS) dissection will increase the rate of pathologically staged in N2 nodes
      in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing definitive surgical resection.
