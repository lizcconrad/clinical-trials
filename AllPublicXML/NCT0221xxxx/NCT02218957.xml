    <textblock>
      Morbid obesity is an increasing medical problem in the western countries. It's related to
      comorbidities as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, OSAS, arthrosis and hypercholesterolemia.
      The Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is an effective surgical therapy for morbidly obese
      patients. A part of these patients will have disappointing results, and have weight regain on
      the long term. Some studies show more weight reduction by increasing the biliopancreatic limb
      in patients with morbid obesity.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a restrictive/extended pouch on
      weight reduction in morbidly obese patients undergoing RYGB-surgery. We hypothesize that the
      restrictive/extended pouch results in more weight reduction.

      The study design is a prospective, randomized control trial. The patients will be randomized
      in 2 groups: a standard RYGB (normal pouch) and restrictive/extended pouch RYGB.
