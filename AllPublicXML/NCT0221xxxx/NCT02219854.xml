    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for treatment of gastric
      cancer is popular in East Asian countries. However, the long-term follow-up outcome based on
      randomized clinical trial (RCT) is still rare. Some studies indicated that laparoscopic
      distal subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is a technically feasible and safe
      procedure by experienced surgeons in high-volume specialized hospitals. However, the
      application of it is still limited because of lack of solid evidence on the oncologic
      efficacy. Nowadays, the proportion of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer is
      estimated up to 80 percent of all gastric cancer cases in China. Before the clinical
      application of laparoscopic procedure for the treatment with curative intent to advanced
      gastric cancer located at the middle- or lower-third of the stomach, the oncologic efficacy
      must be verified.Accordingly, the comparison of long-term outcome between laparoscopic and
      open distal subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for locally advanced gastric cancer
      based on a well designed RCT is needed.
