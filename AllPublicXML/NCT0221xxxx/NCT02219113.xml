  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) extracted using Celution 800/CRS System
      (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) from a portion of the fat harvested from the patient's front
      abdominal wall. ADRC will be administered one-time intraarticularly. This is a single arm
      study with no control. All patients receive cell therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with verified diagnosis knee joint osteoarthritis (degenerative damage of knee
      articular cartilage) will undergo knee arthroscopic debridement. 28 days later patients will
      will undergo liposuction from front abdominal wall under local anesthesia. After that
      autologous ADRC will be extracted using Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc)
      from harvested adipose tissue. Extracted ADRC will be administered one-time intraarticularly.
