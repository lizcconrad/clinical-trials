    <time_frame>After first exposure to BAX 855 until completion of study - approx. 6 months per participant.</time_frame>
    <description>Rating Scale for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes (BEs) (4-point ordinal scale):
Excellent: Full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding (eg, swelling, tenderness, and decreased range of motion in the case of musculoskeletal hemorrhage) after a single infusion. No additional infusion required for the control of bleeding. Administration of further infusions to maintain hemostasis did not affect this scoring.
Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion. Possibly requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution.
Fair: Probable and/or slight relief of pain and slight improvement in signs of bleeding after single infusion. Required more than 1 infusion for complete resolution.
None: No improvement or condition worsens.</description>

        <description>The annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during the prophylaxis period was assessed based upon each individual bleeding episode, spontaneous or traumatic, recorded in the participant´s diary and/or recorded in the physician/nurse/study site notes.
The annualized bleeding rate was analyzed using a generalized linear model framework assuming a negative binomial distribution with a logarithmic link function and presence or absence of target joints and age cohort as covariates and duration of the observation period in years as offset.

        <title>Hemostatic Efficacy Rating for Bleeding Episodes Treated With BAX 855 at Resolution of Bleed</title>
        <description>Rating Scale for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes (BEs) (4-point ordinal scale):
Excellent: Full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding (eg, swelling, tenderness, and decreased range of motion in the case of musculoskeletal hemorrhage) after a single infusion. No additional infusion required for the control of bleeding. Administration of further infusions to maintain hemostasis did not affect this scoring.
Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion. Possibly requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution.
Fair: Probable and/or slight relief of pain and slight improvement in signs of bleeding after single infusion. Required more than 1 infusion for complete resolution.
None: No improvement or condition worsens.</description>

        <title>Positive Post-baseline Binding Antibodies to Factor VIII (FVIII), Polyethylene Glycol-Factor VIII (PEG-FVIII), PEG and Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Proteins</title>
        <description>Binding antibodies to FVIII and PEG-FVIII, as well as to PEG, were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) binding antibodies for FVIII, BAX 855, and PEG were tested at each study visit. Testing for binding antibodies to CHO was performed on citrate-anti-coagulated plasma using an ELISA employing polyclonal anti-human IgG antibodies.
This outcome measure includes antibodies that were transient (antibody developed after exposure to BAX 855 but not present at study termination/completion) and pre-existent (antibody originally present before exposure to BAX 855).</description>

        <description>The first PK infusion was ADVATE and the second PK infusion was BAX 855. All participants undergoing PK assessment had a 72-hour washout period before administration of ADVATE and BAX 855. There were 4 blood draws for PK analysis-1 pre-infusion and 3 post infusion. The timing of the infusion (morning [am] or afternoon [pm]) and the timing of Blood Draws 3 and 4 (3 groups for each blood draw) were determined at randomization.
The sequence was as follows:- Blood Draw 1. within 30 minutes pre-infusion [Day 0]; PK INFUSION - am or pm [Day 0]; Blood Draw 2. 15-30 minutes post-infusion [Day 0]; Blood Draw 3. 3 groups:- 7 hours post-infusion (if am PK infusion) or 4 hours post-infusion (if pm PK infusion) [Day 0], Day 1 am or Day 1 pm; Blood Draw 4. 3 groups:- Day 2, Day 3 or Day 4. A nonlinear mixed effects model approach (population PK) was implemented to analyze PK data. A one-stage clotting assay was used as the primary assay and a chromogenic assay was used to provide supportive data.</description>

          <description>The first PK infusion was ADVATE and the second PK infusion was BAX 855. All participants undergoing PK assessment had a 72-hour washout period before administration of ADVATE and BAX 855. There were 4 blood draws for PK analysis-1 pre-infusion and 3 post infusion. The timing of the infusion (morning [am] or afternoon [pm]) and the timing of Blood Draws 3 and 4 (3 groups for each blood draw) were determined at randomization.
The sequence was as follows:- Blood Draw 1. within 30 minutes pre-infusion [Day 0]; PK INFUSION - am or pm [Day 0]; Blood Draw 2. 15-30 minutes post-infusion [Day 0]; Blood Draw 3. 3 groups:- 7 hours post-infusion (if am PK infusion) or 4 hours post-infusion (if pm PK infusion) [Day 0], Day 1 am or Day 1 pm; Blood Draw 4. 3 groups:- Day 2, Day 3 or Day 4. A nonlinear mixed effects model approach (population PK) was implemented to analyze PK data. A one-stage clotting assay was used as the primary assay and a chromogenic assay was used to provide supportive data.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetics (PK): Incremental Recovery (IR)</title>
        <description>The first PK infusion was ADVATE and the second PK infusion was BAX 855. All participants undergoing PK assessment had a 72-hour washout period before administration of ADVATE and BAX 855. There were 4 blood draws for PK analysis-1 pre-infusion and 3 post infusion. The timing of the infusion (morning [am] or afternoon [pm]) and the timing of Blood Draws 3 and 4 (3 groups for each blood draw) were determined at randomization.
The sequence was as follows:- Blood Draw 1. within 30 minutes pre-infusion [Day 0]; PK INFUSION - am or pm [Day 0]; Blood Draw 2. 15-30 minutes post-infusion [Day 0]; Blood Draw 3. 3 groups:- 7 hours post-infusion (if am PK infusion) or 4 hours post-infusion (if pm PK infusion) [Day 0], Day 1 am or Day 1 pm; Blood Draw 4. 3 groups:- Day 2, Day 3 or Day 4. A non-compartmental model approach was implemented to analyze IR data. A one-stage clotting assay was used as the primary assay and a chromogenic assay was used to provide supportive data.</description>
