  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center study designed to assess the safety
      and efficacy of Adipose-derived Stem Cell (ASC) IV implantation. The therapy is composed of
      cells isolated from a patient's own adipose tissue. Liposuction will be performed to collect
      the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the context of the proposed study, adipose derived stem cells (ASC) constitute an
      autologous cell product that is delivered to the patient via intra-venous injection. In this
      study, we propose to investigate the immunosuppressive potential of the non-manipulated
      non-cultured stromal vascular fraction obtained via liposuction. Endpoints will be measured
      both by improvement of the forced evacuation volume in one second (FEV1) and distance covered
      in a 6 minute walk distance test (6MWD). The stromal vascular fraction comprises stromal
      cells isolated from total fat via enzymatic digestion ex-vivo. These cells are not cultured
      but are isolated from adipose tissue using a sterile tissue process in under two hours. The
      process includes rinsing in a saline solution to remove red blood cells, draining, and
      enzymatic digestion (collagenase) which isolates endothelial cells from adipose tissue.
      Post-processing, the pellet obtained via centrifugation is filtered and delivered to the
      patient who remains sedated within the same ambulatory center.
