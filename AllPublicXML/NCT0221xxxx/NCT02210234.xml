  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research was to understand the effects of bioactive compounds found in
      wheat cereal on human immunity. Subjects came in for a baseline blood draw, consumed whole
      wheat bran cereal daily for 21 days, and returned for a final blood draw. Immune function
      assays were performed at both sampling times. It was predicted that eating wheat bran would
      benefit immune function.

      Healthy individuals, between 18 and 50 years of age, were recruited by flyer and word of
      mouth on the University of Florida campus and in the surrounding area, in May of 2010.
      Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups, to consume either
      50 grams or 100 grams of whole wheat bran cereal daily, for three weeks. Blood was drawn from
      fasting subjects before consumption (baseline) and after three weeks of cereal consumption.
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and cultured with a broad based
      mitogen and autologous serum for 10 days. PBMC were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated
      antibodies on Day 0 and Day 10 of culture, at each blood draw. Data was acquired by flow
      cytometry and analyzed. Overall compliance was assessed using self-reported data and by
      counting left-over bags of cereal.

    <description>Flow cytometry is used to compare the percentage of γδ-T cells in the total CD3 cell population in the blood of subjects before and after three weeks of consuming whole wheat bran cereal. An increase in that percentage would be suggestive of improved immunity (priming).</description>
