    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the OptiScanner® is safe and can provide
      accurate blood glucose levels in critically ill subjects.

      Accuracy Hypothesis:

      The assessment of blood glucose level that results from the OptiScanner is comparable to the
      YSI 2300 STAT Plus™ Glucose and Lactate Analyzer (&quot;YSI Analyzer&quot;; YSI Life Sciences, Yellow
      Springs, OH).

      Safety Hypothesis:

      The OptiScanner has an acceptable risk/benefit profile for a system that can provide repeated
      automated blood glucose levels for critically ill subjects.

    <time_frame>Accurancy up to 72 hours of monitoring per subject</time_frame>
    <description>The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) in glucose level between the OptiScanner and the YSI Analyzer (average of 2 measures). To demonstrate accuracy the MARD must be less than or equal to 10%.</description>

    <measure>Secondary Accuracy Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Accuracy up to 72 hours of subject monitoring</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;population CV&quot; will be computed as the standard deviation of the difference between the glucose level reported by the OptiScanner and the glucose level reported by the YSI Analyzer divided by the mean of the YSI Analyzer values. Repeated measures analyses will be used to account for possible correlation of measurements within patients. The population CV therefore gives an estimate of the extent of the effect of outliers on the accuracy estimation. If the &quot;population CV&quot; is less than 13%, the outcome of the secondary accuracy analysis will be considered a success.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent by participant or his/her legally authorized representative

          -  At least 18 years old

          -  Admitted to the ICU or CCU

          -  Expected ICU or CCU stay of at least 18 hours at the time of enrollment (as judged by
             Investigator)

          -  Requires blood glucose monitoring; and

          -  A vascular access device that can be dedicated for connection to the OptiScanner is
             either already in-place, is planned to be placed for another purpose or can, in the
             opinion of the Investigator be safely placed exclusively for use in this study, and
             another access device is in place or can be placed for manually drawing samples to be
             evaluated using the YSI Analyzer. Note that CVCs should not be placed solely for the
             purposes of conducting this study. Refer to section 1.2.7 for details regarding
             vascular access devices and guidelines for selection and placement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  In the Investigator's opinion the subject cannot safely tolerate the amount of saline
             required to be given to the subject (up to 360 mL per day)

          -  Hematocrit less than 15% or greater than 60%

          -  Subjects that require placement of an additional vascular access line will be excluded
             if they do not have a suitable access site free from any of the following conditions:

               -  Peripheral vascular disease

               -  History of placement site neuropathy or chronic pain

               -  History of placement extremity coagulopathy or clot formation

               -  History of vascular surgery on the same extremity as catheter placement

          -  Any medical condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, would warrant exclusion
             from the study or prevent the subject from completing the study, including but not
             limited to a high risk of complications associated with vascular access; or

          -  Participation in any other investigational drug or device study in the last 30 days
             and/or while enrolled in this study.
