    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if doctors can use the results of special tests of
      subjects tumor tissue, that will look for specific abnormalities in the tumor, to choose a
      specific drug that is targeted to work against that abnormality (called molecular profiling)
      and to see what effects (good and/or bad) that targeted drug has on subjects cancer when it
      is given with standard chemotherapy.
