    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well tipifarnib works in treating
      patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or undifferentiated
      myeloproliferative disorders. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities of R115777 (tipifarnib) in adult patients with
      myeloproliferative disorders.

      II. To assess hematologic responses, including changes in 1) white blood cell count and 2)
      erythroid responses.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess bone marrow cytogenetic responses to R115777. II. To analyze for the presence of
      neuroblastoma (N)/Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-Ras) mutations in patient
      bone marrow samples.

      III. To analyze the effect of R115777 on Ras /DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily A, member
      1(HDJ-2) farnesylation in patient bone marrow/peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

      IV. To analyze the effect of R115777 on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation in
      patient bone marrow mononuclear cells.

      V. To perform colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) cytotoxicity assays using
      patients' hematopoietic cells with R115777.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a good hematologic response may continue treatment at the
      discretion of the treating physician.
