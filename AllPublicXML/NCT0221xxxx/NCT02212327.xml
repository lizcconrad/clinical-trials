  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' overarching goal is to improve long-term outcomes for end stage renal
      disease (ESRD) patients. In this study we focus specifically on patients receiving peritoneal
      dialysis (PD). Volume regulation in PD patients is related to hypertension, heart failure,
      nutritional status, and survival. Salt (NaCl) is the body's ion transport target to normally
      regulate volume via the kidneys; however, in hemodialysis (HD) patients the dialyser or in PD
      patients the peritoneal membrane, must serve that purpose. Determining volume status in PD
      patients is not easy and monitoring sodium (Na+) is more difficult still. The investigators
      have developed a novel, noninvasive approach to this problem involving 23Na+ magnetic
      resonance imaging (Na-MRI). Na+ is stored bound to proteoglycans in mostly the skin. Our
      technique measures Na+ in skin and skeletal muscle. In this study, we propose to apply this
      novel technique to PD patients.

      Aim 1. To determine Na+ stores in PD patients, to compare Na+ stores to normal controls using
      Na-MRI technique, and to correlate Na+ stores by Na-MRI with multifrequency bioimpedance
      measurements and cross-sectional clinical data.

      Hypothesis: Na+ stores are increased in PD patients compared to normal controls; they are
      increased in PD patients with volume expansion and in those patients with high soluble
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (sFlt-4) levels.

      Aim 2. To determine the utility of Na-MRI as an assessment of preserving residual renal
      function in PD patients.

      Hypothesis: Extracellular volume expansion as measured by multifrequency bioimpedance was
      found to have no utility in predicting preservation of residual renal function in PD
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that Na+ stores as determined by 23Na-MRI will
      fulfill that function and will be inversely, rather than directly, related.
