  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Modified Vaccinia
      Ankara (MVA) Mosaic vaccine in healthy adult participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, placebo-controlled (the use of an inactive substance identical in
      appearance to the active vaccine), double-blind (neither the participant or study personnel
      will know the identity of the treatment administered) study where participants will be
      randomized (treatment type assigned by chance) to receive a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)
      Mosaic vaccine (at 1x10E8 pfu) or placebo. This design is intended to reduce the likelihood
      of observer and selection bias, provide control for confounding variables, and aid an
      unbiased analysis of the study results. The study will include 4 groups of participants, 2
      groups having previously been vaccinated with Ad26.ENVA.01 (A recombinant adenovirus [rAd]
      vaccine for HIV-1) and 2 groups not previously vaccinated with Ad26.ENVA.01. Participants
      will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive either a MVA Mosaic vaccine or placebo. The
      trial comprises a 4-week screening period, a 12-week vaccination period during which
      participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1) and Week 12 (Day 84), and a 40-week
      follow-up period to the final visit at Week 52.
