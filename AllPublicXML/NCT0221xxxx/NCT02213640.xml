  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following stroke, over 50% of patients keep severe neurological deficiency whose unilateral
      neglect, mostly following a right hemispheric lesion. The prismatic adaptation involves to
      pointing movements toward visual targets wearing prismatic glasses. These prismatic glasses
      induce a shift to the right visual field for improving symptoms in short term.

      Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) has been evaluated for different types of deficiency
      resulting from stroke with encouraging results. The hypothesis of the study is to evaluate
      the usefulness of brain stimulation as an adjunctive intervention to optimize and increase
      the rehabilitation of unilateral neglect to long-term.

      Thus, the main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of standard treatment with
      prismatic adaptation with anodal tDCS or sham tDCS.
