  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-cohort phase I study is designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of oxytocin and to evaluate epelsiban (GSK557296) potential to reduce
      subendometrial contractractility induced by oxytocin in healthy female subjects. Additionally
      tissues concentrations of epelsiban will be determined from endometrial tissue biopsies. Data
      from this study will inform the identification of the doses of epelsiban to be used in future
      in-vitro fertilization (IVF) clinical studies. Expected number of subjects to be randomized
      are: Cohort 1- 10 subjects, Cohort 2a- 10 subjects for each epelsiban arm 25 milligrams (mg),
      200mg, 5 for placebo, Cohort 2b- 10 subjects per arm with dose to be determined, cohort 3- 6
      subjects. Cohorts 1 and 2 will be double blind (sponsor unblinded) placebo controlled
      cohorts. Cohort 3 will be an open label cohort, cohort 4 will be a double blind (sponsor
      unblinded) placebo controlled cohort.
