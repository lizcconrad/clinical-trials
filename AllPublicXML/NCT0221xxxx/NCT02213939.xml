  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery leeds to a systematic inflammatory response induced by the surgical trauma
      and the use of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Activation of inflammatory cascades can
      cause a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which is associated with increased
      morbidity and mortality. Therefore, strategies to reduce the inflammatory response have a
      potential benefit for cardiac surgery patients.

      The clinical benefit of reducing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, Il-8 and TNF-a with
      the use of a cytokine adsorbing circuit (Cytosorb) during CBP remains unclear. Therefore, the
      investigators conduct this prospective, observational pilot study to determine the clinical
      impact of the use of a cytokine adsorbing circuit during CBP.

      Patients, who have an elective myocardial revascularization and give there written consent
      will be enrolled to the study. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data will be
      collected prospectively. Furthermore, blood samples (1. before induction of anaesthesia 2. at
      the end of CPB 3. 6 hours after surgery 4. 24 hours after surgery 5. 3-5 days after surgery)
      will be analyzed.
