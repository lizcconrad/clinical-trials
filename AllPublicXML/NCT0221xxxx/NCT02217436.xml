  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children aged 2-12 presenting to the Rady Children's Hospital San Diego (RCHSD) emergency
      department with facial lacerations requiring suture repair will be eligible to participate in
      the study. Participating children will be randomized to standard care versus standard care
      plus iPad use during the procedure. Children's anxiety levels assessed using a validated
      scale will be measured from video recordings made of the procedure. Parent and provider
      satisfaction surveys will be completed following the procedure. The primary study aim is to
      determine how iPad use affects children's anxiety levels during facial laceration repair. The
      secondary study aim is to determine how iPad use affects parent and provider satisfaction
      regarding a child's facial laceration repair. Hypothesis is that iPad use decreases
      children's anxiety levels during facial laceration repair and increases parent and provider
      satisfaction regarding a child's facial laceration repair.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients: Male and female children aged 2-12 of all ethnic backgrounds and
             socioeconomic levels presenting to the emergency department for laceration repair.
             Children sustaining single, uncomplicated facial lacerations, which can be repaired
             with basic suture techniques, are eligible for the study. Lacerations repaired using
             LET cream, lidocaine injection, and LET cream and lidocaine injection are all eligible
             for the study.

          2. Parents of enrolled patients.

          3. Providers of enrolled patients: Residents, fellows, attendings, and nurse
             practitioners serving as the primary provider performing the laceration repair.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients: Lacerations to parts of the body other than the face. Children with
             developmental disabilities. Children with laceration repair requiring sedation.
             Children with complex lacerations requiring subspecialty repair.

          2. Parents and/or providers of children not eligible or enrolled in the study.

          3. Providers: Medical students performing the laceration repair.
