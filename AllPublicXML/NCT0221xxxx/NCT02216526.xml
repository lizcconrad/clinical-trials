  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residents of institutional long-term care facilities are at high risk for developing skin and
      tissue diseases, e.g. xerosis cutis (including pruritus), infections (e.g., tinea pedis,
      candidiasis), chronic wounds or neoplastic changes (e.g. actinic keratosis, malignant
      melanoma) but there are few epidemiological figures about the actual frequencies of these
      conditions in nursing homes. Therefore, in the first part of this study we aim at measuring
      key dermatological conditions and associated health and functional status, and the skin care
      practice of aged nursing home residents (&quot;prevalence study&quot;).

      Basic skin care interventions are believed to reduce skin dryness and to enhance skin health.
      Thus, the second aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of two structured skin
      care regimens compared to the routine standard skin care on skin health in nursing home
      residents (&quot;intervention study&quot;).

      The study will be conducted in a random sample of seven out of approximately 300
      institutional long term care facilities of the federal state of Berlin.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Overall Dry Skin Score (ODS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 56+/-4</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical assessment of the presence or severity of skin dryness using a five point rating scale at right lower leg. The Overall Dry Skin score is a clinical assessment of the presence and severity of skin dryness using a five-point scale. A score of '0' indicates no skin dryness, whereas a score of '4' indicates advanced skin roughness, large scales, inflammation and cracks.</description>

    <measure>Stratum Corneum Hydration (SCH)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56 +/- 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Stratum corneum hydration (SCH) at the lower leg. Instrumental skin measurements were conducted to characterize possible effects of the interventions in terms of skin function. The stratum corneum hydration was measured using the Corneometer CM 825 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). This measurement is based on the differences of the dielectric constant of water and other substances. With this device, only the moisture content in the stratum corneum is measured. The arbitrary units (a.u.) range from 0 to 120 where as higher readings indicate higher stratum corneum hydration.Values &gt; 40 a.u. are often considered 'normal', whereas values &lt; 40 a.u. are regarded as typical for dry Skin.</description>

    <measure>Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56 +/- 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at the lower leg. Transepidermal water loss was measured with the Tewameter TM 300 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). The probe captures the constant permeation of water through the stratum corneum in gram per hour per m2. The measuring probe contains a pair of sensors that are located in different distances to the skin surface to determine temperature and relative humidity above the skin surface. The humidity gradient between both sensors is used for calculating the transepidermal water loss. Higher values indicate a higher transepidermal water loss.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin Surface pH</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56 +/- 4</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Skin surface pH at the lower leg. Skin surface pH was measured with the Skin-pH-Meter PH 905 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany), a planar glass electrode. The pH is a measure of acidity and alkalinity of a solution and it indicates the concentration of the hydrogen ions in an aqueous solution. Reference values of human skin have been reported to range from 4 to 6.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Self-completion of the 5-D itch scale. Having a 6-CIT score of 7 or lower was the criterion to administer the 5-D itch scale.The score of the 5-D Itch scale ranges from '5' (no pruritus) to '25' (most severe pruritus) and contains five items measuring pruritus over the past two weeks.
A possible cognitive impairment was tested using the Six Item Cognitive Impairment Test on Day 0. It includes six simple questions, for example 'What year is it?' or 'Count backwards from 20 to 10. Scores may range from 0 (= no sign of cognitive impairment) to a maximum score of 28 (= significant cognitive impairment). Residents with sum scores &gt; 8 were classified as 'cognitively impaired'.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Overall Dry Skin Score (ODS)</title>
          <description>Clinical assessment of the presence or severity of skin dryness using a five point rating scale at right lower leg. The Overall Dry Skin score is a clinical assessment of the presence and severity of skin dryness using a five-point scale. A score of '0' indicates no skin dryness, whereas a score of '4' indicates advanced skin roughness, large scales, inflammation and cracks.</description>

        <title>Stratum Corneum Hydration (SCH)</title>
        <description>Change in Stratum corneum hydration (SCH) at the lower leg. Instrumental skin measurements were conducted to characterize possible effects of the interventions in terms of skin function. The stratum corneum hydration was measured using the Corneometer CM 825 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). This measurement is based on the differences of the dielectric constant of water and other substances. With this device, only the moisture content in the stratum corneum is measured. The arbitrary units (a.u.) range from 0 to 120 where as higher readings indicate higher stratum corneum hydration.Values &gt; 40 a.u. are often considered ‘normal’, whereas values &lt; 40 a.u. are regarded as typical for dry Skin.</description>

        <title>Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL)</title>
        <description>Change in Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at the lower leg. Transepidermal water loss was measured with the Tewameter TM 300 (Courage + Khazaka, Cologne, Germany). The probe captures the constant permeation of water through the stratum corneum in gram per hour per m2. The measuring probe contains a pair of sensors that are located in different distances to the skin surface to determine temperature and relative humidity above the skin surface. The humidity gradient between both sensors is used for calculating the transepidermal water loss. Higher values indicate a higher transepidermal water loss.</description>

        <description>Self-completion of the WHO-Five Well-being Index. Well-being was assessed with the WHO-Five Well-being Index. The German version of the questionnaire published by the World Health Organization in 1998 was used. Scores range from ‘5’ (all the time) to ‘0’ (never) for in total five items. Simple questions were asked regarding well-being in the last two weeks, e.g. ‘In the last two weeks … I was happy’ or ‘…I was relaxed’. The sum scores range from 0, indicating the lowest well-being, to 25, indicating the highest well-being. A cut-off score of &lt; 13 is recommended. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire was recently supported.</description>

        <description>Self-completion of the WHO-Five Well-being Index. Well-being was assessed with the WHO-Five Well-being Index. The German version of the questionnaire published by the World Health Organization in 1998 was used. Scores range from ‘5’ (all the time) to ‘0’ (never) for in total five items. Simple questions were asked regarding well-being in the last two weeks, e.g. ‘In the last two weeks … I was happy’ or ‘…I was relaxed’. The sum scores range from 0, indicating the lowest well-being, to 25, indicating the highest well-being. A cut-off score of &lt; 13 is recommended. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire was recently supported.</description>

        <title>Itch Assessment. Question 5. Affecting of Daily Activities ( 1 = Never Affects Activity; 2 = Rarely Affects Activity; 3 = Occasionally Affects Activity; 4 = Frequently Affects Activity; 5 = Always Affects Activity) at Day 56 +/-3</title>
        <description>Self-completion of the 5-D itch scale. Having a 6-CIT score of 7 or lower was the criterion to administer the 5-D itch scale.The score of the 5-D Itch scale ranges from ‘5’ (no pruritus) to ‘25’ (most severe pruritus) and contains five items measuring pruritus over the past two weeks.
A possible cognitive impairment was tested using the Six Item Cognitive Impairment Test on Day 0. It includes six simple questions, for example ‘What year is it?’ or ‘Count backwards from 20 to 10. Scores may range from 0 (= no sign of cognitive impairment) to a maximum score of 28 (= significant cognitive impairment). Residents with sum scores &gt; 8 were classified as ‘cognitively impaired’.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 56 +/-3</time_frame>
        <population>Only participants not being cognitively impaired were able to answer the questionnaires. Due to a number of loss to follow up at the end of the study, n = 28/117 answer these question. In the Cetaphil Group one value is missing for that question.</population>
