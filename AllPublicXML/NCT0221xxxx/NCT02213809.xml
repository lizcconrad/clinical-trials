      Background:

      COPD is an inflammatory and chronic obstructive lung disease, mainly caused by smoking. Most
      patients with COPD are discovered and treated in primary health care. Co-morbidity with heart
      disease, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis and underweight is common. It is important to
      diagnose COPD at an early stage, primarily to motivate smoking cessation, which is the most
      important factor for decelerating the progress of COPD. In addition, medication and
      rehabilitation to reduce symptoms of COPD can be given. Previous studies in Sweden have shown
      poor quality of primary health care provided to patients with COPD.

      As general practitioners often deal with multiple medical problems and patients' motivation
      when diagnosing and treating COPD we hypothesize that case method education (see description
      under &quot;intervention&quot;) in COPD has better effect than traditional education (see description
      under &quot;intervention&quot;).This study aims to examine the effect of case method education on (1)
      learning in COPD among general practitioners and on (2) health in their patients with COPD.

      Method:

      Primary health care centers (PHCC) in Stockholm will be recruited. The PHCCs will be
      randomized to either case method education (n=9 PHCCs) or traditional education (n=9 PHCCs)
      in COPD for their general practitioners. The educations will be held during two times (two
      hours each) within a time range of three months, covering examination and treatment of
      patients with COPD. At least 10.000 patients should be listed at PHCCs included. Random
      sampling of 45 patients with COPD at stage 2-3 will be done from each PHCC. The patients will
      fill in a self-assessment questionnaire including CCQ, CAT and LINQ (see outcome measures) as
      well as questions about medication, exacerbations and other chronic diseases. The
      questionnaire will be sent to the patients 1-2 months before the education and 18 months
      after the education. Differences in assessments in the questionnaire before and after the
      education will be compared between the patients listed at the PHCCs that have received case
      method education vs. traditional education. In addition, general practitioners
      (approximately, n=180) at the PHCCs will fill in a questionnaire, immediately before and 12
      months after the education, covering the learning outcomes in order to study differences in
      learning between the two intervention groups.

    <description>The CCQ measures health status in patients with COPD and consists of 10 items with an overall score and 3 domains: Symptoms (4 items), Functional state (4 items) and Mental state (2 items). All scores range from 0 to 6; (0 = no impairment).</description>

    <description>The questionnaire covers examination and treatment of COPD and includes multiple choice questions as well as questions about attitudes that will be answered in free text.</description>

    <description>Two hours of case method education in COPD are given two times within 3 months to the general practitioners at nine primary health care centers. The education covers examination, including interpretation av spirometry, and treatment of patients with COPD. The learning outcomes are predefined and are the same in both arms. The same person will teach at both times of education.</description>

    <description>In case method a rich narrative describing of a real-life situation (teaching case) is presented, in which the learning group must make a decision or solve a problem. The teaching case provide information, but neither analysis nor conclusions. The analytical work of explaining the relationships among events in the case, identifying options, evaluating choices and predicting the effects of actions is the work done by students during the discussion.</description>

    <description>Traditional education in this study means that the teacher mainly speaks to the group. Although short cases may be used for illustration, the main focus is not that the group shall solve problems from a narrative case.</description>
