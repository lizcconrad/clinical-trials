    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study to assess safety and clinical activity of continued AFFITOPE® PD01A
      vaccinations in patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients, who have already participated in
      AFF008 will be involved and will be receive one boost immunization with AFFITOPE® PD01A. One
      study site in Vienna (Austria) will be involved.

      In addition, up to 8 patients will be offered participation within an untreated control
      group.

             accepted contraceptive method

          -  Stable doses of PD medications for at least 3 months prior to Visit 0 and during the

          -  Alcoholism or substance abuse

          -  Prior treatment with experimental immunotherapeutics for PD including IVIG (with the
