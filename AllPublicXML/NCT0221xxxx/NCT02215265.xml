    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the PATHOS study are:

      To assess whether swallowing function can be improved following transoral resection of
      HPV-positive OPSCC, by reducing the intensity of adjuvant treatment protocols. The aim is to
      personalise treatment, based on disease biology (HPV status and pathology findings), to
      optimise patient outcomes.

      To demonstrate feasibility of recruitment- if the phase II recruits successfully, PATHOS will
      continue to a Phase III study aiming to show non-inferiority of survival in the reduced
      intensity treatment arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PATHOS is a multicentre, open label, parallel group Phase II/III randomised controlled trial
      (RCT). Approximately 242 patients will be recruited to the phase II study. Patients eligible
      for the study must have biopsy proven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)
      clinically staged T1T3 N0N2b. Their primary tumour, as judged by the local MDT, must be
      considered resectable via a transoral approach. Having secured informed consent, patients
      with centrally determined, HPVpositive tumours will undergo baseline assessment of swallowing
      function (includesÍ¾ MDADI score, videofluoroscopy, PSSH&amp; N, 100 mL water swallow test) and
      complete QOL questions (EORTC QLQC30 and EORTC QLQH&amp;N35) prior to surgery.

      Surgery to the primary site may be carried out by Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM) or
      Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS), whilst a standard open approach will be used to facilitate
      an associated neck dissection.

      Following surgery and histopathological assessment of the primary tumour and neck dissection
      surgical specimens, patients will be allocated into study groups based on the presence or
      absence of pathological risk factors for recurrence as follows:

      Group A: Patients with tumours which exhibit no adverse histological features. Patients in
      this group will not receive any adjuvant treatment as per standard of care.

      Group B: Patients with: T3 tumours (or T1T2 tumours with additional risk factors), N2a
      (metastasis in single ipsilateral node 31-60 mm diameter) or N2b (metastasis in multiple
      ipsilateral nodes &lt;61 mm diameter) disease with evidence of perineural and/or vascular
      invasion or close margins (15mm) around the primary tumour specimen but with negative
      marginal biopsies (section 7.1). Patients in this group will be randomised to: PORT 60Gy in
      30# over 6 weeks (Control Arm B1) or PORT 50Gy in 25# over 5 weeks (Test Arm B2).

      Group C: Patients with tumours of any T or any N stage, which exhibit the following high risk
      pathological features will be included: positive (&lt;1mm) margins around the primary tumour
      specimen but with negative marginal biopsies and/or evidence of cervical lymph node
      extracapsular spread. Patients in this group will be randomised to: POCRT 60Gy in 30# over 6
      weeks with concurrent Cisplatin (Control Arm C1) or PORT 60Gy in 30# over 6 weeks only (Test
      Arm C2).

      Patients in groups B and C will be stratified prior to randomisation by: T stage, N stage,
      smoking history and treating centre.

      The same assessments as at baseline will be completed post operatively prior to treatment and
      then at four weeks and 6, 12 and 24 months post treatment. The exception is videofluoroscopy
      which will be repeated at post-surgery and 12 months only.

      Acute and late toxicity will be recorded weekly during treatment the again at 4 weeks and 6,
      12 and 24 months post treatment.

      The time point of assessments should be recorded on the CRF. Complications relating to
      surgery will be recorded in the CRF. In particular any complications which necessitate a
      delay to the start of adjuvant treatment.

      The Phase II study will, if successful in demonstrating a swallowing function advantage in
      the experimental arms, continue seamlessly onto a phase III study, the primary endpoint of
      which is overall survival, aiming to prove survival noninferiority in the reduced intensity
      treatment arms. In order to demonstrate survival noninferiority, &gt;800 patients in total will
      need to be recruited. The phase II will act as an internal pilot and recruited patients will
      be included in the phase III study.

      Data registry: The top copy of each completed CRF should be returned to the WCTU for data
      entry within four weeks of the visit. The remaining copy is to be retained at the local site.
      In accordance with the principles of GCP, the PI is responsible for ensuring accuracy,
      completeness, legibility and timeliness of the data reported to the WCTU in the CRFs.CRF
      pages and data received by the WCTU from participating trial sites will be checked for
      missing, illegible or unusual values (range checks) and consistency over time.

      If missing or questionable data are identified, a data query will be raised on a data
      clarification form. The data clarification form will be sent to the relevant participating
      site. The site shall be requested to answer the data query or correct data on the data
      clarification form. The CRF pages should not be altered.

      All answered data queries and corrections should be signed off and dated by a delegated
      member of staff at the relevant participating site. The completed data clarification form
      should be returned to the WCTU and a copy retained at the site along with the participants'
      CRFs.

      The WCTU will send reminders for any overdue data. It is the site's responsibility to submit
      complete and accurate data in timely manner.

      Quality assirance: The clinical trial risk assessment has been used to determine the
      intensity and focus of central and on-site monitoring activity in the PATHOS trial.
      Monitoring levels will be employed and are fully documented in the trial monitoring plan.
      Investigators should agree to allow trial related monitoring, including audits and regulatory
      inspections, by providing direct access to source data/documents as required. Patient consent
      for this will be obtained.

      Registration: To register or randomise a patient the relevant registration or randomisation
      case report form (CRF) should be completed and the Wales Clinical Trials Unit (WCTU)
      contacted. Randomisation will take place centrally after confirmation of eligibility, by a
      telephone call to the WCTU. Participants will be randomised using minimisation with a random
      element. This will ensure balanced treatment allocation by a number of clinically important
      stratification factors. Randomisation will have an allocation ratio of 1:1.

      Statistical analyses: We will compare mean MDADI scores at 12 months between arms using
      either a t-test or nonparametric methods if appropriate depending upon distributions. We
      expect baseline MDADI values to be high but will adjust for these and the randomisation
      stratification variables in additional sensitivity analyses using regression techniques. This
      primary analysis will be conducted when the last patient has had their 12 month assessment. A
      detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed before the analyses are conducted.

      An IDMC will review the accumulating data (survival, toxicities, recruitment) at 6 monthly
      intervals (see section 13.1). Additionally, using a similar method to the CTAAC funded
      PARSPORT trial (CRUK/03/005), a formal interim analysis will be performed after 38 patients
      have been randomised in each randomisation (19 per arm), treated and followed up for 6
      months. Within each randomisation, a stopping rule will be based on observing an absolute
      observed difference of 6 or more loco-regional recurrences and/or deaths as reason to
      consider early termination of the trial.

      However, the IDMC will also be asked to take into account available data from other sources
      and the likely influence on clinical practice before recommending early closure of the trial.
      Once the 12 month follow- up data has been accumulated to answer the Phase II question, the
      IDMC will be convened to recommend either continuing to Phase III or stopping recruitment. In
      making this decision they will consider both the primary and secondary endpoint data.

      Sub-group statistical analyses:

      For swallowing endpoints, subgroup analysis by T stage and tumour subsite (tonsil, soft
      palate, tongue base) will be carried out, as the most likely relevant clinical co-variables
      affecting swallowing function. Exploratory analyses may be conducted to aid hypothesis
      generation if a phase III is subsequently developed.
