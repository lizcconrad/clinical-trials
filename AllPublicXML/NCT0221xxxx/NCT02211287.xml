    <measure>Level of family carer satisfaction in decision making about the care of the resident</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). This measures uncertainty and difficulties in the decision making process. The 16 item version measures four domains: a) uncertainty in choosing options; b) unsupported in decision making; c) feeling informed; d) decision is consistent with values</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Perception of Care Scale (FPCS). This instrument will represent a global measure on the quality of nursing home care. It is comprised of four subscales: 1) resident care, 2) family support, 3) communication, and 4) rooming. One can investigate both the total and the subscale scores. Family members will also be asked to identify three of the 25 items in the instrument as the highest priorities for providing quality care in the nursing home. Respondents will also be invited to include written comments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of family carer anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). This 12-item instrument is a self-report measure of psychological morbidity. It is widely used in clinical practice, epidemiological research and for research in psychology. The GHQ-12 is often used to assess general distress. It is designed to cover four identifiable elements of distress: anxiety, depression, social impairment, and hypochondriasis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The comfort of the resident at the end of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Dying in Long Term Care (QoDLTC). This instrument is a retrospective scale representing psychosocial aspects of quality of dying. The questionnaire contains 11 items with three subscales: personhood (5 items), closure (3 items) and preparatory tasks (3 items). Factor scores (means of item scores within each factor) may be averaged for an overall quality of dying score (range 1 - 5), with a higher score indicating a more positive experience. Individual factor scores may also be used separately.</description>
