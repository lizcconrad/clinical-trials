          -  Female subject is surgically sterile, post-menopausal or agrees to use an acceptable
             method of birth control.

          -  Subject agrees to stop taking any vitamins, minerals, or dietary/herbal supplements
             he/she is currently taking at least 7 days prior to randomization and agrees to not
             take any vitamins, minerals or dietary/herbal supplements other than the study product
             until after study completion.
