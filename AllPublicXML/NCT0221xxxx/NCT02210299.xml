  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People are, especially in industrialized countries, exposed to a growing number of ubiquitous
      chemical substances. It thus increases human exposure pathways: diet, inhalation, soil and
      dust dermal contact…), notably for semi-volatile organic compounds. Diet is generally sought
      to contribute the most to total exposure for many chemicals, the relative contribution of
      each pathway is nevertheless poorly described, and can be different among populations. This
      is in particularly the case For young children, who can be more exposed via the environment,
      because of frequent contact with object and dust and hand to mouth behaviors. Children are in
      addition considered more sensitive to chemical risk due to their maturating systems.

      In this context, the objective of this project is to characterize the young children's
      exposure to a particular class of semi volatile organic compounds. It will encompass the
      relative contribution of different pathways to the external dose, and to try to match the
      internal and external doses with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for
      molecules for which it is possible.

      The present demand concerns a feasibility study on 2 children, for Perfluorinated Alkylated
      Substances (PFAS), used in numerous consumer products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study for testing feasibility of cross sectional integrative exposure study.

      Strategy : Exposure assessment of young children to PFAS with simultaneous measurement of
      internal (serum) and external doses (diet, indoor environment: contamination data and human
      exposure factors; quantity ingested and breathed).

      Expected outcomes :

      Assessment of feasibility to obtain:

        -  original data on children's body burden

        -  original contamination data for food, water, air and dust ;

        -  Matching of these data to identify main sources and pathways of exposure.

    <description>Main objective of this feasibility study is to set the scientific consortium to recruit and study 2 young children's exposures.
Main judgement criteria : Effective enrolment of 2 young children during their consultation to Rennes hospital, from those having a blood sampling for medical purposes, and house survey.</description>

    <description>Second objective is to validate protocols, procedures and methods to study exposure to PFAS.
Secondary judgment criteria :
Possibility to sample an extra volume of blood, to prepare it and transport it at -18°C to Laberca lab, Nantes;
Possibility to organize a home visit with sampling of diet, water, air, dust and delivery of dietary questionnaire;
Possibility to quantify PFAS in dietary and environmental samples;
Possibility to model the internal dose for some compounds from kinetics data, and to compare doses estimated from blood measurements to those from environmental and diet measurements</description>
