  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current islet transplantation into the portal vein of the liver has shown the unique ability
      of islets to stabilize blood glucose levels and prevent severe hypoglycemia in a selected
      group of subjects with Type 1 diabetes. The main limitations of islet transplantation are the
      need for systemic immunosuppression to maintain function and the loss of islet function over
      time. Additionally, many studies have demonstrated that the current site of transplantation
      in the liver is not an ideal site due to several factors. These factors include (1)
      significant liver inflammation following islet infusion; (2) potential for life-threatening
      procedure-related complications such as bleeding and thrombosis; (3) high levels of
      immunosuppressive drugs and GI toxins in the liver contributing to islet toxicity; (4) the
      inability to retrieve islets after infusion; and (5) development of graft dysfunction in a
      number of recipients of intrahepatic allogeneic and autologous islets. The implantation of
      islets into the omentum will allow adequate engraftment of islets onto the omentum and will
      lead to comparable or superior functional and clinical outcomes than in the traditional
      intrahepatic site.

      Islet transplantation will be performed in subjects with unstable Type 1 diabetes mellitus
      under permanent immunosuppression. Islets are re-suspended in autologous plasma and
      distributed on the omental surface by a minimal invasive approach. Cell adherence is achieved
      by addition of clinical-grade recombinant human thrombin that reacts with plasma to create a
      biocompatible, degradable gel containing the islet graft. The primary efficacy endpoint is
      the proportion of subjects with HbA1c ≤6.5% at 1 year AND free of severe hypoglycemic events
      from Day 28 to Day 365, inclusive, after the islet transplant. The primary safety endpoint is
      to demonstrate patient safety throughout all stages of the trial.
