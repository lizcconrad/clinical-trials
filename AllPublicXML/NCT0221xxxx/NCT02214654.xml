      The purpose of this study is to compare clopidogrel with ticagrelor which one has stronger
      anti-inflammation effect to protect against type 2 diabetes-induced vascular damage.

      i- Verify the study inclusion and exclusion criteria at visit 1.

      ii- Inform patients (verbally and in writing) and their caregivers (when considered necessary
      and with the patient's consent) of the characteristics of the study and confirm their
      agreement to participate by signing the informed consent document.

      iii- Assist with patient assessment, record the information in the case report form. Based on
      the data we get from the case report form, assign the patient to the experimental or control
      group by stratified randomization.

      ⅳ- At visit 2 to obtain blood sample from peripheral vessel and analyze the density of
      CECs,sCD40L and hs-CRP by flow cytometry (FCM), ELISA and particle-enhanced turbidimetric
      immunoassay.

      ⅴ- All patients are given aspirin 100mg/qd orally and the experimental group given ticagrelor
      90mg/bid while the control group clopidogrel 75mg/qd for 30 days.

      ⅵ- At visit 3 repeating step ⅳ and making comparison on numbers of CECs and CD40L between the
      two groups, and finish a statistic analysis.

      We will collect blood samples from the vena mediana cubiti, volume of sample blood will be
      5ml.Centrifuge samples at 700gfor 20 min at 4 °C with no brake.Remove gently the upper phase
      (plasma) with a 5 ml pipette into a separate tube and store in 0.25 ml aliquots.Distribute
      500 μl of samples into one isotype control and three sample tubes and add the special
      antibodies.Then account the CECs and sCD40/40L,etc.
