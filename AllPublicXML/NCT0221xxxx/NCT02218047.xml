  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycythemia Vera (PV) is a disease of bone marrow stem cells that manifests in a drastic
      increase of red blood cells and frequently also of white blood cells. The &quot;thickening&quot; of the
      blood in relation with a modified function of the cells has several consequences like
      increased blood pressure, pruritus of the skin, fatigue, disturbed blood circulation in the
      brain as well as fingers and toes and an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis
      (thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a vessel); like stroke, cardiac infarction,
      deep vein thrombosis in the legs. In case of a strong increase of platelets there is an
      additional risk of bleedings. As the disease progresses the size of spleen and liver
      increased in most cases and the bone marrow shows signs of fibrosis. In some cases of PV a
      progression at a later time point to a leukemia (increased formation of white blood cells)
      can occur.

      The aim of this study is to show that the study drug AOP2014 (pegylated proline interferon
      alpha-2b) has the long term efficacy and safety in controlling the disease. A comparison arm
      is receiving best available therapy as selected by the investigator. Response to the
      treatment is measured by several blood parameters as well as size of the spleen.

      Interferon-alpha has been shown to be effective in controlling the blood parameters by
      immunologically influencing the blood building cells. This can lead to a suppression of the
      disease-causing stem cells and help healthy stem cells to proliferate. Through this mechanism
      it is possible that Interferon-alpha can avoid long-term damaging effects of the disease.

      This is a Phase III, parallel-arm, open-label continuation of the PROUD-PV study performed in
      adults diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera (PV). Patients who received AOP2014 in the primary
      study, PROUD-PV will continue on AOP2014, patients who received HU in the PROUD-PV study will
      receive best available therapy as selected by the investigator. Only patients who completed
      PROUD-PV including the end of study visit will be enrolled into this continuation study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who completed the 12 months AOP2014 treatment arm of the PROUD-PV study and

             of the following criteria:

               -  normalization of at least two out of three main blood parameters (Hct, PLTs and
                  WBCs) if these parameters were moderately increased (Hct&lt;50%, WBC&lt;20 x 109/L,
                  PLTs&lt;600 x 109/L) at baseline of the PROUD-PV study, OR

               -  &gt;35% decrease of at least two out of three main blood parameters (Hct, PLTs and

          4. Clinically significant development of a new ophthalmologic disorder, or worsening of a
             pre-existing one, during the study.

          5. Loss of efficacy of AOP2014 or any comparable situation where no further benefits of
