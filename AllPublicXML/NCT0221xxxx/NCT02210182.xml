             to signature of ICF

         11. Any of the following conditions: Ongoing clinically significant cardiac dysrhythmias
             such as atrial fibrillation ; QTc interval &gt; 450 msec for males or &gt; 470 msec for
             females or uncontrolled intercurrent cardiac illness, e.g. unstable angina; severe
             coronary disease, ventricular arrhythmias, bradycardia &lt; 50 bpm (unless caused by
             beta-blocker); a history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g.,
             heart failure or family history of Long QTC Syndrome)

             negative urine pregnancy test prior to first dose of study medication.

         18. Acute or chronic severe medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality
             that would impart, in the judgement of the investigator, excess risk associated with
             trial participation of study drug administration, or which in the judgement of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial
