  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) can severely deteriorate balance and gait in patients,
      thereby increasing risk of fall and injury. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy
      of a virtual reality game based exercise training for improving postural body sway and gait
      in diabetes patients with peripheral neuropathy. The exercise training has been specifically
      designed for DPN patients with lost lower extremity joint perception and uses
      state-of-the-art inertial sensors (body-worn) to acquire joint movement and provide real-time
      joint feedback through an interactive interface on a LCD monitor. The investigators
      hypothesize that tailored exercise with real-time visual joint feedback during exercise will
      reduce improve balance and gait.

  <detailed_description>

      The game includes a series of ankle reaching tasks and crossing of virtual obstacles on the
      monitor screen; these exercises are aimed to improve weight shifting capabilities and
      medial-lateral movement of body.
