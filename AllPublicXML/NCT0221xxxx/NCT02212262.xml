  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progress in the treatment of myeloma and myeloma bone disease has substantially increased
      overall survival, but relapse is inevitable and better treatment is needed. The bone
      microenvironment is tremendously complex, so that targeting single interactions between tumor
      and bone is unlikely to be effective. Treatments need to block centrally important,
      multifunctional pathways. The investigators data point to a central role of the osteocyte to
      induce heparanase, a multifunctional mediator of myeloma bone disease. Increased heparanase
      due to FGF23 may make systemic inhibitors of heparanase less effective in bone than
      elsewhere. FGF23 neutralizing antibodies have been developed for non-cancer conditions of
      FGF23 excess, such as chronic kidney disease (Shimada &amp; Fukamoto, 2012), and could be used in
      MM alone or in combination with heparanase inhibitors. Complete neutralization of FGF23 has
      adverse effects, but neutralization of FGF23 excess may be practical, or in the future,
      suppression of excess FGF23 biosynthesis by osteocytes.

      The investigators hope to determine serum FGF23 and heparanase, Dkk1 and plasma klotho levels
      in patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma compared to healthy controls with this
      exploratory study.
