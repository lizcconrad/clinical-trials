      The purpose of this study is to evaluate acute local toxicity of IORT at the dose of 20 Gy
      for the replacement of boost-external beam radiotherapy in Korean women who are candidates
      for breast-conserving treatment.

    <description>Intervention:
Intraoperative Radiotherapy
* Operation day
Breast conservative surgery + Intraoperative radiotherapy 20 Gy
Aftuer tumor lump is removed and negative tumor margins are achieved, applicator of Intrabeam® is located within tumor cavity. Purse string suture pulles up tissues and wraps up the applicator. IORT with 20Gy is followed. After IORT, applicator was out of the operative field, and usual wound closure will be done.
* Postoperative period
± Chemotherapy
WBRT (46 Gy) for 4~5 weeks
± Endocrine therapy or target therapy</description>
