      Comparison of efficacy and safety of different insulin regimens between basal bolus and
      premixed insulin in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week, prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study conducted in
      approximately 140 patients with type 2 diabetes from Mackay Memorial Hospitals and Mackay
      Memorial Hospital Taitung branch. After enrollment, eligible patients will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to either Basal-plus therapy(BPT) or Preprandial premix therapy(PPT). The
      effectiveness of advancing insulin therapy will be assessed at baseline and at 12 and 24
      weeks after initiation of study prescription. The safety will be followed during the 24-week
      study period. All study procedure will be conducted after obtaining informed consent.
