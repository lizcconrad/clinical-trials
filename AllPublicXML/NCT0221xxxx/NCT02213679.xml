  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition of unknown etiology. Recent
      studies have shown that CFS is associated with impaired cellular energetics and low levels of
      phosphocreatine. Since guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) acts as a highly bioavailable precursor of
      creatine it may provide an ideal dietary supplement to facilitate treatment and perhaps
      prevention of CFS. The overall hypothesis to be evaluated is that medium-term supplementation
      with GAA will improve clinical outcomes in well-defined adult CFS patients via augmented
      provision of creatine. Specific aims: (1) To determine the effects of GAA on CFS
      symptomatology using a fatigue severity inventory, soreness of locomotive apparatus scales,
      and a health-related quality of life survey; (2) To determine the effect of GAA on creatine
      metabolism using laboratory studies and magnetic resonance spectroscopy; (3) To characterize
      the physiological effects of GAA on work capacity via actigraphy and exercise performance
      tests; and (4); To determine the prevalence of subjectively reported side-effects and
      biochemical adverse events associated with GAA intervention.

      A variety of dietary interventions have been used in the management of CFS, yet no
      therapeutic modality demonstrated overall positive results in terms of effectiveness (Whiting
      et al. 2001). Previous studies have evaluated the effects of essential fatty acids, vitamins,
      minerals and/or enzymes, with findings do not support the use of a broad-spectrum nutritional
      supplement in treating CFS‐related symptoms (Brouwers et al. 2002). Considering the fact that
      patients with CFS have lower levels of high-energy compounds (e.g. phosphocreatine, adenosine
      triphosphate) (Block et al. 1998), effective dietary treatment of CFS should be focused on
      providing compounds that facilitates cellular bioenergetics. Besides other candidate agents,
      guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) could be of particular interest since it occurs naturally in the
      human body and acts as an immediate precursor of creatine (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000).
      Due to its low cost and high bioavailability (Baker 2009), if proven effective dietary GAA
      may be suitable for use in broad CFS population.
