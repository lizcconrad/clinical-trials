    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the proportion of participants with non-occupational
      post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP) failure, defined as NPEP non-completion (including loss to
      follow-up) at week 4 or primary HIV infection at week 4 or 12, excluding those participants
      who should and do cease study drug because:

        1. The participant is found to be HIV-infected (study drugs will be ceased until the
           genotype of the infecting strain is determined)

        2. The source is found to be HIV-uninfected

      The primary study objectives are:

        1. To describe on-drug adherence and regimen completion rates of 28 days of NPEP using
           dolutegravir (DTG) with co-formulated emtricitabine-tenofovir (FTC-TDF)

        2. To describe the safety of 28 days of non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP)
           using dolutegravir with co-formulated emtricitabine-tenofovir

      The study is a multi-site, prospective, open-label, non-randomized trial. One-hundred (100)
      eligible participants will receive dolutegravir (one tablet) with co-formulated
      emtricitabine-tenofovir, two tablets, once daily for 28 days based on one of the following
      exposures:

        1. receptive anal intercourse with a source known to be HIV-infected; or

        2. receptive anal intercourse with a source of unknown HIV status; or

        3. insertive anal intercourse with a source known to be HIV-infected

      There will be 7 study visits over a 12-week period. Follow-up post NPEP is for 8 weeks i.e.
      to week-12 post-exposure. Any participant who is intolerant of dolutegravir will be managed
      at the investigator's discretion.
