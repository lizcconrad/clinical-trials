      The study designed to determine the effect induced by WCK 2349 on the QT interval.

      The study will be conducted in two parts: 1) to determine the supratherapeutic dose; and 2)
      to assess the safety of high doses of single-dose administration of WCK 2349 on the QT
      interval.

    <textblock>
      Part 1 of this study will determine the supratherapeutic dose to be used in Part 2. Part
      1will enroll 8 subjects at each of 4 dose levels (up to 32 subjects). Cohorts will be
      staggered so that appropriate safety monitoring and follow-up can be performed for each
      subject at each dose level.

      Safety monitoring will be based upon review of AEs, ECGs and clinical laboratory test results
      prior to escalation to the next dose level.

      At the first dose level, 6 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of WCK
      2349 at 1800 mg and 2 subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo. If this dose is
      tolerated by subjects, and safety data allows, the next group will be initiated in the same
      fashion at a dose of 2200 mg. If this dose is tolerated by subjects, and safety data allows,
      the next group will be initiated in the same fashion at a dose of 2600 mg. If this dose is
      tolerated by subjects, and safety data allows, the next group will be initiated in the same
      fashion at a dose of 3000 mg. Based upon safety data, the highest safely tolerated dose in
      Part 1 will be utilized as the supratherapeutic dose in Part 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subject between 18 and 55 years of age,inclusive, with a body mass
             index ≥18 to ≤33 kg/m2.

          -  Female subjects must be at least 2 years postmenopausal,surgically sterile, or
             practicing 2 highly effective methods of birth control (determined by the investigator
             or designee; one of the methods must be a barrier technique), not pregnant or
             lactating, and have a negative serum pregnancy test before enrolling in the study.

          -  Male or female subjects must agree to practice 2 highly effective methods of birth
             control (as determined by the investigator or designee; one of the methods must be a
             barrier technique) from Screening until 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Stable health based on no clinically significant findings on the medical history,
             physical examination, or clinical laboratory test results (as determined and
             documented by the investigator).
