  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of a noninvasive cortical
      electrostimulation therapy known as &quot;Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical
      Electrostimulation&quot; (RINCE) in the treatment of pain associated with fibromyalgia. Patients
      who meet the 2010 American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia will receive up
      to 24 RINCE treatments delivered by a medical device called &quot;NeuroPoint&quot;. Approximately 200
      fibromyalgia patients will be randomized into one of two study groups. One of these groups
      will receive sham treatment, meaning they will receive no treatment at all, while the other
      group will receive active RINCE treatment. The study's primary outcome measure will be the
      difference between active and sham treatment groups in the mean change from baseline in
      patients' weekly worst pain scores. The study's hypothesis is that there will be a difference
      between treatment groups in primary outcome measure.
