  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed on 50 APS (antiphospholipid Syndrome) patients, which will be
      randomized to receive either CoQ10 (200mg/day) or placebo for one month. Blood will be drawn
      at time 0 and at the end of the treatment. Studies will be conducted in plasma and purified
      leukocytes from APS. Design: 1) Study of endothelial function: 2) Analysis of changes
      operated on various prothrombotic/proinflammatory parameters and their associated
      intracellular signalling. 3) Analysis of mitochondrial ultra structure and activity;
      mitochondrial antioxidant system characterization; Expression levels and activity of
      transcription factors/proteins involved in oxidative stress (Foxo 3, NFkB, Nrf2),
      Quantification of CoQ10 (Coenzyme Q10). 4) Biomarkers of oxidative stress. 5) miRNAs
      microarrays, RT-PCR validation and correlation/association studies. 6) Induction of
      over-expression of miRNAs of interest; luciferase constructs. 7)Studies of methylation.

    <description>Study of the endothelial function in vivo. Variations in capilar blood flow of the skin will be analyzed by noninvasive Doppler laser fluorimetry using a Periflux 5000 equipment.
The study will be performed on 50 APS (antiphospholipid Syndrome) patients. Patients will be randomized to CoQ10 or placebo group. Treatments will be given for 1 month, according to a randomized and crossover design (with wash-out periods of four weeks) Blood will be drawn at time 0, at the end of treatment, and after three months of the end of treatment.</description>
