  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AG-221 is a first-in-class drug targeted specifically to inhibit the IDH2 enzyme. Small
      molecule inhibition of the IDH enzyme represents a new, targeted approach to cancer
      treatment.

      Administration of oral drugs with food may change the absorption of drugs, and it is
      therefore useful to characterize the effect of food early in drug development.

             prior to Screening, must agree to use condom with spermicide as contraception
             (regardless of their female partner's childbearing potential or their partner's use of
             their own contraception) from Day 1 of Period 1 until 28 days following the last dose
             of study drug.

          5. Subjects must have a body weight ≥50 kg and body mass index (BMI) ≥18.5 and ≤32 kg/m2
             at Screening.

          6. Subjects must be in general good health as determined by no clinically significant
             deviation from normal in medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and
             12-lead ECGs at Screening or on Day -1 of each period.

          7. Subjects must be non-smokers and have not used nicotine-containing products for at
             least 3 months prior to Screening.

          9. Subjects must be willing to refrain from strenuous exercise starting 72 hours prior to
             Day 1 of Period 1 through the Follow-up visit.

         10. Subjects must be willing to refrain from ingestion of alcohol starting 7 days (14 days
             for red wine) prior to Day 1 of Period 1 through the Follow-up visit.

         11. Subjects must agree not to donate blood or plasma to any blood bank or for any purpose
             (other than blood samples in this study) for the duration of participation in the
             study (from Screening to Follow-up).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will not be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subjects who have previously received AG-221 (this does not apply at Period 2).

          2. Subjects with Screening or Check-in clinical laboratory results that are outside the
             laboratory normal range, including hematology, clinical chemistry, serology, and
             urinalysis, that in the Investigator's judgment, is felt to be clinically relevant.

          3. Subjects who, after 10 minutes supine rest, have a systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt;144
             mmHg or a diastolic BP &gt;90 mmHg. If BP exceeds these cut points related to transient
             anxiety-related increases, BP may be repeated once.

          4. Subjects with QTcF interval (Fridericia's correction factor) &gt; 450 msec at Screening
             or pre dose on Day 1 of either study period.

          5. Subjects with a history of serious mental illness that includes, but is not limited
             to, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. Subjects with a history of
             depression may be included if treatment did not require hospitalization, if the
             subject has been off anti-depressant medication for a minimum of 12 months, and if in
             the Investigator's judgment, the subject has been stable with no evidence of
             significant depression for a minimum of 12 months.

          6. Subjects who have a clinically relevant history or presence of respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal, cardiovascular, hepatic, hematologic, lymphatic, neurologic,
             endocrine, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunologic, dermatologic, or
             connective tissue diseases or disorders.

          7. Subjects with a history of any primary malignancy, including a history of melanoma or
             suspicious undiagnosed skin lesions, with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinomas of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ or other malignancies curatively
             treated with no evidence of disease for at least 1 year prior to Screening.

          8. Subjects with a pre-existing condition that interferes with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, and/or hepatic and/or renal function that could interfere with
             the absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drug. Note that
             cholecystectomy is not exclusionary.

          9. Subjects with any other medical or psychological condition, deemed by the Investigator
             to be likely to interfere with a subject's ability to sign informed consent,
             cooperate, or participate in the study.

         15. Subjects with a positive screen for drugs of abuse, or urinary cotinine &gt;200 ng/mL at
             Screening or at Check-in; subjects with a positive screen for alcohol at Check-in.

         16. Subjects who are participating in any concurrent clinical trial of another
             investigational product or placebo, or have received an investigational agent within 2
             months prior to Day 1 of Period 1.

         17. Subjects who have used prescription drugs within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is

             collard greens, kohlrabi, brussels sprouts, mustard) from 7 days prior to dosing
             through discharge from the clinic in each period.

         22. Subjects who have undergone strenuous activity within 72 hours prior to Day 1 in each
             period.

             for the current study.

         25. Subjects who cannot communicate reliably with the Investigator.

         26. Subjects who cannot or are unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study
             (for example, difficulty with swallowing multiple tablets of medication).

         27. Subjects with any conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the
             subject unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the subject's participation
             in, or completion of, the study.
