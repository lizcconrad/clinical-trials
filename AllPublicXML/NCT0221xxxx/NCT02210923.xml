  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotid baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) by the Rheos® system produces a sustained fall in
      blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. Since the activation electrodes are
      implanted at the level of the carotid sinus, it is conceivable that the nearby located
      carotid body chemoreceptors are stimulated as well. Physiological stimulation of carotid
      chemoreceptors not only raises respiration, but it also increases sympathetic activity which
      may in part counteract the effects of BAT. The aim of the present study is to investigate
      whether there is evidence for concomitant carotid chemoreflex activation during BAT. We
      hypothesized that there is no clinically relevant co-activation of the carotid body
      chemoreceptors during BAT in patients with resistant hypertension.

        Subjects implanted with a BAT system will be invited to participate in this study. These
        are patients who were enrolled in the DEBuT-HET and Rheos Pivotal Trial and have given
        their permission to be approached for follow-up studies. Subjects are all &gt;21 years of age
        and were all known with a blood pressure ≥160/90 mmHg despite optimal antihypertensive
        therapy before receiving BAT. It is essential to have the Rheos® device implanted to enable
        participation in this study, as we want to investigate the effect of electrical carotid
        sinus activation on the carotid body chemoreflex.
