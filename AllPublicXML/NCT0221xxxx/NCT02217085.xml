      The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to ensure that polyps are completely
      removed by evaluating the borders of the removed polyp. If a polyp is found that meets the
      size requirements for the study, the investigators will take extra biopsies of the margin to
      determine if there is any abnormal tissue or cancer at these borders.
