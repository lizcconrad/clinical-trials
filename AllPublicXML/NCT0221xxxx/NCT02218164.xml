  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of two established anti-cancer
      therapies are beneficial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Specifically,
      investigators want to determine if the combination of 5-FU/Capecitabine (oral pills) and
      Interferon alpha-2b (injection) can help people with advanced cases of squamous cell
      carcinoma of the skin. For participants that are not approved for oral capecitabine, treating
      physicians will use continuous infusion 5-FU. Both 5-FU/Capecitabine and Interferon alpha-2b
      have been used separately to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and are FDA approved
      in other cancer types.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will start the Capecitabine pills on day 1 thru day 14 and be off for 7 days (day 15-day 21).
Participants will receive 5-FU days 1-4 of each 21 day cycle.
Participants will receive the Interferon alpha-2b injection weekly every week. The three week period is referred to as one cycle.
After three cycles, new imaging studies will be performed that will measure how the disease is responding to treatment. Participants whose disease is stable or improved will undergo an additional 3 cycles of therapy and the imaging studies will be repeated. Again, participants whose disease is stable or improved will undergo a final 3 cycles of treatment (a total 27 weeks of treatment).</description>

    <description>Drug administration will occur on an outpatient basis at the infusion center at Moffitt Cancer Center. Dose will be weight-based. Starting treatment doses of 3 mcg/kg will be given subcutaneously (SC) injection in the thigh, abdominal wall, or upper arm every week for a total of 27 weeks as tolerated.</description>

    <description>Drug administration will be on an outpatient basis. Capecitabine will be administered at an initial dose of 800 mg/m^2 by mouth twice daily on days 1-14 of a 21 day cycle with days 15-21 off. This cycle will be repeated every 21 days during the study for a maximum of 9 cycles as tolerated. Administration via feeding tube in patients unable to swallow is permitted.</description>

    <description>If participants are not able to acquire oral capecitabine, then treating physicians will start participants on infusional 5-FU which can be delivered via standard of care. Participants will need to have a port placed for continuous infusion treatments. 5-FU pumps will be activated in the infusion center at Moffitt Cancer Center with a starting dose of 800 mg/m^2 days 1-4, with pump removal on day 5 at the infusion center. 5-FU pumps will be attached every 21 days (1 cycle) for a maximum of 9 cycles.</description>

             Prior topical treatment with 5-fluorouracil is permitted. Patients who are on chronic
             daily doses of prednisone of greater than 10 mg are excluded. There is no restriction

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
