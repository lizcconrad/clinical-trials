  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with and without stimulant
      medication and compare it to medication alone. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      stimulant medication only, CBT only and combined CBT and stimulant medication group. Patients
      will be evaluated at baseline, following mediation optimization (for medicated groups),
      following 12 months of treatment, after 3 months of follow up, and after 6 months of follow
      up. The investigators hypothesize that the combined group will have the best outcome at all
      evaluation points. ADHD in adults is associated with significant morbidity and impaired
      academic, occupational, social, and emotional functioning. Developing optimal treatment
      approaches for this population is key in improving their functioning.

    <description>Medication is titrated over a 4-week period with stepwise increments each week. Patients and significant others complete ADHD symptom scales at baseline and before each medication visit. Patients also complete side effects scales at baseline and before each medication visit. The gradual increase will continue until there is no further improvement in symptoms and in the Clinical Global Improvement Scale or side effects are such that further increases are not indicated. Once the optimal dose is reached, the subjects remain on this dose for the remainder of the study.</description>
