  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism of Osteoarthritis (OA) is complex, however the investigators know that
      cartilage breakdown follows changes in certain cells in the cartilage called chondrocytes,
      leading to proteases that break down cartilage. There is a protein in the human blood called
      alpha-2-macroglobulin that can trap these proteases and prevent the breakdown of cartilage.
      Cytonics developed a device that use the patient's own blood to remove all cells and
      concentrate alpha-2-macroglobulin to be injected in the painful knee due to osteoarthritis.
