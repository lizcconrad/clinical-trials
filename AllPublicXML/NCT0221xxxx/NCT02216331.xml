  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label study, 2-treatment, 2-period, single sequence design. Period 1 will
      examine the pharmacokinetics of TMC207 in the absence of rifapentine or rifampicin. Subjects
      will receive a single 400-mg dose of TMC207 administered alone on Study Day 1. Period 2 will
      examine the effects of repeated doses of either rifapentine or rifampicin on TMC207
      pharmacokinetics and will begin on Study Day 20. During Period 2, subjects will receive 22
      daily doses of either 600 mg rifapentine or rifampicin from Study Day 20 through Study Day
      41. A single 400-mg dose of TMC207 will be administered on Study Day 29. Subjects will be
      confined to the clinic from Study Day-1 to Study Day 2 in the morning of Period 1, and Study
      Day 19 to Study Day 30 in the morning of Period 2. The study hypothesis is to determine
      whether Rifapentine affects the pharmacokinetics of TMC207 as measured by effects on Cmax and
      AUC(0-t) to a lesser degree than rifampicin.

          -  Subjects with the following laboratory abnormalities at screening as defined by the

             Table and in accordance with the normal ranges of the clinical laboratory: Serum
             creatinine grade 1 or greater (&gt; 1.0 x ULN); Pancreatic lipase grade 1 or greater (&gt;
             1.0 x ULN); Hemoglobin grade 1 or greater (≤ 10.5 g/dL); Platelet count grade 1 or
             greater (≤ 99000/mm3); Absolute neutrophil count grade 1 or greater (≤ 1500/mm3);
