      The purpose of this study is to compare the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      dual therapy with 3TC and DTG as initial therapy among naïve HIV patients.

      Data collected in this study would inform the development of larger studies designed to
      evaluate metabolic and long term safety, impact on inflammatory biomarkers, efficacy, safety
      and cost effectiveness of this strategy among naïve and suppressed patients.

      Primary endpoint:Proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies/mL at
      week 48.

      Secondary endpoints: Frequency, type and severity of adverse events and laboratory
      abnormalities, Proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;1000 copies/mL at week 12, Proportion
      of patients with HIV-RNA &lt;400 at week 24 Number and type of resistance mutations in case of
      virologic failure (defined as a confirmed viral above 400 copies/mL after week 24 copies/mL
      or viral rebound at any timepoint) Changes in CD4+ lymphocyte count between baseline and 48
      weeks, Estimation of the viral decay compared to historical data.
