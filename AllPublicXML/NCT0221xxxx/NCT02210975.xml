  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has gained popularity as both a staged and a definitive procedure for
      morbid obesity due to its technical simplicity, low-morbidity and excellent results both for
      weight loss and control of metabolic syndrome. There are however reports of SG worsening
      pre-existing GERD or causing new-onset GERD. Because of this, patients with pre-existing GERD
      have been denied the benefits of SG. In addition, patients that develop post-op GERD cannot
      undergo traditional anti-reflux surgery since the gastric fundus that is required for
      fundoplication is removed during the SG. Hence, patients with post-SG GERD not adequately
      controlled with medication can only opt for the more invasive gastric bypass procedure as
      their only surgical treatment option.

      In a recently reported case study, an obese patient with severe GERD successfully treated
      with EndoStim underwent SG and maintained adequate GERD control with continued use of LES
      stimulation therapy. However electrical stimulation was not yet tested systematically in
      patients with prior gastric operation such as sleeve gastrectomy.

      This study will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation is effective in control of
      GERD associated with SG.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is between 18 - 80 years of age.

          2. Subject underwent a sleeve gastrectomy minimum one year prior to enrollment (in order
             to have reached a stable weight loss plateau).

          3. Subject has a history of heartburn, regurgitation or both for &gt;6 month prompting
             physician recommendation of continual daily use of PPI after sleeve gastrectomy.

          4. Baseline off-PPI GERD-HRQL score ≥ 20 following 10-14 days off PPI

          5. Baseline off-PPI GERD-HRQLscore is at least 5 points higher than the on-PPI score or a
             positive relationship between the occurrence of their primary symptom during the pH
             impedance monitoring (symptom association probability ≥ 95% or a SI score ≥ 50%) is
