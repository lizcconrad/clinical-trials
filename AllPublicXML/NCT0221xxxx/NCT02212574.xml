  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants enrolling on this study will receive standard of care chemotherapy for Wnt
      positive medulloblastoma without the radiation therapy or the weekly chemotherapy that is
      given during radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 9 cycles of chemotherapy. There are two different kinds of cycles given. They
      are referred to as A and B.

      Cycle A lasts for 6 weeks and Cycle B lasts for 4 weeks. B cycles are given after the
      completion of two A cycles.

      Below are the details of the drugs and schedules for A and B cycles.

      Cycle A (This cycle lasts 42 days)

        -  Lomustine (CCNU) is given by mouth on Day 1.

        -  Vincristine is given directly into a vein (IV) over one minute or using a minibag over
           several minutes by some institutions on Days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Cisplatin is given directly into a vein over 8 hours on Day 1

      Cycle B (This cycle lasts 28 days)

        -  Cyclophosphamide is given into a vein over 1 hour on Days 1 and 2.

        -  MESNA, a drug to protect the bladder from the effects of cyclophosphamide, will be given
           15 minutes before each dose of cyclophosphamide and repeated at 3 and 6 hours.

        -  Vincristine is given directly into a vein directly into the vein (IV) over one minute or
           using a minibag over several minutes by some institutions on Days 1 and 8.

      You may also get a supportive care drug called a myeloid growth factor (filgrastim or
      pegfilgrastim). This drug will help your blood counts recover after the chemotherapy is
      given.
