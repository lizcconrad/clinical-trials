  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A thin tube, called a ureteral stent, is inserted into the ureter and is commonly used as
      treatment of urinary stone disease. Stents are designed to help provide drainage of the
      kidney in the setting of an obstructing stone, or postoperative swelling of the ureter.
      Though their presence is only temporary, stents are associated with a significant amount of
      patient discomfort and bother, which can negatively impact overall satisfaction. Over the
      past decades, there have been refinements in stent technology and usage philosophy. Smaller
      and softer stents are now available for use in patients, though studies evaluating the
      relative benefits have been conflicting. The investigators aim to evaluate the effect of
      stent size and composition upon outcomes after the treatment of stone disease, including
      patient comfort and satisfaction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Over 18 years of age and willing and able to provide informed consent

          2. Patients with current urinary stone disease, undergoing any of the following
             procedures:

               -  cystoscopy with stent placement

               -  ureteroscopy with intracorporeal lithotripsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with compromised urinary tract due to cancer (e.g. bladder tumor, ureteral
             obstruction from non-GU malignancy)

          2. Patients requiring bilateral surgical stone management procedure

          3. Patients with any single stone exceeding 1.5 cm

          4. Patients with severe concurrent disease, infection, or co-morbidity that, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would render the patient inappropriate for enrollment

          5. Any patient who is on anticholinergic medication at baseline
