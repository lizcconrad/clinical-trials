  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a peer led social skills training
      intervention is more effective than a social activity group (i.e. usual care) in improving
      social skills following brain injury.

      The study will take place in two phases. The pilot phase (n =12) will test the feasibility of
      the approach. Following a period of analysis and fine-tuning, the protocol for the second
      phase of the study (n=12) will be adapted in the light of pilot study results.

    <measure>Behaviorally-Referenced Rating System of Intermediate Social Skills - Revised (BRISS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in BRISS-R at week 8 (follow-up measure)</time_frame>
    <description>The Personal Conversational Style Scale and the Person Directed Behaviour Scale from the Behaviorally-Referenced Rating System of Intermediate Social Skills - revised (Farrell et al 1985) enable coding of a range of verbal and nonverbal social interaction behaviours. The scales measure the degree of adaptation to social context, and are therefore sensitive to the loss of higher-level social judgment and awareness that frequently accompanies damage to the frontal lobes. These scales from the BRISS-R have previously been used in TBI research and studies have demonstrated acceptable levels of inter-rater correlation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults between 18 and 70 years

          -  A diagnosis of severe TBI (measured by post traumatic amnesia exceeding 24 hours or by
             other neurological evidence, such as surgery to reduce intracranial swelling, or other
             persisting neurological signs), or severe acquired brain injury with similar cognitive
             presentation to TBI (measured by a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 9 or other
             persisting neurological signs)

          -  Occurrence of injury at least six months prior to the study

          -  Evidence of a social communication impairment as a result of the injury

          -  Ability to tolerate group activity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Extensive cognitive impairment preventing active involvement in programmes of
             rehabilitation

          -  Insufficient English to converse with peers

          -  Significant aphasia (a disorder affecting both the understanding and use of language)
