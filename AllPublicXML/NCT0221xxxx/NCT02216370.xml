  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the significant risk factor of ischemic stroke with incidence
      about 20% of all ischemic strokes. The undiagnosed AF in cryptogenic stroke patients could be
      present but not revealed by rutinne ECG.

      The subcutaneous Insertable Cardiac Monitor - Reveal® XT ICM, which provides long-term
      monitoring ( for 3 years), in selected stroke and TIA population on the basis of age, stroke
      etiology, and prescreening for cardiac arrhythmias helps to increase a detection of AF to
      16.7% (range, 14.3% to 20.0%) in compare to ambulatory ECG detection of AF 6.4% (range, 5.3%
      to 9.0%). The AF detection after stroke and TIA strategically changes the therapeutic
      approach. In correlation with mentioned above the incidence of both specific genetic markers
      of AF and occurance of AF in this population and healthy volunteers are interesting.
