  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm, 1:1:1 randomized, placebo controlled, double- blinded trial in which at
      least 28 subjects will receive active Anti-Thymocyte Globulin and Granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (ATG-GCSF), at least 28 subjects will receive ATG alone and at
      least 28 subjects will receive placebo alone within 100 days from diagnosis of Type 1
      Diabetes (T1D).

      The primary objective of the study will be to determine the safety and ability of low dose
      ATG plus GCSF and low dose ATG alone to retain/enhance C-peptide production in new onset T1D
      patients demonstrating residual beta cell function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary statistical hypothesis to be assessed in the study is whether the 2 hour area
      under the curve (change in baseline to 12 months) in residual beta cell function (C-peptide)
      will differ between those treated with ATG and GCSF or ATG alone as compared with placebo.

      The study will also examine the effect of the proposed treatments on surrogate markers for
      immunologic and metabolic outcomes.

    <description>Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG)/Placebo: Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG) will be administered at a dose of 2.5mg/kg as two divided IV infusions of 0.5mg/kg and 2mg/kg. First dose (0.5mg/kg) will be infused over a minimum of 12 hours, and the second dose (2mg/kg) over a minimum of 8 hours. The second dose should be given no less than 12 and no more than 24 hours after the previous dose.
Placebo(for GCSF) treatment will begin 6 hours after completion of the ATG. Placebo will be given subcutaneously every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses</description>

    <description>Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) is supplied in 0.6 mL prefilled syringes for subcutaneous injection. Each syringe contains 6 mg GCSF (based on protein weight), in a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free solution (pH 4.0) containing acetate (0.35 mg), sorbitol (30.0 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.02 mg), and sodium (0.02 mg) in water for injection, U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP). The standard 6mg dose will be given with the exception of subjects who weigh less than 45 kg.
GCSF treatment will begin 6 hours after completion of the ATG / Placebo. GCSF will be given subcutaneously every 2 weeks for a total of 6 doses</description>
