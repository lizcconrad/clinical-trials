    <description>Two phase study of Recombinant full human Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) Monoclonal Antibody:
First phase: seven escalating single-dose groups : 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 mg/kg
Second phase: multiple-dose groups 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 mg/kg: weekly once for 4 doses; 5.0, 6.0 mg/kg: every two weeks for 2 doses; 4.0 mg/kg: weekly or every two weeks depends on the results of previous dose groups.</description>
