    <textblock>
      The VenaCure EVLT 400 µm Fiber Kit is currently marketed for the treatment of varicose veins.
      AngioDynamics, Inc., the company that manufacturers the VenaCure device, is sponsoring this
      study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the VenaCure EndoVenous Laser Treatment
      (EVLT) 400 µm Fiber Kit for treatment of incompetent perforator veins (IPVs). The VenaCure
      EVLT 400 µm Fiber Kit has not been previously studied by AngioDynamics for the ablation of
      IPVs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, prospective, multicenter, non-blinded clinical trial. Study data will
      be summarized and submitted to the FDA in a premarket notification once all treated subjects
      have completed the 3 month visit. Longer term followup is being performed for publication
      purposes.

      Patients diagnosed with incompetent Perforator Veins (IPV's) and meet all inclusion and none
      of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for this study.

    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is &quot;Acute Primary Ablation Success&quot; defined as complete lack of flow or IPV disappearance in the entire treated segment. Success will be measured via Duplex Ultrasound imaging performed 10 days (± 3 days) post procedure. Primary ablation success must be measured by a physician other than the physician that performed the study procedure.</description>
