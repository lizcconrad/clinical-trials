  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mammography is a systematic way in the main programs of screening for breast cancer in women
      over 40 or 50 years old, according to screening programs, but most research has shown a
      frequency of discomfort and pain during the examination mammography. This study is a
      randomized controlled trial, whose intervention will be a sequence of exercises body warming
      and muscle stretching, performed systematic manner and supervised by a physical educator. It
      is expected to find in this study a possible impact of physical exercise in reducing pain
      after mammography examination.

      This research aims to evaluate the relationship of pre-mammography guided physical activity
      and pain after the examination, evaluating the impact of the intervention in a group of
      patients undergoing upper limb exercise (SLE), compared to another group women not subject
      exposure (MNE), and another group with lower limb exercise (LLE). This study is a randomized
      controlled trial, whose intervention will be a sequence of exercises body warming and muscle
      stretching, performed systematic manner and supervised by a physical educator. It is expected
      to find in this study a possible impact of physical exercise in reducing pain after
      mammography examination. The results will be checked by study association between the level
      of physical activity, body mass index, breast density and reducing the pain effect between
      groups for comparison of means and variances of values of the visual analogue scale (VAS).

    <description>Following the randomization, approximately 10 minutes after performing a physical exercise in the upper limbs (Group 1) and lower (Group 2), or not performing any physical exercise (Group 0), the woman will be submitted to bilateral mammogram. Ten minutes after the procedure, the assessment of pain during mammography will be measured by the visual analog scale. The mean difference between the measurements of visual analog scale (VAS) will be compared between groups.</description>
