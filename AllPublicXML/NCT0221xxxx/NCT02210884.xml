  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Synthesis of vitamin D in the skin through the action of sunlight is a major source of
      vitamin D in parts of the world where foods are not fortified with the vitamin. Skin
      pigmentation (color), dress habits and season are some of the factors that limit sun exposure
      and affect vitamin D synthesis in the skin. Maternal vitamin D status is especially important
      to meet infant needs when newborns are not supplemented with vitamin D. In Ethiopia, vitamin
      D status of lactating women and infants and breast milk vitamin D concentration have never
      been assessed. The purpose of this study is to assess changes in maternal and infant markers
      of vitamin D status before and after vitamin D supplementation of the lactating mothers.

      Vitamin D is a vitamin that regulates calcium and phosphorous homeostasis and ensures proper
      mineralization of bone. Lactating women and infants are considered to be at risk of vitamin D
      deficiency due to increased needs for vitamin D and calcium. Stores of vitamin D acquired in
      utero and breast milk are the main sources of vitamin D for infants. Maternal vitamin D
      deficiency, exclusive breastfeeding, skin pigmentation and limited sun exposure are commonly
      seen in infants with rickets. However, the UV exposure, dress habits, traditional practices
      and other risk factors to vitamin D deficiency in Ethiopia have not been explored. This study
      aims to fill this research gap.
