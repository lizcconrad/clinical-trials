    <textblock>
      The shock wave is a new and potential intervention for the reinnervation of peripheral nerve.
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on
      carpal tunnel syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Recently, many studies show the potential effect of shock wave for the reinnervation for
      peripheral neuropathy in the animal mode. Only one study reveal the potential benefit of
      shock wave in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. Althouh its expressive finding, the
      number of cases is relatively too small to make a conclusive remark. Large and well-designed
      study would expand the new field.

    <description>The antidromic sensory nerve conduction velocityof the median nerve was performed on all subjects according to the protocol reported by the American Academy of Neurology with SierraWave, Cadwell (USA). The median nerve was stimulated at the wrist between the palmar longus and flexor carpal radialis tendon at a distance of approximately 14 cm from the active electrode.</description>

    <description>The finger pinch strength was measured using Jamar dynamometer (Fabrication Enterprises Inc., USA). The subject was seated with shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated with the elbow flexed at 90°. The forearm and wrist were positioned in a neutral position for the palmar pinch</description>

    <description>Shock waves are defined a sequence of acoustic pulse characterized by a high peak pressure (100 MPa), fast pressure rise (&lt; 10 ns) and short duration (10 μs). Different studies and clinical experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of shock waves in the treatment of musculoskeletal system such as chronic tendinopathies or hypertrophic pseudoarthrosis.</description>
