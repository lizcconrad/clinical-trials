  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pilot study investigating the effectiveness of a
      computerized response inhibition training program at reducing the response inhibition
      difficulties often seen in children with Williams syndrome ages 10-17. The investigators
      hypothesize that after completing the training program, children with Williams syndrome will
      show improvement on computerized measures of response inhibition and on parent measures of
      impulsivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral characteristics of individuals with Williams syndrome include eagerness to
      approach and interact with others (including strangers), repeated questions especially about
      upcoming events, and difficulties with attention, impulsivity, and inhibition. There is very
      little systematic research about the kinds of interventions that are most useful for children
      with Williams syndrome to support optimal psychosocial functioning, and of the effectiveness
      of such interventions. We will conduct a pilot study of a potential intervention to address
      the response inhibition difficulties associated with Williams syndrome. The investigators
      will examine the utility of an online, web-based computerized cognitive retraining program
      aimed at addressing impulsivity and inhibition difficulties in 20 children, ages 10-17, with
      WS. The engaging training program has shown some utility in other populations, including
      children with tic disorders and trichotillomania. The investigators will examine the
      acceptability and feasibility of the treatment approach, as well as its impact on performance
      on experimental measures of impulsivity and on everyday psychosocial functioning as rated by
      parents; this study will consist of a small-scale pilot Randomized Clinical Trial with wait
      list. Through this novel work, we hope to develop and tune this approach for optimal outcomes
      and to demonstrate the promise of this intervention to address common challenges of people
      with Williams syndrome in the area of inhibition.
