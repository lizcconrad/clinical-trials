  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and debilitating disorder known to have
      reported lifetime prevalence in the range of 2%. OCD is most commonly treated with Cognitive
      Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy. However, some studies suggest challenges
      with CBT in retaining gains long term, and while 60-80% of OCD patients respond to SRI
      treatment, partial symptom reduction is substantial. Investigations into the effectiveness of
      alternative, cost-effective treatment modalities are thus needed. Mindfulness, defined as
      paying attention in a particular way (on purpose, in the present moment and nonjudgmentally),
      promotes awareness and attention to internal experience and has been shown to reduce symptoms
      of anxiety and depression. A number of controlled studies have found Mindfulness-Based
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to be effective for depression, social anxiety disorder, and
      generalized anxiety disorder, but few have tested its effect on obsessive compulsive disorder
      (OCD). Moreover, those studies examining MBCT in OCD focused on clinical case studies and
      non-clinical samples. This study proposes to examine the effect of MBCT in clinical practice,
      in a randomized sample of patients with OCD whom are on a clinic wait list. As patients are
      allocated to the wait list, they will be randomly assigned to receive either 10 weeks of
      group MBCT or wait list as per usual. It is hypothesized that subjects randomly assigned to
      the MBCT treatment group, compared to those in the wait list control group, will see greater
      reductions in self-reported measures of OCD symptom severity and improvement in other
      measures of mindfulness, mood and level of functioning. The results of this pilot study, if
      successful, will provide evidence towards another route by which patients can improve their
      OCD while waiting for clinic services or consultation. Results will also lend more evidence
      as to whether MBCT is effective as a stand-alone treatment for clinical OCD, which will
      inform further investigations into the potential addition of mindfulness techniques to
      standard care.

    <description>MBCT teaches patients to become more aware of, and to relate differently to, their thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. Through MBCT, patients will learn skills that allow them to disengage from habitual (&quot;automatic&quot;) dysfunctional cognitive routines, such as obsessional thinking. As an example, patients are encouraged to relate to thoughts and feelings as passing events in the mind, rather than to identify with them or treat them as accurate representations of reality. The MBCT protocol for OCD patients is adapted from Segal et al.'s original MBCT manual for depression (Segal, Williams &amp; Teasdale, 2002).</description>
