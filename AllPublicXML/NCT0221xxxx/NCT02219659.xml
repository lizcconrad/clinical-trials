  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A three-arm, randomized, pilot feasibility, study to assess the effect three validated
      sedation strategies on outcomes of patient on mechanical ventilation.

      A significant proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) require
      mechanical ventilation (MV). To maintain comfort and facilitate quality care, large
      quantities of sedatives and analgesics are often administered either by continuous infusion,
      with or without daily interruption (DI) of sedation, or as intermittent doses of analgesics.
      Three validated sedation strategies are currently available. A recently published SLEAP trial
      has shown that instituting protocol-directed sedation in patients requiring continuous
      infusion of sedatives and analgesics, whether or not daily interruption (DI) of the sedative
      occurs, will improve MV outcomes, specifically the duration of MV. Girard et al performed a
      randomized, multicenter, clinical trial (ABC- Awakening and Breathing Controlled trial)
      evaluating the pairing of a spontaneous awakening trial (SAT) with an SBT. Most recently, a
      Danish study by Strøm et al. investigated whether an analgesia-first approach to patient
      comfort that consisted of intermittent doses of intravenous opioids, and the initiation of IV
      sedation for short periods only when acute agitation was present, would be superior to a
      protocol similar to the ABC trial. While the three above mentioned approaches are accepted
      and currently implemented in the critical care community there is no comparative study or
      evaluation on the optimal timing to conduct a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for assessing
      weaning readiness with each of these strategies. It is possible that a SAT strategy, where
      sedative and opioid infusions are interrupted, may lead to more agitation and anxiety than a
      strategy in patients managed with a sedation protocol where intravenous sedative and
      analgesic therapy is regularly titrated to maintain patients in a lightly sedated state.
      Moreover, it remains unclear whether there are advantages of an analgesia-first sedation
      strategy over either an SAT or sedation protocol strategy in terms of the time it takes to
      wean patients from MV. However, it is noteworthy to mention that the analgesia-first strategy
      was associated with more delirium episodes, which were attributed to the ability to assess
      for it in a more awake patient. However, comparing delirium occurrence in studies with
      different sedation goals and methodologies may be inaccurate.

      The investigators therefore propose a three-arm, randomized, pilot feasibility, study to
      assess the effect of these three (3) validated strategies for sedation and pain management

    <description>Continuous infusion of fentanyl and midazolam is started per protocol. Both drugs are titrated to target pain score (0 to 3) using Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and target sedation score (0 to -3) using Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). Every morning both drugs are stopped (Daily Interruption) and patient's wakefulness is assessed per protocol. If patient's pain and RASS score stays withint the target, both drugs are kept off. If patient shows any signs and symptoms of pain or agitation (described in the study protocol), both drugs are restarted at a half dose of the previous dose and titrated to target pain and RASS score. Every morning both drugs are stopped and when patient is awake and met the SBT safety screen, 120-min CPAP trial is performed.</description>

    <description>This arm attempts to manage patient's pain and agitation with anagesia first. Fentanyl IV pushes are administered every 5 minutes as needed to target pain and sedation score, up to 4 doses per hour. Every morning 120-min CPAP trial is performed as long as patient's RASS score is 0 to -2 and patient passes the SBT safety screen. If fentanyl IV push doses alone cannot manage patient's pain and agitation (could not reach the target score), notify the study team. Fentanyl infusion is started and titrated to target pain and sedation score up to 6 hours. If fentanyl infusion is titrated up twice consecutively and target pain and sedation score are not met, notify the study team. Propofol infusion is started and tritrated to target RASS score up to 6 hours.</description>

    <description>Continuous infusion of fentanyl and midazolam is started and titrated to target pain and RASS score: Fentanyl started at 25 mcg/hr titrated by 25 mcg/hr every 30 minutes to goal pain score; Midazolam started at 1 mg/hr titrated by 1 mg/hr every hour to goal RASS score for the study design duration (28 days) or for the duration of mechanical ventilation. Every morning both infusions are stopped and when the patient is awake and met the SBT safety screen, 120-min CPAP trial is performed. If the patient meets the CPAP passing criteria, arterial blood gas (ABG) is done and the patient is placed back to the previous ventilator setting. ABG result is notified to the physician for determination for extubation. If the patient does not pass the CPAP trial it is repeated next morning.</description>
