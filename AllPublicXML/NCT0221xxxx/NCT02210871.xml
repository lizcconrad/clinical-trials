  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the
      pharmacokinetics (the exposure of the trial drug in the body), safety and tolerability after
      a single injection of semaglutide in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic
      impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, age at least 18 years at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Body mass index (BMI) 18.5-40.0 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

          -  Only for subjects with hepatic impairment (mild, moderate and severe): A diagnosis of
             cirrhosis due to parenchymal liver disease, classified as Child-Pugh grade A,B or C as
             assessed by investigator and which is confirmed and documented by medical history,
             physical examination and at least one of the following: hepatic
             ultrasound,computerised axial tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
             and/or liver biopsy

          -  Only for subjects with normal hepatic function: Subjects who are judged to be in good
             general health based on physical examination, medical history, ECG, vital signs, and
             the results of biochemistry, coagulation, haematology tests and urinalysis performed
             during the screening visit, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant or is of
             child-bearing potential not using an adequate contraceptive method throughout the
             trial including the follow-up period (adequate contraceptive measures as required by
             local regulation or practice)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure above or equal to 180
             mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure above or equal to 100 mmHg). If white-coat
             hypertension is suspected at the screening visit a repeated measurement at the
             screening visit is allowed

          -  Mental inability, unwillingness or language barrier precluding adequate understanding
             of or compliance with trial procedures

          -  Donation of any blood or plasma in the past month or in excess of 400 mL within the 3
             months preceding screening, or surgery or trauma with more than 400 mL blood loss
             within the 3 months preceding screening
