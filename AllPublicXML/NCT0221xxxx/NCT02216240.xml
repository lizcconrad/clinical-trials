  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a term describing any rhythm coming from the top half
      of the heart. Although atrial fibrillation is the commonest cardiac arrhythmia, regular SVT's
      are also common. The two commonest regular SVT's are atrioventricular (nodal) reentry
      tachycardias (AV(N)RT) and atrial flutter (AFL). Atrioventricular (nodal) reentry
      tachycardias (AV(N)RT) are common but benign forms of fast heart rhythm. Although AV(N)RT can
      cause unpleasant symptoms and are frightening it is not dangerous. If patients present with
      AV(N)RT the accepted and normal treatment for most is to have the fast heart rhythm stopped
      by either taking a deep breath and straining or by the use of drugs. Patients can then be
      discharged home and have further investigation and treatment as an outpatient. SVT can be
      frightening for the patient but is easy to diagnose and treat. There is high success rate
      post treatment for this benign condition. This is traditionally done in the local accident
      and emergency, although patients can sometimes be unnecessarily admitted to hospital
      overnight. We propose to investigate the safety and efficacy of training paramedics to treat
      safe forms of AV(N)RT at the scene and then giving the patient an information pack which
      includes a request for a GP referral to a heart rhythm specialist. Patients will be randomly
      allocated after consenting to take part in the study to either get paramedic or accident and
      emergency department treatment. We will compare these two approaches by telephone follow up
      of the patients. The costs of the different approaches will be compared by assessing the rate
      of appropriate investigation and the information given to patients and how they rated their
      experiences.

    <description>Treatment at the scene by a paramedic. Valsalva manoeuvre with subsequent administration of 6mg and 12mg of adenosine unless the supraventricular tachycardia terminated. Patients were taken to accident and emergency if the tachycardia did not terminate, restarted, or the patient had continuing symptoms, a persistently abnormal ECG (other than T wave inversion) or was heamodynamically unstable. Prior to discharge from the ambulance patients received an information pack and a referral letter for their GP to refer them to an arrhythmia clinic.</description>
