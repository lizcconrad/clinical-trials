    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this observational cohort study is to examine the role of &quot;food
      reward&quot; in maternal diet and weight change during pregnancy and postpartum. The study will
      further examine the importance of food reward in the context of behavioral control and other
      related aspects of eating behavior, as well as weight-related biomedical, psychosocial and
      behavioral factors including genetics, physical activity, stress, sleep and depression. Four
      hundred and fifty women of varying baseline weight status will be enrolled early in pregnancy
      (before 12 weeks postpartum) and followed until 1 year postpartum. Assessments will occur at
      baseline (&lt;12 weeks postpartum), during pregnancy at 13-18 weeks gestation, 16-22 weeks, and
      28-32 weeks, and postpartum at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. Measures will
      include assessments of food reward and related constructs, dietary intake, other health
      behaviors, and anthropometrics. Clinical data and biological specimens will be obtained.
      Infant anthropometrics and feeding practices will also be assessed. Primary exposures include
      aspects of food reward and behavioral control, which will be assessed in multiple ways to
      maximize information and utility. Primary outcomes include gestational weight gain,
      postpartum weight retention and dietary quality.

        PEAS is a prospective observational study of N=450 women without evidence of psychiatric or
        eating disorders, recruited in early pregnancy (â‰¤12 weeks), targeting N=150 in each weight
        status group: normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obese (BMI &gt;=30).
        Women will be followed through pregnancy and until 1 year postpartum, along with their
        infants from birth to 1 year, with collection of blood, stool, and urine specimens,
        previous and current medical information, dietary intake and eating behaviors,
        anthropometrics, and demographic information.
