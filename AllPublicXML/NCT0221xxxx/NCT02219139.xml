      Immunologically evaluation of myeloperoxidase level as indicator for inflammatory reactions
      on modified surface abutments compared to machined surface abutments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One study abutment per patient will be placed. After healing for 6 to 7 weeks, patients will
      be asked to stop oral hygiene at the study site for 2 weeks.

      Sulcus fluid and plaque samples will be taken at the abutment site at several visits before
      and during abdication of oral hygiene.

      The study finishes with biopsy visit. Afterwards a regular abutment will be placed and the
      patients will be treated according to the standard protocol of the clinic to obtain their
      final restoration
