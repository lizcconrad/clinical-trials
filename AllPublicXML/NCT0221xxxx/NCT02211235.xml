  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines on the diagnoses and management of cystic fibrosis (CF) related diabetes
      recommend treatment for diabetes based on diagnostic criteria derived from adults with type 2
      diabetes. Increasing evidence supports treating early glucose abnormalities in cystic
      fibrosis patients to target CF specific outcomes, including lung function and nutrition
      (BMI-Body Mass Index). However, the criteria and timing of when to start insulin therapy in
      the `prediabetic' state are unclear. A more accurate characterization of blood sugar
      variability in youth with and without CF will help the investigators better interpret
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) findings in patients with CF prediabetes and diabetes and
      more accurately identify those individuals at greatest risk for disease progression.
