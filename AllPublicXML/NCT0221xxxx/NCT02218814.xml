      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients undergoing a Total Knee Arthroplasty
      who receive a single shot Adductor Canal nerve block and local infiltration will have
      improved functional outcomes compared to individuals who receive a femoral nerve block and
      local infiltration during the first 24 hours post surgery.

      Title: Prospective, Double-blind, Randomized Study to Evaluate a Single Shot Adductor Canal
      Nerve Block versus Femoral Nerve Block combined with LIA (Local Infiltration Analgesia):
      Early Postoperative Period Functional Outcomes after Total Knee Arthroplasty.

      Objectives:

      Primary: To determine if patients undergoing a Total Knee Arthroplasty who receive an
      Adductor Canal block will result in increased quadriceps muscle strength (MVIC) compared to
      those who receive a Femoral Nerve block at 24 hours.

      Secondary: The secondary objective is to determine whether Adductor Canal nerve block results
      in improved functional outcomes as evidenced by Time up and GO, Range of Motion and
      Six-Minute Walk Test at 24 hours, 48 hours and 6 months.

      To assess post-operative pain as measured by the Visual Analog pain score (VAS) immediately
      prior to the start of, during, and after each in-patient physical therapy session.

      Study Design: Prospective, double-blind, randomized study

      Description of Intervention: The devices to be used in this study are intended for nerve
      blocks and consist of 13-6 MHz linear ultrasound transducer (SonoSite HFL38x; Washington,
      US), a 22-gauge, 50-mm, short-bevel stimulating needle (Stimuplex; B Braun, Bethlehem,
      Pennsylvania), B/Braun Stimuplex DIG RC, Bupivacaine HCl 100 mg injected in the Adductor
      Canal or around the Femoral nerve.

      Femoral nerve block in combination with local infiltration analgesia is the standard of care
      in the investigators institution at present.

      Bupivacaine HCl 100 mg in combination with Toradol 30 mg are used for local infiltration of
      the anterior lateral and lateral posterior side of the knee, done by the surgeon using a
      standard technique.

      Subject Population:The study will include both male and female adults who will meet the
      inclusion criteria and none of exclusion criteria. For each patient time to conduct the
      blocks will vary between 5-10 minutes, local infiltration analgesia between 5-10 minutes,
      physical therapy tests between 30 minutes and one hour each encounter, VAS pain assessment
      between 2-5 minutes

      Subject Participation Duration:The rate of patient accrual, and the prescribed follow-up
      time, the total duration of this study is expected to be approximately 18 months where
      enrollment is expected to occur over 12 months with a follow-up period of 6 months in the
      physical therapy office visits.

      Number of Patients:The study will include 120 patients.

      Number of Sites: The study will include one site.

      Study Duration:The expected study duration is approximately 18 months.

      Endpoints: Endpoints of this study will include quadriceps muscle strength, ROM of the knee,
      TUG, 6 minute walk test, knee pain score (VAS), activities of daily living, adverse events
      and will be studied from the baseline up to 6 month after TKR. VAS pain score will be
      assessed at each physical therapy encounter.

    <measure>Knee range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 24 48 hours and 6 month after the nerve block performance</time_frame>
    <description>Knee range of motion is measured as a combined flexion/extension either actively or passively with assistance. Knee range of motion is typically measured in the supine position. The examiner will measure knee flexion passively using a goniometer. It has been validated as an outcome measure in total knee arthroplasty. To be able to navigate stairs 90 degrees of flexion is required. To adequately perform activities of daily living (ADL's), 110 degrees of flexion is required. The minimum detectable change in knee flexion for an individual is 9.6 degrees.</description>

    <measure>Time Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24, 48 hours and 6 month after the nerve block performance</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test records the time taken to stand up from a standard height arm chair, walk 3m, walk back to the chair, and sit down. It is meant to assess a patients balance and risk of falling. Assistive devices, for example, a walker, are allowed to be used if needed. This test has been validated as an early functional outcome after TKA. Maximum improvement occurs between the sixth and ninth postoperative weeks, with a plateau at 10 weeks. Freely independent patients are able to complete the task in 10 seconds, whereas a time greater than 30 seconds corresponds to patients being dependent in most activities. The minimum detectable change is 2.5 seconds.</description>

    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 6 month after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) records the maximum distance ambulated on level ground without physical assistance in six minutes with standardized encouragement. It has been validated for evaluation of functional outcome after TKA. Assistive devices are allowed if needed. The minimum distance that is required to perform ADL's is 300m. After TKA, increase in 6MWT distance typically follow pattern where maximal improvement occurs in the first 12 weeks postoperatively, specifically between weeks 6 and 9, followed by a slower improvement between weeks 12 and 26, reaching a plateau at 26 weeks. The minimum detectable change (MDC) for the 6MWT is reported to be 61.3m.</description>

    <description>Adductor Canal Nerve Block: The patient is placed in a supine position with the extremity to be blocked slightly externally rotated. On the medial thigh, at the midpoint between the inguinal crease and the medial condyle, 13-6-MHz linear ultrasound transducer (SonoSite HFL38x; Washington, US) is placed in a transverse orientation to visualize the femoral artery in short axis deep to the sartorius muscle. Sterile field and patient sedation achieved. A 21-gauge,100 mm, short-bevel needle (Stimuplex; B Braun) is inserted under ultrasound guidance in in-plane technique to position the needle tip anterolateral to the artery and just deep to the posterior fascia of the sartorius muscle. Once in position, 30 mL of Bupivacaine (100 mg) is deposited adjacent to the femoral artery and deep to the Sartorius muscle, using intermittent aspiration. After completion of the procedure, a sterile dressing is placed over the needle insertion site.</description>

    <description>Femoral Nerve Block. The procedure is conducted with the patient in a supine position with a 13-6 MHz linear ultrasound transducer (SonoSite HFL38x; Washington, US) applied to the skin at the level of the inguinal crease. The femoral artery, fascia iliac, and femoral nerve are visualized. Sterile field and patient sedation achieved. A 22-gauge, 50-mm, short-bevel stimulating needle (Stimuplex; B Braun, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania) connected to twitch monitor B/Braun Stimuplex DIG RC is inserted under ultrasound guidance using an in-plane technique from lateral to medial until a quadriceps motor response is elicited at a current between 0.5 and 0.2 mA with a pulse width of 0.1millisecond from a twitch monitor . After negative aspiration, 30 mL of Bupivacaine (100 mg) is deposited adjacent to the femoral nerve and deep to the fascia iliac, with intermittent aspiration. After completion of the procedure, a sterile dressing is placed over the needle insertion site.</description>
