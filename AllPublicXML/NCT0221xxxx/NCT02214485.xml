      Objective: To determine the differential effectiveness of integrated care (IC) and lower
      extremity strength training (LEST) among community-dwelling frail older adults in Taiwan.

      Method: The investigators randomize participants at Bei-Hu site from the &quot;Intervention study
      of Geriatric Frailty, Osteoporosis, and Depression in a Community Based Randomized Trial&quot;
      into 12 weeks of either IC or LEST. Outcome assessments are performed at baseline, 12 weeks
      and 6 months after initiation of the interventions.

      Interventions:

        1. IC: Participants visit the study site with health education, social activities, warm up,
           stretch, and low intensity resistance exercise for about 1 hour per week. If any medical
           problems or functional decline suspected during the visit, the case manager refers
           participants to their primary care physicians for further managements.

        2. LEST: Participants receive 2 sessions of 30-minute lower extremity strength straining
           using isotonic strength training machines each week. The intensity is set at 60-80% of 1
           repetition maximum (RM). Evaluation of the exercise protocol are repeated every 2 weeks
           for individualized adjustments

    <description>Leg extension power is to be measured at baseline, 12 weeks (after completion of intervention), and 6 months (after completion of the study). Specifically, following warm-up of three submaximal isotonic contractions, each subject was asked to extend his knee through a range of motions from -80 to -10 degrees of knee extension (0° extension being full knee extension without hyperextension) at an initial resistance equal to 25 percent of the subject's body weight. Knee range of motion was determined goniometrically. Following the successful completion of one full repetition, additional resistance of 1 kg, or a multiple thereof, was added. The repetition was repeated until the subject was no longer able to complete one full repetition. The number is the measured leg extension power</description>
