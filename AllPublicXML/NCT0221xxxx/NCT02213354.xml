  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, partially-blinded, controlled trial in 360 (up to 600) males
      and females, 65 years of age and older, who are in good health and meet all eligibility
      criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and
      immunogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufactured by
      Sanofi Pasteur administered intramuscularly at different intervals and dosages (3.75, 7.5, or
      15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) given with MF59 adjuvant manufactured by Novartis Vaccines and
      Diagnostics. Subjects will receive three doses of the vaccine. Safety, reactogenicity, and
      immunogenicity data will be collected at standard time points with safety follow-up to
      continue through one year post dose 2. Study Duration is approximately 30 months and Subject
      Participation is approximately 18 months. The primary objectives are to (1) assess the safety
      and reactogenicity of different dosages (3.75, 7.5, and 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) of an

      This is a Phase II randomized, partially-blinded, controlled trial in males and females, 65
      years of age and older, who are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This
      clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a
      monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine, derived from the influenza
      A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur administered intramuscularly at
      different intervals and dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) given with MF59
      adjuvant manufactured by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics. Subjects will be assigned
      randomly to 1 of 6 groups (60 to 100 subjects per group) to receive three doses
      intramuscularly of the inactivated A/H7N9 vaccine at dosages (3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg of HA/0.5
      mL dose) given with MF59 adjuvant using two different study vaccination schedules. The first
      and third study vaccinations will be administered to all subjects on Day 1 and approximately
      Day 169. The second study vaccination will be administered either on approximately Day 29 for
      Groups 1, 3, and 5 or approximately Day 57 for Groups 2, 4, and 6. Reactogenicity will be
      measured from the time of each study vaccination through 8 days after each study vaccination
      by the occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic reactions. Unsolicited non-serious
      adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the time of each study vaccination through
      approximately 28 days after each study vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and
      new-onset chronic medical conditions will be collected from the time of the first study
      vaccination through approximately 12 months after the last study vaccination.

      Immunogenicity testing will include performing hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and
      neutralizing (Neut) antibody assays on serum obtained immediately prior to the first study
      vaccination (Day 1), approximately 28 days after the second study vaccination (approximately
      Day 57 for Groups 1, 3, and 5; approximately Day 85 for Groups 2, 4, and 6), immediately
      prior to the third study vaccination (approximately Day 169), and approximately 28 days after
      the third study vaccination (approximately Day 197). Subjects in Groups 1, 3, and 5 will also
      have immunogenicity testing for HAI and Neut antibody assays performed on serum obtained at
      approximately 56 days after the second study vaccination (approximately Day 85). Between 360
      and 600 subjects will be enrolled in this trial. Study Duration is approximately 30 months
      and Subject Participation is approximately 18 months. The primary objectives are to (1)
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of different dosages (3.75, 7.5, and 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL
      dose) of an MF59-adjuvanted, monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine using two
      different study vaccination schedules and (2) assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition
      (HAI) antibody responses to different dosages (3.75, 7.5, and 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) of an
      MF59-adjuvanted, monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine using two different
      study vaccination schedules following receipt of the second study vaccination. The secondary
      obectives are to (1) assess study vaccine-related unsolicited non-serious adverse events
      following receipt of different dosages (3.75, 7.5, and 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) of an
      MF59-adjuvanted, monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine using two different
      study vaccination schedules, (2) assess new-onset chronic medical conditions following
      receipt of different dosages (3.75, 7.5, and 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) of an MF59-adjuvanted,
      monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine using two different study vaccination

          3. Are males or females, 65 years of age and older.

          4. Are in good health1. 1As determined by medical history and targeted physical
             examination, if indicated based on medical history, to evaluate acute or currently
             ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions that would affect the assessment of
             eligibility and safety of subjects. Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions being
             actively managed must be within acceptable limits in the last 180 days. Good health in
             the elderly is also defined as no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or
             frequency of medication in the 90 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change
             that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is
             done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be
             considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription
             medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site
             principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a
             deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)
             medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of
             reactogenicity and immunogenicity and does not indicate a worsening of medical
             diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and
             first study vaccination are acceptable provided the subject is asymptomatic, condition
             stable, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the
             evaluation of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled
             medications (with the exception of steroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion
             Criteria (see Section 5.2)), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted

          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees F.

          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mm Hg, inclusive

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Have an acute illness2, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
        sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.

        2An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining is
        allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate
        sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess
        safety parameters as required by the protocol.

        2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
        investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study
        participation3.

        3Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting 3 months
        (defined as 90 days) or longer, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of
        injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may
        interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this
        study.

        3. Reside in a nursing home4 or other skilled nursing facility or have a requirement for
        skilled nursing care.
