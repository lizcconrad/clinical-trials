  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: With new challenges for healthcare, there is a clear consensus among experts on
      the need to introduce changes in the organization of care in health centres to address the
      problems of over-attendance, bureaucratization and other emerging issues that require growing
      amounts of attention. However, there has been insufficient research into possible models and
      the impact of their adoption.

      The objective is to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the TRIAP intervention, a new
      organizational model based on triage and healthcare mini-teams (two general
      practitioners/pediatricians, two nurses and one member of the administrative staff) compared
      to the current model, aiming to achieve a correct classification of the healthcare needs of
      the primary care population and direct them to the most suitable professional.

      In addition, the implementation research objective is to identify the facilitators for and
      barriers to the implementation of the intervention in the context of primary care.

      Methods/ design: This is a quasi-experimental controlled clinical trial to be performed in 14
      healthcare mini-teams (7 intervention and 7 control groups) from 8 health centres in the
      Basque Healthcare Service (Osakidetza) Interior Health Region.

      The results will be assessed using the data on morbidity-adjusted attendance of users to
      their family doctor, number of referral, addition of new activities to the portfolio of
      services, and patient perception and professional satisfaction. All the variables will be
      measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention, 24 months later.

      Using covariance analysis models, the investigators will estimate the effect attributable to
      the intervention by analyzing differences in changes between the two groups, and calculating
      the 95% confidence interval, adjusting the comparisons for baseline values. The investigators
      will also adjust for potential confounding and effect-modifying variables.

      Nominal groups will be held at the end of the intervention with the participation of all the
      agents involved in intervention centres to identify the facilitators for and barriers to the
      implementation of the intervention.

      Discussion: There is a need to develop new forms of organization in primary care services to
      respond to new healthcare demands. To pursue this aim, changes have to be introduced in the
      organization of healthcare within health centres, redefining the roles of primary care
      professionals and refocusing their activity towards population health needs, seeking greater
      efficiency in health services.

    <description>Number of visits of the patients to their GP and paediatricians in accordance to the Adjusted Clinical Groups [ACG] Case-Mix System.
The patients will be classified using the ACG system, on the basis of their age, sex and ICD-9-CM codes of health problems diagnosed over a year in visits to their GP/paediatrician. The ACG case-mix system was designed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, originally for care on an outpatient basis, and classifies the population into around 100 self-excluding categories.
Regardless of the number of contacts with the healthcare services, each person is classified every year into a single ACG depending on their age, sex, and combination of diagnoses they were assigned over the previous 12 months. For this study, we will use the ACG Assignment Software version 7.00.
All the tasks performed will be recorded in the Osabide computer system of the Basque Health Service.</description>

They will carry out activities focused on health promotion, self-management and de-medicalisation during visits from patients with mild self-limiting illnesses as well as appointments for chronic diseases in adults.
GP:
They will develop the new portfolio of services: health promotion, joint review of patient medical records by doctors and nurses to improve the management of certain groups of patients, and organization of minor surgery services, etc.</description>
