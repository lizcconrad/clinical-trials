  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SLC-0111 is a selective, small molecule, inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase (CA) IX and is in
      development for the treatment of solid tumours over-expressing CA IX. CAIX, a transmembrane
      metalloenzyme, is overexpressed on extracellular surfaces of hypoxic tumour cells but its
      expression is highly restricted in normal tissue. CAIX is a functional regulator of processes
      critical for tumour growth and metastasis, including pH regulation, survival, migration and
      invasion.

      This prospective single arm study will evaluate the safety of SLC-0111 given once daily in 28
      day cycles in subjects with advanced solid tumours. The intent of this research study is to
      find our more information such as: the highest dose of SLC-0111 that can be given safely, the
      side effect it may cause, to examine how the body affects the study drug concentration in the
      blood (pharmacokinetics or PK), and to gain some information on its effectiveness in treating
      cancer.

                  therapy, and prior radiotherapy).

               -  At least 4 weeks or five times the elimination half-life (whichever is shortest)
                  of any investigational drug/biologic or combination product prior to first dose
                  of study treatment.

               -  At least 3 months since prior interferon therapy.

               -  At least 4 weeks since any major surgery
