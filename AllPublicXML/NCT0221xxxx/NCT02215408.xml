      The study tested whether a pharmacist-run cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) at the
      University of Iowa can increase use of national standards of care in clinics
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project conducted a multicenter, cluster-randomized study utilizing a centralized CVRS
      for medical offices with large geographic, racial and ethnic diversity to determine the
      extent to which the CVRS model will be implemented. Twenty primary care offices were
      randomized to either the CVRS arm or a usual care arm, and 18 continued in the study. Each
      clinic enrolled 20-30 patients per office for a total of 402 subjects, of which 186
      represented racial minorities.

      Subjects in the intervention arm clinic had regular contact by phone, email or text with a
      CVRS clinical pharmacist housed at the University of Iowa. The pharmacist communicated with
      the subject, with the site clinical pharmacist and, as needed, with the site provider to
      optimize both the subject's pharmaceutical regimen and lifestyle behaviors. The CVRS
      intervention lasted for 12 months.

      A complex algorithm was used to calculate the degree to which the subject's care and medical
      regimen follows national guidelines for reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular risk.

      Post-intervention telephone interviews are being conducted with 20 intervention subjects in
      order to assess their experience with the intervention and barriers and facilitators to the
      intervention.
