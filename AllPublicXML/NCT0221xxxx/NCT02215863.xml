  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent reviews have highlighted the unpredictability and complexity of immune interference
      when multivalent conjugate vaccines are co-administered with other pediatric vaccines. It has
      become evident that the likelihood of immune interference (in response to conjugated- or
      co-administered antigens) increases in proportional to the number of glyco-conjugates
      (valencies) and dosages of carrier proteins. There are many kinds of carrier proteins:
      tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid (DT), CRM197 (non-toxic variant of DT), OMP (complex
      outer-membrane protein mixture from Neisseria meningitidis) and non-typeable Hemophilus
      influenza-derived protein D. Among them, TT is a more potent inducer of T-helper immunity,
      but carrier-induced-epitopic suppression (dose-dependent carrier antibody and carrier B cell
      dominance) may occur with TT. In comparison, DT and CRM197 are weaker B-cell immunogens, but
      apparently trigger more T-regulatory mechanism. Recent pediatric studies of PCV13
      co-administered with DTaP vaccines showed 6B GMT (geometric mean titer) to be somewhat
      reduced compared to the results with PCV13 alone.

      Similar to children, adults frequently visit outpatient clinics to get two or more kinds of
      vaccines at the same time: pneumococcal vaccine, influenza vaccine, Td (diphtheria and
      tetanus) vaccine, HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine, meningococcal vaccine, zoster vaccine,
      etc. PCV13 has limited co-administration information for adjuvanted influenza vaccine.

      This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 and MF59-adjuvanted
      influenza vaccine (Fluad) after concomitant administration in adults aged 60 years or older.

      This study is a multi-centered, randomized controlled clinical trial: Korea University Guro
      Hospital, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Hallym University Gangnam Sacred Hospital and
      Catholic University Medical College, St. Vincent's Hospital.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of Fluad after concomitant
      administration of Fluad and PCV13 in adults aged 60 years or more. This study is designed to
      demonstrate non-inferiority of sero-conversion rate after Fluad vaccination: Fluad-PCV13
      co-administration group versus Fluad alone group

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of PCV13 after concomitant
      administration in adults aged 60 years or more. This study is designed to demonstrate
      non-inferiority of PCV13 when co-administered with Fluad compared with PCV13 alone.

      This study is also designed to evaluate the safety of concomitant PCV13-Fluad administration
      in adults aged 60 years or more. All the participants will be followed for the duration of an
      expected average of 4 weeks after vaccination.
