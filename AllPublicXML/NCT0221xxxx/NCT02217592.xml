    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to identify the aetiology and factors associated with outcome
      of community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in Northeast Thailand.

      Potential study participants will be adult patients who are presented at the hospital with
      community-acquired sepsis. Clinical specimens (including blood, urine, sputum and throat
      swabs) will be collected from each participant on admission for culture, PCR and serological
      tests, and other laboratory tests, including inflammatory markers and genotyping.
      Participants' treatment will be closely monitored during the duration of their hospital stay.
      Blood will be again collected at 72 hours after admission. Participants will be contacted at
      28 days after admission to determine clinical outcome by phone interview with standardized
      script.

      There will be a total of 5,020 patients enrolled in this study over 3 years.

      Primary objective: To determine the causes of community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in
      NE Thailand.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To define the clinical outcome of community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in NE
           Thailand.

        2. To determine factors associated with inflammatory response, organ failure, and mortality
           in community-acquired sepsis and severe sepsis in NE Thailand, including causes of
           sepsis, sepsis resuscitation, antimicrobial treatment and genetic factors.

        3. To evaluate diagnostic tests for infection in community-acquired sepsis and severe
           sepsis in NE Thailand.

          -  Documented by attending physician that an infection is the primary cause of illness

             (bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites)

          -  Presence of any 3 of the following Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)

               -  Fever or hypothermia (Core body temperature defined as &gt; 38.3 C or &lt; 36.0 C)

               -  Tachypnea (respiratory rate &gt; 20 per minute)

               -  Arterial hypotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 90 mmHg, mean arterial
                  pressure (MAP) &lt; 70 mmHg, or SBP decrease &gt; 40 mmHg)

             primary/referring hospital

          -  Prior to this current episode, the patient was admitted to any hospital within the
             last 30 days

          -  Prior to enrolment, it is documented by the attending physician that hospital acquired
             infection is associated with the cause of sepsis or severe sepsis

        Please note that the following conditions are not exclusion criteria, and patients with the
        following conditions can be enrolled into the study

          -  Confirmed diagnosis by any method of an infection as a major cause of illnesses
             leading to hospitalization. For example, a patient who already has had a definite
             diagnosis of malarial infection by blood smear

          -  Clinical diagnosis of any specific disease or any specific syndromes such as acute
             infective diarrhea, acute pneumonia, acute encephalomyelitis and acute myocarditis

          -  Suspected of having both infectious and non-infectious diseases and infectious disease
             is a primary cause of illnesses (primary diagnosis) leading to the hospitalization.
             For example, acute pneumonia with stroke as an underlying disease, etc

          -  Patients who are admitted to other hospitals and referred to the study site. For
             example a referred patient who admit to the first hospital less than 48 hours prior to
             enrollment

          -  Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria without having result of complete blood
             count or result of all parameters in the inclusion criteria. For example, a patient
             who has hypothermia, tachycardia and tachypnea completes the criteria of SIRS even
             without the result of complete blood count or the result of other parameters such as
             INR, or plasma procalcitonin
