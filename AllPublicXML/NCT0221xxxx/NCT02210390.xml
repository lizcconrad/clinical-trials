      The purpose of the study is to test Feasibility RCT of the efficacy of a culturally adapted
      psychological intervention for Bipolar disorder in Pakistan

      Primary Objectives :

        1. To determine effectiveness of educational intervention in terms of patient Satisfaction
           with overall care, knowledge and attitudes to bipolar disorder and medication adherence.

        2. To assess feasibility in terms of

             -  Recruitment

             -  Using instruments that will be used to assess recurrence rate in the main study
                (BDI, YMRS and obtaining prospective hospitalisation and medication data)

             -  acceptability of a culturally adapted bipolar group education package

        3. To allow 'fine tuning' of culturally adapted bipolar group education package (this will
           partly be achieved by using the SEMI at study entry)

      The Participants will be recruited from psychiatric department of different hospitals.

      They will be randomly divided into two groups; intervention group and treatment-as-usual
      group. A total of thirty six participants will be recruited in the pilot study and divided
      equally into two arms. This will ensure that, even after loss to follow-up, we will have at
      least 12 subjects per group for analysis (FDA guidance
      http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/5356fnl.pdf) .Randomization will be carried out by the on
      offsite statistician. This will provide a reliable geographically remote service. For
      intervention group twelve sessions of psychoeducation will be provided by trained research
      clinician during the period of three months. Patients in the treatment as usual (TAU) group
      will be given details of intervention at the end of the study and interested patients will be
      offered psychoeducation.
