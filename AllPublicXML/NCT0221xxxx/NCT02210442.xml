      A multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness of a teaching strategy based on the
      incorporation of educational games with simulated settings versus usual practice based on
      diffusion for the implementation of clinical practice guidelines in Family Medicine Residency
      Program. The impact of the new strategy will be measured in improving knowledge and skill
      acquisition in clinical decision making of Family Medicine Residency Program after 6 months.
      Effectiveness will also be measured a month and 12 months after intervention.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of educational games to implementation practice
      guidelines to acquire skills in clinical decision-making by family medicine residents in
      Spain.

      Secondary objectives: To describe the strategies utilized in Residency Program in Family
      Medicine in Spain to teach the use of practice guidelines. To identify barriers and
      facilitators for the use of practice guidelines for family medicine residents.

      Setting: Unit Family Medicine in Spain. Study design: Multicentric cluster randomised
      controlled clinical trial. Population: Family Medicine Residents of second and third year.
      Sample size: 394 residents (197 in each arm). The randomization units will be units
      (clusters). The units of analysis are professionals (residents). Variables: Main outcome
      variable measured in both groups: assess of skill levels and number of correct answers about
      clinical questions in diabetes, anxiety disorders, antibiotic prescription and insomnia
      clinical practice guidelines in primary care.

      Sociodemographic variables and educational variables for each subject and variables regarding
      Residency Program in Family Medicine.

      Intervention: EDUCAGUIA plan. Incorporating educational games online for each guideline.

      Statistical Analysis: Primary and secondary effectiveness. Adjusting by contextual and
      individual variables factors with mixed effects models (lineal regression) (dependent
      variable: points obtained in educational games in each guide).
