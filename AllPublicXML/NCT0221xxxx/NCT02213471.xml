  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective communication between physician and patient is fundamental to effective care. The
      recent introduction of electronic patient on-line portals has the potential to change the
      communication landscape. The investigators surveyed patients to assess their preferred
      modality for biopsy notification at 3 institutions with differing patient access to on-line
      portals, to ascertain what patient preferences are currently and if it has changed from
      historical preferences. Our hypothesis is that as patients become more familiar with ln-line
      portals, their preferences will likely reflect familiarity with this modality.
