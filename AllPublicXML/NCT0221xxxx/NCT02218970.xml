  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical health does not have a high priority in today's treatment of patients with substance
      use disorder (SUD). SUD patients have a poor physical health not only due to injuries related
      to the substance abuse, but also because of the addiction-related lifestyle. There are few
      studies today that provide information about SUD patient's physical health, and especially
      there is little information about their muscular strength. One of the project's aims is to
      measure muscular strength in SUD patients who are being treated for their addiction, and see
      if they have decreased neuromuscular function. If so, we will investigate the effect of
      maximal strength training on neuromuscular function in these patients.
