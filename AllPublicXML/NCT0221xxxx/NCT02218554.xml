      To evaluate the performance of the Micromedic BRONJ Risk Assessment in vitro assay (the
      &quot;BRONJ Assay&quot;) in identifying Multiple Myeloma (MM) and/or other cancer subjects at risk for
      developing Bisphosphonate-related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (BRONJ) following intravenous (IV)
      administration of Bisphosphonates (BP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Micromedic BRONJ Assay is intended for the qualitative analysis of genetic changes which
      may be indicative of increased risk to develop BRONJ osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) following
      IV administration of drugs of the Bisphosphonate family.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria Study Group (all of the following):

          1. Subject is ≥18 years old

          2. Subject is or was a Multiple Myeloma and/or other cancer patient who is or has been IV
             treated with the BP zoledronic acid and/or pamidronate disodium; Or; Subject is or was
             a Multiple Myeloma and/or other cancer patient who is or has been IV treated with the
             BP zoledronic acid and/or pamidronate disodium and was also treated by oral BP such as
             sodium alendronate, and in the opinion of the PI, IV treatment was significant enough
             to be considered as the cause for BRONJ

          3. Subject has been diagnosed with BRONJ at stages 1 or 2 or 3 according to AAOMS
             (American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons)

          4. Subject has signed the informed consent or consent can be waived

        Inclusion Criteria Control Group (all of the following):

          1. Subject is ≥18 years old

          2. Subject is or was a Multiple Myeloma and/or other cancer patient who is, or has been
             IV treated with the BP zoledronic acid and/or pamidronate disodium for at least two
             (2) years (continuously or cumulatively)

          3. Subject has not developed any signs or symptoms of BRONJ

          4. Subject has signed the informed consent or consent can be waived

        Exclusion Criteria:

             exceeding 35 Gy

          2. Pregnant or lactating women

          3. Subject has been treated with either bevacizumab or sunitimib

          4. Subject has been treated with Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
             (HSCT)
