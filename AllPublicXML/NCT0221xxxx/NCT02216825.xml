      Background: In recent years, probiotics have shown promise in treating a variety of diseases.
      Previously, the investigators have reported on the clinical efficacy of bile salt hydrolase
      active Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242 in improving the lipid profile in
      hypercholesterolemic adults.

      Objective: The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of a delayed release or
      standard vegetarian capsule containing L. reuteri NCIMB 30242, taken in escalated dose over a
      4 week period, on the plasma bile acid profile.

      Design: The study design is a pilot, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study. The
      study will last a total of 6 weeks, including a 4-week intervention period and a 2-week
      washout period.
