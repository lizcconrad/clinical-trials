  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study was to determine if patients undergoing radiofrequency neurotomy (RFN)
      of lumbar facet joints that are adjacent to previously placed pedicle screws from a fusion,
      would lead to an increase in the temperature of the pedicle screws.

    <textblock>
      This study was a prospective clinical trial, examining outcomes related to temperature
      increases in pedicle screws. It was not possible to blind the investigators or the patient.
      Outcomes related temperature differences were collected at each pedicle screw adjacent to a
      zygapophyseal joint being treated.

      A conventional 18-gauge, 1-cm curved active tip radiofrequency cannula was placed under
      fluoroscopic guidance to the area to be treated (the junction of the transverse process and
      the superior articulating process of the facet joint). This position placed the tip of the
      radiofrequency cannula immediately adjacent to, but not in direct contact with, the pedicle
      screws. The radiofrequency cannula was connected to a radiofrequency generator, and the
      conventional settings for clinical medial branch neurotomy was used, heating the tissue to
      80Â°C for 90 seconds. The procedure described up to this point is the normal procedure and
      protocol for RFN performed at the Mayo Clinic.

      The experimental portion of the procedure is as follows: A separate 22 gauge radiofrequency
      cannula was intentionally placed in direct contact with the dorsal surface of the pedicle
      screws and was connected to a radiofrequency generator solely for the purpose of measuring
      temperature, as the RF cannula are dual purpose probes capable of both conducting energy for
      the radiofrequency lesion and monitoring tissue temperature. In other words, this small gauge
      needle was placed for the sole purpose of acting as a thermistor probe/temperature monitor.
      This process was repeated for each level necessary for treatment.
