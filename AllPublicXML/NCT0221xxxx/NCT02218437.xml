  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) is a non Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) in adult bone marrow and
      takes part in the bone marrow microenvironment. The response rate of early treatment on
      Children's SAA application combined with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (40-50 days after ATG
      treatment) is associated with long-term effect. The injection of Umbilical Cord Derived
      Mesenchymal Stem Cells combined with ATG improves the efficacy of children with SAA.

      1. Mesenchymal Stem Cells were prepared by in vitro separation, screening, and culture from
           healthy human umbilical cord tissue; The &quot; injection of mesenchymal stem cells
           (umbilical) manufacturing and verification regulation &quot; was also formulated.

        2. The starting dose of Umbilical Cord Derived MSC was 0.5-1.0 * 106 cells /kg, based on
           the previous human studies; And the maximum tolerated dose was 1 * 107 cells /kg

        3. The response and complete remission rate, relapse rate of the injection of Umbilical
           Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (or combined with ATG ) for Child with SAA were
           determined.

    <description>Complete response (CR) was defined as achieving normal levels of hemoglobin adjusted for age, platelet count &gt;100*109/L, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1.5*1.0 9/L. Partial response (PR) was defined as injection independence, reticulocyte count&gt;30*109/L, platelet count &gt;20*109/L, and ANC&gt;0.5*1.0 9/L above the baseline. Persistence of injection requirement or death was evidence of no response (NR).</description>
