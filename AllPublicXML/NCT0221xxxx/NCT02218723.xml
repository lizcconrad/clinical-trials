  <brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Profile of Four Formulations of Fluticasone Furoate (FF) Using Unit Dose Dry Powder Inhaler (UD-DPI) Compared With FF ELLIPTAÂ® Presentation</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, five- period, cross-over, randomized, single dose, single centre study
      in healthy subjects. This is the second clinical study for the UD-DPI. This study will
      ascertain whether the Pharmacokinetics (PK) systemic exposure [in terms of area under the
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)] of FF
      delivered via the UD-DPI is comparable to the systemic exposure of FF delivered via the
      ELLIPTA Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI). For this reason four treatment doses consisting of three
      dose strengths and 2 percentage blends will be assessed when delivered via the UD-DPI. This
      study is designed to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of various doses and blends of FF
      administered via UD-DPI and relative to FF administered via ELLIPTA DPI. Subjects will be
      screened 28 days prior to study initiation. During each treatment period, subjects will be at
      study site from evening prior to dosing until completion of the 48 hour post-dose PK sample
      collection on Day 3. Minimum 7 days washout will be between treatments after completion of
      all five treatments and the follow-up visit will be conducted 7-14 days post last dose.
      Duration of study is 13 weeks. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the GSK group of
      companies.

             review medication on a case by case basis to determine if its use would compromise
             subject safety or interfere with the study procedures or data interpretation

             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  The subject has taken systemic, oral or depot corticosteroids less than 12 weeks
             before the screening visit.

          -  The subject has taken inhaled, intranasal or topical steroids less than 4 weeks before
             the screening visit.

          -  DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER CRITERIA

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment. . For
             potent immunosuppressive agents, subjects with presence of hepatitis B core antibody
             (HBcAb) should also be excluded.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 millilitre (mL) within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  The subject has a history of breathing problems in adult life (e.g. history of
             asthmatic symptomatology). Screening lung function tests will be performed to confirm
             normal lung function parameters Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) &gt;=85%
             predicted and FEV1/ Forced Vital capacity (FVC) ratio &gt;=0.7).

          -  Subjects who have suffered a lower respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of the
             screening visit
