    <textblock>
      PROACTIVE randomized study to evaluate the impact of a multidimensional geriatric
      intervention on treatment compliance, measured regularly by blood dosing of drug metabolites.

      Patients in the intervention group will be proposed:

        -  A regular geriatric follow up including an attentive screening of joint symptoms and
           functionality,

        -  An adapted treatment of join pain,

        -  Weekly sessions of adapted physical activity (Taï Chi),

        -  And a systematic correction of vitamin D deficits.

    <description>Patients have 3-monthly geriatric follow-up with biological tests, anti-aromatase agents blood dosing and a clinical assessment (M3 to M9, M15 to M22 and M27 to M33). Musculoskeletal adverse events and quality of life level will be reported and analgesic treatment adapted. Patients will be proposed weekly Taï-Chi exercises to improve joint flexibility, muscular tonus and balance and reduce fall risk.
A broader geriatric assessment including functionality, gait analysis and nutrition will be performed each year (M12, M24 and M36).</description>
