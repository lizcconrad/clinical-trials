  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to assess whether angiotensin blockers (ARBs) and
      telmisartan in particular, are associated with an increased overall risk of the four most
      common cancers, namely, lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. A secondary objective
      was to explore these effects separately for each of the four cancers and in combination with
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACEIs).
