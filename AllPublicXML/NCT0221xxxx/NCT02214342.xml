    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate an innovative virtual reality-based balance
      training intervention for improving clinically relevant motor performances (balance and gait)
      in people with mild cognitive impairment.

      The investigators hypothesize that the virtual reality-based balance training intervention
      will improve balance and gait performances in people with mild cognitive impairment compared
      to a control group receiving usual care only.
