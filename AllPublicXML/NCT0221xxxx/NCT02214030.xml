  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a locally designed Assiut
      Femoral Compression Device (AFCD) versus manual compression (MC). Femoral compression devices
      have been developed thorough the past decades without being strongly implemented in the
      catheterization laboratory. Their limited adoption reflects concerns of high cost and
      conflicting data regarding their safety

    <textblock>
      The intra-arterial sheaths were removed 6 hours after PCI in the MC group according to the
      standard local protocols. However for AFCD group, the sheaths were removed 2 hours after PCI
      instead of conventional 6 hours. To standardize compression times, AFCD were applied to
      patient and complete femoral artery compression were applied for 5 minutes, followed by a
      gradual release of pressure till distal pulse is palpated. Each patient received a minimum of
      13 minutes of compression, with further compression applied only if full hemostasis had not
      been achieved at that point with maximum of 30 minutes.

    <measure>Time-To-Ambulation (TTA), measured in hours</measure>
    <time_frame>TTA was measured from the time the introducer sheath was removed (2 hr in AFCD group and 6 hours in MC group after end of PCI) to time of ambulation</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulation was defined as patient standing and walking at least 6 meters (20 feet) without re-bleeding or significant oozing requiring manual compression</description>

    <time_frame>24 post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>major adverse event (MAE) was defined as symptomatic bleeding associated with hemoglobin drop â‰¥5 g/dL requiring blood transfusion, fatal bleeding that directly results in death, a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula, distal arterial embolism, infections requiring administration of IV antibiotics or debridement, and the need for vascular surgery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device success:</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes during application</time_frame>
    <description>This was defined as easy application of the device with good fixation and stability and achieving final hemostasis. Device Stability was defined as absence of tilt and/or mobility after application of the device on top of the patient groin. Assessment of the device application was performed using a questionnaire with a scale of three grades; &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Difficult&quot; and &quot;Requires Improvement&quot;. Assessment of stability and fixation of the device was performed on a scale defined as &quot;Very Good&quot;, &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Procedure success</measure>
    <time_frame>24 h post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>This was defined as hemostasis achieved by the assigned method, without the occurrence of a closure-related major adverse event (MAE).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Time-To-Hemostasis (TTH), measured in minutes.</measure>
    <time_frame>TTH was measured from the time the introducer sheath was removed (2 hr in AFCD group and 6 hours in MC group after end of PCI) to the time hemostasis was achieved</time_frame>
    <description>Hemostasis was defined as no or minimal subcutaneous oozing and the absence of expanding or developing hematoma</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Minor complications:</measure>
    <time_frame>24h post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Any oozing (leakage of blood from the puncture site requiring digital pressure), ecchymosis (bleeding into subcutaneous tissue planes causing bluish-purple discoloration &gt; 4cm in diameter), hematoma (non pulsatile mass &gt; 1 cm in diameter), and infections treatable with oral antibiotics</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient discomfort:</measure>
    <time_frame>within 10 minutes of device application</time_frame>
    <description>was assessed based on a short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire using a Present Pain Intensity (PPI) scale that rated pain from 0 (no pain) to 5 (excruciating).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vasovagal manifestations</measure>

To standardize compression times, AFCD were applied to patient and complete femoral artery compression were applied for 5 minutes, followed by a gradual release of pressure over the ensuing 8 minutes. Therefore each patient received a minimum of 13 minutes of compression, with further compression applied only if full hemostasis had not been achieved at that point with maximum of 30 minutes.</description>
