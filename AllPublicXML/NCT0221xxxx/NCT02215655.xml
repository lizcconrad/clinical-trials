  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is a non-traditional risk factor
      for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Non-adherence to phosphate binders is as high as
      74% in ESRD patients and has been shown to be most related to psychosocial factors including
      attitudes. There is limited data on the influence of attitudes and perceived autonomy support
      on phosphate binder adherence and these two psychosocial constructs can be positively
      influenced through the use of motivational interviewing skills to increase autonomous
      motivation. Furthermore, racial disparities are known to exist in ESRD however and there are
      still gaps, which exist in understanding the determinants of disparities in adherence in
      vulnerable patients with ESRD.

      In this study, the investigators seek to determine the impact of motivational interviewing on
      phosphate binder adherence in diverse ESRD patients. The investigators will ask all the
      subjects to fill out surveys mainly regarding their attitudes; perceived providers' autonomy
      support and phosphate binder adherence. The investigators will administer motivational
      counseling to subjects in the intervention arm of the study, at baseline and 1 month after
      recruitment. The investigators will ask all the subjects to fill out the same surveys 2
      months after recruitment and the investigators will compare subjects who underwent
      motivational interviewing to those who did not.
