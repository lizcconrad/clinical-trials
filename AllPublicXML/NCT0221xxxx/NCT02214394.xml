  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves the use of an experimental device which will measure how much propofol is
      present in your exhaled breath during surgery compared to how much is in your blood. The
      study results will look at whether the device is as accurate as conventional methods for
      measuring propofol levels during surgery.

    <description>Measure and compare propofol concentrations in exhaled breath to those in plasma in human patients anesthetized with propofol. Samples of the exhaled breath from patients will be monitored using the SAW Sensor and collected onto Tenax TA Tubes for analysis by Thermal Desorption GC/MS (using the method described by Grossher et al.)</description>
