  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), formerly also known as chronic idiopathic urticaria and
      chronic urticaria (CU), is one of the most frequent skin diseases. At any time, 0.5-1% of the
      population suffers from the disease. Although all age groups can be affected, the peak
      incidence is seen between 20 and 40 years of age. The duration of the disease is generally
      several years but is likely to be longer in more severe cases, cases with concurrent
      angioedema, in combination with physical urticaria or with a positive autologous serum skin
      test (autoreactivity). CSU has major detrimental effects on quality of life, with sleep
      deprivation and psychiatric comorbidity being frequent. It also has a large impact on society
      in terms of direct and indirect health care costs as well as reduced performance at work and
      in private life.
