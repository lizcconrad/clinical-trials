      A Randomized controlled study of two different educational support interventions developed
      for children in foster care (age 6-13). One intervention is school-based and involves a team
      of professionals at the child's school, and the other is a home-based tutoring intervention
      provided by the foster parents. The participants in the study are assigned to three groups
      (the two intervention groups and control group). Based on power calculation we aim to recruit
      approximately 180-200 foster children, their foster parents and public schools to participate
      in the study.

    <description>A school-based intervention that builds on the promising Swedish programme SkolFam, but is adapted to a Danish school context. The two main components of the programme are a) comprehensive assessment of the child, involving testing of the child's cognitive and academic abilities and difficulties as well as an evaluation of the child's behaviour, school-related social relations and well-being, and b) a systematic and individually targeted intervention plan, made in collaboration between a psychologist, the teachers, and a special educational teacher at the school (e.g., the reading counsellor).</description>

    <intervention_name>Parents as Tutors</intervention_name>
    <description>A home-based intervention, comprising a structured tutoring programme that allows foster parents to systematically support the foster child's school performance. Foster parents will attend an introductory tutor training seminar at which they will be introduced to relevant theory on learning and counselled on tutoring practice. The intervention itself is designed to provide approximately three hours per week of individual home-based tutoring for a period of 40 weeks.</description>
