  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effect of
      prophylactic antipyretics on the immune responses and rates of fever after inactivated
      influenza vaccine (IIV) in children 6 through 47 months of age.

      In this study, 160 healthy children, 6 through 47 months of age, including some children at
      risk of febrile seizure, will be randomized to one of three different treatment arms.
      Children will receive either blinded therapy with prophylactic acetaminophen or placebo
      immediately following and every 4 to 6 hours in the 24 hours after receipt of a dose of IIV
      or open-label ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours in the 24 hours after receipt of a dose of IIV.
      Children will be followed for the occurrence of fever, fussiness, changes in appetite and
      sleep patterns, and use of medical services on the day of and for two days following
      vaccination. Antibody to influenza antigens contained in the respective 2014-2015 and
      2015-2016 vaccines as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody will be assessed
      at baseline and four weeks following vaccination. The proportions of children experiencing
      fever, having solicited side effects, using medical services, demonstrating a serologic
      response corresponding to seroprotection and seroconversion to each of the IIV antigens will
      be determined for groups of children in each of the three treatment arms. Likewise geometric
      mean HAI titers (GMTs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each IIV antigen will
      be calculated for the three treatment arms. The investigators hope to learn whether or not
      prophylactic antipyretics affect the immune response and fever rates following IIV.

             nasal steroids are allowed).
