      Hypothesis The incidence of toxicity in patients receiving the tumor DNA-transfected
      fibroblast vaccine will be acceptably low and the immunologic response rate sufficiently high
      to warrant further study of this therapy

      The study of the vaccine will proceed in two stages after the method of Simon (102). In the
      first stage, 15 patients will be accrued and treated. If two or fewer objective immunologic
      responses occur, the study will be terminated. If 3 or more responses are observed, the study
      will proceed to the second stage, accruing an additional 22 patients. If the second stage is
      complete and a total of 9 or more immunologic responses are observed among the 37 patients
      treated, the treatment response rate for the vaccine will be considered high enough to
      warrant further study. Conversely, if the evaluation of the vaccine concludes at the first
      stage, or if 8 or fewer total immunologic responses occur after completing the second stage,
      the vaccine will not be considered for further study.

      This is a single institution open-label phase Ib clinical trial designed to determine the
      safety of immunization of patients with resected Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
      (HNSCC) with lethally irradiated semi-allogeneic human fibroblasts (MRC-5) transfected with
      DNA derived from the subject's own tumor and to measure the immune response to the autologous
      tumor vaccine.

      Briefly, the plan is to use a two-stage trial design and to initially enroll 15 patients with
      Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). The patients will undergo surgical resection
      to provide complete removal of the primary lesion with negative gross and microscopic
      margins. A portion of the primary tumor specimen not necessary for the pathologic diagnosis
      will be obtained to serve as a source of DNA for preparing the vaccine. Each DNA-based
      vaccine will contain 1 x 10e7 DNA-transfected human allogeneic fibroblasts. The vaccine will
      be lethally irradiated before it is used for immunization. It will be administered
      intradermally in the Outpatient Clinic for a total of four vaccinations delivered at weekly
      intervals.

      Patients delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses will be tested but will not be an
      eligibility criterion. Immunologic response to the vaccine will be evaluated. If there is no
      evidence of toxicity, and &gt;3 of the 15 initial patients show immunologic response, the second
      stage of the study will be opened for accrual of 22 patients.

      To determine patient's response to the DNA-based vaccines, the frequency of T cells reactive
      with recipient cells transfected with the autologous tumor DNA will be measured by ELISPOT
      for IFN-y and compared with the response to non-transfected fibroblasts prior to and after
      vaccination. All patients will be monitored for Immunologic response by assays include
      ELISPOT, flow cytometry for lymphocyte markers, Annexin V binding, TcR expression, caspase3
      activity and serum antibodies.

    <description>Toxicity will be monitored continuously from the first vaccination through the 6 month post follow up study visit for each subject.
Patients will have a follow-up visit at 1 week after last vaccination (day 29, off treatment), at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after last vaccination or after removal from study or until death, whichever occurs first. After the 6 month follow-up visit, subjects will be followed for survival only (no additional clinical trial site visits). Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
All subjects should be enrolled within 2 years and follow up studies complete within 3 years.</description>

    <measure>Immunologic Response Rate to the the tumor DNA-transfected fibroblast vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Immunologic evidence of a response to the DNA-based vaccine will depend on the results of ELISPOT assays performed at five to seven time points: pre-surgery, pre-vaccine (either at the day -28 or Day 1 prior to vaccination), on day 15, on day 29, 1 month, 3 months (if clinically indicated at 1 and 3 months) and at the 6 month post treatment follow-up appointment. A significant difference in the frequency of vaccine reactive or anti-tumor-reactive T cells between pre- and post-vaccine determinations will be considered as a positive immune response to the vaccine.
Additionally, immune competence and the presence/absence of immune suppression will be evaluated before and after vaccine administration. The ability of DNA-based vaccines to reverse or diminish demonstrated effects in signaling defects, lymphocyte apoptosis or proportions of T(reg) in the peripheral circulation will be measured but will not be used as a criterion for evaluation of the immune response.</description>

          -  BUN 8-26 mg/dL

          -  At least a 12 week interval should have elapsed between prior surgery, radiation
             therapy, chemotherapy or any other treatment and the first vaccination. Patients
             should have recovered from surgery and adjuvant treatment.

          -  The effects of the tumor DNA-transfected fibroblast vaccine on the developing human
             fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 4 months after the
             last dose of the study vaccine, even if oral contraceptives are used. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of the
             tumor DNA-transfected fibroblast vaccine administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be EXCLUDED from participation in the study if any of the following apply:

          -  One or more of the Inclusion Criteria are not met.

          -  A significant history or current evidence of cardiac disease including, but not
             limited to: congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, angina pectoris,
             uncontrolled hypertension, serious arrhythmias or myocardial infarction within the
             previous six months.

          -  Evidence of ongoing or active infection requiring antibiotic therapy.

          -  Active intracranial metastases. Patients with previously resected intracranial disease
             and/or previously irradiated intracranial metastases that have been clinically stable
             for four weeks are eligible.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnant women are excluded from this study. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test per standard of care prior
             to the surgery for tumor removal. A second pregnancy test must be performed 7 days
             prior to the first vaccination and must be negative. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on study.

          -  Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids (unless patients have had no
             corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to start of study).

          -  Autoimmune disease including, but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
             erythematous, multiple sclerosis, or ankylosing spondylitis.

          -  Patients who have post-obstructive pneumonia or other serious infection at the time of
             registration or other serious underlying medical condition that would impair the
             ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment.

          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the patient has
             been disease-free for at least 5 years prior to registration.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study. HIV testing will be performed in patients receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated per medical records review.

          -  Patients with clinical symptoms of Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C will be tested, if
             clinically indicated per medical records review. Positive results will be an exclusion
