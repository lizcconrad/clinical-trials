  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to assess measured, observed, and self-reported outcomes achieved
      through the use of passive (mechanical), active(motorized) and adaptive (magnetorheological)
      prosthetic knee control systems in individuals with unilateral, transfemoral amputation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An interrupted time-series trial with pre/post baseline assessments, randomized crossover of
      interventions, and within-phase repeated measures is used to evaluate and compare the
      effectiveness of the Össur Power Knee II and the Össur Rheo Knee in individuals with
      unilateral, transfemoral amputation. A rigorous and clinically-meaningful experimental
      protocol is applied to verify study participants receive appropriate training, experience,
      and assessment in each knee condition. A suite of standardized and ad-hoc physical
      performance tests, patient-reported questionnaires, and monitoring technologies were
      carefully selected to assess important, clinically-relevant participant outcomes. Comparative
      effectiveness of three prosthetic knee interventions are evaluated using direct measurement
      (i.e., timed tests), observed clinical ratings (i.e., subjective assessments of gait quality)
      and self-report instruments (i.e., health status surveys). Analyses will focus on identifying
      differences between control system technologies inherent to each type of prosthetic knee
      (i.e., passive [mechanical], adaptive [magnetorheological], and active [power]). Outcomes
      will be used to establish recommendations for which activities and patients knees are most
      appropriate or likely to produce a desired effect.
