      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of SHAPE
      administered topically to skin lesions in patients with early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
      (CTCL).

      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of SHAPE Gelled Solution applied topically daily or twice daily for 26 consecutive
      weeks to specified skin lesions in patients with Stage IA, IB or IIA CTCL. Patients
      responding to treatment will be allowed to continue on study for a maximum of 52 weeks.
