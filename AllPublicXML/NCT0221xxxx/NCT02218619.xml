  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinically, the ability to slow or prevent beta cell demise can prevent or improve the course
      of type 1 diabetes. The immune-mediated destruction of beta cells that is an apparent major
      pathological basis for the disease, has led to efforts to prevent or suppress this immune
      assault. Here we propose to buttress the beta cell's capacity to withstand this assault by
      improving the function of the endoplasmic reticulum stress resolving mechanisms within these
      cells. The ability to do so could have a major impact on preventive and therapeutic
      strategies for type 1 diabetes (and possibly other types of diabetes). The type of
      endoplasmic reticulum stress relieving agent (TUDCA) proposed here could ultimately be
      applied on an anticipatory basis to individuals at high risk for type 1 diabetes.

      Reducing endoplasmic reticulum stress will promote beta cell survival in new-onset type 1
      diabetes.

      The primary aim is to test the clinical efficacy of an already approved agent, TUDCA,
      re-purposed to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve beta cell survival in patients
      with new onset type 1 diabetes. The primary endpoint of this proposed double-blinded
      randomized placebo-controlled pilot study is c-peptide measured after mixed meal stimulation
      test at randomization and then at 6 and 12 months of treatment with TUDCA compared to
      treatment with placebo and at 6 months following treatment.

      TUDCA is an oral medication with an excellent safety profile that is approved for use in
      Europe for gall stones and liver disease. The drug and similar compounds has been used in
      children, as young as newborns, and in adults. TUDCA's ability to lower endoplasmic reticulum
      stress has only recently been recognized and will be applied to new-onset type 1 diabetes in
      this proposal. If this pilot trial is successful, future studies could include broadening the
      recipients to antibody-positive pre-type 1 diabetes patients and/or combining TUDCA with
      other agents shown to have a beneficial effect on insulin secretion in new-onset type 1
      diabetes.

    <description>It is believed that the autoimmune assault of new onset type 1 diabetes leads to stress to the part of the beta cell that folds proteins; referred to as endoplasmic reticulum stress. When endoplasmic reticulum stress increases, changes in protein levels in beta cells occur. We will measure markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress in beta cells taken from skin biopsies taken from subjects before treatment with TUDCA or placebo.</description>
