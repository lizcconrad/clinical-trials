  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, based on prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) progression, of abiraterone acetate in participants with metastatic (spread of cancer
      cells from one part of the body to another) castration (any action, surgical, chemical, or
      otherwise, by which a male loses the functions of the testes) resistant prostate cancer
      (cancer in prostrate; a gland that makes fluid that aids movement of sperm) (mCRPC),
      chemo-naive (treatment of cancer is not done using drugs), who received a prior
      diethylstilbestrol therapy (DES).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multinational (when medical research study takes place in more than one
      country), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), and single
      arm study to determine benefits of abiraterone acetate and low-dose prednisone to androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) in mCRPC participants who failed to prior DES therapy. The study
      will consist of a Screening Phase of up to 28 days before enrollment; a PSA Evaluation Phase;
      and a Follow-up Phase of up to 24 months. Each cycle of abiraterone therapy will be of 28
      days. Participants will receive 1000 milligram (mg) abiraterone acetate orally once daily
      plus prednisone 5 mg orally once daily plus stable regimen of ADT (luteinizing
      hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonists) as per Investigator's discretion. Treatment will
      continue until PSA progression, clinical progression, consent withdrawal, or the occurrence
      of unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy will primarily be assessed by time to PSA progression.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to PSA progression is calculated from date of enrollment to the date of first documentation of PSA progression. As per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) criteria, PSA progression is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 25 percent (%) and &gt;=2 nanogram/milliliter (ng/mL) after 12 weeks (in case of no decline in PSA from Baseline), or first PSA increase that is &gt;=25% and &gt;=2 ng/mL above the nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later (in case of decline of PSA from Baseline).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA response is defined as at least 50% decrease in PSA level from Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Change From Baseline in Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Response at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA response is defined as at least 50% decrease in PSA level from Baseline. The maximal change from Baseline in PSA response at Week 12 will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survial Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months until death, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from enrollment to date of death due to any cause.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of Cycle 1; Day 28 of every 2 cycles up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF is a publicly available instrument to assess the pain. Total score is an average of the pain interference score (mean value for the 9 BPI-SF questions [questions inquiring about the extent of interference with activities by pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes)]) and pain subscale score (mean value for the scores for BPI-SF questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 [questions inquiring about the extent of pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine)]). Total score ranges from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating more pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to 30 days after last dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who will receive study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly.</description>
