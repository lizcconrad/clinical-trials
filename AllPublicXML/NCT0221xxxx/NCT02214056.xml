      The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of standardized screening for
      comorbidities among patients with one or more of three chronic diseases (diabetes, COPD,
      atherosclerosis) by a mobile unit at times and localities under-served by health actors.

    <description>Each patient enrolled will receive a standardized assessment in one locality, made in about two hours, and comprising:
questionnaire responses, a complete physical exam, a 12-lead ECG, spirometry before and after administration of β2-agonists, an arterial Doppler ultrasound (carotid and abdominal), ankle-brachial index (systolic pressure at the toe).
At the end of two hours, each patient will evaluate their satisfaction using a survey of acceptability and leave with a full report to the attention of their general practitioner (copy sent to Physician if needed) detailing the results of the different examinations.</description>
