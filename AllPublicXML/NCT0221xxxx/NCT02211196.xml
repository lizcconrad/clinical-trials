      This pilot clinical trial studies evidence-based tobacco cessation strategies in patients
      with cancer. Stop-smoking plans suggested by doctors may help patients with cancer quit
      smoking.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess oncology providers' self-reported need for training on evidence-based tobacco
      cessation strategies and assess their level of interest in future training on evidence-based
      tobacco cessation strategies.

      II. To test the feasibility of the implementation of evidence-based tobacco cessation
      strategies in community oncology clinics.

      III. To test the feasibility of surveying community oncology patients after a clinic visit to
      assess provider behavior regarding screening and brief intervention for tobacco use.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete a survey over approximately 10-15 minutes related to their provider's
      cessation advice and assistance with quitting.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <description>These prevalences will be estimated at pre- and post-intervention, and 95% CIs calculated adjusting for the expected within-clinic correlation of patient outcomes. These outcomes will be analyzed further using a subject-specific modeling approach to account for the correlation that occurs due to patients being clustered within clinics.</description>
