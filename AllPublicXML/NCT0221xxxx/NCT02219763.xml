  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the impact of a 12-week behavioral weight management program on body weight and
      quality of life. We hypothesize that participants will lose body weight and see improved
      quality of life after program completion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate weight change and quality of life among individuals after completion
      of a 12-week comprehensive group weight management program. Findings from this study will
      also help with program development and improvement within our center. The already established
      weight management program is called Healthy Habits for Life (HHL) and includes a total of 14
      visits (one individual visit both before and after the 12 group sessions).

      All patients who are enrolled in the Healthy Habits for Life group program at the Weight
      Center have an individual visit with a registered dietitian prior to beginning the group as
      part of standard care. At this visit the dietitian will obtain informed consent for
      participation in the research study and provide subjects consenting to participate in the
      study with the IWQOL-lite quality of life questionnaire.

      After completion of the 12 HHL group sessions, all patients at the Weight Center have another
      individual visit with the dietitian to review weight and behavior changes since the initial
      evaluation. At this visit, subjects participating in the research study will again be
      provided with the IWQOL-lite questionnaire to fill out.
