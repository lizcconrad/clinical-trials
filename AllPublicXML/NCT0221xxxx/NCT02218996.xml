      The purpose of this study is to examine the content of the treatment being delivered for
      anxiety disorders for children and adolescents in the regular outpatient clinics in western
      Norway. The study will also collect data before and after treatment to evaluate the result of
      the treatment. Furthermore, as part of the study we aim to collect normative data on two
      questionnaires used to identify anxiety symptoms and the extent to which anxiety interfere
      with daily functioning. We also aim to develop a quality indicator for anxiety treatment that
      can be used to monitor treatment in the regular outpatient service, based on the results of
      the current study.
