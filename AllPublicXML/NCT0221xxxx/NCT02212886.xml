  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This is a phase IIa study in which GA Depot 80 or 40mg is administered as an IM
           injection to subjects with RRMS at 4 week intervals for 52 weeks of treatment.

        -  The purpose of the study is to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a monthly
           long-acting IM injection of 80 or 40mg GA Depot in subjects with RRMS. The study will
           include subjects switching from daily or thrice weekly administration of 20 mg or 40mg
           respectively of glatiramer acetate (GA, i.e., Copaxone) injection

    <textblock>
      -  25 Subjects with a diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who are
           treated with daily or thrice weekly subcutaneous injections of 20 mg or 40 mg
           respectively of GA (Copaxone) during the previous 12 months

        -  Study product is GA long-acting injection (GA Depot) which is a combination of
           extended-release microspheres for injection and diluent (water for injection) for
           parenteral use. GA Depot will be administered intramuscularly (IM).

        -  The study duration for an individual subject in the core study will be 60 weeks,
           consisting of 4 weeks of screening evaluation (weeks -4 to 0), followed by a 52-week
           open-label treatment period, and a 4 weeks follow up period: through a total of 17
           visits.

        -  For both arms, subjects who completed 13 injections and who consented (by signing an
           informed consent) are able to enter the optional 3 years extension period. During the
           extension period subjects will receive 40 mg of GA Depot IM once every 4 weeks, 36 times
           for a total of 144 weeks.

        -  Physical, vital signs and safety assessment - at each visit during the core study
           (physical examination will be assessed reduced to quarterly in the extension period).

        -  MRI at visit 1 (screenings), at week 24, week 52 (end of core study) and every 6 months
           during the extension period.

        -  Neurological and safety laboratory tests at screening visit, on visits in weeks 4, 12,
           24, 36, 52 (end of core study) and every 6 months during the extension period.
