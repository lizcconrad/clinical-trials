  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head lice, or Pediculus humanus capitis, cause an estimated 6 to 12 million infestations per
      year in the U.S., most commonly affecting children 3 to 11 years of age. Despite common
      perceptions, head lice crawl, and cannot hop or fly. For this reason, transmission occurs
      most often by human head-to-head contact, and much less commonly by the sharing of personal
      items such as hats, coats, combs, or towels. Because head lice feed on human blood, they
      cannot live on pets and are only viable 1-2 days on surfaces other than the human head.

    <time_frame>Day after first treatment and Day 14 of study</time_frame>
    <description>A determination of head lice effectiveness, measured by number of subjects free of live lice and by number of subjects free of viable eggs, was calculated using two week post-treatment data as the primary study outcome. Measurements were calculated at Day 1 (day after first treatment) and Day 14.
At diagnosis, 55 subjects had viable eggs with three subjects meeting enrollment criteria for three or more live lice.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Free of Live Head Lice and Free of Viable Eggs</title>
        <description>A determination of head lice effectiveness, measured by number of subjects free of live lice and by number of subjects free of viable eggs, was calculated using two week post-treatment data as the primary study outcome. Measurements were calculated at Day 1 (day after first treatment) and Day 14.
At diagnosis, 55 subjects had viable eggs with three subjects meeting enrollment criteria for three or more live lice.</description>
        <time_frame>Day after first treatment and Day 14 of study</time_frame>
        <population>There were 58 evaluable subjects in the experimental (LiceMD) arm of the study.</population>

LICEMD: Parents/guardians of infested children will provide consent for their child's participation. Infested children whose parents agree to use the investigational product will be enrolled on the experimental arm of the study using the LiceMD product as treatment. All participants will be examined for lice count and scalp irritation the day after the first application, and at seven days and fourteen days after the first application. Participants may also be examined by parents or the school nurse at any time if signs of irritation or re-infestation occur. If the child is still found to be infested during any of these examinations, the school nurse will instruct the parent/guardian to retreat.</description>

            <description>Parents/guardians who do not agree to use the investigational product and choose a standard head lice treatment will be asked to participate in the comparison arm of the study.
Standard head lice product: The most common treatments are pesticide-based, over-the-counter remedies of permethrin (1%), or pyrethrin-based products. After a baseline scalp exam for lice count and preexisting signs of irritation, parents who agree to the comparison arm may choose and purchase any other head lice treatment of their choice. All treatments (investigational and comparison) are to be done at home by a parent or guardian. All participants will be examined for lice count and scalp irritation the day after the first application, and at seven days and fourteen days after the first application.</description>
