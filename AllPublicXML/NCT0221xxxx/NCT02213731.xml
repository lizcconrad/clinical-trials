      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the single procedure outcomes of using
      cryoballoon ablation without additional empirical lesions and/or complex fractionated
      electrogram (CFE) ablations for patients with early persistent atrial fibrillation (&lt;1 year
      from first diagnosis of persistent AF).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single procedure success of cryoballoon ablation on patients with early persistent AF</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>12 month success will be defined as absence of adjudicated AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachyarrhythmias &gt;/= 30 seconds in duration from the end of the 90 day blanking period of the cryoballoon ablation procedure to at least 12 months after the cryoballoon ablation procedure. Only Arctic Front Advance catheters may be used to achieve the single procedure success and no additional empirical lesions and/or complex fractionated electrogram (CFE) ablations may be made. Additionally, subjects must not require any other intervention for AF following the index procedure. Right atrial flutter ablations and pharmacological and/or electrical cardioversion can be performed within the 90 day blanking period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute procedural success of cryoballoon ablation on patients with early persistent AF</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Acute procedural success is defined as:
Only Arctic Front Advance catheters used to achieve procedure success AND
All targeted pulmonary veins were isolated (minimally assessed for entrance block and, where assessable, exit block) AND
Sinus rhythm is restored at the end of the ablation procedure (with or without cardioversion)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Success of cryoballoon ablation on patients with early persistent AF (allowing for multiple procedures)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>12 month success will be defined as absence of adjudicated AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachyarrhythmias &gt;/= 30 seconds in duration from the end of the 90 day blanking period of the cryoballoon ablation procedure to at least 12 months after the cryoballoon ablation procedure. Only Arctic Front Advance catheters may be used to achieve multiple procedure success and no additional empirical lesions and/or complex fractionated electrogram (CFE) ablations may be made. Additionally, subjects must not require any other intervention for AF. Right atrial flutter ablations and pharmacological and/or electrical cardioversion can be performed within the 90 day blanking period.</description>
