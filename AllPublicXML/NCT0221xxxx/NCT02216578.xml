  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, multi-national, open label, single arm Phase II study of
      single-agent cabozantinib. The objective of the study is to assess the safety and activity of
      cabozantinib in patients with metastatic GIST who have previously progressed on imatinib and
      sunitinib and have not been exposed yet to other KIT- or PDGFR-directed tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors.

      Patient will receive cabozantinib until they experience no further benefit from the
      treatment, becoming intolerant to the drug or wishing to discontinue the treatment. Treatment
      beyond RECIST 1.1 progression is allowed in patients deriving clinical benefit upon
      investigator's discretion, provided no other criteria for treatment withdrawal are met.

          -  Prior surgery:

               -  Minor surgery (including uncomplicated tooth extractions) within 28 days before

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those

        Note: women of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of
        becoming pregnant (ie, females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,
        with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been
        amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if
        the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight,
        ovarian suppression or other reasons.

          -  Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use adequate birth control
             measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and for at
             least 4 months after the last study treatment. A highly effective method of birth
             control is defined as a method which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1%
             per year) when used consistently and correctly.

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to ICH
             (International Conference on Harmonisation)/GCP (Good clinical Practice), and
             national/local regulations.

             with desmoid fibromatosis or neurofibromas, which can be associated with GIST, are
             allowed to enter the trial, under the provision that they do have a measurable GIST
             lesion that can be distinguished from the other lesions.
