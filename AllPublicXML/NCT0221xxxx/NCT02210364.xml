      Phase I Multicenter, Open-label, Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Study of Lurbinectedin
      (PM01183) in Combination with Capecitabine in Patients with Unresectable Metastatic Breast
      Cancer (MBC), Pancreatic Cancer (PC) or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC) to determine the
      recommended dose (RD) of PM01183 in combination with capecitabine, to characterize the safety
      profile, to explore the feasibility of PM01183 dose optimization, to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (PK), to obtain preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity
      of this combination and to conduct an exploratory pharmacogenomic (PGx) analysis.
