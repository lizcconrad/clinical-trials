             fissures, fistulas, perianal abscesses, and eczema of the perianal skin

          -  Patient exhibited evidence of active gastrointestinal disease

          -  Patient was diagnosed as having intestinal obstruction, had any undiagnosed abdominal
             symptoms, or was in severe dehydration

          -  Patient had a history of major gastrointestinal surgery

          -  Patient had ingested any drug in the past week before enrolment that in the opinion of
             the investigator would have an effect on gastrointestinal motility (e.g.
             anti-cholinergic medications, opioids, smooth muscle relaxants or antacids)

          -  Patient required the use of a drug, other than study drug, or dietary supplement to
             relieve the symptoms of constipation at any time during the baseline or treatment
             phases of this study

          -  Patient was currently taking any form of tetracycline antibiotics

          -  Patient was a nursing mother
