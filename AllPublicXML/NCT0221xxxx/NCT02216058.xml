      A prospective, multicenter study is preformed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOYA
      CoCr biodegradable coating sirolimus-eluting stents in treating coronary artery lesions.
      Appropriate patients judged by inclusion and exclusion standards will be preformed stent
      implantation, and after that all patients will be clinically followed up at 30, 180, 365
      days,2 years,3 years,4 years and 5 years. Target Lesion Failure (TLF) found in following-up
      period as key indicators to evaluate the safety of stents. The arrangement, conclusion and
      statistical analysis of trial data including clinography and angiography will be fulfilled by
      independent Data Management Center(DMC) and radiography core laboratory.
