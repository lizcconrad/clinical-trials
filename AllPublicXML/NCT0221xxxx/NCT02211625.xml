  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics
      (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TRV734 given as a single dose (Part A) and as multiple
      ascending doses (Part B) in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be conducted in two-parts enrolling a total of approximately 72 healthy volunteers.

        -  Part A will assess the safety, tolerability, PD and PK of a 125mg dose of TRV734 in an
           open-label, randomized, three-period crossover study in which subjects are fasted, fed a
           standard meal, or fed a high-fat meal.

        -  Part B of the trial will assess the safety, tolerability, PD and PK of multiple
           ascending doses of TRV734 in a double blind, double dummy, randomized, active- and
           placebo-controlled, adaptive study. Oxycodone immediate release (IR) 10 mg will be used
           as a benchmark.
