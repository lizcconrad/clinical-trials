  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postsurgical pain may effectively be treated with a multimodal approach that incorporates the
      use of local anesthetics. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic that has been proven to be
      effective at reducing postsurgical pain. Furthermore, this local anesthetic has been shown to
      reduce opioid use, improve functional outcomes, allow for early mobilization, and decrease
      hospital length of stay. However, local anesthetics, via wound infiltration, are often
      short-acting and do not meet the duration of postsurgical pain due to their solubility and
      protein-binding properties. ExparelTM is an FDA-approved liposomal formulation of bupivacaine
      that allows for 72 hours of postsurgical analgesia with a single injection. This formulation
      has been shown to have little to no adverse effects; although some studies have reported
      adverse effects with the use of ExaprelTM, most frequently being nausea, vomiting, and
      dizziness. The occurrences of these adverse events were still less than the placebo cohort.

      All patients undergoing surgical fixation of a lower extremity fracture(s) will be offered
      the opportunity to enroll in the study. Patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral surgical
      fixation would be included. Written, informed consent to enrollment will be recorded and
      included in the patient record. The study is designed around the standard of care for
      postsurgical pain management. There are no additional costs to the patient strictly related
      to this study.

      Patients will undergo surgical fixation of a lower extremity fracture(s) by one of surgical
      investigators at a single institution. A sealed, opaque envelope, selected in the
      pre-operative holding area, will accompany each patient participant to the operating room.
      The envelope will be opened at the conclusion of the fracture fixation to reveal patient
      assignment to either study Group 1 or Group 2. Once the total numbers of patients have
      completed their procedures and follow-up, the study will close.

    <description>The opaque envelope, which was selected by the treating physician, will accompany each of the study participants will be opened and the patient identified as belonging to either Group 1 or Group 2. It is important to note that randomization of the envelopes were computer-generated and placed by a co-investigator; the treating physician is completely unaware of the order of the opaque envelopes. Patients in Group 1 will receive a standardized medication regimen including non-liposomal bupivacaine by soft-tissue injection at the conclusion of their surgical procedure. Those in Group 2 will receive non-liposomal bupivacaine and ExparelTM by soft-tissue injection at the conclusion of their surgical procedure. Study participants will undergo injection in this manner until the conclusion of the study.</description>
