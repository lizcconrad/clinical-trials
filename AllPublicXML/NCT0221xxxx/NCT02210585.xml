  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to test the following hypotheses:

      Main Objective:

      To compare the level of spontaneous physical activity at 3 months after re-entrainment by
      multi-site electrical stimulation (m-ES), measured by actigraphy over 7 days, compared to
      conventional care (lifestyle and dietary advice and placebo (simulated) electrostimulation)
      (control arm).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare the metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular and functional parameters, physical
      activity, quality of life and quality of sleep, at 3 months and at 2 years in the two groups.

      Design:

      We will conduct a multicenter controlled study vs. reference care with randomization into two
      parallel groups and double-blind (placebo electrostimulation). Patients will have the ES
      material available at home and will be supervised by monthly visits over 3 months and by
      telephone follow-up for two years. The study size calculation is based on physical activity,
      the percentage of lean body mass and arterial stiffness measured in the OBEX study.

      This project will determine whether the training strategy is effective for increasing
      physical activity and/or in inducing significant metabolic and cardiovascular effects in
      these patients after 2 years. In addition, it provides a solid base of investigation for the
      study of the interactions between muscle contraction and cardio-metabolic health with greater
      precision.

      Obesity and sleep apnea syndrome lead to metabolic troubles and increasing cardiovascular
      risk. Furthermore, both diseases are associated with reduced exercise tolerance.

      For many patients with morbid obesity, the implementation of physical activity programs
      remains difficult for several reasons including the level of disability and psychosocial
      causes (the scrutiny of others, depression and poorly adapted equipment).

      Main hypothesis: Neuromuscular electrostimulation is a way to increase spontaneous physical
      activity (PA) in treated apneic obese patients with low spontaneous physical activity
