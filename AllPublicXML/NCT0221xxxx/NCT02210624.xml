  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow-derived
      stem cells therapy in patients with anaerobic (hypoxic) brain injury. Stem cell therapy is an
      emerging alternative treatment modality in incurable and intractable neurological disorders.
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of stem cells in anaerobic brain
      injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various treatment modalities to minimize the neurological deficits of anoxic brain injury,
      including lower consciousness, abnormal movement disorders, and abnormal behavior, have been
      tried, but so far there have been no effective proven method for chronic patients.

      This study is the investigator initiated trial to verify the safety and feasibility of stem
      cells therapy in patients with anoxic brain injury.
