  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The autonomic nervous system (ANS) unconsciously regulates the activities of vital organ
      systems such as the respiratory, circulatory, and urinary systems. It consists of two major
      components, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the sympathetic nervous system
      (SNS), which together are in charge of keeping our body in homeostasis. Homeostasis is the
      state of chemical and metabolic balance within an organism; it is disturbed in situations of
      uncontrolled stress.

      Massage has been shown to decrease SNS and stimulate PNS; but most studies focused on full
      body massage, with limited assessment of ANS function, and lacked control groups.

      The effects of head massage therapy (HMT) on regulating the activity of the ANS have not been
      studied before. In this pilot study, we propose that by randomizing 10 participants to
      sessions of HMT and 'Simple Relaxation' (no HMT), and by using a non-invasive method of
      measuring the ANS activity (spectral analysis of Heart Rate Variability [HRV] as well as
      Pre-ejection Period (PEP)), we will be able to investigate the effects of 10 minutes of HMT
      in comparison with the period of no HMT administered. We expect HMT to reduce stress, with a
      better and balanced profile of autonomic nervous system after receiving massage.

    <time_frame>Within 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Main HRV parameters that will be reported include High Frequency (HF) which is the power in high frequency range representative of the parasympathetic nervous system activity, HFnu which is the HF power in normalized units, and total power which is the total variability of the autonomic nervous system over the temporal segment.
HRV parameters are measured at baseline and post intervention. Post-intervention outcomes for each subject will be compared with their baseline. There will also be comparison of the outcomes between the massage and the control intervention, for the effect of massage therapy</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-ejection period (PEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>PEP is the time interval between electrical stimulation of the sinoatrial node and opening of the aortic valves and has shown to be inversely correlated with the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.
PEP is measured at baseline and post intervention. Post-intervention outcomes for each subject will be compared with their baseline. There will also be comparison of the outcomes between the massage and the control intervention, for the effect of massage therapy.</description>
