      The purpose of this study is through a phase I/II clinical trial to assess the safety and
      toxicity of intraperitoneally administered MOC31PE immunotoxin, given on the 1.postoperative
      day after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC)
      for peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MOC31PE is an immunotoxin that has previously been evaluated in a phase I clinical study
      involving patients with advanced EpCAM positive carcinoma to assess the safety and
      tolerability profile and the pharmacokinetic behavior of the compound. In this study, the
      compound was administered intravenously and was well tolerated. MOC31PE will now be evaluated
      on the same parameters in a new phase I/II clinical trial, where the drug will be
      administered intraperitoneally to patients with peritoneal metastases from EpCAM positive
      colorectal carcinomas.
