  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a multi-echo gradient echo sequence to calculate R2* and quantitative susceptibility
      maps and well as susceptibility-weighted imaging post processing the investigators
      hypothesize that the investigators would be able to distinguish between pseudoprogression and
      true progression with the use of an easily implementable sequence on clinical MRI scanners.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-treatment radiographic imaging change (PTRIC) is seen in approximately 50% of patients
      who are treated for brain neoplasms using chemotherapy and radiotherapy. PTRIC can be
      attributed to true disease progression or a form of benign radiographic enhancement, known in
      literature as pseudoprogression. Of these patients, 50% of them have benign radiographic
      enhancement that is usually spontaneously resolved and required no intervention. The other
      50% require immediate medical intervention, or more aggressive treatment for true
      progression. Currently standard medical practise is to administer a prophylactic treatment of
      chemotherapy to all patients with PTRIC with a follow up scan 3-6 months after initial PTRIC
      diagnosis, leading to up to 50% of patients receiving an unneeded dose of chemotherapy. The
      investigators hope to take advantage of the differentiation in tissue types and
      vascularization between true progression tumour and pseudoprogression to be able to identify
      patients who would not need to be administered a prophylactic dose of chemotherapy.
