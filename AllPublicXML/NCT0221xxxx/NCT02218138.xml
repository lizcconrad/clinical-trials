  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that puts people at risk for major health problems like
      heart disease. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes in adults. However, there
      has been a concerning rise in type 2 diabetes among teenagers. Diabetes develops through poor
      insulin sensitivity, meaning that insulin - an important chemical the body makes to keep
      blood sugar normal - isn't working properly. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by improving
      insulin sensitivity. Stress is related to insulin sensitivity. Individuals who feel stressed
      have worse insulin sensitivity than individuals who do not feel stressed. In adults,
      decreasing stress leads to improvements in insulin sensitivity, but this hasn't been tested
      in teenagers. The purpose of this study is to find out if taking part in a brief group
      program to decrease stress will improve insulin sensitivity and lower diabetes risk in
      teenage girls.

      After a screening to determine eligibility, girls are randomly assigned to take part in one
      of two 6-week group programs: 1) Learning to BREATHE - a mindfulness-based program, or 2)
      Colorado Blues - a cognitive-behavioral program. After the group, girls return for three
      follow-up visits over the course of a year. The main outcomes are depressive symptoms and
      insulin resistance. We also are assessing stress, eating behavior, fitness, and mindfulness.
