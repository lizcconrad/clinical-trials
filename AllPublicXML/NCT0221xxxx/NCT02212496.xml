  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there has been increasing interest in the association between cancer and
      cerebrovascular disease, the underlying pathophysiology of stroke in cancer patients is still
      not fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the stroke mechanisms in
      patients with cancer-associated stroke.

      Patients with cryptogenic embolic stroke will be prospectively enrolled and categorized into
      two groups according to the presence of active cancer: cryptogenic embolic stroke with active
      cancer (cancer-associated stroke) vs. without active cancer (cryptogenic embolic stroke). All
      patients will undergo brain MRI/MRA, 12-lead electrocardiography, transthoracic and
      transesophageal echocardiography with injection of agitated saline, and 24-hour Holter and/or
      telemonitoring. Duplex ultrasonography to detect venous thrombosis of the lower extremity
      will also be performed in patients with a positive right-to-left shunt on echocardiography.
