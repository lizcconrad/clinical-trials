  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part study designed to provide an initial assessment on the safety, tolerability,
      and PK of rivipansel, following single ascending (Part 1) and multiple ascending dosing (Part
      2) given subcutaneously with rHuPH20, in healthy subjects. Part 1 of the study will be
      conducted using a cross-over design while Part 2 of the study will be conducted using a
      parallel design.
