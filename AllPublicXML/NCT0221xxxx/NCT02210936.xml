  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brandeis University and University of South Carolina (USC) have joined together to develop
      the South Carolina Opioid Safety Initiative - Military (SCOSI-M), to develop an academic
      detailing (medical education) intervention for physicians and evaluate its effectiveness in a
      pilot study. The goal of the intervention is to increase the use of safe prescribing and
      prescription monitoring practices among primary care physicians. The research team will
      design and pilot an educational intervention for physicians who treat military personnel,
      veterans, and their families with prescription opioids. The overall aim of SCOSI-M is to
      prevent the onset or progression of prescription drug problems among Iraq and Afghanistan
      veterans, military members, and their families who are at high risk for developing problems
      if their treatment involves long-term use of an opioid.

    <description>The design is primarily a pre-post, non-equivalent comparison group test of program effectiveness. If final sample size permits, we will examine program effects for each practice environment separately. For measures that require interview data there will be no comparison group data.
We will construct matched comparison groups of physicians for each environment for which only secondary data analysis will be conducted. The matched comparison group will be constructed using prescription data from the DoD's pharmacy data transaction system (MACH and DORN VAMC) and from SCRIPTS (community-based physicians and VA prescribers).</description>
