    <textblock>
      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab is FDA approved to treat metastatic melanoma or
      non-small cell lung cancer after the disease has gotten worse while receiving platinum-based
      chemotherapy. Ipilimumab is FDA approved to treat metastatic melanoma. The use of nivolumab
      and ipilimumab in this study is investigational.

      Bevacizumab is approved for certain types of kidney cancer and several other types of cancer,
      including breast, colon, and lung cancer. It is not FDA approved for the treatment of
      metastatic kidney cancer. The use of bevacizumab in this study is investigational. The study
      doctor can explain how the study drug(s) are designed to work.

      Up to 105 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the roll of dice) to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of
      being assigned to each group.

      If you are in Group N, you will receive nivolumab alone.

      If you are in Group N-B, you will receive nivolumab and bevacizumab.

      If you are in Group N-I, you will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are in Group N, you will receive nivolumab by vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of
      Weeks 1, 3, and 5. You will not receive this drug again until Week 14. Starting at Week 14,
      you may begin receiving the drug again every 2 weeks.

      If you are in Group N-B, you will receive nivolumab by vein over about 60 minutes and
      bevacizumab by vein over about 90 minutes on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 3, and 5. You will not receive
      these drugs again until Week 14. Starting at Week 14, you may begin receiving nivolumab again
      every 2 weeks.

      If you are in Group N-I, you will receive nivolumab by vein over about 60 minutes and
      ipilimumab by vein over about 90 minutes on Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 4. You will not receive
      these drugs again until Week 14. Starting at Week 14, you may begin receiving nivolumab again
      every 2 weeks.

      Study Visits:

      If you are in Group N or Group N-B, on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 3, and 5 or if you are in Group N-I,
      during Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 4:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your blood oxygen level will be tested.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. During Week
           1 only, this blood or urine will also be used for a pregnancy test if you can become
           pregnant.

      All patients will have the following tests and procedures below:

      During Week 8:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your blood oxygen level will be tested.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be collected for immune system testing.

        -  You will have CT or MRI scans to check the status of the disease.

      You will have surgery on Week 10. During surgery, tumor tissue will be collected for immune
      system testing. You will sign a separate consent explaining the surgery and its risks. If
      during screening you were told that you were not eligible to have surgery at Week 10, you
      will have a biopsy after your last dose of study drug.

      After Surgery (during Week 14, 15, or 16):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be collected for immune system testing.

        -  You will have CT or MRI scans to check the status of the disease.

      Every 12 weeks starting in Week 26, 27, or 28, you will have CT or MRI scans to check the
      status of the disease.

      The schedule of tests and procedures may change if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug(s) for up to 2 years after surgery. You will no longer
      be able to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you stop receiving treatment:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your blood oxygen level will be tested.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have CT or MRI scans to check the status of the disease.

        -  If at screening you were told that you were not eligible to have surgery at Week 10, you
           will have a biopsy after your last dose of study drug.

      Follow-up Visits:

      About 30 days after you stop treatment and again around 86 days after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your blood oxygen level will be tested.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Every 3 months for the first 2 years after surgery, then every 6 months for the third year,
      then every year unless the disease get worse or if intolerable side effects occur:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

             are eligible for cytoreductive nephrectomy, metastasectomy or post-treatment biopsy.
             Diagnosis must be confirmed by pathologist review of screening biopsy. The
             determination of resectability will ultimately lie in the clinical judgment of the
             urologist and medical oncologist involved in the care of the patient.

          3. Patient must have measurable disease and is defined as a lesion that can be accurately
             measured on the long axis with a minimum size of 10 mm or a lymph node that can be
             accurately measured along the short axis of a minimum size of 15 mm (CT scan slice
             thickness can be no greater than 5 mm).

          4. Patients can have had prior treatment for RCC including prior surgery, radiation

         14. Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually active are exempt
             from contraceptive requirements. However WOCBP must still undergo pregnancy testing as
             described in these sections. Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who
             are sexually active with WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the
             implications of an unexpected pregnancy Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male
             subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of
             contraception. Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year when used consistently and correctly. At a minimum, subjects must agree to
             the use of two methods of contraception, with one method being highly effective and
             the other method being either highly effective or less effective as listed below:
             HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION: a) Male condoms with spermicide;

         15. (Continued from #12) b) Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral
             contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices
             (IUDs) such as Mirena by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner.; c)
             Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard; d) Tubal ligation; e) Vasectomy; f) Complete
             Abstinence* *Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual
             intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Abstinence
             is only acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, profession of
             abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception.

         16. (Continued from #12) Subjects who choose complete abstinence are not required to use a
             second method of contraception, but female subjects must continue to have pregnancy
             tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be
             discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence. LESS
             EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION: a) Diaphragm with spermicide; b) Cervical cap with
             spermicide; c) Vaginal sponge; d) Male Condom without spermicide*; e) Progestin only
             pills by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner; f) Female Condom* *A male and
             female condom must not be used together

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any other malignancy from which the patient has been disease-free for less than 2

             corticosteroids (&gt;10mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive
             medications within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug. Inhaled steroids and
             adrenal replacement steroids doses &gt;10mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in
             the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          5. Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Positive test for hepatitis B virus (HBV)

          6. Any underlying medical condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, will make
             the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse
             events, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that
             might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at
             high risk from treatment complications.

         11. Patients who have proteinuria at baseline. Patients who are unexpectedly discovered to
             have &gt;/= grade 2 proteinuria at baseline routine urinalysis should undergo a 24-hour
