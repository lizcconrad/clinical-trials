  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-dose, randomized, 5-way cross-over study, healthy volunteers were treated with
      the highest approved dose of octreotide, three different doses of Somatoprim (DG3173) and
      placebo control. The main purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of each
      treatment on the control of plasma glucose as well as the secretion of insulin and glucagon
      following a standard meal.
