  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to improve prediction of poor reading outcome at
      preschool age by using a combination of behavioural and neuroimaging measures and to evaluate
      a specific computerized training program to support children with problems during reading
      acquisition.
