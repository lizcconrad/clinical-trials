  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase II study in subjects with Human epidermal growth
      factor receptor (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer who received at least 2 prior lines
      of anti-HER2-targeted therapies of which at least one included a Trastuzumab-containing
      regimen. This study is a post-approval commitment with regulatory authorities. It is designed
      to evaluate whether treatment with Dual blockade promotes changes to biomarkers associated
      with immunomodulation. The primary endpoint of the study will be to evaluate changes in
      expression of biomarkers associated with immunomodulation between a pre-treatment biopsy and
      the disease progression biopsy. Secondary efficacy endpoints include overall response rate;
      clinical benefit rate; and progression-free survival (PFS); as well as safety/tolerability.
      All subjects will receive study treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable
      toxicity, or subject withdrawal. In case of disease progression during the treatment period,
      the subject will be followed-up for 30 days for safety evaluation. In case of study treatment
      discontinuation for any reasons other than disease progression, the subject will be
      followed-up for safety and efficacy assessments until disease progression, new anticancer
      therapy, death, withdrawal of consent or end of study, whichever comes first.

      This study will support a better understanding if the rapidly accumulating evidence for the
      importance of the immune microenvironment in HER2-positive breast cancer and the observed
      immunomodulation in the neoadjuvant setting can be confirmed in the advanced setting and
      support the putative mechanism of action of HER2 dual blockade and its potential function on
      the tumor microenvironment. No formal comparisons between treatment arms will be undertaken.
