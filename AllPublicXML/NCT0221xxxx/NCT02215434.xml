  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is an established side effect of Selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), causing symptoms
      such as loss of libido, arousal difficulties, or delayed orgasm or anorgasmia.

      Efficacy of testosterone therapy for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder
      (HSDD) in women has been demonstrated in studies including naturally and surgically
      menopausal women, either alone or in combination with estrogen, with or without progestin
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have reported an increase in the number of satisfactory sexual events recorded
      in a 4-week daily diary, as a primary outcome, and reduction in associated personal distress.

      There is also evidence that testosterone therapy results in a similar improvement in sexual
      function in premenopausal women with loss of libido.

      Testosterone therapy has been associated with significantly improved well-being in studies in
      which the participants had low well-being at enrollment.

      Trials of testosterone for HSDD in women have excluded those with clinical depression, as
      well as those taking antidepressants.

      Whether testosterone will benefit women with HSDD who are taking an antidepressant is not
      known.

      The primary aim of this study was to examine the effects of transdermal testosterone therapy
      with a nanoemulsion BIOLIPID B2 on sexual function in women at midlife, who were experiencing
      treatment-emergent low libido. The primary study outcome was the change in the total score of
      the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-rating Scale (SSS).

      In line with previous studies of women without depression, efficacy was measured by the
      change in the frequency of SSEs over 4 weeks, as well as the domains of the SSS, general
      well-being, depression, and mood status.

      In this present study these factors will be analized in 12 weeks interval

    <measure>Safety of transdermal Testosterone Biolipid B2 effects</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety is assessed by comparing the rates of adverse events in the two treatment groups. Androgenic side effects including the frequency of facial depilation per month, hirsutism by the Ferriman-Gallwey scale (range 0-4 for each of nine body regions), acne by the Palatsi scale and clitoromegaly by examination were assessed at screening and the final visit.
We also monitor vital signs and concomitant medications.</description>

    <description>The study is a single-center, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial.
It consists of a 4-week screening period plus a 12-week treatment phase. At the screening visit, all participants underwent a physical examination including vital signs and breast and pelvic examination.
They were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a transdermal vehicle biolipid B2 (identical placebo) provided by Evidence Pharmaceuticals Inc, SP,BRAZIL.
The testosterone and placebo emulsion were alcohol-free matrixes that were applied topically to the forearm daily for the period of 12 weeks.</description>
