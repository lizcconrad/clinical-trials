      duration is 10 to 12 months. The study will enroll in up to 30 clinical sites.

      Test Product: One single-dose, pre-filled disposable applicator delivering approximately 5 g
      of cream containing approximately 100 mg of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2% (Watson
      Laboratories, Inc.)

      Reference Product: One single-dose, pre-filled disposable applicator delivering approximately
      5 g of cream containing approximately 100 mg of Clindesse® (clindamycin phosphate vaginal
      cream 2% ) (Ther-Rx™)

      Placebo Control: One single-dose, pre-filled disposable applicator delivering approximately 5
      g of cream containing vehicle of the test product (Watson Laboratories, Inc.)

      Dose and Mode A single applicator of investigational product cream will be administered of
      Administration once intravaginally at any time of the day. The subject participation is 22-30

    <time_frame>22 to 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Cure is defined as resolution of clinical signs and symptoms from entry visit as follows:
The original discharge characteristic of bacterial vaginosis has returned to a normal physiological vaginal discharge which varies in appearance and consistency depending on the menstrual cycle,
The whiff test is negative for any amine (&quot;fishy&quot;) odor,
The saline wet mount is negative for clue cells,
Vaginal fluid pH is &lt; 4.7, using pH paper that measures from 3.6 to 6.1. A bacteriological cure is defined as a Nugent score &lt; 4.
The system will use a 0-4 scale for evaluation of vaginal flora, based on the weighted sum of the following 3 bacterial morphotypes scores calculated from slide examination under oil immersion field (See appendix 11.2) :
Lactobacillus: large gram positive rods,
Gardenella / Bacteroides spp: Small gram variable coccobacilli/small Gram negative rods,
Mobiluncus spp.: thin, curved Gram variable rods.</description>
