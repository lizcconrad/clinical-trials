  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty five consecutive patients who had undergone intravitreal bevacizumab injection for
      Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion with macular edema were included in this study. All subjects
      were enrolled between April, 2012 and April, 2013 in the Department of Ophthalmology,
      Kyungpook National University Hospital.
