  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although several studies have considered the relationship between infertility and semen super
      oxide radical scavengers levels, no study on the effects of asthenospermia treatments such as
      oral zinc supplementation on superoxide radical scavengers activity which are important in
      fertility of the individual has been reported.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study was conducted to study the effect of zinc supplementation on the
      quantitative and qualitative characteristics of semen along with superoxide radical
      scavengers activity in the seminal plasma of asthenospermic patients.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  the presence of asthenozoospermia in the semen sample.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  the absence of endocrinopathy, varicocele, and female factor infertility. Smokers and
             alcoholic men were excluded from the study because of their recognized high seminal
             ROS levels and decreased antioxidant levels.
