  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absolute bioavailability (the extent to which a
      drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-42756493 following a single 10
      milligram (mg) dose as an oral solution administered in combination with a single intravenous
      administration of a microdose (100 microgram [mcg]) of JNJ-61818549 and to evaluate the
      relative bioavailability of 10 mg JNJ-42756493 following an oral solution (reference) and a
      tablet (test) formulation in a crossover (method used to switch subjects from one study group
      to another in a clinical trial) design in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), open-label (all people know the
      identity of the intervention), 2-way crossover, single-dose, and single-center, Phase 1 study
      of oral JNJ-42756493 in healthy participants. The duration of the study is approximately
      36-63 days: 2-20 days Screening, two 7 days open-label treatment periods, 12-14 days washout
      and 12-14-day follow-up (Day 13-15 of period 2). All participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. In Treatment Sequence AB: JNJ-42756493 10 mg tablet
      formulation will be administered on Day 1 of Period 1 and 100 mcg JNJ-61818549 will be
      administered intravenously 2 hours after the intake of 10 mg JNJ-42756493 oral solution on
      Day 1 of Period 2. In Treatment Sequence BA: 100 mcg JNJ-61818549 will be administered
      intravenously after the intake of 10 mg JNJ-42756493 oral solution on Day 1 of Period 1 and
      10 mg JNJ-42756493 tablet formulation will be administered on Day 1 of Period 2. A minimum 12
      days washout is required between treatment periods. Participants will primarily be analyzed
      for pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues
      over time). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
