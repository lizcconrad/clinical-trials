      RATIONALE

        1. In patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, there is sometimes a discrepancy between
           actual clinical outcome and TNM stages because it is an anatomy-based system in which
           functional factors are not concerned.

        2. Hemoglobin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and platelet count were proved to improve
           prognosis prediction of TNM staging system in our previous retrospective study.

      PURPOSE To validate that the prognostic index based on complete blood count and TNM system
      had higher prediction efficiency on survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma than TNM system
      alone.

      500 patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be include and will be divided
      into 3 groups (Low Risk, Intermediate Risk and High Risk Groups) according to their
      prognostic index, which is on basis of blood cell count indexes and TNM stage. The 3 groups
      of patients will undergo a radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and be followed until
      death or the end of the study. Comparison on survivals of the 3 groups will be made to
      validate the accuracy of the prognostic index. And comparison on prediction efficacy between
      prognostic index and TNM staging system will be made.
