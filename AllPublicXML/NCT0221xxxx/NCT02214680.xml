    <textblock>
      In this study we will explore the combined effect of Brimonidine and Timolol 0.5% (Combigan)
      eye drops on pupil dilation. It is a well studied phenoma that Brimonidine and a miotic
      effect on the pupil, however the combined effect of alpha agonist and beta blocker has not
      been studied.

      The study subjects will be examined twice, two weeks apart. On the first exam the subject
      will receive Combigan eye drop to the right eye and a Brimonidine drop to the left eye. The
      effect on pupil size before and 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 240 minutes, and 300 minutes after
      instillation of eyedrops. On the second exam the subject will receive Timolol (0.5%) eye drop
      to the right eye and a Brimonidine drop to the left eye. The effect on pupil size before and
      30 minutes, 60 minutes, 240 minutes, and 300 minutes after instillation of eyedrops.
