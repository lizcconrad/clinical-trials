  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the hospitalized patients with increased
      waist circumference exhibit cardiorespiratory alterations after chest physical therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physiotherapist assessment will consist of anthropometry (body mass index, abdominal
      circumference, adipometer); chest inspection and palpation, vital signs (blood pressure,
      heart rate, respiratory frequence, oxymetry), dyspnea index and capillar blood glucose; and
      later with pulmonary tests (thoracoabdominal perimetry, respiratory muscle strength and
      pulmonary volume and capacity). This will be a quasi-experimental study. Patients will be
      divided into four groups according to waist circumference (increased or not, with respect to
      cardiovascular risk) and respiratory disorders (obstructive and restrictive). After this
      assessment, chest physical therapy will begin according to the protocol for obstructive and
      restrictive respiratory disorders. The treatment will have an average duration of 30 minutes.
      At the end of treatment (single session) the patient will be assessed again after five and
      thirty minutes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in spirometric measures.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, five and thirty minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The spirometry is used to assess chest volume and capacity of individual patients respiratory disease and their response to therapy and is regarded as the gold standard measure of respiratory function. The following variables were recorded; forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume achieved in 1 second.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of pulse oxymetry before/after chest physiotherapy. Comparison of blood pressure before/after chest physiotherapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, five and thirty minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The pulse oxymetry or pulse oximeter is used to measure peripheral oxygen saturation.
The arterial blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) will be measured by sphygmomanometer to follow the displacement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of heart rate variability before/after chest physiotherapy. Comparison of thoracoabdominal perimetry before/after chest physiotherapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, five and thirty minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate variability has become the conventionally accepted term to describe variations of both instantaneous heart rate and intervals (time domain).
Thoracoabdominal perimetry consists of a set of measurements of thoracic and abdominal circumferences during respiratory movements, and it aims at quantifying the thoracoabdominal mobility.</description>
