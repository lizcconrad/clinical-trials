  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating experimental evidence to suggest the role of essential fatty acids
      (EFA) in neuronal migration, pruning and synaptic plasticity. These processes are implied to
      be dysfunctional on early stages of schizophrenia, according to neurodevelopmental
      hypothesis. Numerous epidemiological and clinical trial data support the benefit of EFA rich
      diets in reducing symptoms in schizophrenia. An EFA rich diet might be of particular
      importance at the beginning of the illness. As a relatively safe option, EFA supplementation
      would be a preferable add on therapy in treating individuals with a first episode of
      schizophrenia (FES) and a short duration of psychotic symptoms. No long term follow-up
      studies of EFA supplementation in FES patients were carried out. The demonstration of the
      efficacy of the prophylactic properties of EFAs in relapse prevention in FES patients would
      be a strong basis for further studies and prescribing EFAs for a large population of patients
      who are in the early stages of that debilitating illness.

    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [64] will be used to assess the efficacy of EPA+DHA supplementation in reducing symptom severity in first-episode schizophrenia after 8 and 26 weeks of supplementation. The main outcome measure will be the change in symptom severity from baseline to week 26. Baseline PANSS total score will be subtracted from PANSS score obtained after 26 weeks, resulting in the degree of change observed in the study.</description>
