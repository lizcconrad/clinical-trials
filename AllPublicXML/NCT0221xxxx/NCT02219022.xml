      A randomized controlled trial with rheumatoid arthritis patients will be realized. Patients
      will be randomized into two groups. Experimental group will do a 12 weeks training of
      progressive resistance exercise for global muscles and remain with the clinical treatment and
      the control only remain with the clinical treatment. Patients will be evaluated at baseline,
      after 6, 12 and 24 weeks.

    <description>Patients in experimental group participated in a 12-week progressive resistance training using a maximum repetition exercise in which patients performed 1 Maximum Repetition with the maximum bearable weight. Once the 1 Maximum Repetitionwas determined, training was divided into the following regimen: 2 series of 8 repetitions, the first with 50% and the second with 70% of 1 Maximum Repetition.
The exercises were knee extension and flexion and hip abduction and adduction, elbow extension and flexion, wrist extension and flexion and shoulder abduction and adduction and spine extension and flexion all performed in machines. The 1 Maximum Repetition load was reevaluated every 6 weeks.
Patient remain with their usual clinical treatment.</description>
