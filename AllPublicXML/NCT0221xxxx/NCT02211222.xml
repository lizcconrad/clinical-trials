  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Expanded Access Program (EAP) consists of a Prerandomization Phase and a Randomization
      Phase. Only subjects with radioiodine-refractory DTC who fulfill the eligibility criteria
      will be treated. These subjects will be treated until progression of disease or unacceptable
      toxicity.

    <description>Lenvatinib at starting doses of 24-mg, 20-mg, or 14-mg will be administered as a combination of 10-mg capsules and 4-mg capsules to be taken once a day (QD) (recommended to be taken the same time each day). Subjects will receive one of three starting doses of lenvatinib, 24-mg/day, 20-mg/day, or 14-mg/day. Dose reductions occur in succession based on the previous dose level (24, 20, 14, and 10 mg/day). Any dose reduction below 10 mg/day must be discussed with the sponsor. Once the dose has been reduced, it cannot be increased at a later date.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnoses of one of the
             following DTC subtypes: a. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) i. Follicular variant ii.
             Variants (including but not limited to: tall cell, columnar cell, cribriform-morular,
             solid, oxyphil, Warthin's-like, trabecular, tumor with nodular fasciitis-like stroma,
             Hurthle cell variant of papillary carcinoma, poorly differentiated); b.Follicular
             thyroid cancer (FTC) i. Hurthle cell ii. Clear cell iii.Insular

          2. Subjects must be radioiodine-refractory or resistant within 12 months of radioiodine
             therapy and have one of the following:

               1. One or more lesions that do not demonstrate iodine uptake on any radioiodine scan

               2. One or more lesions that have substantially increased in size within 12 months of
                  radioiodine therapy, despite demonstration of radioiodine activity at the time of
                  that treatment by pre- or posttreatment scanning

               3. Cumulative activity of radioiodine of greater than 600 mCi or 22 gigabecquerels
                  (GBq), with the last dose administered at least 6 months prior to study entry

          3. Subjects must have received and failed treatment with sorafenib for RR-DTC. This
             criterion will not apply outside the United States if sorafenib is not commercially
             available in the country where the subject resides.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2

          5. Blood pressure (BP) less than or equal to 150/90 mmHg at screening with or without
             antihypertensive medications and no change in antihypertensive medications within 1
             week prior to Cycle 1 Day 1

          6. Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft and
             Gault formula

          7. Adequate bone marrow function

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL (can be corrected by growth factor
                  or transfusion)

               -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L

          8. Adequate liver function

               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) except for
                  unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia or Gilbert's syndrome

               -  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 x ULN (less than or equal to 5 x
                  ULN if subject has liver metastases). If ALP is greater than 3 x ULN (in the
                  absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in the presence of liver
                  metastases) AND subjects are also known to have bone metastases, the
                  liver-specific ALP must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver
                  function instead of the total ALP

          9. Provide written informed consent

         10. Males and females age greater than or equal to 18 years at the time of informed
             consent

         11. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test. Females of
             childbearing potential and male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing
             potential must use or their partners must use a highly effective method of
             contraception

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects having greater than 1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick at screening testing
             will undergo 24 h urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria.
             Subjects with urine protein greater than or equal to 1 g/24 h will be ineligible.

          2. History of congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             Classification greater than II, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, serious
             cardiac arrhythmia, or stroke within the past 6 months

          3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT interval (QTc) interval greater than or equal to 480
             msec

          4. Existing anti-cancer therapy-related toxicities of grade greater than or equal to 2,
             except alopecia and infertility

          5. History of intolerance to or progression on prior treatment with lenvatinib that led
             to the discontinuation of lenvatinib

          6. Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise subject's ability to safely complete the protocol

          7. Females who are pregnant (positive B-hCG test) or breastfeeding

          8. Eligible for any other lenvatinib study that is open for recruitment.
