  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled cohort study. This study will look at the
      effect of Ethinyl Estradiol 35mcg/Norethindrone 1mg and Ethinyl Estradiol 20
      mcg/Norethindrone 1mg on postpartum depressive symptoms and sexual function scores when
      compared to a control group using no hormonal contraception. Depressive symptoms and sexual
      function will be measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Arizona
      Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX), and Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women (BISF-W).
      Participants will begin taking the medication at Week 3 postpartum, and these outcomes will
      be measured at baseline (0-1 day postpartum), Week 3, and Week 6-7. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be an ethinyl estradiol dose related response in EPDS, ASEX, and
      BISF-W scores at Week 6-7, which would indicate a decrease in depressive symptoms and
      increase in sexual function in both of the oral contraceptive groups.
