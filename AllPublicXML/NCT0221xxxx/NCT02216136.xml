Final Vectra 3D will occur at 6-12 months after radiation in Group A, 3-6 months following last reconstructive intervention in Group B, and 6-12 months after mastectomy in Group C.</description>

    <description>Mastectomy and Reconstruction group (Group B): This group will have mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (defined as reconstruction process starting at time of initial mastectomy surgery). They may or may not require chemotherapy and radiation depending on their cancer staging as well as multiple steps of their breast reconstruction.</description>

        Females ages 22 - 70 years of age scheduled to undergo breast conservation therapy (BCT),
        mastectomy or mastectomy with immediate reconstruction for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS),
        lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and early stage breast cancer (Clinical Stages IA-IIB).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must be scheduled to undergo breast conservation therapy (BCT), mastectomy or
             mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (defined as initiating the reconstructive
             process at time of mastectomy) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma
             in situ (LCIS), and early stage breast cancer (Clinical Stages IA-IIB). Stage IIB
             tumors are 2-5 cm with micrometastases 0.2 to 2.0 cm in lymph nodes; or 2-5 cm tumor
             with 1-3 positive axillary or internal mammary lymph nodes, or &gt;5 cm with no lymph
             node involvement. Clinical staging, based on imaging and physical exam will be used
             for enrollment. Patients that are upstaged due to unexpected findings at the time of
             surgery/assessment of surgical pathology will be excluded at that time. For staging
             reference please see
             http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/patient/page2#keypoint13

          -  If multifocal/multicentric disease of the ipsilateral breast is encountered and
             patients are still deemed eligible for BCT or mastectomy per standard of care, then
             the tumor area will be calculated as the total volumes of the identified foci.

          -  Patient must be between 22-70 years old

          -  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive impairment

          -  History of previous lumpectomy (needle biopsies are eligible)

          -  History of radiation to the chest wall or breasts

          -  Patients unable to undergo MRI due to metallic implant or claustrophobia

          -  Patients that are pregnant since breast MRI is contraindicated

          -  History of previous breast surgery other than primary cosmetic augmentation

          -  Identification of a concurrent or synchronous contralateral cancer during the
             enrollment period

          -  Any patient that would not have been considered for BCT or reconstruction

          -  BCT patients planning to proceed with reconstruction during their study participation
