  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reported prevalence of disproportionate pain and disability among patients recovering
      from a fracture of the distal radius varies widely. Literature reports numbers between 1% and
      37%, perhaps in part because it is poorly defined, known by so many different names,
      subjective, and unverifiable.

      The investigators are interested in the effect of vitamin C after distal radius fractures on
      objective measurement of finger motion, patient reported outcome measures, and pain
      intensity, instead of the previously used, subjective and imprecise criteria for complex
      regional pain syndrome.

      Patients presenting to the Hand and Orthopaedic Trauma Services of MGH with a distal radius
      fracture will be asked to participate in this clinical trial. Patient will be randomly
      assigned to take either placebo or vitamin C 500 mg until full finger motion is attained as
      regarded by the treating physician at follow-up or for 6 weeks.

      The investigators hypothesize no difference in finger stiffness at 6 weeks measured by
      distance to palmar crease of the index through little finger between patients taking vitamin
      C or placebo after a distal radius fracture. Additionally, the investigators assess finger
      stiffness by range of motion and stiffness of the thumb, and difference in PROMIS upper
      extremity function and pain score both measured at six months.

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To establish the distance to palmar crease, we aske patients to make a fist and determine the distance from nail tip to palmar crease for each individual digit using a ruler. We defined total distance to palmar crease as the sum of the values for the index, long, ring, and small fingers.</description>

    <measure>Active flexion index through small finger</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Active flexion will be measured using a handheld goniometer. We calculate total active flexion of the index through small finger by summing flexion at the metacarpo-phalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints</description>
