  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project is designed as a 30-day pilot trial to demonstrate the safety and
      tolerability of resveratrol therapy in overweight adolescents to decrease liver fat, and
      improve insulin sensitivity to prevent type 2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Pilot study of 10 overweight or obese children with MRS determined fatty liver randomized to
      resveratrol or placebo. Primary outcome measures include change in liver triglyceride content
      as determined by MRS and improvement in insulin resistance as determined by the area under
      the curve of glucose excursion during a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test.

    <description>To determine efficacy of resveratrol to reduce hepatic and cardiac triglyceride content in adolescents with NAFL MR spectroscopy will be performed using a 3.0-Tesla whole-body magnet. Sixty-four spectra will be acquired and averaged for the determination of intracellular water and lipid content. LCModel software will be used to isolate and quantify lipid and water peaks. Hepatic steatosis will be defined as hepatic triglyceride content of &gt;.5% fat/water.</description>
