      Phase 2, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the clinical effects of oral
      administration of dexpramipexole for 6 months in subjects with chronic sinusitis with nasal
      polyps and eosinophilia.

      This open-labelled study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of dexpramipexole
      for reducing the number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood and in improving nasal polyp
      score when administered to 20 subjects with chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps and
      eosinophilia.

      Subjects will received dexpramipexole for up to 6 months and will have safety tests performed
      monthly and will have efficacy evaluations performed at month 1, month 3, and month 6 after
      beginning study drug.
