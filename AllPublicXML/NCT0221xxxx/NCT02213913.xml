      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given
      together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) (MYC)-associated B-cell lymphomas.
      Lenalidomide may stop the growth of B-cell lymphomas by blocking the growth of new blood
      vessels necessary for cancer growth and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, use substances made from living organisms
      that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from
      growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate,
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in
      different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving lenalidomide together with combination
      chemotherapy may be an effective treatment in patients with B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when added to dose-adjusted
      (DA)-etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide,
      rituximab (EPOCH-R) (hereby termed &quot;DA-EPOCH-RR&quot;) in patients with double hit lymphoma (DHL)
      lymphomas. (Phase I) II. To determine the 1- and 2-year progression free survival (PFS) of
      DA-EPOCH-RR in patients with DHL lymphomas. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate, complete response, and duration of response. II. Quality of life
      (QOL) measures using standardized scales. III. Toxicity assessment using version 4.0 of the
      National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      criteria.

      IV. Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-14. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      DA-EPOCH-R: Patients receive etoposide intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-4,
      prednisone PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, vincristine sulfate IV continuously on days 1-4,
      doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously on days 1-4, cyclophosphamide IV over 15 minutes on
      day 5, and rituximab IV over 4 hours on day 1 (per institutional guidelines). Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION PHASE: Patients who are transplantation (hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      [HSCT])-eligible receive BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan (BEAM)-conditioning
      regimen followed by autologous (auto)-HSCT or HSCT at the discretion of the treating
      physician. Patients who do not undergo HSCT in first remission receive lenalidomide
      maintenance for 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 1 year, and then periodically for 1 year.

             lineage (CD20, CD3) and cell of origin (CD10, BCL6 and MUM1) in addition to
             proliferative/prognostic markers (Ki-67, C-myc and BCL2). DHL will be identified using
             cytogenetics and/or immunohistochemistry as detailed in section 4.1.2 below.

          2. To define DHL, patients must have evidence of C-myc [defined as: Cytogenetic evidence
             (FISH or karyotype) of C-myc breaks (Increased copy number in itself is not considered
             positivity for C-myc) OR Positive IHC defined as &gt;40% of the lymphoma cells staining
             for C-myc] PLUS either:

               1. Breaks in BCL-2 via cytogenetic studies or

               2. BCL-2 immunopositivity in &gt;70% of lymphoma cells.

          3. Patients are allowed to have received radiotherapy before enrollment if radiation was

             measurable disease present. Further, at the investigator's discretion and for patients
             who are unstable, one cycle of R-CHOP is allowed prior to enrollment but no more than
             one cycle. For purposes of this trial, prednisone or other corticosteroids used for
             non-lymphomatous conditions will be allowed. In addition, a prior/recent short course

             allowed.

          4. AST and ALT &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x ULN (with
             exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver
             involvement with NHL or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment).

          5. Patients must have adequate renal function by virtue of GFR &gt; 50 ml/minute using
             Cockroft-Gault formula.

          6. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (platelets &gt;100,000 and ANC &gt;1,200).
             Patients with bone marrow involvement are allowed at the investigator's discretion
             regardless of cytopenias.

          7. ECOG PS 0-2.

             program, and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the REMS® program.

         10. Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as
             required in the lenalidomide REMS® program. (Please see study schema for further
             details)

         11. Able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients
             intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin).

         12. Ability to read, understand, and sign a written informed consent approved by each
             institutional IRB. Alternatively, patients with legal guardians who can read,
