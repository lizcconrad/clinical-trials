      This study evaluates the response to oxidative stress in healthy men and women after taking a
      blend of plant concentrate.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how blends of plant concentrates impacts oxidative
      stress in humans. Biomarkers of oxidative stress will be measured at three time points in 3
      month intervention. Based on our proof of concept dose response study, it was shown that the
      plant concentrate at the proposed dose can lower markers of oxidative damage and induce the
      production of antioxidant enzymes. We would like to confirm these findings and further
      evaluate the implication of increased antioxidative enzymes as seeing in our proof of concept
      study. An acute oxidative stress will be induced by a high glycemic drink and short aerobic
      exercise and the response during the induction of an acute oxidative stress as well as the
      recovery from an acute oxidative stress. Since the induction of antioxidative enzymes not
      only is linked to the protection of proteins and lipids from oxidative damage, it is also
      linked to the protection of DNA damage. Therefore, in this study, comet assay will be
      performed to evaluate the integrity of DNA.
