    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of a telehealth-based,
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention (problem-solving training: PST) for adult
      informal military family/friend caregivers of OIF/OEF service members with a
      deployment-related TBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has gained increasing attention in American society as it is now
      considered the &quot;signature injury&quot; of the Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom
      (OIF/OEF) campaigns. The chronic changes that often occur in the wake of TBI along with
      possible physical injuries may run a chronic, unremitting course, imposing great strain and
      distress upon family members who often assume a caregiver role with little preparation and no
      formal training for these wounded service members as they reintegrate back into civilian life
      post-deployment. Unfortunately, research has not adequately addressed the unique long-term
      needs of informal military caregivers of deployed service members with TBI (i.e., family
      members/close friends).

Delivery of the PST + usual care condition will be administered to caregivers over the course of 6 one-hour per week, telephone calls/sessions that will entail education related to problem-solving skills/problem-solving model and application to caregiving and managing caregiver related problems.</description>
