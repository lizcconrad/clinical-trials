      This study evaluates the 6 month exercise intervention (Taiji and gym course) combined with
      free use of communal recreation facilities in fall prevention.

      Morbidity, use of social services and health outcomes of aging women in province of Kuopio,
      Finland are also monitored. The study combines a six months supervised exercise, followed by
      six months free, but unsupervised, use of recreational facilities and observational period of
      second year into total of 2 year follow up duration.

    <textblock>
      In 2016, a 2-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be launched to investigate the
      effect of exercise on fall risk, injuries and subjective well-being (SWB) in aging women
      (n=1078) by using municipal sport services in cooperation with the city of Kuopio. The effect
      of the exercise intervention on functional capacity, muscle strength, bone, body composition,
      cognitive function, the use of health services and its cost effectiveness will also be
      studied.

      The trial will be carried out on women belonging to the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and
      Prevention (OSTPRE) Study, which is an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study,
      with a follow-up of 26 years. It investigates life style factors associated with fractures
      falls, bone mineral density and morbidity in a target population of 14 220 women, now aged
      between 75-84 year.

      The study combines combination of a 2-year fall prevention trial with the 26 years of life
      style and medical data from the previous OSTPRE follow up to provide meaningful answers
      whether municipal exercise program can provide cost effective health gain in elderly. In
      addition, the study aims to answer, who will benefit from the exercise the most and what are
      the underlying factors explaining efficacy in the women's previous 26 years of lifestyle and
      medical history. The study will help to develop strategies for societal fall prevention.
