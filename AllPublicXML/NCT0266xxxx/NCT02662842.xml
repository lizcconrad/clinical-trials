  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) via insulin pump therapy has been shown to
      improve quality of life and glucose control in many patients with diabetes opting for this
      treatment modality. Despite significant innovation and advancement in pump technology,
      insulin infusion sets have been an area where innovation has been significantly lacking with
      no clinical studies performed prior to product launches.

      BD has developed a subcutaneous infusion set with FlowSmart™ Technology designed to address
      patient comfort, insulin delivery and flow interruptions. According to preliminary animal and
      clinical studies, this technology results in lower infusion pressure indicating more
      consistent insulin delivery.

      The FlowSmart infusion set has been previously tested in prototype form with healthy
      non-diabetic subjects with the sets inserted by nurses, and with CSII-using patients who
      self-inserted the FlowSmart infusion set in a clinical research setting.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if insulin pump users prefer using the BD FlowSmart
      infusion set compared to their current set with respect to insertion pain and wear comfort.

    <description>At the study visit after completing both study periods (Visit 3), subjects will use a 15 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to indicate which insertion set was less painful to insert, the BD Flowsmart or their current infusion set. Effects of infusion set type will be tested for statistical significance using linear mixed models adjusting for the effect of subject, study site and period. The model will be used to generate a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the adjusted average pain rating using a multiple comparison approach.</description>

    <description>At the study visit after completing both study periods (Visit 3), subjects will use a 15 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to indicate their preference for the BD Flowsmart compared to their current infusion set based on their recent experience. Effects of infusion set type will be tested for statistical significance using linear mixed models adjusting for the effect of subject, study site and period. The model will be used to generate a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the adjusted preference rating using a multiple comparison approach.</description>
