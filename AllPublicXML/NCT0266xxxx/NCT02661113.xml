      Phase II:

      Primary Objectives:

      -To determine the effectiveness of dasatinib (Sprycel) with radiotherapy (RT) and 6 weeks of
      concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) administered at 75 mg/m^2/day followed by adjuvant
      temozolomide with concurrent dasatinib in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) as
      measured by overall survival.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the efficacy of this treatment as measured by radiographic response (RR),
           progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP).

        -  To characterize the safety profile of dasatinib (Sprycel) in combination with RT and
           concomitant TMZ in patients with newly-diagnosed GBM.

        -  To characterize the safety profile of dasatinib (Sprycel) in combination with adjuvant
           TMZ in patients with GBM after RT.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      -To correlate tumor genotype, tumor expression of dasatinib target proteins (e.g. Src, EphA2,
      c-kit and PDGFR), and PTEN levels with response to therapy with dasatinib and temozolomide.

      PHASE II (Study did not progress from Phase I)

      The Study Drugs:

      Dasatinib is designed to change the function of certain genes. By changing the function of
      these genes, it may prevent cancer from growing and spreading. It is also designed to block
      or lower the activity of one or more tumor-causing proteins responsible for the uncontrolled
      growth of tumor cells, which may result in shrinking or stopping tumor growth.

      Temozolomide is designed to kill cancer cells by damaging DNA (the genetic material of
      cells). The damaged DNA may cause tumor cell death.

      PHASE II Study Drug Administration

      Study Groups:

      If found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be assigned to a dose
      level of dasatinib based on when joined study. Up to 2 dose levels of dasatinib will be
      tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of dasatinib given in combination with temozolomide is found.

      All the groups will take the same dose level of temozolomide for the entire study.

      The amount of study drugs received may change if participant experiences side effects. If at
      any time participant experiences any intolerable side effects, tell the study doctor right
      away.

      Study Drug Administration:

      During Radiation:

      As a part of standard of care, participant will receive radiation therapy Monday-Friday for a
      total of 30 radiation treatments (about 6 weeks).

      Every day while participants are receiving radiation, they will take the temozolomide by
      mouth once a day for up to a maximum of 7 weeks.

      They should swallow temozolomide whole, one right after the other, without chewing them. If
      vomit while taking temozolomide, participant cannot take more capsules before the next
      scheduled dose. They should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hours
      after eating) with 1 cup (about 8 oz.) of water.

      Every day while receiving radiation, take dasatinib by mouth 1 time a day for up to a maximum
      of 7 weeks. Participant should take dasatinib without food (1 hour before or 2 hours after
      eating), with at least 1 cup (8 oz.) of water.

      After Radiation:

      After the radiation therapy ends, every day, participant will continually take dasatinib by
      mouth 1 time a day.

      They will not take temozolomide for about 4 weeks after the radiation therapy ends. After 4
      weeks, they will begin taking temozolomide 1 time a day, by mouth, on Days 1-5 of each 28 day
      study cycle.

      Study Visits:

      Four (4) weeks after the end of radiation, then every 4 weeks after that, the following tests
      and procedures will be performed:

        -  They will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs.

        -  They will have a neurological exam.

        -  They will have a performance status evaluation.

        -  They will be asked about any drugs they may be taking and if they have experienced any
           side effects.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check blood's ability to clot normally.

      Every week for the first 6 weeks, then every 4 weeks after that, they will be asked if have
      experienced any side effects.

      If they are taking an anti-seizure drug, every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks and then every 4
      weeks after that, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the levels of anti-seizure
      drug in blood.

      At Week 6, then before each cycle after radiation for the first 6 cycles, they will have an
      ECG.

      Every week for the first 6 weeks, then on Days 1 and 22 of every cycle after radiation, blood
      (about 3 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests.

      Four (4) weeks after the end of radiation, then every 8 weeks after that, they will have an
      MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      They may continue taking temozolomide for up to 12 cycles. They may continue taking dasatinib
      for as long as benefitting. they will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or
      experience intolerable side effects.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After going off study, they will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following
      tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Complete medical history will be recorded.

        -  They will have a physical exam.

        -  They will have a performance status evaluation.

        -  They will be asked about any drugs they may be taking and if they have experienced any
           side effects.

        -  They will have a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 1/2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests and to check blood's
           ability to clot normally.

        -  If they are taking an anti-seizure drug, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check
           the level of anti-seizure drug in blood.

      Long-Term Follow-up visit:

      After the end-of-study visit, the study team/staff will contact participants by telephone
      every 3 months to check how participants are doing. Each phone call will take about 5
      minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Temozolomide is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of brain tumors. Dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of some types of leukemia, but it is experimental for use in brain tumors. In
      addition, the combination of temozolomide and dasatinib is experimental for use in brain
      tumors. At this time, the combination is only being used in research.

      Up to 72 participants will take part in this study. Up to 72 will be enrolled at M. D.
      Anderson.

             diagnosis of a GBM is made.

          2. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study.

          3. Diagnosis will have been established by biopsy or resection 14-28 days prior to
             registration. In order to permit healing, patients should not receive Day 1 of
             treatment until at least 14 days after surgery.

          4. Patients must not have had prior cranial RT

             Anderson or outside facilities. Radiotherapy must be given by external beam to a
             partial brain field in daily fractions of 180 to 200 cGy, to a planned total dose to
             the tumor of approximately 6000 cGy. Stereotactic radiosurgery and brachytherapy will
             not be allowed.

          6. Patients must not have received prior cytotoxic drug therapy, non-cytotoxic drug

             least 5 days. If the corticosteroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and
             registration, then a new baseline MRI/CT is required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI
             or CT, must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement.
             The use of MRI rather than CT is preferred.

          9. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;/= 60.

         10. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC &gt;/= 3,000/µl, ANC &gt;/=

             ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

         15. Patients on the following medication will be excluded: a) Anticonvulsants: Patients on
             Enzyme Inducing Anticonvulsants (EIAED) will be excluded. If patients were previously
             on EIAEDs that have been discontinued, patients must have been off EIAEDs for &gt;/= 2
             weeks prior to initiation of dasatinib. It should also be noted whether patients were
             or were not previously receiving EIAEDs and the last date of administration of EIAEDs.

         16. ( 15. continued) b) Antacids: Use of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors is
             prohibited because systemic antacids (H2 inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors) decrease
             dasatinib absorption. Patients who require antacids should use short acting, locally
             active agents (e.g., Maalox, Mylanta etc.). However, these agents should not be taken
             within either 2 hours before or 2 hours after the dasatinib dose. This is particularly
             important in patients with glioblastoma who are frequently on dexamethasone and
             prophylactic H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors.

         17. (15. continued) c) Anticoagulants/Anti-platelets: Patients on therapeutic (treatment)
             dose of anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, low molecular-weight heparin) are not eligible.
             Patients are not allowed to take aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, Aggrenox. Patients
             on prophylactic anticoagulation may be enrolled and treated on study as long as their
             platelet count is monitored closely and maintained at &gt;75,000 while they are receiving
             Dasatinib.

         18. (15. continued) d) Ibuprofen and other NSAIDS: Ibuprofen and other non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can inhibit platelet function. Patients may not take
             ibuprofen or other NSAIDs at study entry and must have stopped these agents &gt;/=7 days
             prior to starting dasatinib to allow for an appropriate wash-out period.

         19. (15. continued) e) Inducers and Inhibitors of CYP3A4: Patients required to be on any
             of those drugs will be excluded (with the exception of Dexamethasone, but all efforts
             should be made to reduce the dose of dexamethasone). Patients may discontinue drug at
             least 7 days prior to starting dasatinib.

         20. (15. continued) f) Category I drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of
             causing Torsades de Pointes including: (Patients must discontinue drug at least 7 days
             prior to starting dasatinib) (1). quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide (2).
             amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide (3). erythromycin, clarithromycin (4).
             chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide (5). cisapride,
             bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone, halofantrine,
             levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine.
