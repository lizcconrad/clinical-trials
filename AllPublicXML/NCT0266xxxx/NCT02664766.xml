  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of long-term aerobic exercise of
      moderate intensity on psychological, physiological, biochemical, physiological and
      alcohol-related parameters in heavy drinkers, in order to investigate possible biochemical
      mechanisms by which exercise may be a healthy alternative to alcohol abuse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism of incentives that lead people to unhealthy habits such as excessive alcohol
      consumption is not only social, personal, and psychological, but also associated with
      neurochemical and neurobiological mechanisms.

      Several programs have been developed to stop excessive drinking, but the success rates are
      small, while the relapse rates are very high, reaching up to 90%. Although there is some
      evidence for the beneficial effects of exercise on alcohol use disorders, research is
      limited. The present study investigates whether exercise can act as adjunct therapy for
      alcohol abuse cessation.

      One of the basic assumptions is that the appropriate form of exercise in alcoholics will
      contribute to the secretion of beta-endorphin, which in combination with psychological
      pleasure, vitality, change of mood, reduced stress, increased confidence, and the shift of
      attention will help people to follow healthy lifestyles and abhor alcohol.

      The research project is divided in three phases. In the first phase, the effect of acute
      exercise in critical psychological, physiological, biochemical and alcohol-related parameters
      associated with excessive alcohol consumption will be examined. In the second phase (current
      study), a long-term exercise program in conjunction with psychological support strategies
      aimed at alcohol abuse cessation will be developed, implemented and evaluated. Finally, in
      the third phase, based on the results of the previous phases, awareness programs in
      adolescent and adult populations will be designed and implemented as well as the
      dissemination of results and evaluation of the project will take place.

Participants will be recording their daily alcohol consumption. Participants will also undergo three trials of acute exercise (before, at the 4th week and at the 8th week of exercise training) in order to investigate whether exercise training can lead to changes in acute responses to exercise. Each trial involves 30 min of exercise on a cycle ergometer at 50-60% HRR.</description>
