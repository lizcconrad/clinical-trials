  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-therapeutic, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who have received
      retroviral-based gene therapy products in cancer studies. All subjects in this LTFU protocol
      have received lentiviral modified T cells engineered to express an anti-EGFRvIII scFv
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to monitor adult subjects, who as participants of a
      clinical trial, received T cells modified by a lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen
      receptor specific for EGFRvIII, for adverse events that may be associated with lentiviral
      vector gene transfer such as insertional oncogenesis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be enrolled into this destination protocol because they have received
             CART-EGFRvIII cells that were genetically modified with a lentiviral vector. All
             subjects who have participated in a lentiviral vector study under IND 15968 and have
             received CART-EGFRvIII cells will be asked to participate in this protocol.

          -  Subjects 18 years of age and older

          -  Subjects who have provided informed consent prior to their study participation.
