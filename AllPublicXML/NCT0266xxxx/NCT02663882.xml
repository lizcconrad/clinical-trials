  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about self-control and adults who smoke
      cigarettes. It has been suggested that people can improve self-control by practicing tasks
      that require the use of self-control (such as delaying cigarettes or sitting up as straight
      as possible). The goal of this study is to learn about whether scores on self-control and
      other measures will change after one week of practicing self-control tasks at home. We
      believe that adults who smoke cigarettes will show better self-control after practicing tasks
      for a week.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine a smoking-related self-control task and smoking
      behavior in adult smokers who are not motivated to quit smoking.

      This pilot study will have a between-subjects design. All participants will be asked to
      complete two study appointments. First, they will complete a baseline appointment where they
      will review consent procedures. Participants who complete the consent forms will then be
      asked to fill out measures of demographics, smoking, and self-control. Smoking will be
      confirmed using expired breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels taken using a CO monitor. At that
      appointment participants will be randomly assigned to complete one of two self-control tasks:
      a task that is related to smoking (e.g., giving instructions to delay smoking when they have
      a craving) or a task that is not related to smoking (e.g., participants will be instructed to
      try to maintain the best posture possible (e.g., sit up straight, walk with good posture) as
      much as possible throughout each day Random assignment will be done using a random number
      generator and 50% of participants will be assigned to the smoking task while the other 50%
      will be assigned to the non-smoking task. Study staff will received standardized instructions
      to read to each participant about the task that they are assigned to practice during the
      week. Participants will be asked to practice their assigned self-control task every day for a
      week and to complete a brief series of questions about the effort and time spent practicing
      the task that day along with the number of cigarettes they smoked that day. After one week,
      participants will return for the second study appointment where they will report on their
      effort and time spent practicing the self-control tasks and complete additional measures of
      smoking and self-control.

    <measure>change in self-control as measured by the change in the length of time participants can hold a hand-grip</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to squeeze a hand-grip exerciser as long as possible and research staff will use a stopwatch to time the length of time that the hand-grip is squeezed. A wad of paper will be inserted between the handles of the hand-grip and timing will stop when the paper falls from the hand-grip indicating that the participant has released the hand-grip. The hand-grip will be held before and after a thought suppression exercise that is meant to diminish self-control in order to control for individual hand strength. Self-control will be measured as the difference in the length of time holding the hand-grip before and after the thought suppression exercise. Change in self-control due to task practice will be measured as [self-control at the second study appointment one week after the first appointment] minus [self-control at the first study appointment].</description>
