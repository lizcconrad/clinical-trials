  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the prospective randomized study is to investigate whether a intensified diabetic
      control program leads to better final visual acuity and less frequent diabetic ocular
      complications in patients with diabetic retinopathy when compared with a normal diabetic
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patints with diabetic macular edema (DME) will be treated with intravitreal ranibizumab
      injections and the effect of optimal control of internal factors (eg. glycemia, blood presure
      etc) on final functional (best corrected visual acuity-CBVA) and morphological (central
      retinal thickness-CRT) will be investigated. Patients will be randomized into two groups:
      Group with intensified diabetic control will be follow and investigated monthly at department
      of diabetology, endocrinology and nutritional medicine (Campus Benjamin Franklin) in Berlin
      with aim to reach the optimal glycemic control defined as HbA1c &lt; 6,5%. Further,
      triglycerides values &lt; 140 mg/dl and blood presure &lt; 140/90 mmHg will be pursued. Second
      group of patients will be followed by their general practitioner and in the study center only
      blood samples will be taken quarterly without active medical intervention.

      BCVA, CRT and the number of required ranibizumab injections will we evaluated and compared
      between both study groups.

    <description>Diabetic macular edema will be treated with 3 monthly ranibizumab (0,5mg) injections followed by PRN regimen. Patients randomized into this group will be controlled by their general practitioner or private diabetologist (usual care). The glycemic control (blood measurements of HbA1c) will be performed at trial site (Department of diabetology, endocrinology and nutritional medicine) every 3 months. The site will not influence or change the diabetes medication given by general physician and serves as an observer only to monitor the diabetic control.</description>

    <description>Diabetic macular edema will be treated with 3 monthly ranibizumab (0,5mg) injections followed by PRN regimen.
Patients randomized into this group will be controlled at the trial site (Department of diabetology, endocrinology and nutritional medicine) during first year monthly, in the second study year every 3 months. The individual HbA1c will be targeted according to the general status reflecting other risk factors for the vasculopathy (e.g. BMI, smoking, blood pressure, lipid status). All effort will be done to reach the target blood pressure ≤ 140/90 mmHg and blood triglyceride level &lt; 140 mg/dl: Further the patients will be educated to improve their eating habits in regard to reduce the carbohydrate intake.</description>
