      This study is designed to leverage the sensitivity of ultrasonography available in clinical
      practice setting to better describe the time course of response to secukinumab (150 mg and
      300 mg) on joint synovitis and enthesitis in PsA patients with an inadequate response to
      non-biologic DMARDs. PDUS changes in joint synovitis will be assessed using the global
      Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)-European League against Rheumatism (EULAR)
      synovitis score (GLOESS) and changes in joint enthesitis will be assessed using the OMERACT
      enthesitis score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 52-week, multicenter, international study consisting of a 2 to 4-week Screening
      period, a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period (Period 1), a
      12-week open-label treatment period (Period 2) and a 6-month open-label extension period
      (Period 3).

      Treatment Period 1 is a 12-week placebo-controlled, randomized period primarily designed to
      demonstrate the early and optimal efficacy of secukinumab vs placebo on joint synovitis using
      PDUS via the GLOESS and global entheseal score after 12 weeks of treatment.

      The main aim of Period 2 is to assess the maintenance or increased magnitude of treatment
      response on joint synovitis for patients from the original secukinumab groups and to assess
      the time course of response with secukinumab on joint synovitis in the original placebo group
      switched to secukinumab from Week 12.

      The main aim of Period 3 (extension period) is to allow patients who respond to secukinumab
      to extend study treatment up to Week 52 or until commercial drug becomes available, whichever
      occurs sooner.
