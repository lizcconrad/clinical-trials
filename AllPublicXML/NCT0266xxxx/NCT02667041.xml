  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating illness that affects millions of
      individuals in North America and can result in clinical symptoms including loss of pleasure
      and feelings of worthlessness, in addition to significant cognitive impairments (e.g.,
      memory, attention) that affect daily functioning. Major depression bears a heavy burden for
      the individuals and family members afflicted, as well as an enormous health care and economic
      cost. Approximately half of major depressive patients seek out treatment for their illness
      and only 20% of those individuals report their treatment as satisfactory. Many MDD patients
      do not respond to pharmacological therapy following the first course of treatment, resulting
      in the need for alternative measures to alleviate the clinical and cognitive symptoms of
      treatment-resistant depression and the targeting of these therapies to better suit each
      individual patient. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well-accepted,
      non-invasive technique that utilizes currents to induce electrical fields that excite
      specific brain regions. The current recommended practice of rTMS involves the administration
      of a biphasic stimulus waveform; however, a novel method using monophasic pulses may prove
      more effective for the treatment of depression. The present study aims to determine the
      effect of monophasic rTMS compared to biphasic rTMS on cognitive processing in MDD patients
      through electrophysiological recordings of the brain taken before and after 6 weeks of
      stimulation. Additionally, the study aims to investigate various biological markers linked to
      clinical rTMS response; these brain markers will help in personalizing treatment for
      individuals suffering from MDD.

          2. are voluntary and competent to consent to treatment

          3. have a confirmed DSM-IV diagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorder

          4. are male or female

          5. are between the ages of 18 and 75

          6. have failed to achieve a clinical response to an adequate dose of an antidepressant in
             the current episode OR have been unable to tolerate at least 2 separate trials of
             antidepressants of inadequate dose and duration

          7. have a score &gt; 22 on the MADRS

          8. have had no increase or initiation of any psychotropic medication in the 4 weeks prior
             to screening

          9. are able to adhere to the treatment schedule

         10. pass the TMS safety screening questionnaire (TASS)
