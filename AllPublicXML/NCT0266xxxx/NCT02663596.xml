    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the safety of delivering continuous infusion
      (CI) vancomycin in pediatric CRRT by utilizing CI via by mixing the vancomycin into the CRRT
      solution(s). The secondary objectives are to describe the ability to achieve therapeutic
      vancomycin concentrations by utilizing this new delivery technique.

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine whether delivering continuous infusion vancomycin mixed into the CRRT solution
      can maintain therapeutic levels of drug in patients being treated for proven or suspected
      Gram-positive bacterial infections.

      Treatment Patients deemed candidates for CRRT and antimicrobial therapy for a proven or
      suspected Gram-positive bacterial infection that includes vancomycin at the time of CRRT
      initiation or at any time during the CRRT course. If vancomycin is part of the empiric
      regimen or needed for definitive therapy an assessment will be made whether the vancomycin
      can be administered via a continuous infusion by mixing the vancomycin in the CRRT
      solution(s).

      Intervention Administration of continuous infusion vancomycin via mixing vancomycin in the
      CRRT solution(s). The CRRT solution will be prepared at the time it is needed following
      current standard operating procedures of the Department of Pharmacy at St. Christopher's
      Hospital for Children for sterile product compounding. The amount of vancomycin to be added
      to the CRRT solution will be determined by the clinical condition such as the site of
      infection,infecting organism(s), and serum drug levels. The mixed solution will be infused
      for the duration it is prescribed for CRRT. Vancomycin is stable with the components of the
      CRRT solution for at least 96 hours, therefore the frequency with which each CRRT solution
      bag will be prepared will not exceed 96 hours.

      Vancomycin dosing and concentration adjustments:

      For patients started on vancomycin after initiation of CRRT, a single loading dose of 15-20
      mg/kg of total body weight will be given intravenously over 60 minutes, after which the
      vancomycin will be added directly to the CRRT solution(s). Vancomycin will be added at a
      final concentration of 30 mg/L at CRRT initiation, regardless of age. For patients receiving
      vancomycin prior to the initiation of CRRT, if the last dose administered is &gt; 8 hours prior
      to CRRT initiation, a loading dose of 15-20 mg/kg of total body weight will be given
      intravenously over 60 minutes, after which the vancomycin will be added directly to the CRRT
      solution(s). Vancomycin will be added at a final concentration of 30 mg/L at CRRT initiation,
      regardless of age. The first serum vancomycin level will be determined 8-12 hours after
      initiation of CRRT mixed with vancomycin. All serum for vancomycin concentrations
      determination will be obtained directly from the patient via a central line, arterial line or
      peripheral venipuncture and no vancomycin concentrations will obtained from the CRRT circuit
      for analysis.

      Vancomycin concentrations in the CRRT solution(s) will be adjusted based on the initial
      vancomycin serum plateau level, and subsequent levels will be obtained based on these
      changes. The target vancomycin plateau serum concentrations range is 15-30 mg/L. If the first
      vancomycin plateau level obtained is within range, daily vancomycin plateau levels will be
      obtained for the duration the vancomycin is mixed in the CRRT solution. If the first
      vancomycin plateau level is not within range, the vancomycin concentration in the CRRT
      solution will be adjusted. Subsequent vancomycin plateau levels will be obtained 8-12 hours
      after the vancomycin concentration change and this process will continue until a therapeutic
      plateau level is obtained. Once a therapeutic plateau level is obtained, daily vancomycin
      plateau levels will be obtained for the duration the vancomycin is mixed in the CRRT
      solution.

      Based on the initial concentration of vancomycin in the CRRT solution, the flow rates, and
      the serum plateau level, adjustments to the vancomycin concentration in the CRRT solution as
      follows;

      Dose (mg/hr) = Concentration observed (mg/L) * Clearance (L/hr)

      The dose in mg/hr will include the amount of vancomycin from all of the flow rates from all
      sources of the CRRT solution. When the first serum plateau level is obtained, the equation
      can be solved to determine the clearance in L/hr. Once the clearance is determined, the
      desired steady state concentration (Css) can be inputted and the new dose in mg/hr can be
      determined. Based on the flow rates and the dose (mg/hr) needed to obtain the desired Css,
      the concentration needed in CRRT solution to deliver the dose can be determined.

      If the CRRT flow rates remain constant, the process for evaluating the serum plateau levels
      and potential changes to the vancomycin concentration in the CRRT solution can be simplified
      as follows; Vjc = Vjcn Vpobs Vpdes

      Vjc = Vancomycin CRRT solution concentration Vjcn = New vancomycin CRRT solution
      concentration Vpobs = Observed vancomycin plateau level Vpdes = Desired vancomycin plateau
      level

      Once the first vancomycin plateau level (Vpobs) is obtained, the vancomycin concentration in
      the CRRT solution is already known (Vjc). The desired or target vancomycin plateau level
      (Vpdes) can then entered and the equation solved to determine the new vancomycin CRRT
      solution concentration (Vjcn).

      Blood samples for vancomycin analysis will be obtained 8-12 hours after starting the CRRT
      solution mixed with vancomycin. Based on the first drug level obtained, changes to the
      concentration may be made to adjust to the desired serum concentration and serum levels will
      be obtained 8-12 hours after each change to the vancomycin concentration in the CRRT
      solution. Once a therapeutic level is obtained, serum levels will be obtained as needed but
      usually not more frequently than daily.

      If the first vancomycin plateau level is &lt; 10 mcg/mL, then a single, supplemental dose of 10
      mg/kg of vancomycin will be given while the vancomycin CRRT concentration is being adjusted.
