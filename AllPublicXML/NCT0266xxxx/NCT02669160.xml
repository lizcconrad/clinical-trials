  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) includes all the sensorimotor development disorders leading to balance,
      gait and movement disruptions. These disorders are related to lesions of the central nervous
      system (CNS) that occurs at birth or during the early childhood. The therapeutic management
      of CP is essentially based on reeducation, but may also require specific medical treatments,
      orthopedic devices and sometimes bone surgery. Therefore, CP children are very often placed
      in specialized institutions with a significant socioeconomic impact. CP children suffer from
      various sensorimotor impairments, which may evolve into orthopedic deformations, justifying
      the implementation of restrictive devices. The French High Authority of Health (HAS)
      estimates that 50 % of CP children have pains when using contention or verticalization
      devices. These pains are mainly nociceptive and are caused by the passive constraint applied
      on contact points. Many clinical trials evaluating the physiotherapy benefits on CP patients
      have led to controversial results regarding the duration of the effect of this therapeutic
      approach. However, the improvement is more important when neuromuscular facilitation
      techniques are added to the reeducation program. Human neuronal adaptation and plasticity
      mechanisms are now understood, with the possibility of a potential partial recovery.
      Non-invasive stimulation methods and neurorehabilitation techniques could participate in the
      CNS re-calibration. Automated assisted movements have already been used and these processes
      showed an increase joint range of motion, bone density and decreased spasticity.

      In recent years, &quot;exoskeleton&quot; devices have been used on subjects with spinal cord injuries
      allowing motor performances improvement.

      This pilot study aims evaluating CP children's tolerance to motorized orthosis reproducing
      walking pattern compared with conventional passive standing-up devices. For this clinical
      trial, the investigators compare the behavior of CP children using a motorized orthosis
      reproducing walking pattern (Innowalk Pro Small) to the behavior of same children placed in
      their usual conventional passive device. The investigators hypothesis is that the Innowalk
      improves joints range of motion, enhances selective motor control, decreases the medium-term
      spasticity and offers at least the same tolerance as conventional passive devices.
