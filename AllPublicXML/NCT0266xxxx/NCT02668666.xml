      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, phase II study of palbociclib
      in combination with tamoxifen in women with HR(+)/HER2(-) advanced breast cancer who have not
      received prior systemic anticancer therapies for their advanced/metastatic disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

        -  Palbociclib 125 mg will be administered orally once daily on days 1-21 (D1-D21) of each
           28-day cycle. Subjects will not take palbociclib on D22-D28.

        -  Tamoxifen 20 mg will be administered orally once daily for every day of the 28-day cycle
           (i.e., continuously).

      Palbociclib should be taken with food in combination with tamoxifen. Subjects should take
      their dose at approximately the same time each day.

      It is encouraged, but not mandatory, that premenopausal subjects will also receive treatment
      with goserelin or equivalent (e.g., Lupron) given as an injectable subcutaneous implant on D1
      of every 28 days cycle or every 3 months.

      Disease assessments will be performed at the completion of every 2 cycles.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or
      subject death either from progression of disease, the therapy itself, or from other causes.
      Subjects who voluntarily stop the study, have progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicities
      will be followed for a total of 24 months after discontinuation of study drug.

      To demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 14 days
      prior to registration for protocol therapy:

      Hematological (must meet ALL of the following criteria):

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10 9/L

        -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

        -  Platelet count ≥ 100 × 10 9/L

      Renal (must meet ONE of the following criteria):

        -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN

        -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × ULN, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40 mL/min

      Hepatic (must meet ALL of the following criteria):

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known
           hepatic metastases

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN or ≤ 5 × ULN for subjects with known hepatic
           metastases

        -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in
        this study:

          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age at time of consent. NOTE: Both pre- and
             post-menopausal women are eligible. Pre-menopausal status is defined as either:

               -  Last menstrual period within the last 12 months.

               -  In case of therapy-induced amenorrhea, plasma estradiol and /or FSH is in the
                  premenopausal range per local normal range.

          -  Locally advanced, locoregionally recurrent, or metastatic disease, not amenable to
             curative therapy. NOTE: Although not required as a protocol procedure, a patient with
             a new metastatic lesion should be considered for biopsy whenever possible to reassess
             ER/PR/HER2 status if clinically indicated. If a biopsy is prospectively done as part
             of standard of care, the study would like to store samples for correlative research.

          -  Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of ER positive and/or PR
             positive (ER &gt;1%, PR &gt;1%), HER2 negative breast cancer. NOTE: Subject has
             HER2-negative breast cancer (based on most recently analyzed biopsy) is defined as a
             negative in situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0, 1+ or 2+. If IHC is 2+, a
             negative in situ hybridization (e.g. FISH, CISH, SISH, DISH, etc.) test is required by
             local laboratory testing.

          -  Metastatic disease evaluable on imaging studies. Subjects may have measurable disease
             as per RECIST 1.1 or bone-only disease. NOTE: Bone-only subjects are eligible if their
             disease can be documented/ evaluated by bone scans, CT or MRI. Their disease will be
             assessed using MDA criteria. NOTE: Previously irradiated lesions are eligible as a
             target lesion only if there is documented progression of the lesion after irradiation.

          -  No prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for advanced HR+ disease. NOTE: Subjects
             receiving adjuvant treatment with aromatase inhibitors at time of recurrence are
             allowed to participate. There is no AI washout period required.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2

          -  Provided written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
             Act of 1996 (HIPAA) authorization for release of personal health information, approved
             by an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). NOTE: HIPAA
             authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained separately.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. A
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test is required within 72 hours of study
             registration from women of childbearing potential. If the urine test cannot be
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCP) must be willing to use two effective methods of
             birth control such as use of a double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, or
             vaginal ring with spermicidal jellies or cream), or total abstinence for the course of
             the study until 120 days after the last dose of study drug. The use of hormonal
             contraceptives is discouraged. NOTE: Women are considered to be of childbearing
             potential unless they are postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months or
             surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             hysterectomy).

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures.

          -  Male subjects capable of fathering a child must agree to use adequate contraception or
             total abstinence for the course of the study until 120 days after the last dose of the
             study drug.

        NOTE: Male subjects will be considered as capable of fathering a child unless they have
        azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical
        condition).

          -  Co-enrollment in an imaging biomarker study or other non-therapeutic study is allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:

          -  Prior treatment with any CDK 4/6 inhibitor.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of HER2 positive disease.

          -  Known uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases. Subjects with known brain metastasis
             will only be eligible after their tumors have been treated with definitive resection
             and /or radiotherapy and they are neurologically stable for at least 1 month off
             steroids.

          -  Advanced, symptomatic, visceral spread with a life expectancy less than 4 months.

          -  Concurrent malignancy or malignancy within 3 years of randomization, with the
             exception of adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin carcinoma,
             non-melanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervical cancer.

          -  Any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the
             investigator's judgment, contraindicate subject participation in the clinical study.
