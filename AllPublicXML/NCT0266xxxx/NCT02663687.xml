  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is looking to gain information about the safety and tolerability of an
      investigational treatment (SHP623) in healthy adult volunteers. This study will also collect
      pharmacokinetic data (how the body absorbs and breaks down the study drug).

          2. Male, or non-pregnant, non-lactating female, who agrees to comply with any applicable
             contraceptive requirements of the protocol, or females of non-child-bearing potential.

          3. Body mass index between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 inclusive with a body weight &gt;50 kg (110
             lbs.). This inclusion criterion will be assessed only at the first screening visit.

          4. Hemoglobin ≥12.0g/ld.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a history of allergic reaction to C1 INH products (e.g. C1 Inhibitor [Human],
             Berinert [C1 Estrace Inhibitor (Human)] and C1 estrace [recombinant]

          2. Known history of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year.

          3. Donation of blood or blood products within 60 days prior to receiving investigational
             product.

          4. Current use of any medication except hormonal replacement therapy, hormonal
             contraceptives and occasional use of any over-the-counter non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or acetaminophen.

          5. Have a history of hypercoagulability or other predisposition to thrombotic events.
