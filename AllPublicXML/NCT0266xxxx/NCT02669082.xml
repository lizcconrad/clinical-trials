      This study will explore the effect of ramelteon 8 mg once daily for 8 weeks for the treatment
      of insomnia patients with depression by using actigraphy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ramelteon. Ramelteon is being tested to treat
      people who have insomnia with depression. This study will look at sleep activity of
      participants who take ramelteon.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will be administered:

      â€¢ Ramelteon 8 mg

      Participants will be asked to take 1 tablet orally at bedtime. This multi-center study will
      be conducted in Japan. The overall period to participate in this study is 9 weeks (Run-in
      period for 1 week and treatment period for 8 weeks). Participants will make multiple visits
      to clinic including the final visit 8 weeks after the start of treatment.

    <description>Sleep Latency is defined as time period measured from &quot;lights out,&quot; or bedtime, to the beginning of sleep. Sleep Latency will be assessed by actigraphy, a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual's movement during sleep. Mean value from the past 7 days at each time point will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>Nocturnal Wake time is the total time that is scored between nocturnal sleep onset and final wake-up. Nocturnal wake time will be assessed by actigraphy, a non-intrusive tool that measures an individual's movement during sleep. Mean value from the past 7 days at each time point will be evaluated.</description>
