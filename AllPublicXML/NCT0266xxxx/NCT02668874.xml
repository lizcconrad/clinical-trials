  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this split-mouth, randomized, controlled trial is to evaluate the retention
      rates of sealants placed under Isolite vs. cotton roll isolation. This study will also
      compare the patient and operator acceptability and satisfaction of the two isolation
      techniques as well as the time consumed for sealant application during the two isolation
      techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      100 regular patients at the College of Dentistry Department of Pediatric Dentistry Clinics,
      ages 6-16 years, will be invited to participate in this study. Matched contralateral pairs of
      first and second molars and premolars will be randomized to receive sealants with the use of
      the deice (Isolite) for isolation or with the use of cotton roll isolation. All sealants will
      be placed by pediatric dentistry residents. Sealants will be placed on first and second
      permanent molars that have a matched contralateral molar requiring a sealant as well.
      Photographs may be taken of the sealants on the day of placement and at a 6-month and 12
      month recalls. Retention of the sealants will be evaluated and scored by calibrated pediatric
      dentists.

    <measure>Categorical scale of Sealant retention by direct examination</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical examination will be done and recorded as completely retained, partially retained not at risk for dental caries, partially retained and at risk for caries development or completely lost.
Recordings will be done for each application site of the sealants. For each of the surfaces sealed in the teeth. Upper molars will have 3 recorded sites (mesioclusal, distoclusal and palatal), lower molars will have two recorded sites (occlusal and buccal) and upper and lower premolars will have one recorded site (occlusal). Teeth of 100 child participants will be evaluated.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Direct clinical examination will be done and marginal adaptation will be recorded as good or poor for each of the surfaces sealed in the teeth. Upper molars will have 3 recorded sites (mesiocclusal, distocclusal and palatal), lower molars will have two recorded sites (occlusal and buccal) and upper and lower premolars will have one recorded site (occlusal). Teeth of 100 child participants will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>Clinical examination will be completed and documented if yes there are caries or no there are not caries for each of the surfaces sealed in the teeth. Upper molars will have 3 recorded sites (mesiocclusal, distocclusal and palatal), lower molars will have two recorded sites (occlusal and buccal) and upper and lower premolars will have one recorded site (occlusal). Teeth of 100 child participants will be evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Categorical scale of child satisfaction with the isolation technique by direct reporting</measure>

    <description>The child will be asked to answer several questions related to the convenience of the procedure and the preference of the isolation method used. Direct interviewing of the child exactly after the placement of the sealant will be carried out and the answers are closed ended (yes, no) or which procedure/ device did you prefer.</description>
