  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study is researching how the spirituality of a group of British patients
      with type 2 diabetes (T2D), impacts their approach to the self-management of their condition.

      Bio-statistical markers will be taken from consenting participants' Clinic database records.
      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with participants, and the results analysed and
      interpreted, alongside their bio-statistical markers.

      Results will be presented in healthcare peer reviewed journals and conferences, to inform
      clinicians how patients' self-management of their T2D is influenced by their spirituality.

      Patients will be recruited from diabetes clinics.

      The bio-statistical markers will be: include their living situation (living alone or with
      family/partner); date of T2D diagnosis; current age; glycated haemoglobin (hba1c) blood test;
      body mass index and current pharmacological therapy. This data will be collected from the
      Diabetes Clinic to contextualize the qualitative data. These measurements will reveal how
      well a participant is managing their T2D.

      The Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) will involve interviews with eight
      participants. Each participant will have at least 2 and possibly 3 interviews at a location
      of their choice. The data will undergo thematic analysis, which will be interpreted.

      The results will be used to encourage clinicians to consider the spirituality of people with
      T2D when planning their care, thus giving holistic treatment.

    <measure>The self-management Interviews to identify if and how patients' spirituality influences their diet and exercise.</measure>
    <time_frame>58 months</time_frame>
    <description>An exploratory study using qualitative data only to identify if and how patients' spirituality influences their diet and exercise, both of which are key to good diabetes control, and the prevention of diabetic complications in the long term. (No quantitative data will be collected, and as such no outcome measures will be collected).
Interviews will utilize the biographical narrative interpretive method to reveal how beliefs may influence diet and exercise. Each interview may last up to 3 hours. Each participant will be interviewed up to 3 times (approximately 9 hours of interviewing per participant). Interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Themes will be generated, coded and interpreted. Results will be the researchers interpretive analysis of the qualitative data generated, and the themes that emerge.</description>
