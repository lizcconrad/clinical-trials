  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate, in a blinded fashion, the effectiveness of the
      Nautilus BrainPulse device when used as an aid in the diagnosis of concussion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, blinded, matched control study of young athletes (ages
      10-25 years old) in competitive sports (Cohort A: higher-risk of concussion, Cohort B:
      lower-risk of concussion) to assess the effectiveness of the Nautilus BrainPulse device when
      used as an aid in the diagnosis of concussion.

      The Nautilus BrainPulse is intended for use on a patient's head to non-invasively detect,
      amplify and capture the brain pulse, the brain motion caused by pulsatile blood flow from the
      cardiac cycle. The Nautilus BrainPulse analyzes the captured data to provide an aid in
      diagnosing an episode of concussion.

    <description>Sensitivity and Specificity of the Nautilus BrainPulse in detecting the number of subjects experiencing concussion as compared to the number of subjects with concussion as adjudicated by a panel of medical experts. BrainPulse measurement data will be aggregated by subject over the first 10-days of recording after the concussive event, or for subjects in the Control arm, after their selection as a control subject.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects between 10 and 25 years of age (middle school, high school or
             college-age)

          2. Team member, where the team meets at least twice a week

          3. Willing and able to participate in all study evaluations and allow access to medical
             testing and records

          4. Signed informed consent, or have a legally authorized representative willing to
             provide informed consent on behalf of the subject if the subject is a minor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented history of a concussion diagnosed by a physician in the last two months
             assessed via interview with athlete

          2. Known history of any cognitive deficits that diminish ability to administer study
             assessments, such as SCAT3™

          3. Wound on the head in the area of one of the Nautilus BrainPulse sensors that would
             impede use of the Nautilus BrainPulse device

          4. Inability to obtain a valid SCAT3 and ImPACT® baseline assessment of concussion

          5. Any serious medical, social or psychological condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator would impair ability to provide informed consent or otherwise disqualify
             a patient from participation
