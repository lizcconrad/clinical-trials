  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Batefenterol (BAT) is a novel bifunctional molecule that combines muscarinic antagonism and
      beta2-agonism in a single molecule and is in development for the treatment of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). FF is a corticosteroid approved as the inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) component of a combination product, with vilanterol (VI), a long-acting
      beta2-agonist for COPD. In the current study FF will be investigated as an inhaled product in
      combination with BAT, for treatment of COPD.

      This study is an open-label, six-way crossover, single and repeat dose study to evaluate the
      systemic pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of FF and BAT when administered via the
      ELLIPTA™ alone, in combination, or concurrently at 3 times the clinical dose, following a
      single dose, and at the proposed clinical dose, following repeat doses.

      This study will consist of screening period, 6 treatment periods, and a follow-up visit. Each
      subject will have 3 periods in which they receive a single dose treatment regimen (3
      inhalations on Day 1 of each single dose study period) and 3 periods in which they receive a
      single dose treatment regimen followed by a 7-day, once-daily, repeated dose. On Day 1 of
      those periods, subjects will receive their single dose as 3 inhalations. On Days 2-8,
      subjects will receive 1 inhalation per day for the repeated dose regimen. There will be a
      minimum of 7-day washout between each treatment periods. All subjects will receive 9
      treatments and follow-up procedures will be done 7 14 days after the last dose.

      Forty eight healthy subjects will be enrolled into the study, such that approximately 40
      subjects complete dosing and PK assessments. The total duration of participation for each
      subject in this study will be up to 15 weeks. ELLIPTA is a registered trademark of the
      GlaxoSmithKline [GSK] group of companies.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, vital signs,
             laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or
             exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may
             be included only if the investigator agrees and documents that the finding is unlikely
             to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2)
             inclusive.

        Males: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must use a condom from
        the time of first dose of study medication until follow-up, or have had a vasectomy with
        documentation of azoospermia.

        Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed
        by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least
        one of the following conditions applies: Non-reproductive potential defined as:
        Pre-menopausal females with one of the following: documented tubal ligation, documented
        hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal
        occlusion, hysterectomy, documented bilateral oophorectomy.

        Post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, with simultaneous follicle
        stimulating hormone (FSH) and oestradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to
        laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels). Females on hormone replacement
        therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the
        highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
        Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior
        to study enrolment.

        Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List
        of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential
        (FRP) during the trial, and until follow-up. The investigator is responsible for ensuring
        that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form as described in this
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN)
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Mean QTC &gt; 450 millisecond (msec). NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for
             heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or
             another method, machine read or manually over-read.

        The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
        individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other words,
        several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject
        and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial.

        For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction formula, or a composite of
        available values of QTc will be used as specified in the reporting and analysis plan (RAP).

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment
             (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, or 12-lead ECG.

          -  Pre-existing condition(s) interfering with normal gastrointestinal (GI) anatomy or
             motility, including constipation, malabsorption or other GI dysfunction which may
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or elimination of the study
             drug. Subjects with a history of cholecystectomy must be excluded.

          -  At screening, a supine blood pressure (BP) that is persistently higher (the mean of
             triplicate measurements taken at least 2 min apart) than 140/90 millimetres of mercury
             (mmHg).

          -  At screening, a supine mean (triplicate measurements) heart rate (HR) outside the
             range 40‒90 beats per minute (bpm).

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          -  A history of respiratory disease in the last 10 years.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose
             of study medication, unless in the opinion of the investigator and GSK Medical Monitor
             the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject

             agonist, anti-muscarinic, corticosteroid medication, magnesium stearate, or lactose),
             or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or
             Medical Monitor, contraindicated the subject's participation.
