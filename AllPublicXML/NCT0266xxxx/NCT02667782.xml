  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine which mindfulness-based intervention protocol, MBCT or
      MBSR, is more suited for use among local carers of people with dementia (PWD), as measured by
      better mental health outcomes in PWD such as reductions in stress and improvements in mental
      well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 subjects will be recruited in the community and randomized into either the MBCT or MBSR
      group. Both MBSR and MBCT will be delivered through a face-to-face teaching session followed
      by regular telephone follow-ups.

      The primary outcome measures of the dementia caregivers will be stress with Perceived Stress
      Scale (PSS; Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988). The secondary outcome measures of the dementia
      caregiver will be 1) anxiety with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmon &amp;
      Snaith, 1983), 2) depression with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD;
      Radloff, 1977), and 3) burden with Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI; Zarit, Reever, &amp;
      Bach-Peterson, 1980). The control measure will be their level of mastery of the five facets
      mindfulness with Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer, Smith, Hopkins,
      Krietemeyer, &amp; Toney, 2006). Focus group interviews with each group of participants will be
      conducted post-intervention to explore their experiences and perceptions.

      Data will be collected at baseline (T0), at 2 months (the mid-point of the intervention; T1),
      4 months (immediately after the intervention; T2), and 7 months (the follow-up assessment;
      T3). Adherence rates, response rates, and drop-out rates will be collected and analyzed. The
      triangulation of both qualitative and quantitative data will be performed to determine the
      suitability and benefits of MBSR and MBCT for carers of PWD in the local setting.

    <description>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). It is an eight-week Program that includes practices such as gentle mindful movement (awareness of the body), a body scan (to systematically nurture awareness of the body region by region), and sitting meditation (awareness of the breath to include the four foundations of mindfulness, namely, body, feeling tone, mental state, and mental content) (Cullen, 2011).</description>

    <description>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), developed by Zindel Segal, Mark Williams and John Teasdale, employs a cognitive theoretical framework (Cullen, 2011; Segal, Williams, &amp; Teasdale, 2002). It is also delivered as an eight-session group treatment. The first four sessions teach the fundamental concepts and skills of the practice of mindfulness. The remaining four sessions teach the individual how to notice his/her own thoughts and the impact of such thoughts on his/her own physical and emotional experiences.</description>

    <description>Recruited subjects that are randomly allocated into the MBSR group will have an intensive face-to-face (F-T-F) teaching-learning program that is focused on stress reduction. After that, there will be some regular telephone follow-ups for a closed group of 10-15 participants. Subjects would receive four consecutive weekly F-T-F sessions, then a weekly telephone follow-up for three months in combination with an F-T-F session once a month. The Interventionist will be an experienced mindfulness therapist who is qualified to deliver both MBSR and MBCT.</description>
