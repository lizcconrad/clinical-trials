        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigators assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP, PR), 12-lead ECG,
             and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          -  Males who are willing to use a medically acceptable method of contraception during the
             study (from start of treatment until end of trial examination). Acceptable methods of
             contraception for use by male volunteers include sexual abstinence, a vasectomy
             performed at least 1 year prior to dosing, and barrier contraception (condom).

             additional acceptable method of contraception will be used by his female partner such
             as IUD (intrauterine device), surgical sterilisation (including hysterectomy),
             hormonal contraception (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral or vaginal
             contraceptives) that started at least 2 months prior to first nintedanib

             medication or its excipients)

          -  Intake of drugs with a long half-life (more than 24 h) within 30 days or less than 10
             half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication

          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Laboratory parameters ALT, AST or GGT outside the reference range

          -  Intake of drugs that inhibit the efflux of bile salts (e.g. rifampicin, glibenclamide,
