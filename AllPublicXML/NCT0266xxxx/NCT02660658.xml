  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is a commonly used technique for lower limb surgeries offering better
      quality of postoperative analgesia, lower incidence of side effects, and shorter
      post-anesthesia care unit stay than general anesthesia. However, the relatively short
      duration of action of the currently available local anesthetics (LAs) make these advantages
      short-lived.

      The risk for local anesthetic toxicity (LAST) increases with the trials to use higher
      concentrations or volumes of intrathecal local anesthetics to increase the duration of
      analgesia.

      Dexmedetomidine has the potential to prolong the duration of perioperative analgesia without
      the need for using high doses of local anesthetics and hence with decreasing the potential
      risk of local anesthetic, but the increased likelihood adverse effects such as short term
      bradycardia and prolonged duration of motor block may offset these benefits.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the optimal single-dose of intrathecal dexmedetomidine
      that prolongs the analgesic duration with the least possible side effects.

      With the patients in the sitting position and the use of complete aseptic technique, 25G
      Whitacre spinal needles will be introduced through L2-L4 interspaces and after observing free
      flow of the CSF, a 3ml volume including bupivacaine 12.5mg in conjunction with
      dexmedetomidine (3 µg) will be injected in the first case, then the patient will be turned
      supine.

      The dose of intrathecal DEX given to the next patient will be guided by modified Dixon's
      up-and-down method using 1.5 mg as a step size, which assumed to be of clinical importance.
