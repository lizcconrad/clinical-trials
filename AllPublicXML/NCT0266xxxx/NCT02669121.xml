      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Norovirus (NoV) GI.1/GII.4
      Bivalent Virus-Like Particle Vaccine against moderate or severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE)
      due to genotype-specific (GI.1 and GII.4) NoV strains.

      The vaccine being tested in this study is called NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent virus-like particle
      (VLP) vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide. The norovirus vaccine is being tested to
      prevent acute gastroenteritis (AGE) due to genotype-specific (GI.1 and GII.4) norovirus
      strains in healthy participants recruited from US military training installations. This study
      will look at the illness rate of AGE occurring &gt; 7 days after dosing due to genotype-specific
      (GI.1 or GII.4) NoV strains represented in the vaccine.

      The study will enroll between 2800 and 8700 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  NoV GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is a liquid that looks similar to the study
           drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants will receive one dose of study medication on Day 1 administered via
      intramuscular injection.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States at select military locations.
      The overall time to participate in this study is up to 45 days for participants in the Navy
      53 days for participants in the Air Force, and 72 days for participants in the Marines.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit on the last day
      of study participation (Day 45, 53 or 72) for a follow-up assessment.
