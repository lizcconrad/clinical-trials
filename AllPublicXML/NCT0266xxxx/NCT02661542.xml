  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1/2a, dose-escalation study of FF-10502-01 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and
      Lymphomas. A total of up to 9 cohorts will be enrolled in Phase 1 to establish the MTD. Phase
      2 will consist of 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 will include subjects with Pancreatic Cancer. Cohort 2
      will include subjects with another tumor type enrolled in the Phase 1 dose-escalation phase
      who have demonstrated Clinical Benefit by Week 16.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive doses of FF-10502-01 intravenously (IV) weekly for three weeks,
      repeated every 28 days (= 1 cycle). Disease assessments, based on computed tomography (CT),
      magnetic resonance image (MRI), and, for lymphoma, [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography (FDG-PET) scans, will be obtained at Week 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter until
      documented progression of disease (PD). Subjects who demonstrate clinical benefit will be
      allowed to continue therapy with FF-10502-01 until progression of disease, observation of
      unacceptable adverse events, intercurrent illness or changes in the subject's condition that
      prevents further study participation.
