      Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety for each cohort of patients on a fixed-dose combination pill of
           capecitabine and cyclophosphamide administered at flat dose and with metronomic schedule
           (defined as continuous daily treatment without interruption) in patients with metastatic
           breast cancer.

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and bioavailability of the fixed-dose combination
           pill of capecitabine and cyclophosphamide administered at different doses/regimens by
           metronomic schedule in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess antitumor activity of the fixed-dose combination pill of capecitabine and
           cyclophosphamide administered at different doses/regimens by metronomic schedule in
           patients with metastatic breast cancer given at 3 different doses and schedules (regimen
           1=standard dose twice daily [BID], regimen 2=full dose once daily [OD], regimen 3=low
           dose [OD])

        -  Disease Control Rate (DCR)

        -  Overall Response Rate (ORR)

        -  Time to Progression (TTP) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
           (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1).

        -  To evaluate the compliance under treatment.

        -  To describe evolution of toxicities.

        -  To assess safety all along patient's treatment.
