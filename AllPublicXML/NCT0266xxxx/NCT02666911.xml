  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will recruit 20 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 80, who have no
      history of carpal tunnel syndrome or wrist injury. Images will be captured twice, first with
      the 2D transducer and then with the 4D transducer and compared to images captured with the
      new 4D transducer, using the same movement data analysis protocols. Investigators will also
      assess the inter and intrarater reliability of the 4D transducer images, by using two
      different sonographers, both trained in the technique, measuring the same blinded images on
      separate occasions, at least two weeks apart. The overall goal of this project is to assess
      the reliability, or reproducibility, of measurements in normal subjects using a novel 4D
      ultrasonographic method to characterize the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) and detect
      motion between SSCT, median nerve and tendon motion for the evaluation and diagnosis of
      patients with disorders affecting the carpal tunnel, especially carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CTS can be diagnosed in many ways, but there are currently no non-invasive methods to assess
      the physiology within the carpal tunnel, which may help select treatment and predict
      treatment outcomes. The investigators have shown in preliminary work that differences in the
      motion of various structures within the carpal tunnel, including the median nerve, flexor
      tendons, and SSCT, vary in normal subjects and those with CTS. A clinical trial is already
      under way to assess conventional ultrasound imaging to predict outcomes of CTS treatments. In
      this study investigators wish to compare the current ultrasound methods, which involve moving
      two dimensional images, with a new technology which captures moving images in three
      dimensions (i.e., four dimensions, or 4D). If successful, a single 4D measurement could
      replace longitudinal and transverse 2D images, saving time and allowing better understanding
      of the relationship between displacements in both planes.
