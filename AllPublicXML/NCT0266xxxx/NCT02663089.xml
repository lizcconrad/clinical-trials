  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Batefenterol (GSK961081) is a bifunctional bronchodilator that is being developed for the
      treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Absorption, metabolism and
      excretion of batefenterol have been studied in animals, in vitro, and in previous clinical
      studies; however, the elimination routes and metabolic pathways of batefenterol have not been
      fully elucidated in humans. This is an open-label, single centre, non-randomised, 2-period
      single-sequence crossover, mass balance study to determine total radioactivity (drug related
      material) in plasma, the rate and extent of excretion of total radioactivity in urine and
      faeces and the total recovery of radioactivity of [14C] GSK961081 administered as a single IV
      dose (concomitant with an inhaled non-radiolabelled dose) and a single oral dose, in healthy
      male subjects. A total of 6 healthy male subjects will be enrolled. The duration of each
      subject in the study is up to 11 weeks, which consists of a screening visit, 2 Treatment
      Periods, and a follow up visit.
