  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to better understand how a new lab test called the Oncotype DX
      Prostate Cancer Assay may impact what treatment men decide to get and how they feel and think
      about their choice of treatment. The study will compare men who receive this new lab test
      with men who receive the usual counseling given to men after they get a new diagnosis of
      prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is sometimes slow-growing and sometimes fast-growing.
      Healthcare providers are searching for better ways to predict how each tumor will behave so
      that each man can make a better decision about when to receive treatment. The Oncotype DX lab
      test uses leftover prostate biopsy tissue to generate a Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). The GPS
      is related to the risk of a fast-growing cancer being discovered if surgery is performed to
      remove a man's prostate. The goal of this study is to find out if this test helps men when
      they are deciding how their prostate cancer will be treated. Treatment options include
      surgery to remove the prostate, radiation therapy, or an approach called &quot;active
      surveillance&quot; in which there is no immediate therapy and the tumor is watched using prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) tests and repeat biopsies.

    <description>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) counseling uses recommendations based on currently-accepted approaches to cancer treatment. The result provided by the Oncotype DX prostate test is called a Genomic Prostate Score (GPS). The GPS provides important information about how aggressive a man's cancer is based on the biology of the man's individual tumor.</description>
