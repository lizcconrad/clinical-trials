  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adjuvant radiotherapy following radical
      prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients with positive margins or capsular penetration
      improves biochemical, overall and/or cancer specific survival and whether adjuvant
      radiotherapy is reasonably well tolerated when compared to watchful waiting.

      In this study the investigators will evaluate adjuvant radiation therapy vs. watchful waiting
      in prostate cancer patients with positive margins or capsular penetration after radical
      prostatectomy. This is a randomized, open label, multicentre, collaborative study of
      FinnProstate Group and Finnish Radiation Oncology group.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with pT3aN0M0 or pT2N0M0 prostate cancer with a positive margin, gleason score
        2-10, preoperative PSA &lt; 20 ug/l, postoperative PSA &lt;0.5 ug/l after surgery (within 8
        weeks), the WHO performance status 0-2, life expectancy at least 3 months, informed consent
        obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Other simultaneous cancer therapy including systemic endocrine therapy; more than 12 weeks
        has elapsed since surgery for prostate cancer; metastatic disease (N+ or M1); cancer
        invasion to the seminal vesicles; any other previous malignancy within the last 5 years
        except basalioma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; any contraindication to
        irradiation (severe locoregional infection, prior radiation therapy to the
        prostate/bladder); any physical or mental condition, which in the opinion of the
        investigator, may interfere with patient's ability to comply with scheduled visits.
