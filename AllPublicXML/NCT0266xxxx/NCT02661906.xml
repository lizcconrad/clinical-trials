      cyclical breathing patterns, ranging from slow and calming to rapid and stimulating. It is
      recommended for relaxation, stress management, control of psycho physiological states and to

      and those who consent were provided with 6 days yoga course for a duration of 3 hours and
      trained to practice SKY at home for 12 week. At baseline and after 6 days of SKY,
