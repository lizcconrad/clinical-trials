  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the etonogestrel (ENG) + 17β-estradiol (E2) vaginal
      ring's efficacy compared to a placebo vaginal ring in the treatment of dysmenorrhea at
      Treatment Cycle 2. In addition, this study will assess the safety and tolerability of the
      ENG-E2 vaginal rings. Primary hypothesis: Relative to the placebo ring, the ENG-E2 vaginal
      ring results in a greater proportion of participants with a ≥3 point reduction in peak pelvic
      pain score and no increase in the number of rescue pain relief (ibuprofen) tablets taken at
      Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to baseline.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With ≥3 Point Reduction in Peak Pelvic Pain Score and no Increase in Number of Ibuprofen Tablets Taken at Treatment Cycle 2, Compared to Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 4-day cramping window and Treatment Cycle 2 4-day cramping window, as determined by committee for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate their worst pain or cramps in the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 10 (0=No pain or cramps to 10=Extreme pain or cramps) and to indicate the number of ibuprofen tablets they took during the 4-day cramping window. The peak pelvic pain score was to be calculated as the highest (daily) pelvic pain score observed within the cramping window of the cycle and the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken was to be based on the 4-day cramping window. The baseline peak pelvic pain score and number of ibuprofen tablets taken were to be defined as the mean value of the 2 peak pelvic pain scores and the mean value of the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken during the cramping window of each of the 2 menstruations during the screening period, respectively. The percentage of participants with a reduction in peak pelvic pain score of ≥3 points and no increase in the use of ibuprofen at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to baseline was to be presented.</description>

    <description>Participants were asked to rate their worst pain or cramps in the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 10 (0=No pain or cramps to 10=Extreme pain or cramps).
The peak pelvic pain score was to be calculated as the highest (daily) pelvic pain score observed within the 4-day cramping window of the cycle. The baseline peak pelvic pain score was to be defined as the mean value of the 2 peak pelvic pain scores during the cramping window of each of the 2 menstruations during the screening period.

    <time_frame>Baseline 4-day cramping window and Treatment Cycle 2 4-day cramping window, as determined by committee for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to indicate how much pain or cramps limited their physical, work/school and social/leisure activities and over the previous 24 hours. The level of negative impact of dysmenorrhea on daily life was scored on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all to 4=Extremely impacted). For each of the 3 impact items, the baseline score was to be defined as the mean value obtained from the 2 menstruations during the screening period. The change from baseline to Treatment Cycle 2 in the number of days during the cramping window with no impact of dysmenorrhea (score = 0) on each of the following items was to be presented: work/school, physical activities and leisure/social activities.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked to rate their worst pain or cramps in the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 10 (0=No pain or cramps to 10=Extreme pain or cramps) and to indicate the number of ibuprofen tablets they took during the 4-day cramping window. The peak pelvic pain score was to be calculated as the highest (daily) pelvic pain score observed within the cramping window of the cycle and the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken was to be based on the 4-day cramping window. The baseline peak pelvic pain score and number of ibuprofen tablets taken were to be defined as the mean value of the 2 peak pelvic pain scores and the mean value of the total number of ibuprofen tablets taken during the cramping window of each of the 2 menstruations during the screening period, respectively. The percentage of participants with a reduction in peak pelvic pain score of ≥3 points and no increase in the use of ibuprofen at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to baseline was to be presented.</description>
