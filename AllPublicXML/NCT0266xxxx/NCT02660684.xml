      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Tacrolimus (Prograf
      capsule, Prograf injection) and Methotrexate combination therapy for GVHD prophylaxis in
      patients who received peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a sibling
      donor, and to compare with data from a historical control group that administered a
      conventional Cyclosporine formulation.

    <description>Severity is graded according to the Seattle criteria, between 1+ ~ 4+ depending on the severity of the injury of the skin, liver and digestive system, and the overall grade is classified by including the performance change.</description>

    <description>Depending on the extent of occurrence, it is classified as limited (present only locally) and extensive (systemic lesions). Depending on the presence of preceding acute GVHD, it is classified as progressive for a patient with preceding acute GVHD (chronic GVHD following the occurrence of acute GVHD), quiescent (chronic GVHD after relief of acute GVHD symptoms) or otherwise (de novo).</description>
