    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, multi-center, Home and Hotel Clinical Investigation in pediatric
      subjects with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. The purpose of this study is to
      demonstrate that the closed loop algorithm that is built into the 670G insulin pump is safe
      as part of the overall system.

      The study will proceed as follows:

      Run-in Period - General:

      A total of up to 200 subjects (age 2-13) will be enrolled at up to 15 investigational centers
      (14 in the US, 1 EMEA) in order to reach 120 subjects who will complete the HCL study.

      Study Period - At Home:

      Following the two week run-in period using the Study Pump (670G), all subjects (age 2-13)
      will participate in a 3-month study period.

      Study Period - Hotel Study Subjects (age 7-13) will participate in a Hotel study (6 days, 5
      nights), with the remainder of the study period to be spent at home. Subjects 2-6 years of
      age are not required to participate in a hotel study. Instead, they will participate in an
      out-of-home study for 5 consecutive days, 4-6 hours per day.

      Continued Access Program Subjects will be given the opportunity to extend use of their study
      devices for a period of 2 years. If subjects choose to participate in the continuation
      period, they will retain the study devices at the end of study period visit or receive them
      back in the event they have been returned to study staff already.
