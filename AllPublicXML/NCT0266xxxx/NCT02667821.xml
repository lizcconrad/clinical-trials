    <textblock>
      The Investigators are performing a study to determine, in patients with chronic/recurrent
      neck pain, the cerebrovascular hemodynamic consequences of cervical spine movements,
      including manipulation, in vivo using fMRI technology on vertebral and cranial blood flow
      dynamics affecting brain perfusion, and extend the current data set on these variables

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to further investigate in patients with chronic/recurrent neck pain,
      the cerebrovascular hemodynamic consequences of cervical spine positions, including
      manipulation, in vivo under clinically relevant circumstances using two advanced MRI
      technology on the vertebral and posterior cerebral and cerebellar blood flow dynamics
      affecting brain perfusion. According to the knowledge of the investigators, a study utilizing
      MRI to examine blood flow and perfusion, turbulence and evidence of micro-trauma within these
      blood vessels has yet to be conducted.

    <measure>Changes in Blood Flow Through the Vertebral Artery and Posterior Cerebral and Cerebellar Circulation</measure>
    <time_frame>The series of fMRI sequences will be performed on each participant immediately after each condition. Through study completion, data will be presented after an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Phase contrast MRI provides velocity measurements that can be used for analysis of the blood flow and tissue motion. At the level of C1-2, the contralateral and ipsilateral vertebral arteries (VA), defined to the direction of head motion, were assessed and anatomical images were established to localize the VA circulation. Mean and SDs were calculated for VA blood velocity (cm/s) for each of the head conditions and VA side. Differences between task maneuvers and VA flow and velocity were evaluated using a repeated-measures analysis of variance with factors of head position and VA side, and a level of significance was set at .05</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Tissue Perfusion in the Posterior Cerebrum and Cerebellum Will be Assessed Using Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI Technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>The series of ASL sequences will be performed on each participant immediately after each condition. Through study completion, data will be presented after an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>ASL allows one to separate the blood flow from the BOLD effect, thus giving clear measures of perfusion. More specifically ASL will be used to measure blood perfusion and allow extraction of metabolic difference from flow differences in BOLD imaging. It is a quantitative technique, yielding values with units of ml/(100g of tissue)·min-1.</description>

    <description>Participants included in the experimental arm will be adults aged 18 years and older with chronic/recurrent neck pain Grade II who have been prescribed cervical manipulation for treatment of their condition. Each participant will undergo three separate test maneuvers consistent with prior work completed at the St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton Brain Body Institute. Each participant will begin with neutral cervical spine as a standard natural control, followed by block randomization between maximum voluntary rotation of the cervical spine and one cervical manipulation. Please see Intervention section for a detailed description.</description>

    <description>Each participant will undergo three separate test maneuvers. Neutral (0° rotation) neck position (condition 1) will be followed by block randomization between maximum voluntary rotation (condition 2) and a high-velocity-low-amplitude cervical manipulation targeted at C1-C2 (condition 3). Conditions 1 and 2 will be held for 1 minute before returning to neutral alignment. For the manipulation, the head will be repositioned at neutrality immediate. An experienced practitioner will perform the manipulation on the adjustable and pivotal MRI bed. After each condition, MRI of the upper neck and cerebrum for perfusion and blood flow will ensue.</description>

        <title>Changes in Blood Flow Through the Vertebral Artery and Posterior Cerebral and Cerebellar Circulation</title>
        <description>Phase contrast MRI provides velocity measurements that can be used for analysis of the blood flow and tissue motion. At the level of C1-2, the contralateral and ipsilateral vertebral arteries (VA), defined to the direction of head motion, were assessed and anatomical images were established to localize the VA circulation. Mean and SDs were calculated for VA blood velocity (cm/s) for each of the head conditions and VA side. Differences between task maneuvers and VA flow and velocity were evaluated using a repeated-measures analysis of variance with factors of head position and VA side, and a level of significance was set at .05</description>

Each participant will undergo three separate test maneuvers. Neutral (0° rotation) neck position (condition 1) will be followed by block randomization between maximum voluntary rotation (condition 2) and a high-velocity-low-amplitude cervical manipulation targeted at C1-C2 (condition 3). Conditions 1 and 2 will be held for 1 minute before returning to neutral alignment. For the manipulation, the head will be repositioned at neutrality immediate. An experienced practitioner will perform the manipulation on the adjustable and pivotal MRI bed. After each condition, MRI of the upper neck and cerebrum for perfusion and blood flow will ensue.</description>
