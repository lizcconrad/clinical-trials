  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of both endothelial injury in pre-eclampsia, high blood pressure and kidney
      impairment characteristics, a recent study demonstrated that the serum levels of NGAL
      increased at the end of the second trimester in women who subsequently developed
      pre-eclampsia compared to the control group.

      This correlates well with the endothelial damage that occurs during pre-eclampsia and thus
      NGAL can be considered as a promising marker in predicting both early and late onset
      pre-eclampsia. It may be required to combine one or more biomarker with NGAL to increase the
      precision, and sensitivity for detection of risk and reliability of using biomarkers for
      pre-eclampsia.
