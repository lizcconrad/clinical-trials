    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to develop a mobile health (mHealth) application that
      will both advance theory in and clinical practice of homework (HW) implementation. The mobile
      health application will enhance the existing evidence informed curriculum of a Multiple
      Family Group model (called 4 Rs and 2 Ss for Strengthening Families Model) for families with
      children who have disruptive behavior disorders. This mobile application consists of two
      primary components that will support engagement and integration of the model's core concepts
      in family life. The first component focuses on delivering homework via a highly engaging,
      multiplayer, interactive, cooperative, and skill-building game platform aimed at improving
      the &quot;Design&quot; and &quot;Do&quot; process of homework.The second component focuses on targeting factors
      putatively related to poor HW implementation within the &quot;Do&quot; process.
