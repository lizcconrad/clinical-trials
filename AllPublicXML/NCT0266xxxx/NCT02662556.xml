      This is a multicenter, open-label study in patients 40 years and older who are undergoing a
      surgical procedure.

      Patients may receive one dose of ST 30 mcg as needed for pain management, but no more

      This is a multicenter, open-label study in patients 40 years and older who are undergoing a
      surgical procedure.

      Upon meeting all entrance criteria, patients will be administered the first dose of ST 30 mcg
      and will remain in the study for up to 12 hours for safety and efficacy measurements.
      Patients may receive additional doses of ST 30 mcg as needed for pain management, but no more
      frequently than every 60 minutes.

    <measure>Time-weighted Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over the 12-hour Study Period (SPID12).</measure>
    <time_frame>12-hours</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity difference (PID) at each evaluation time point after the dose of study drug is the difference in pain intensity at the specific evaluation time point and baseline pain intensity [PID(evaluation time after the first dose) = PI(baseline) - PI(evaluation time after the first dose)]. A pain intensity score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) is obtained at baseline and throughout the 12 hour period. The time-weighted SPID12 is the time-weighted summed PID over the 12-hour study period. The scores ranged from -13.75 to 100.5. A negative score indicates an increase in pain intensity and a higher score indicates a greater decrease in pain intensity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients who are 40 years of age or older.

          2. Patients who have undergone a surgical procedure with general anesthesia or spinal
             anesthesia that does not include intrathecal opioids during the operation.

          3. Patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class IIII

          <title>Time-weighted Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over the First Hour (SPID1).</title>
          <description>The pain intensity difference (PID) at each evaluation time point after the dose of study drug is the difference in pain intensity at the specific evaluation time point and baseline pain intensity [PID(evaluation time after the first dose) = PI(baseline) – PI(evaluation time after the first dose)]. A pain intensity score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) is obtained at baseline and throughout the 1 hour period. The time-weighted SPID1 is the time-weighted summed PID over the 1-hour study period. The scores ranged from -6.67 to 6.77. A negative score indicates an increase in pain intensity and a higher score indicates a greater decrease in pain intensity.</description>
