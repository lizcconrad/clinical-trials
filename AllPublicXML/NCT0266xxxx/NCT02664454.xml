  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older patients account for around 10% of the population, of which 57% have a long-term
      illness, and 33% were admitted in the past year.

      Geriatric assessment (GA) is a multidimensional assessment of general health status that can
      help identifying deficiencies and followed by a personalized care plan.

      Assessment and management of elderly patients is a daily concern for the general practitioner
      (GP) but conflicting results have been reported so far relating to the clinical impact of GA
      when applied in the primary care setting.

      This study protocol aims to assess the effect on morbi-mortality of a complex intervention in
      patients aged ≥70 years with chronic conditions in primary care. It aims to demonstrate that
      a GA adapted to primary care, followed by a personalized care plan and combined with
      successful interprofessional collaboration can improve clinically relevant outcomes in
      elderly patients with chronic conditions such as one-year overall mortality, unplanned
      hospital admission, emergency visits, or institutionalization.

      The CEPIA study will also help addressing the issue of whether an improved benefit could be
      achieved from a systematic nurse-led or a case-by-case GP-led GA.
