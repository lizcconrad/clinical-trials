    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the sensitivity，specificity and concordance rate
      of EGFR testing results in plasma in comparison of results in matched tumor tissues tested by
      amplification refractory mutation system(ARMS). Moreover, the investigators correlate our
      findings in plasma with survival of advanced patients.

    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), accounting for 80% of all lung cancers, is a leading
      cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      kinase activity by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, can
      result in improved response and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in selected
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations, especially
      the exon 19del and exon 21（L858R） mutations. Unfortunately, about 50%-60% patients who accept
      EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors with sensitizing mutations will receive resistance mutations,
      the T790M resistance is a target of active pharmaceutical development. So EGFR mutation
      testing is a step in identifying the right patients for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      treatment. Now tissue samples and tumor cytologic samples are accepted as appropriate sample
      types for EGFR mutation detection, but these samples are not always available on or after
      diagnosis, and, even when available, they may be of insufficient quality or quantity for
      mutation testing. Noninvasive techniques for tumor genotyping may be needed to fully realize,
      such as plasma sample. Cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) in plasma is a kind of fresh and realtime
      sample, and has been shown to be promising for the detection of sensitizing EGFR mutations
      even the resistance mutation（T790M). However, a challenge was also raised about how to detect
      the low abundance of mutant alleles in plasma. In our study Droplet Digital polymerase chain
      reaction and Realtime polymerase chain reaction will be used to assess the EGFR mutation in
      plasma DNA samples from patients with advanced NSCLC before and after EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors therapy.

      Each specimen was collected into one 10mL EDTA-containing vacutainer and was spun into plasma
      within 4 hours of collection. cfDNA was extracted from 2 mL of plasma, and the final DNA
      eluent was frozen at- 20℃ until genotyping
