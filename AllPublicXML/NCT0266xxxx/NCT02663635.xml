    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety of the use of the Safe'N'Sound 1mL staked passive
      delivery system cone version with add-on EFF in the prevention of needle stick injuries and
      to evaluate the user's satisfaction with regards to the handling characteristics of the
      product namely safety, design and the ease of use.
