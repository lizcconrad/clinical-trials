    <textblock>
      Objectives and Specific Aims Time efficiency of robot assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with
      totally intracorporeal stapled orthotopic neobladder remains a main drawback of this
      procedure. According to a recent consensus panel, the benchmark for intracorporeal orthotopic
      neobladder should be 5 hours in high volume centers .

      This prospective single-stage phase 2 trial is designed to assess the time efficiency of
      using robotic stapler versus the conventional motorized staplers (Linear stapler articulated
      Endo GIAâ„¢, Covidien) in achieving the target outcome (total operative time &lt;5 hr).

      Perioperative complications (intraoperative and 30-d postoperative complications according to
      the Clavien classification system), 30-d/90-d/ 180-d complication and readmission rates,
      early functional outcomes (time to recovery of urinary continence), 180-d and 360-d
      neobladder stone formation rates will be analyzed to assess the safety and the cost
      effectiveness of the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary end point by which the sample size was determined was a total operative time
      &lt;5hr. In the last 50 cases of our series (data unpublished) this benchmark was obtained in
      60% of patients (p0), while we expect to improve the time efficiency of the procedure with
      the use of robotic staplers maintaining the total operative time of the procedure &lt;5hrs in at
      least 80% (p1) of cases. According to A'Hern, in order to verify the significance of this
      hypothesis, the estimated sample size is 33 patients with a power of 80% at a significance
      level of 5%. The trial will be successful if the total operative time will be &lt;5hrs in at
      least 25 out of 33 patients.

      The population of this study will include 35 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer
      without contraindications to orthotopic neobladder. The first two cases will be excluded in
      order to provide the entire surgical team the minimal skill necessary for a proper and time
      efficient use of the new surgical device (robotic stapler). The following 33 consecutive
      cases will be enrolled and the outcomes analyzed. The estimated time to complete the
      enrollment is 9 months.
