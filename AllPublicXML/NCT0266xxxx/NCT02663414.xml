      The objective of this study is to collect post market data on safety and performance of the
      Atlas Knee System in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the medial knee compartment through
      a 24 months post-operative follow-up period. This study is designed as a post-market,
      prospective, multicenter, single arm study. The study population will consist of adult
      subjects older than 25 years of age, with a diagnosis of symptomatic and radiographic OA of
      the medial knee compartment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, older than 25 years of age;

          2. Have clinical symptoms in the study knee such as pain primarily localized to the
             medial aspect of the knee and generally exacerbated by weight bearing;

          3. Radiographic confirmation of osteoarthritis of the medial knee compartment without
             bony erosion and best assessed using a Rosenberg view X-ray;

          4. Have failed at least 6 months of conservative therapy prior to surgery with continued
             OA pain. Prior conservative therapy is defined as treatment including at least one of
             the following (OARSI Recommendations)9:

               1. Lifestyle modification;

               2. Weight loss, if BMI &gt;35;

               3. Pain relievers;

               4. Physical therapy;

               5. Assist devices (Canes, Orthotics, Braces, etc.);

               6. Intra-articular (IA) injections.

          5. Have active knee flexion ≥ 90⁰;

          6. Are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in this clinical
             investigation.

          7. Are, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, able to understand this clinical
             investigation, cooperate with the investigational procedures, and are willing to
             return for all required post-treatment follow up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical symptoms and radiographic evidence of OA in the lateral compartment of the
             study knee;

          2. Clinical symptoms and radiographic evidence of OA in the patella-femoral compartment
             of the study knee;

          3. Tibio-femoral alignment of &gt; 10⁰ of varus, or &gt; 6° of valgus, as measured using
             anatomical axis on a long standing (Hip-Knee-Ankle) antero-posterior (AP) view X-ray,
             or tibio-femoral alignment of &gt; 16⁰ of varus, or &gt; 0⁰ of valgus as measured using
             mechanical axis on a long standing (Hip-Knee-Ankle) AP view X-ray;

          4. Previous joint modifying surgery in the study knee within 12 months prior to planned
             surgery date such as ligament reconstruction, meniscus repair, cartilage
             transplantation, and microfracture;

          5. Arthroscopic surgeries for joint lavage, medial meniscectomy, chondral debridement,
             and loose body removal if within 3 months prior to planned surgery date; Note:
             concomitant diagnostic arthroscopy including debridement during Atlas procedure is
             permitted.

          6. Active infection, sepsis, osteomyelitis or history of septic arthritis in any joint;

          7. Rheumatoid arthritis, other forms of inflammatory joint disease or autoimmune
             disorder;

          8. Excessive scarring of soft tissue structures of the medial knee;

          9. Hyperextension &gt; 10⁰;

         10. Pathologic ligamentous instability (&gt; 1 Medial collateral ligament injury or Lachman &gt;
             1 without hard stop) as assessed by the Investigator on physical examination;

         11. Severe deformities leading to impaired fixation or improper positioning of the
             implant;

         12. Paget's disease or metabolic disorders which may affect bone formation;

         13. Known or suspected diagnosis of Osteomalacia;

         14. Known or suspected diagnosis of Osteonecrosis;

         15. Known or suspected diagnosis of Osteoporosis;

         16. Rapid joint destruction, marked bone loss or bone resorption apparent on X-ray;

         17. Charcot's joint disease or other severe neurosensory deficits;

         18. Vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease;

         19. Immunologically suppressed or immunocompromised;

         20. History of systemic steroid treatment, medication use that affects bone metabolism
             (such as chemotherapy) within the previous 6 months, or radiotherapy within the
             previous 6 months;

         21. Any significant medical condition and other factors that the investigator feels would
             interfere with the participation and completion of the study;

         22. Pregnancy;
