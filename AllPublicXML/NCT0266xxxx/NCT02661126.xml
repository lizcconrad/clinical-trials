      The purpose of this study is to compare the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of single doses of
      MK-3682B [MK-3682/grazoprevir (MK-5172)/ruzasvir (MK-8408) fixed dose combination (FDC)] in
      participants with moderate (Part 1) and severe (Part 2) renal insufficiency (RI) to healthy
      participants.

             use that is approved by the Investigator and Sponsor

          -  Positive results at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus (HCV)
