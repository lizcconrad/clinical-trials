      An open-label randomized and controlled clinical trial: This study was to compare the
      anticancer efficacy and safety in the First-Line Treatment in patients with Advanced
      Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer with Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection In combination with
      Cisplatin versus Paclitaxel Injection Containing Cremophor EL(polyoxyethylenated castor oil)
      In combination with Cisplatin in the way of an open-label, randomized controlled clinical
      trial.

      Treatment Protocol:

      The subjects were randomized in the Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection Group and the
      Paclitaxel Injection Group by the proportion of 2:1. The centralized randomization method was
      adopted in this trial. Since the study was a comparison of first-line treatment, the test for
      superiority was adopted. The objective response rate was the primary indicator of efficacy in
      this study.

      Trial Group:

      Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection and Cisplatin was intravenously administrated. Three weeks
      constituted one course of treatment.

      No pretreatment, including anti-allergic prevention and antiemetic prophylaxis, was required
      for the patients before infusion of Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection patients.

      Control Group:

      Conventional Paclitaxel Injection and Cisplatin was intravenously administrated. Three weeks
      constituted one course of treatment.

      Standard preventive treatment must be given to patients in accordance with the specific
      requirements in specifications of Paclitaxel Injection.

      Regardless of the Trial Group or the Control Group, six treatment periods shall be the upper
      limit.

      To estimate the sample size based on objective remission indicators (CR + PR) in the study.
      Hypothesis: the objective remission rate of the Paclitaxel Micelles for Injection combined
      with Cisplatin in the Trial Group is different with that of first-line treatment of advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer, and is also different with that of the Cremophor EL-containing
      Paclitaxel Injection combined with Cisplatin in the Control Group. Trial parameter settings:
      assuming α = 0.05 and 1-β = 80%, the Trial Group: Control Group is designed as per the
      proportion of 2: 1. According to the sample size formula , a total of 426 patients is
      required, including 284 patients assigned in the Trial Group and 142 in the Control Group. In
      consideration of case expulsion in the process of clinical, enlarged by 10%, actually 468
      cases were included in the groups, including 312 in the Trial Group and 156 in the Control
      Group.
