  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the past few years, the survival rate of breast cancer improved due to the advancement of
      surgery techniques and popularization of cancer screening. However, prolonged survival rate
      is definitely not equal to achieving a sound quality of life among breast cancer survivors.
      The health status of cancer survivors might deteriorate according to the severe side effect
      of multiple therapies.

      Health literacy is the ability to access, understand, evaluate and communication information
      as a way to promote and maintain health. Therefore, good health literacy raise the quality of
      life of breast cancer survivors by a good competence in searching and using medical
      resources. Moreover, how to improve health literacy after cancer surgery becomes an important
      part recently. Even if the most fundamental concept has promoted for decades, the clinical
      workers still use the identical education of medical care after surgery for breast cancer
      survivors. However, the identical education is not appropriate for each of patients. In fact,
      each of breast cancer survivors has the different cancer stage leading to accept different
      therapy and producing different side effect. Besides, the background and the role of life are
      very different from each other. Because of the above reasons, the aim of the study is going
      to develop a tailored rehabilitated education, which fit for each breast cancer patients
      after surgery in clinic. At the same time, the health literacy ability might be improved by
      tailored rehabilitated education. When health literacy level is raised, the breast cancer
      survivors have a good quality of life and beautiful health status.

      This evaluator-blinded, randomized, prospective, controlled trial enrolled consecutive
      patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patients were stratified into four strata
      according to the side of the lesion and the surgical approach. A set of numbered envelopes
      containing cards indicating the allocated group was prepared for each stratum. When a new
      eligible participant was registered, an envelope was randomly drawn, and the therapist was
      informed of group allocation.

      To ensure consistent intervention, two certified occupational therapists were trained by two
      primary investigators to administer the intervention and control group protocols
      independently. The two trained occupational therapists recorded outcome measurements at the
      baseline and immediately after the intervention. The evaluators were blinded to group
      allocation, and participants were blinded to the study hypotheses.
