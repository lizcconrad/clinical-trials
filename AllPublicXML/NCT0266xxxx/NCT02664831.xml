  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study of inflammatory mechanisms and lipid metabolism
      after resuscitation from cardiac arrest during targeted temperature management. Investigators
      are focusing on elucidating the activity of immune cells after resuscitation and on two
      biochemical pathways. The first is neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), a growth factor regulating cell
      resistance to oxidative stress, cell survival and proliferation. The second relates to lipid
      peroxidation and pro-inflammatory lipid precursors. Participants will undergo blood sampling
      during 7 days following cardiac arrest, and analyses performed. Patient characteristics,
      clinical circumstances, and outcomes will be recorded and their associations with these
      inflammatory pathways characterized.

    <textblock>
      Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a growth factor that crucially regulates cell resistance to oxidative
      stress, cell survival and proliferation. In preliminary studies, investigators have found a
      novel role of NRG-1 in the regulation of pro-inflammatory activation of human mononuclear
      myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages). These cells represent the major contributors to
      tissue perpetuation of inflammation. The investigators hypothesize that NRG-1 plays a role in
      the prevention of additional brain damage mediated by the post-cardiac arrest cell-mediated
      inflammatory response. To test the hypothesis, investigators will determine NRG-1 protein
      levels and NRG activity at different time points in peripheral blood of patients after
      resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Using flow cytometry, investigators will also investigate
      expression of ERBB (neuregulin) receptors on monocytes. The investigators will evaluate the
      relationships between circulating NRG-1, ERBB receptor expression, other markers of
      inflammation, duration of ischemic time, and biomarkers of the severity of neurological and
      cardiac injuries after cardiac arrest.

      A second inflammatory pathway concerns lipid metabolism. An &quot;obesity paradox&quot; exists in
      cardiac arrest as in myocardial infarction and other diseases, in which mild or moderate
      obesity seems to be protective against mortality despite a higher incidence of adverse events
      during therapy. To characterize the role of lipids in the post-resuscitation inflammatory
      milieu, investigators will prospectively determine serial serum lipid profiles, and measure
      lipid peroxidation and pro-inflammatory lipid precursors in lean and obese post cardiac
      arrest patients. This will allow researchers to investigate the independent associations of
      body mass index (BMI), lipid profiles, lipid peroxidation, and pro-inflammatory lipid
      precursors with the post-resuscitation inflammatory state, and with functional outcomes.

      Participants will undergo a series of blood draws over 7 days, and standard 6 month follow up
      to assess functional outcomes. Investigators will be recording standard elements of
      postresuscitation care including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory values
      including biomarkers of neurological injury, and radiographic findings.
