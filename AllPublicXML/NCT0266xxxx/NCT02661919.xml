  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most important epilepsy-related mode of
      death. The exact mechanism of SUDEP is not known. It is thought that cardiac and respiratory
      factors are involved. Several ways of preventing SUDEP have been identified. These include
      seizure control, stress reduction, physical activity, family's ability to perform CPR, and
      night supervision.

      A mattress alarm system that monitors nocturnal seizures can alert family members of night
      time seizure activity. Thus, a family member could provide aid and therefore potentially
      avoid SUDEP. The Emfit monitor is intended to perform these tasks.

      Investigators tested the Emfit mattress monitor DVM-GPRS-V2 in combination with the Emfit bed
      sensor L-4060SL in the epilepsy monitoring unit and were able to demonstrate that the device
      has a high predictive value for detection of generalized convulsions and that it can notify
      caregivers in the early stages of convulsive activity.

      This study will further investigate the upgraded (connected to a cloud server via an
      integrated cellular GPRS module) Emfit mattress monitor DVM-GPRS-V2 and the upgraded Emfit
      mattress sensor L-4060SLC in combination with an acoustic and new cloud-based notification
      system.

    <description>Investigators are testing the efficacy of the Emfit mattress monitor acoustic notifications for detecting GTC seizures. During video-eeg monitoring clinically detected GTC seizures are listed. These records are compared to Emfit monitor sound notications detected at video recordings. The true-positive, false-positive and false-negative calculations are primary outcome.</description>

    <description>Investigators are testing the Emfit matters sensor acoustic notifications efficacy for detecting other than GTC type seizures (partial seizures, non-epileptic events). Investigators are testing the efficacy of the Emfit mattress monitor acoustic notifications for clinically detected seizures. During video-eeg monitoring clinically detected other than GTC type seizures are listed. These records are compared to Emfit monitor sound notications detected at video recordings. The true-positive, false-positive and false-negative calculations are outcome. False-positive notifications are excluded if patient video recording shows rhytmic movement due patient being awake and performing day-time other activity.</description>
