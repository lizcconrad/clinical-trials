  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the long-term safety profile of Ad26.ZEBOV and
      MVA-BN-Filo in participants previously exposed to these vaccines in Phase 1, 2, or 3 clinical
      studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-country, prospective, long-term clinical safety study for collection of
      serious adverse events and pregnancy outcomes following administration of Ad26.ZEBOV and/or
      MVA-BN-Filo vaccines among participants who were enrolled in Phase 1, 2 or 3 clinical
      studies. The safety data will be collected in 3 cohorts; Cohort 1- adult and pediatric
      participants that received Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo in Phase 1, 2 or 3 clinical studies
      (adults, adolescents and children), Cohort 2- Female participants who became pregnant with
      estimated conception within 28 days after vaccination with MVA-BN-Filo or within 3 months
      after vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV will be followed to the end of their pregnancy for
      pregnancy outcomes (Cohort 2). After the end of pregnancy, female participants will continue
      to be followed in Cohort 1. Cohort 3 - children born to female participants exposed to
      Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA-BN-Filo who became pregnant with estimated conception within 28 days
      after vaccination with MVA-BN-Filo or within 3 months after vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV.
      Safety data will be collected on all consenting participants.
