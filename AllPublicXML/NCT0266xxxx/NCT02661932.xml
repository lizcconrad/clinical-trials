  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficiency and safety of controlled ovarian
      stimulation (COS) associated with an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) for fertility
      preservation in breast cancer patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in this study undergo standard or &quot;random start&quot; ovarian stimulation with
      Gonadotropins using antagonist protocol before the beginning of chemotherapy. Ovulation is
      triggered in all patients with a GnRH agonist since amendment P2015/091 (Decapeptyl 0,2mg).

      At oocyte retrieval, aspirated follicular fluid is separated from the flush medium for
      hormonal assays, and oocytes are denuded for ICSI(Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection) or
      vitrification. Cumulus cells are collected for subsequent analysis of oocyte quality gene
      expression.

      A. Primary objective of the study is to evaluate efficiency of letrozole associated ovarian
      stimulation for fertility preservation in breast cancer patients in terms of oocyte
      maturation rate.

      Patients' results for primary endpoint are prospectively compared to infertile patients
      undergoing COS without letrozole.

      B. Secondary objectives of the study aim to evaluate safety of the protocol:

        1. Estradiol and progesterone levels at ovulation triggering, ovulation and during luteal
           phase after oocyte retrieval (days 3 and 8)

        2. The risk of disease relapse will be assessed by long-term follow-up of these patients
           (up to 5 years) as well as an evaluation of circulating tumoral DNA before and after
           ovarian stimulation.

        3. Finally obstetrical outcomes will also be recorded.

    <description>Patients start ovarian stimulation protocol according to their menstrual cycle phase at enrollment (standard or &quot;random start&quot;). Ovarian stimulation includes gonadotropins administration in a GnRH antagonist protocol Standard Protocol: letrozole is orally administered 2 tablets per day (2,5mgx2/d) from cycle day 2 throughout the ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins protocol until ovulation triggering. GnRH antagonist is administered as soon as at least one follicle reaches 14 mm.
&quot;Random start&quot; protocol: letrozole is administered throughout the stimulation together with gonadotropins and GnRH antagonist, until ovulation triggering.
Oocytes are collected 36h after ovulation triggering. All patients receive GnRH antagonist after oocyte retrieval for 3-7 days or until chemotherapy starts, to induce luteolysis.</description>
