    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the correlations between various tissue dimensions
      and the changes that occur following a single-tooth dental extraction in human adults.

      65 adult subjects who are in need of dental extractions will be recruited. Clinical
      measurements will be gathered prior to and immediately following the single tooth extraction.
      There will be a 2-week post-operative visit to assess healing and a 14-week follow-up for
      photographic documentation and clinical measurements of the extraction area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal phenotype, also known as periodontal biotype, has been recognized as one of the
      key factors that may potentially impact the outcome of a variety of esthetic restorative
      procedures. With the increasing esthetic demand of patients in the context of tooth
      replacement therapy in the anterior esthetic zone, the ability to determine the prognostic
      value and the influence on treatment outcomes of this parameter has become a critical
      component of contemporary treatment planning. Periodontal phenotype encompases &quot;bone
      morphotypes, shapes of the teeth, morphologic characteristics of the gingiva and the
      periodontium&quot;.
