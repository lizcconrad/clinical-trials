  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial , blind for evaluators, to assess the effectiveness of a self-care
      program using assistive technology for treatment of hand osteoarthritis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This program aims to:

        -  Encourage the use of assistive devices on a daily basis as the main form of joint
           protection.

        -  Encourage individual motivation, from the group in attendance, behavior change,
           developing the capacity of self-management of individuals of their health problems.

      Will be held for 4 meetings with an average duration of 90 minutes. Meeting 1: Its proposal
      address the importance of self-care in the treatment of chronic diseases; knowing the OA of
      the hands and their main characteristics; recognize the importance of hand function for
      carrying out activities; understand the meaning of self-care and joint protection; motivation
      adherence to the program and behavior change.

      Meeting 2: Present assistive devices as a protection feature; teach joint protection
      techniques and energy conservation focusing on the assistive device; deliver and demonstrate
      the use of assistive devices.

      Meeting 3:Encouraging the adhesion of the techniques presented; making workshop for daily
      activities; verify the difficulties with devices use by the volunteers.

      Meeting 4: Strengthening guidance given in previous meetings; make closing with the group to
      in connection with the program; motivated to continue carrying out the activities at home.

    <description>self-heed program focusing on the assistive device will consist of four weekly meetings lasting approximately 90 minutes. it will be stimulated the self-heed through knowledge of pathology and guidelines of protection articulate, and will be supplied, and trained the use of assistive devices to improve the performance of volunteers in their daily activities. Assistive devices are devices, not attached to the body, which help people with limited movements and restrictions on participation in the activities of everyday life. Example: thickening of tableware, tin openers. These volunteers will be evaluated in three stages: 1-initial assessment 2-after completion of the program and 90 days after the initial assessment. The questionnaires that will be used are: EVA; SACRAH; COPM; WHOQOL-Bref.</description>
