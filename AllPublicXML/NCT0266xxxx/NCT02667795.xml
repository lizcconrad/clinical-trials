    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that physically fit patients cope much better with the stress of
      surgery and recover faster. Consequently several research studies have tried to increase
      people's level of fitness before they have surgery. These previous research studies have
      usually required patients to carry out intense, structured exercise programmes that involve
      going to a gym. However such programmes are not 'user friendly' especially if people are not
      used to taking a lot of exercise. In this pilot study we want to test the feasibility of a
      home based programme that tries to increase patients' level of fitness by gradually
      increasing the number of steps they walk every day.

      Participants will be randomised into one of two groups. One group of participants will be
      asked to increase their level of activity by gradually walking further (the exercise group)
      and the other group will carry on with their usual level of activity (the usual activity
      group) .

      Assessments People in both groups will have an assessment on 3 occasions: when they join the
      study, just before surgery and 3 months after surgery.

      This assessment involves:

      Walking for 6 minutes up and down a corridor to see how far they can walk. Asking them for
      some information about their medical history Completing three questionnaires about how they
      are feeling and their quality of life.

      People who are randomised to the exercise group will be advised about how many steps to take
      based on how they did in the initial walking assessment. The number of days or weeks they
      will be asked to take a daily walk will depend on how much time there is between them joining
      the study and the date of their surgery. We think this will be about 2 weeks.

    <description>Participants will be given a personalised daily exercise target. This will be three times the number of steps they complete in the initial 6-Minute Walk Test. Participants will be given an activity tracker (a Fitbit ZipTM). The participants will be asked to wear the device all day to monitor their activity. Once a day the participants will be asked to complete the walking target they have been given at completion of their baseline assessment. This target should be completed in one go.
Participants will be able to tell when the target number of steps have been reached by looking at the display of the device. Participants need only to clip it onto an item of clothing. No other interaction with the device is needed and no alteration of settings is possible. The walking programme will last a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum duration of 4 weeks. The length of time will depend on the length of time between recruitment and when the participant is scheduled to have their surgery.</description>
