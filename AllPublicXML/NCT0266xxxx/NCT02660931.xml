  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will incorporate statistical models developed by the investigators to predict
      risk for acute kidney injury into our electronic medical record system, enabling an alert to
      notify providers of the risk status. Pediatric inpatients will be randomly assigned to be in
      the intervention group, for whom the notification will be implemented, or in the control
      group, who will receive usual care (no notification). The investigators believe the
      notification will increase appropriate screening for acute kidney injury and reduce the
      severity of acute kidney injury in the intervention group.

      This proposal will incorporate a logistic regression models developed by the investigators to
      predict risk for acute kidney injury in pediatric intensive care unit and pediatric ward
      patients into the electronic medical record system, enabling personalized decision support.
      Real-time surveillance using the risk prediction models will identify pediatric inpatients at
      increased risk for acute kidney injury. When patients exceed the threshold risk for acute
      kidney injury, the electronic medical record system will notify providers. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to be in the intervention group, for whom the notification will be
      implemented, or in the control group, for whom the notification will not display. The risk
      notification will be assessed for its impact on outcomes including rates of screening for
      acute kidney injury and the severity of acute kidney injury.
