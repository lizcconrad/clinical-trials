      This study is designed to collect data which will be used to correlate changes in EEG to mild
      TBI in sports concussion.

      The study will include obtaining baseline measurements before the season begins in a subset
      of athletes. Injured athletes will be studied during the season at time of injury, and then
      longitudinally weeks after injury. Matched controls will be tested following the same
      schedule as the injured athletes. A pool of contact and non-contact athletes will obtain a
      baseline measurement prior to the season and then after the season has ended.

      The study is designed to populate a large database of electrophysiological and clinical data
      from high school athletes.

    <description>The Population Pool will consist of contact and non-contact athletes recruited at each site participating in the study. The athlete's in this pool will be tested with the study device pre-season and post-season each. The BrainScope Battery consists of 3 components to collect brain electrical activity, a cognitive assessment and a balance/sway measurement.</description>

The BrainScope Battery consists of 3 components to collect brain electrical activity, a cognitive assessment and a balance/sway measurement. In addition, the injured and matched control athletes will receive advanced MRI neuroimaging.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Concussion-Injury subjects will be defined as follows: Any player who, based on
             independent clinical impression, is suspected of having suffered a concussion of any
             severity level, and on whom a routine clinical examination for concussion or head
             injury would have been conducted prior to implementation of this research protocol
             according to current standard practice.

               1. If loss of consciousness, total duration less than &lt;20 minutes

               2. No evidence of abnormality visible on Computerized Tomography (CT) of the head
                  related to the traumatic event (Note: neuroimaging is not required for
                  enrollment)

               3. No hospital admission due to either head injury or collateral injuries for &gt;24
                  hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Do not speak or read English

          2. Current CNS active prescription medications, with the exception of medications being
             taken for the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)

          3. Skull abnormalities, e.g. metal plate

          4. History of brain surgery or neurological disease

          5. Pregnant women.
