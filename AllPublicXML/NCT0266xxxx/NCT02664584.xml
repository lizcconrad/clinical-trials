      Background:

      Cardiovascular disease (CVD), osteoporosis and dementia are chronic diseases of ageing that
      impact adversely on the lives of those affected and have major health, social and economic
      consequences. A number of factors are considered to be implicated in these diseases, ranging
      from the more established factors to those that are less well recognised. Lifestyle factors
      such as diet, body weight, smoking, physical activity and years of education are acknowledged
      as risk factors for the development of these chronic diseases of aging. Emerging research
      suggests that elevated homocysteine and/or sub-optimal status of the metabolically related
      B-vitamins (folate, vitamin B12, B6 and riboflavin) may be associated with a higher risk of
      age-related disease. The interplay between relevant genetic and nutrient factors
      (gene-nutrient interactions) is considered to be highly relevant in the development (and
      prevention) of chronic diseases of ageing, however this relatively new area of research is as
      yet poorly understood. The collection of clinical, lifestyle, nutritional and genetic data on
      large numbers of patients would permit the investigation of those nutrients which interact
      with specific genes to increase the likelihood of a person developing chronic diseases of
      ageing.

      Aim:

      The aim of the TUDA study is to collect detailed clinical, lifestyle, dietary, genetic and
      biochemical data to investigate gene-nutrient interactions (particularly from the perspective
      of the B-vitamins and vitamin D/calcium) in the development of CVD, osteoporosis and dementia
      by studying older adults exhibiting the early stages of these common diseases, namely
      hypertension, low bone mineral density, and early memory loss, respectively.

      Secondary aim (follow up TUDA investigation):

      The aim of this longitudinal investigation is to re-assess clinical, nutritional, genetic and
      biochemical factors in relation to the progression of disease outcomes in TUDA study
      participants, in subsequent years after initial investigation.

      Study design:

      A total of 6000 non-institutionalised older Irish people aged over 60 years with early
      predictors of either dementia, stroke and osteoporosis (namely early memory loss, high blood
      pressure and low bone mineral density, respectively) recruited from three centres (St James's
      Hospital Dublin, Ulster University Coleraine and The Clinical Translational Research and
      Innovation Centre (C-TRIC), Londonderry) across Ireland. Non-fasting blood samples were
      collected from all subjects and routine blood biochemistry profiles and biomarkers of
      relevance to B vitamin and vitamin D status were measured. Supplement use was recorded and a
      targeted food frequency questionnaire was used to record dietary intakes of specific vitamins
      of interest (folate, B12, B6, riboflavin and D) from major food sources, particularly
      fortified foods. Physiological function tests including blood pressure, bone health (DXA
      scans) and cognitive function tests and anthropometric measures were also taken.
