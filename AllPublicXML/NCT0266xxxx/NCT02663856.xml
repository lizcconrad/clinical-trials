    <textblock>
      Understanding the complexity of aging and frailty in chronic HIV infection motivated Italian
      team members to begin to build a frailty index (FI) including 37 health variables at the
      Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic (MHMC). The validation of FI in HIV patients have been recently
      published, and more data comparing FI in HIV infected vs un-infected people, have been
      presented at international meeting and are at present submitted for publication.

      The research consortium (MHMC, HCC and HHMP) of this study was motivated to begin preliminary
      work in consideration of the similar multidisciplinary approach in Ageing care and capacity
      to address health status in ageing HIV patients using shared definitions of co-morbidities,
      multi-morbidity and measures of Physical Function and Cognition impairment, disability and
      quality of life. The investigators wanted to overcome the major criticism intrinsic in the
      FI, that is the needs to collects many variables not easily available in most HIV centres.
      The the investigators approach is to make patient living with HIV (PLWH), be the source of
      health variables taking advantage of information and communication technologies available
      with smart phones and fitness tracking device, collecting physiological parameters and
      patient related outcomes.

      In this study the investigators plan to empower elderly HIV patients via health promotion,
      assessing reduction in health deficit and improvement in quality of life using My Smart Age
      (MySAwH) application.

      MySAwH is an interactive mobile application designed to empower elderly HIV patients in
      health promotion through self assessment of ageing transition using a FI. FI is generated
      from health variables which include physical function data routinely collected by fitness
      tracking devices, Ecological momentary assessment data collected with smart phones and
      Physician health data collected during patient visits. The change in frailty index over time
      describes health transition. Although health generally worsens with age, the relationship
      between aging and health is dynamic and periodic improvement and stability in frailty index
      may be the result of the patients engagement in health promotion and improved life style.
