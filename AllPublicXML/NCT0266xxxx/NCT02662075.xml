  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of electronic cigarette
      (e-cigarette) smoking on measurable biomarkers of platelet function, vascular endothelial
      function and inflammation in healthy active smokers. 10 healthy subjects, smokers, with no
      other medical conditions will be included in this study and measurements will be obtained at
      baseline and after smoking an e-cigarette. The study will contribute to the understanding of
      the effects of e-cigarettes on cardiovascular physiology, specifically establishing if the
      use of e-cigarettes increases platelet aggregation and platelet activation when compared to
      baseline in healthy active smokers, if the use of e-cigarettes decreases brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilation compared to baseline in healthy active smokers, and to determine the
      association between biomarkers of inflammation, platelet function, and vascular endothelial
      function before and after use of e-cigarettes.

    <description>Subjects will be asked to smoke an e-cigarette containing the equivalence of nicotine in one tobacco cigarette (15 puffs) in the presence of research staff. Each puff will be timed at 4 seconds and there should be a 20-30 seconds interpuff interval as previously recommended.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult English speaking subjects able and willing to provide written informed consent

          -  Active tobacco cigarette smoker

          -  History of active smoking tobacco cigarettes for 3-10 years (at least 10 cigarettes
             per day). The rational for inclusion of active smokers is based on prior data showing
             that most e-cigarette users have smoked moderate to high amount of tobacco cigarettes
             in the past

          -  No other use of alternative tobacco or nicotine products

          -  No history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral
             arterial disease, asthma or other chronic lung disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, warfarin, statins, colchicine,
             nitrates, steroids, fish oil, omega-3 fatty acids, or any other anti-inflammatory,
             antithrombotic or anticoagulant agent in the last week

          -  History of adverse reactions to e-cigarettes
