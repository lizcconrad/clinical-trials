      marrow suppression in patients with lung cancer.

      Lung cancer is the malignant neoplasm with the highest incidence and mortality in China as
      well as worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80%-85% of all lung cancer
      cases. Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment method for NSCLC, but many patients cannot
      tolerate the adverse reactions of chemotherapy. Among the most common and most severe adverse
      reactions is bone marrow suppression. The more serious the bone marrow suppression, the
      higher the direct medical cost of chemotherapy. Literatures showed Acupuncture was used to
      treat patients with chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. In this study, the effect
      of percutaneous electrical stimulation of acupoints including Dazhui (DU14), Geshu (BL17),
      Zusanli (ST36), Sanyinjiao (SP6), and Hegu (LI4) will be investigated, compared with the
      medication group treated by oral administration of prophylactic agents, and the control group
      received routine nursing care on chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression in patients
      with lung cancer.
