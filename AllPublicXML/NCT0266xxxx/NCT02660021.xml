    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery or corrective jaw surgery is indicated for conditions of the jaw and
      face that are related to structure or growth malfunctioning, orthodontic problems, or
      co-morbidities associated with skeletal disfigurement.

      Imaging is crucial in the assessment and treatment planning of orthognathic surgery patients.
      Until recently, two-dimensional (2D) imaging, through cephalometry, was standard practice.
      However, it showed several limitations. The introduction of the cone-beam computed tomography
      (CBCT) enabling three-dimensional (3D) imaging has caused a paradigm shift. Though widespread
      implementation in routine practice is not yet present. Our department is one of the pioneers
      in the world of 3D virtual treatment planning for orthognathic surgery. The &quot;triple CBCT scan
      procedure&quot; has been developed in-house and implemented already in 2009.

      The investigators aim to develop a prospective database registering 3D treatment planning
      data of all consecutive patients eligible for orthognathic surgery, performed by Prof.
      Swennen. Patient demographics, detailed virtual 3D treatment planning parameters and
      orthognathic surgery data are being collected during consecutive visits within the framework
      of routine practice.

      Development of a database registering 3D virtual treatment planning data of orthognathic
      surgery, will provide more information about potential patient, virtual planning and surgical
      factors influencing postoperative accuracy of jaw correction, long-term stability of the
      jawbone, long-term condylar resorption, or soft tissue response. In general, it could provide
      answers on research questions that have been examined in prior studies on 2D-imaging, but can
      now be re-examined in case of 3D-imaging. Moreover, registration of those results could
      function as a measurement of quality of care, or could be used for sample size calculation
      for future large multicenter prospective trials.
