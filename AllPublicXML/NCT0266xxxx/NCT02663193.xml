    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the tolerability profiles of enzalutamide and
      abiraterone acetate (with prednisone) -with specific focus on central nervous system (CNS)
      tolerability-and quality of life (QoL) after approximately 2 months of participants starting
      treatment with one of these agents for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (more than one study site), open-label (all people know the identity of
      the intervention), prospective, observational study to characterize the tolerability profile
      of treatment and quality of life (QoL) in participants receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone
      acetate (with prednisone) in a clinical practice setting. Approximately 100 male participants
      will be enrolled into this study, 50 participants will be recruited to each treatment arm.
      Participants will complete 2 scheduled on-site visits (Baseline and Month 2). Participants
      will primarily be observed for tolerability profiles of enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate
      (with prednisone) and safety over an observational period of 2 months.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cogstate Tests at Month 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Cogstate computerized cognitive test battery will be used as the assessment tool in this study. Overall, Cogstate measures a range of cognitive functions (example, psychomotor and memory function) using a number of different tests (example, choice reaction time, one-back memory). This battery of tests was chosen because it has been shown to be sensitive to very small cognitive changes and has been tested in cancer participants after chemotherapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 2</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of Life (QoL) of cancer participants. The QLQ-C30 incorporates 9 multi-item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and QoL scale.</description>

    <description>The FACIT Measurement System is a collection of health-related QoL questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness. The fatigue subscale (FACIT-Fatigue) is a validated, 13-item questionnaire that assesses fatigue in people being treated for a chronic illness.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death余 initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization余 life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying)余 persistent or significant disability/incapacity余 congenital anomaly.</description>
