  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a 3 years longitudinal, observational, multicentre study, about 500 women will be
      recruited and followed-up from early pregnancy (10-15 gestational week) until 12 months after
      delivery. The primary aim of the present study is to systematically explore and characterize
      risk factors for perinatal depression (PND) by prospective sleep assessment (using wrist
      actigraphy, polysomnography and various sleep questionnaires) and blood based analysis of
      potential markers during the perinatal period (Life-ON study). Secondary aims are to explore
      the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and PND (substudy Life-ON1), to
      investigate the effectiveness of BLT in treating PND (substudy Life-ON2) and to test whether
      a short term trial of BLT during pregnancy can prevent PND (substudy Life-ON3).

      The characterization of specific predictive and risk factors for PND may substantially
      contribute to improve preventive medical and social strategies for the affected women. The
      study results are expected to promote a better understanding of the relationship between
      sleep disorders and the development of PND and to confirm, in a large sample of women, the
      safety and efficacy of BLT both in prevention and treatment of PND.
