      This trial will assess the effectiveness of a tailored message intervention on decreasing
      infant undervaccination.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intervention is based on the concept of &quot;message tailoring,&quot; whereby each mother is
      provided with individually customized vaccine- related information that addresses their
      unique concerns, values, questions and logistical barriers. Message tailoring is an
      evidence-based health messaging strategy that has been shown to improve compliance with a
      wide variety of preventive health care behaviors among diverse patient populations.

      In this three-armed trial the investigator will examine how providing mothers with multiple
      &quot;doses&quot; of a tailored versus untailored version of our intervention compares with &quot;usual
      care&quot; for the impact on infant under-vaccination. Secondary outcomes will include maternal
      vaccine-related attitudes (including level of vaccine hesitancy), alignment of maternal
      values with provider recommendations, and self-efficacy for overcoming logistical barriers to
      vaccination.

    <description>assessed using both a continuous and dichotomous measure. Continuous: measure of average days under-vaccinated is a recently developed metric measuring the average number of days a child is unvaccinated based on the vaccines given and the date when the vaccines where given. Dichotomous: mesauring the child's days undervaccinated or whether or not the child is up-to-date with no vaccination delays.</description>
