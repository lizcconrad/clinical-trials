  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to facilitate the evidence-based goal setting and self-monitoring intervention into
      the diabetes education practice, the investigator proposes to use Chronicle Diabetes, an
      electronic system provided available to the American Diabetes Association diabetes education
      programs, to set patient diet and physical activity goals, and connect patient
      self-monitoring information collected from smart phones and fitness trackers to Chronicle
      Diabetes system to facilitate educators' monitoring of patient adherence to their goals.

      Specific Aim 1: To develop and test an interface with Chronicle Diabetes to transfer
      smartphone collected self-monitoring diet and physical activity information from patients to
      diabetes educators.

      Specific Aim 2: To 2a) conduct usability testing and 2b) examine efficacy of this connected
      interface technology in a 3-month randomized clinical trial in 60 overweight or obese
      patients with type 2 diabetes in Houston, Texas and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability of the connected interface technology as indicated by a System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The System Usability Scale measures patients' and educators' acceptability, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of the intervention that is the focus of this study (that is, the connected interface technology within Chronicle Diabetes--Chronicle Diabetes is an electronic diabetes education documentation system to transfer smartphone and wristband collected self-monitoring diet and physical activity information from patients to diabetes educators). Patients and educators are asked to rate each usability item in the scale from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>Patients will use a smart phone and a fitness tracker for self-monitoring of diet and physical activity for 3 months; 3) Smart phones will provide feedback with graphical presentation of self-monitored information to patients; 4) Patient self-monitored information will be integrated into Chronicle Diabetes, so that educators will be able to view this information and give feedback in a follow-up visit.</description>
