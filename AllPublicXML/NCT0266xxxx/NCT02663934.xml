      Management and treatment of older persons living with HIV (PLWH) (≥ 50 years old) is becoming
      increasingly more complex as a majority is greater than 50 years old. This proposal will
      conduct a prospective controlled intervention trial to assess the quantitative and
      qualitative effects of a monitored aerobic/resistance exercise (EXS) program compared to a
      social-interaction stretching (SIS) program on brain health (neuropsychological performance
      testing and neuroimaging measurements) in older PLWH. These results could influence public
      health policy by encouraging PLWH to adopt a more physically active lifestyle and stimulate
      the development of effective EXS programs for older PLWH.

    <textblock>
      Management of older persons living with HIV (PLWH) (≥ 50 years old) is becoming increasingly
      more complex as a majority is greater than 50 years old. Attempts to improve the quality of
      life of older PLWH using adjunctive therapeutics to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)
      have largely been unsuccessful.

      While the impact of physical activity on brain health (assessed by neuropsychological
      performance and neuroimaging) has been well studied in older healthy HIV uninfected (HIV-)
      individuals and neurodegenerative conditions, few studies have concentrated on older PLWH.
      Both clinically and pathophysiologically, HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND)
      differs from other neurodegenerative disorders seen with aging (e.g. Alzheimer's disease
      (AD). A positive association relationship between exercise and cognition has been observed in
      PLWH, but physical activity has been primarily examined using self-report questionnaires that
      are subjective and not quantitative. To date, no study has focused on the direct effects of
      exercise on neuropsychological performance or neuroimaging in PLWH.

      The objective of this proposal is to conduct a prospective controlled intervention trial to
      determine if an increase in physical activity through a monitored aerobic and resistance
      exercise (EXS) program improves brain health in older PLWH. We will quantify physical
      function (physical activity using cardiorespiratory capacity and actigraphy) and brain
      function [neuropsychological performance testing and neuroimaging (cerebral blood flow (CBF)
      and brain volume)] in older physically inactive PLWH at baseline and 26 weeks after
      randomization to either an EXS or a social-interaction stretching (SIS) program. In addition,
      we will obtain stool samples, serum markers of neurogenesis, glucose regulation, and systemic
      inflammation.

      A direct impact of these expected outcomes will be the adoption of a more physically active
      lifestyle by older PLWH and improved EXS guidelines and programs for older PLWH.

    <description>In the present trial the investigators anticipate that an EXS program will lead to &gt;0.5 SD change in global Z- scores but the investigators recognize that the precise threshold for individual perception of improvement is variable. Mean change in supplementary domain Z-scores at 26 weeks will be compared between the EXS and SIS groups for all randomized participants using the Z-test.
The investigators will test the mediating effect of improvements in physical function on cognitive performance in two ways: (i) between randomized groups, and (ii) within the EXS group. Linear models will be used to determine the mediating effect of the physical function markers (high/low physical activity and peak VO2) on the change from baseline in core domain specific Z-scores and the global Z-score, by including these markers, together with group assignment, as predictors in the model.</description>

    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Investigators will assess if an EXS program improves brain structure and function more than a SIS program in older sedentary PLWH. Changes in brain volumetrics (hippocampus, caudate, anterior cingulate, amygdala, thalamus, and putamen) and regional CBF (in the same regions) at baseline (BL) and 26 weeks will be compared between EXS and SIS groups using ITT, AT, and PS analyses.
The investigators will assess if greater improvements in physical function due to EXS are associated with larger brain volumetrics &amp; increases in regional CBF. We will test the mediating effect of improvement of physical function on neuroimaging measures in two ways: between randomized groups &amp; within the EXS group. Linear models will be used to determine the mediating effect of the physical function markers (high/low physical activity and peak VO2) on the change from BL in structural &amp; functional neuroimaging measures, by including these markers, together with group assignment, as predictors in the model.</description>

    <description>All EXS sessions will be at an exercise facility at the WUSTL medical campus. Sessions will be offered weekdays. Each session will start with range of motion exercises. Participants will follow an individualized exercise training prescription based on baseline cardiovascular testing. Individual aerobic exercise intensity is based on % of maximum heart rate achieved during the baseline cardiorespiratory fitness test. The target exercise HR will start at 50% and progress to 85% HR reserve. During aerobic exercise, a battery-operated HR monitor will monitor HR. Exercise intensity &amp; duration will be increased as the participant acclimates to the exercise prescription. Adaptation is determined when a given exercise intensity yields a lower HR than prior sessions conducted at the same intensity.</description>

    <description>This group will serve as a control group against which to gauge the effects of aerobic and resistance training on cognitive function. Participants in this group will follow the same schedule and format as the EXS group. These participants will be supervised by the same trainer and will receive the same amount of attention and class interaction as participants in the EXS program. These SIS participants will receive instructions on stretching, range of motion, limbering, and toning; but the intensity will be far less than that achieved in the EXS classes. Activities will focus on flexibility enhancement. As the participant's level of flexibility increases, stretches with increasing levels of difficulty will be incorporated into the program.</description>

    <description>The resistance exercise training component will follow aerobic exercise and will consist of 4 upper and 3 lower body routines. A combination of guided-motion machines and free weights will be used. Voluntary maximum strength will be measured during the first 4 sessions on each exercise station. The program will initially consist of 1-2 sets of each exercise while lifting a weight that causes muscle fatigue after 8-10 repetitions. The trainer will monitor each participant's exercise response, and when the participant can comfortably lift the weight for 12 repetitions on any exercise, the weight will be increased to cause the muscle group to fatigue after 8 repetitions. This progressive 8-12 repetition cycle is repeated for each exercise over 26 weeks.</description>
