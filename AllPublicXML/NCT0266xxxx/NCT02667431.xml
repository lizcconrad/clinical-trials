  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent treatment of endometrial cancer and SUI may improve QOL, emotional and physical
      health and decrease costs for both patients and the health care system. At the time of
      endometrial cancer diagnosis, not only are women evaluated by a gynecologist and/or a
      gynecologic oncologist, but the majority will undergo surgery within weeks of their
      diagnosis. Thus, urinary incontinence could easily be identified, a referral made, and
      concurrent surgery performed. This would spare the patient two surgeries, decrease the
      emotional distress associated with SUI symptoms, decrease the costs associated with SUI for
      the patient and possibly improve overall quality of life. The proposed study will compare the
      quality of life and clinical outcomes among women with endometrial cancer and SUI that have
      concurrent surgery to women that do not have concurrent surgery. The findings of our proposed
      research will provide valuable information necessary for woman and clinicians to make
      decisions regarding the treatment of SUI, including evidence regarding the risks and benefits
      of performing concurrent endometrial cancer and SUI surgery.

    <measure>Sexual Function will be measured using the female sexual function index (FSFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-op to 12 month post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the sexual function of women with endometrial cancer and SUI who have concurrent surgery to women who have cancer surgery only. Sexual function will be measured using the female sexual function index (FSFI). It is a 19-item instrument assessing 6 domains of sexual function: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain.</description>

    <description>Compare the clinical outcomes of women with endometrial cancer and SUI who have concurrent surgery to women who have cancer surgery only, by measuring time to surgery (ie: number of days) using hospital records. The estimated time to surgery will be assessed up to 12 weeks, measuring from initial date of enrollment to date of documented surgery date.</description>

    <description>Compare the clinical outcomes of women with endometrial cancer and SUI who have concurrent surgery to women who have cancer surgery only by examining Post-Operative complications.

      <textblock>
        Patients with newly diagnosed complex atypical hyperplasia or clinical stage 1 or 2
        endometrial cancer based on physical exam and/or imaging will be approached.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women will be eligible if they have:

               1. clinical stage 1 or 2 (disease confined to the uterus) endometrial carcinoma or
                  complex atypical hyperplasia

               2. answer yes to one screening question: &quot;Do you ever leak urine when you cough,
                  sneeze, jump or laugh?&quot; We will include women with complex atypical hyperplasia
                  (CAH) because 40% of these women will have an endometrial cancer identified at
                  the time of surgery and the risk factors are the same for CAH as they are for
                  clinical stage 1 and 2 endometrial cancers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women will be excluded if they have

               1. clinical stage 3 and 4 endometrial cancer

               2. prior pelvic radiation therapy

               3. vesicovaginal fistula

               4. urethrovaginal fistula.

          -  We are excluding women with vesicovaginal fistula or urethrovaginal fistula due to the
             risk of infection when placing a midurethral sling.
