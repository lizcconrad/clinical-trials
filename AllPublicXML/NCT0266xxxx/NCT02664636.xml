    <textblock>
      The main objective is to develop models for the cortical reorganization of motor areas and
      inter-hemispheric equilibrium in the early phase of post stroke recovery evaluated by the
      fNIRS technique from day 0 to day 60 (day 0 being the day of inclusion in the study) and to
      correlate the latter with the early phases of motor recovery over the same period, as
      measured by the test Fugl-Meyer.

    <description>The study population consists of patients 20 and 75 years of age who have had a supra-tentorial ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. The study covers consulting or hospitalized patients at the neurological rehabilitation service (NHS) of Grau du Roi Medical Center, part of the Nîmes University Hospital. Most patients originate from a 2-4 week stay in the neurological acute care, cardiac or polyvalent departments of the University Hospitals of Montpellier or Nîmes.
