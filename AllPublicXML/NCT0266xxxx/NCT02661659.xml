    <textblock>
      A phase Ib study investigating the safety, the immunogenicity and the optimal administration
      frequency of the S-588210 5-peptide vaccine in MPM patients without progression after
      pemetrexed-based chemotherapy will be conducted. Additionally, to identify more accurate
      predictive biomarkers of response to S-588210, T-cell-receptor-sequencing (TCR) pre- and
      post-vaccination will be performed in blood samples of patients treated with the vaccine.
      Immunohistochemical analysis of the vaccine oncoantigens will also be correlated with
      induction of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Finally, to explore the infiltration of
      tumors with T-cells and the potential presence of an immunosuppressive tumor
      microenvironment, immunohistochemistry for immune checkpoints (including PDL1/PD1, CTLA4) and
      immune suppressive cell subsets (T-regs, macrophages) will be performed.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the rate of peptide-specific CTL induction to S-588210 within the first 8 months
      in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with MPM who have not progressed on first-line
      pemetrexed-based chemotherapy treated on a weekly or every other week vaccination schedule.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the safety of S-588210 in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with MPM treated
           with S-588210

        2. To determine the disease control rate (DCR) in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with MPM
           treated with S-588210

        3. To determine the progression-free-survival (PFS) in HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with
           MPM who have not progressed on first-line pemetrexed-based chemotherapy and who are
           treated with S-588210

        4. To evaluate the peptide-specific CTL response to S-588210 over time up to 8 months in
           HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with MPM who have not progressed on first-line
           pemetrexed-based chemotherapy
