        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Screening body weight 88 to 111 kg, inclusive;

          -  General good health with no clinically significant abnormalities that would affect
             ability to complete study as determined by medical history, physical examination,
             visual evaluation of the septum and turbinates to document baseline anatomy,
             electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory test results;

          -  Negative drug and alcohol testing;

          -  Negative pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject who is not surgically sterile or female subject who is less than 2 years
             postmenopausal, and who does not agree to use a highly effective birth control method
             during the study and up to 3 months after the last dose of investigational product;

          -  In the judgment of the Investigator, any clinically significant abnormality (such as
             septal perforations) or illness that would interfere with participation in this study
             as determined by medical history, physical examination (including visual exam of
             septum and turbinates), ECG, clinical laboratory results, or other screening safety
             tests;

          -  Any other condition and/or situation that causes the investigator to deem a subject
             unsuitable for the study.
