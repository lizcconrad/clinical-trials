  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many bacteria that naturally live in our gut and are essential for good health.
      These bacteria have a variety of helpful functions, such as aiding digestion, synthesizing
      vitamins, repressing the growth of harmful bacteria and defending against some diseases. The
      desirable bacteria that live in the gut are collectively known as 'gut flora', or more
      appropriately, as 'gut microbiota'.

      The less desirable resistant bacteria, however, can also be carried in a person's gut for
      prolonged periods of time and be found in the stools without causing illness. Persons that
      carry the resistant bacteria in the gut are known as &quot;carriers&quot; and they require no
      treatment. Knowing that a person carries resistant bacteria is helpful, because it will
      inform the choice of antibiotic if the person were to become unwell or had an intervention
      such as surgery in the future.

      There is some evidence that resistant bacteria found in the stools can sometimes be passed
      from one person to another and eventually make someone ill if they infect (invade) their
      body. The investigators do not know how often this may happen, or how much carrying resistant
      bacteria in the stools may facilitate the spread of resistant bacteria in the population. It
      is important to address these questions and study ways to stop the resistant bacteria from
      spreading to safeguard the efficacy of antibiotics.

      1. Study A. Mapping of resistant gram negative bacteria (RGNB) in the community: Based on
           RGNB clinical isolates as a proxy for gut colonising RGNB and residential Lower Layer
           Super Output Area (LSOA) data retrieved from laboratory information systems of a
           hospital cohort, to describe the geographical distribution of RGNB in South East London
           in relation to demographic, cultural and socioeconomic indicators and to investigate
           whether geographical clustering of resistance, compatible with the occurrence of
           community based transmission hotspots, occurs in our local community.

        2. Study B. Tracking gut colonisation with carbapenem resistant Klebsiella spp. or
           Klebsiella spp. resistant to third generation cephalosporins (3GC), herein referred to
           as 'Resistant Klebsiella' (RK):

      To investigate the duration of gut colonisation with Klebsiella spp. in a small cohort of
      discharged hospital patients with resistance to the carbapenems (eg. meropenem), defined by
      presence of either blaKPC, blaNDM, blaIMP , blaVIM or blaOXA48 genes, or Klebsiella spp. with
      resistance to the 3GC (eg. ceftazidime), defined by presence of blaCTX_M or AmpC Î²lactamase
      genes. To determine the occurrence of participant to participant RK transmission events
      within a household, in relation to gut bacterial load and the gut microbiota profile. To
      characterise over time, the gut microbiota profile of participants colonised with RK as
      compared to participants who only carry antibiotic susceptible enterobacteria in the gut. It
      is beyond the scope of our feasibility study to enrol a sample of persons that is
      representative of the wider population, or to account for sample size and power calculations
      that would allow for characterisation of statistically meaningful associations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study A ('Mapping'): Retrospective data collection from the hospital laboratory
             information system on patients diagnosed with infection and/or colonisation by
             relevant gram negative bacteria and antibiotic resistance profile.

          -  Study B ('Tracking'):

               -  Inclusion criteria for index participants are being at least 16 years of age,
