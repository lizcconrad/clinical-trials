      The study aim is in two phases. First phase: to evaluate the influence of vitamin D
      deficiency on asthma severity, degree of airway obstruction and frequency of asthma
      exacerbations. Second phase: to evaluate if in patients with vitamin D deficiency (25-OH
      vitamin D levels below 20 ng/ml), vitamin D supplementation decreases the number of disease
      exacerbations.

      The first phase of the study consisted of a cross-sectional examination of a cohort of 119
      asthmatic patients, who had at least one year regular follow-up in our respiratory clinic,
      and were not receiving any vitamin D supplementation.

      In the second phase patients with vitamin D deficiency (25-OH D values below 20 ng/ml), were
      recruited in a one year longitudinal study, during which they received vitamin D
      supplementation. The study started and ended in late autumn-winter season when, at our
      latitude, sun exposure is lowest. Symptoms, spirometry and number of exacerbations were
      recorded during both study phases.
