    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded study conducted in British Columbia, Canada, where there is a
      publicly funded, organized screening program and screening mammography is recommended at
      24-month intervals. Eligible women aged 51-73 years old and overdue for their screening
      mammogram by 6-24 months are identified in the database of the Screening Mammography Program
      of BC (SMPBC). Family physicians are recruited by mail and asked to sign letters to the
      overdue women in their practices. The overdue women are randomized and mailed either the
      signed reminder letter and the standard reminder postcard, or the standard reminder postcard
      alone. The primary endpoint is the proportion of overdue women attending a screening
      mammogram appointment 6 months after the mailing.
