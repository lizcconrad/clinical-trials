      Primary Objective:

      To compare the effect of repeat doses of Leukine to placebo administered subcutaneously (SC)
      on established cortical amyloid load in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of Leukine versus placebo.

        -  To explore the effect of Leukine versus placebo on cognitive performance.

        -  To collect biospecimens for future biomarker research.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Men and women ≥40 years and ≤80 years with a diagnosis of MCI due to AD according to
             the National Institutes of Aging Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria
             (intermediate or high likelihood) with sporadic or familial inheritance pattern. Mild
             cognitive impairment AD is defined as:

          -  Evidence of concern about change in cognition, in comparison with person's previous
             level (subjective memory complaint/decline during the past year for more than 6 months
             and/or confirmed by informant and/or clinician), and

          -  Objective impairment of memory function documented by an error score on the delayed
             recall section of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale
             (ADAS-cog) ≥1.5 standard deviations (SD) from the age-stratified mean; ie,

          -  Age 55-69 years: ≥6 errors

          -  Age 70-74 years: ≥7 errors

          -  Age 75+ years: ≥8 errors

          -  But no definite impairment(s) in activities of daily living (ADLs), in the
             Investigator's view as assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS)
             ADL adapted to MCI, and

          -  Evidence of elevated cortical amyloid by positron emission tomography (PET) using
             florbetapir F18 (Amyvid) (a positive scan) by qualitative assessment according to the
             product label.

          -  Have a dedicated partner/caregiver informant who can assist the patient with the study
             procedures and administration of study medication, and is in the company of the
             patient at least 12 hours a week.

          -  Willing and able to provide signed informed consent.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any technical/administrative reason that makes it impossible to randomize the patient
             in the study.

          -  Prior treatment with an investigational anti-amyloid therapy.

          -  Contraindication for lumbar puncture, or contraindication or inability to complete
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or having past or planned exposure to ionizing
             radiation that would, together with the radiation resulting from the administrations
             of the PET tracer used in this study, exceed applicable institutional, local, or
             national recommendations for annual or lifetime exposure.

          -  Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score &gt;4.

          -  Other neurological or psychiatric condition (other than AD) which can impair
             cognition; or, computerized tomography (CT)/MRI evidence of potentially significant
             intracranial abnormalities not related to AD (eg, evidence of major stroke or lacune
             in an area critical to cognition, infections, cancer, hydrocephalus, multiple
             sclerosis etc.); or abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) not consistent with AD.

          -  MRI evidence of &gt;4 microhemorrhages: patients who may be prone to spontaneous
             amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA-H) and/or may be more susceptible to
             adverse effects of the ARIA-H.

          -  Untreated or unstable medical condition that could interfere with the study
             assessments in the opinion of the Investigator or may require immune-stimulating,
             immune-suppressive, or immune-modulating treatment(s) during the conduct of the study;
             eg, immunoglobulin, therapeutic vaccines, cytokines, anti-cytokine monoclonal
             antibodies. History of asplenia, hyposplenia, or splenectomy (whatever the surgical
             reasons).

             substance-related disorder according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Psychiatric Disorders, Edition IV, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) or DSM-V; or considered

             or hyperthyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, hyperleukocytic syndrome (including but
             not restricted to chronic myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma),
             monoclonal gammopathy, and thrombocythemia.

             unable to be tested for pregnancy; or are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Recipient of an investigational drug within prior 60 days, or within 5 times the

          -  History of latex allergy or yeast allergy.

          -  Any patient who:

          -  Is likely to be noncompliant, leave the area, or separate from the designated
             caregiver/informant for more than 3 days during the study,
