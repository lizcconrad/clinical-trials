    <textblock>
      Although significant advances in neonatal care have increased survival rates of preterm
      infants born before 28 weeks gestation, a concomitant decrease in neuro developmental
      disorders has not been achieved. Cerebral injuries, well documented during the previous
      years, in preterm babies are particularly deleterious since they occur in a developing brain.
      They affect both white and grey matter by complex mechanisms and the principal targets are
      the developing oligodendrocytes and neurons of the subplate. All these criteria define the
      encephalopathy of prematurity. Nevertheless, the consequences of prematurity at the level of
      the brainstem are not very well known and may explain neuro-developmental disorders with
      normal MRI.

      The assessment of the motor repertoire is complementary to the neurological examination and
      may represent a diagnostic tool for cerebral palsy, mild motor deficits and delayed
      acquisition in children. The newborn have a rich motor repertoire. GMs play a key role in the
      development due to the feedback that they send to cortical neurons and reflect the
      maturational stage of the Central Nervous System (CNS). Lesions of the brainstem caused by
      prematurity may induce alterations of the motor repertoire.

      Dysautonomic disorders, such as bradycardia, apneas, feeding problems, that occur frequently
      in very preterm babies reflect brainstem abnormalities. These symptoms are also described in
      other pathologies, in Rett syndrome and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In these
      pathologies deficits of the 5-HT system have been described and associated with dysautonomia.
      It would then be interesting to evaluate 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in very preterm
      babies.

      The serotonergic system develops very early during gestation and is one of the first
      neurotransmitter to appear in the developing brain. The main 5-HT nuclei are located within
      the brainstem. 5-HT plays an important role in the homeostasis and the modulation of the
      respiratory network. Moreover, previous studies have shown that 5-HT projections to the
      spinal cord are involved in posture and in the coordination. It is tempting to think that
      5-HT deficits may have some repercussions on the development of the CNS, changing activity
      dependent processes, such as spontaneous activity recorded at the spinal level in rodents.

      In this project, the 5-HT platelet levels in preterm infants born before 28 weeks will be
      compared with newborns. a correlation between the levels of 5-HT with MRI of the posterior
      fossa, GMs and dysautonomia different parameters such as heart rate variability,
      suction-swallowing and different breathing techniques will be established
