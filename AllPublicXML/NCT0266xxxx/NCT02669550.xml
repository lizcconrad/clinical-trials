  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) has been the preferred instrument for many years in the
      management of difficult tracheal intubation, and it is considered as a gold standard. The
      disposcope endoscope (DE) is a medical device for endotracheal intubation used in clinical
      practice recently.This study compares FOB and DE for awake orotracheal intubation in obese
      patients with anticipated difficult airway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty obese patients with anticipated difficult airways were randomised to undergo awake
      orotracheal intubation by FOB(group F) or DE(group D) after conscious sedation. The
      conditions of orotracheal intubation, the time needed to view the vocal cords and to complete
      the orotracheal intubation, the hemodynamic changes and the adverse events including
      bradycardia, respiratory depression during orotracheal intubation, throat pain, hoarseness
      and memory after surgery were recorded. The ease of view the vocal cords and passing the
      tracheal tube through the glottis were also evaluated by using a visual analogue scale (VAS)
      by operator.
