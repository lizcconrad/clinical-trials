  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute effects of oxygen supplementation during
      a submaximal exercise test in patients with Eisenmenger's Syndrome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome were submitted to a submaximal exercise test (six-minute
      walking test) with and without supplemental oxygen. The distance walked during the two tests
      were compared to assess the impact of oxygen supplementation on the walking distance.
