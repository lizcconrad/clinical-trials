  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer´s disease (AD) in one of the most important causes of dementia and poses a
      considerable challenge in health care. Today, criteria for the diagnosis and the follow up of
      patients with AD mainly rely either on subjective tests or invasive methods. This limits the
      general applicability of the latter test for population screening and underlines the need for
      the identification of easily accessible tools for the identification of high-risk subjects.
      Because of its unique optical properties, the eye offers the possibility of the non-invasive
      assessment of both structural and functional alterations in neuronal tissue. As the
      neuro-retina is part of the brain, it does not come as a surprise that neuro-degenerative
      changes in the brain are accompanied by structural and possibly also functional changes in
      the neuro-retina and the ocular vasculature. The current study seeks to test the hypothesis
      that beside the known anatomical changes, also functional changes can be detected in the
      retina of patients with AD. For this purpose, flicker light induced hyperemia will be
      measured in the retina as a functional test to assess the coupling between neural activity
      and blood flow. Further, structural parameters such as retinal nerve fiber layer thickness
      and function parameters such as ocular blood flow and retinal oxygenation will be assessed
      and compared to age and sex matched controls.

          -  Normal findings in the medical history unless the investigator considers an
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant
