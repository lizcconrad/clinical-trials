      This study is experimental and will prospectively assess the proportion of patients in the
      two (2) MammaPrint Risk categories in patients of Chinese descent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of breast cancer in Chinese women is lower than that of a Western population.
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Chinese women and the incidence is rising.
      Moreover there are more premenopausal women with breast cancer where the breast cancer
      incidence peaks in the forties and the postmenopausal rise in incidence is less commonly
      seen. As the genetic predisposition to breast cancer is increasingly understood, it has been
      suggested that the differences in breast cancer incidence in different ethnic populations is
      potentially due to interactions between lifestyle and genetic characteristics. To date, the
      use of Agendia's gene expression assays in Chinese women has not been studied. In this study,
      the feasibility of the gene-expression prognostic assays for risk assessment in this specific
      group will be assessed. Moreover, the specific molecular characteristics and potential
      biomarkers will be studied, focusing especially on the large group of premenopausal breast
      cancer patients.
