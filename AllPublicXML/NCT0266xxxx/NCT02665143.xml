  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination of nintedanib+ induction
      chemotherapy can be an effective strategy for patients where outcome of relapse/refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poor.

      This study will conducted as a Phase 1/Phase 2 trial.

      The primary objective of Phase 1 is to determine the safety and tolerability of a combination
      of Nintedanib + induction chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      The primary objective of Phase 2 is to determine the efficacy (rate of CR/CRp/CRi) of
      Nintedanib+ induction vs Placebo+ induction.

      The secondary objectives of this study include: determining the overall response rate
      according to IWG AML 2003 criteria, the toxicity profile and safety of the combination, the
      percentage of patients bridging to transplantation, the overall survival, leukemia free
      survival including analysis with censoring at HSCT and rates of haematological improvement
      according to IWG MDS 2006 criteria. In addition, exploratory correlative studies will be
      conducted.

    <description>In the Phase 1 portion of the study, safety will be assessed after the inclusion of the first 6 patients, to analyze tolerance and adverse events occurring during this trial and will decide on any action to be taken. Safety will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE V4 criteria.</description>

    <measure>Complete Remission Rate (Phase 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>In Phase 2, the primary endpoint of complete remission rate will be based on IWG 2003 AML response criteria.
This construct is an overall response composite and it will be assessed using the following metrics:
Morphologic complete remission (CR): ANC ≥ 1,000/mcl, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcl, &lt; 5% bone marrow blasts, no Auer rods, no evidence of extramedullary disease. (No requirements for marrow cellularity, hemoglobin concentration).
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): Same as CR but ANC may be &lt; 1,000/mcl but &gt;500 mcl and/or platelet count &lt; 100,000/mcl but &gt;20,000/mcl
Partial remission (PR): ANC ≥ 1,000/mcl, platelet count &gt; 100,000/mcl, and at least a 50% decrease in the percentage of marrow aspirate blasts to 5-25%, or marrow blasts &lt; 5% with persistent Auer rods.
Marrow Leukemia Free State: &lt; 5% bone marrow blasts, no Auer rods, no extra medullary disease. No requirement on cytopenias.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Hematological Improvement (Phase 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of hematological improvement will be assessed based on IWG MDS 2006 criteria. Due to differing pretreatment conditions of participants, response to treatment in this construct will be assessed in the following manner:
Erythroid response (pretreatment &lt;11 g/dL) : Hgb increase at least by 1.5 g/dL. Relevant reduction of units of RBC transfusions by an absolute number of at least 4 RBC transfusions/8 wk compared with the pretreatment transfusion number in the previous 8 wk. Only RBC transfusions given for a Hgb of below or equal to 9.0 g/dL pretreatment will count in the RBC transfusion response evaluation.
Platelet response (pretreatment 100x109/L): Absolute increase of at least 30x109/L for patients starting with more than 20x109/L platelets. Increase from less than 20x109/L to more than 20x109/L and by at least 100%.
Neutrophil response (pretreatment, &lt;1.0x109/L) At least 100% increase and an absolute increase of at least 0.5x109/L.</description>
