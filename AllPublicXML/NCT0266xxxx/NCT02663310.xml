  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of surgical
      decompression/untethering, combined with weight bearing rehabilitation, on neurological
      recovery following chronic spinal cord injury.

      Safety Issues:

      Safety issues need to be watched are: occurrence of known and unknown undesirable incidences,
      moving up injury levels, loss of previously preserved neurological functions, vital physical
      signs, and worsening of EKG and lab results. If unforeseen issues occur, patients will be
      consulted to determine whether treatments will be continued.

      Adverse events:

      Adverse events may occur during the trail and these events will be recorded. The severity of
      the events and their relationship to the experimental therapy will be determined, documented
      and reported to the Data Monitoring and Safety Committee who will determine how these events
      will be handled if they occur.
