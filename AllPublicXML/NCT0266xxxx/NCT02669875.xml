    <textblock>
      Portal hypertension (an increase in blood pressure in the portal vein that carries the blood
      from the intestine and spleen to the liver) underlies most of the serious complications of
      liver cirrhosis. This randomised placebo controlled study in people with liver cirrhosis
      evaluates the acute effects serelaxin (RLX030) infusion on portal hypertension and liver
      blood flow.

      This study will investigate the effects of the investigational drug serelaxin (a recombinant
      form of the peptide human relaxin-2) on portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis.
      The investigators will measure portal pressure by hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and
      hepatic blood flow by indocyanine green (ICG) clearance to evaluate the potential benefits of
      the drug. In a recently completed small exploratory open-label phase 2 study (EudraCT no.
      201200023626, NCT01640964), Part B demonstrated that serelaxin can lower portal pressure.
