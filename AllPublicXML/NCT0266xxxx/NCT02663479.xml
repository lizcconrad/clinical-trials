      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a proprietary
      nutraceutical supplement in capsule form over 4 months in treating blood pressure in a group
      of chronic hypertensive subjects that are not receiving any pharmaceutical anti-hypertensive
      agents or other nutraceutical supplements.
