      1. An intact pharyngoesophageal reflex is essential to protect the upper airway from
           aspiration of either mouth contents or regurgitated gastric refluxate. This reflex is
           essential at protecting the airway in all patients.

        2. In patients, while under general anesthesia, it is postulated that an identifiable upper
           esophageal sphincter and esophageal peristalsis are not present.

        3. With the cessation of general anesthetics, accompanied by the reversal of nerve block,
           normal pharyngoesophageal peristaltic activity correlates with awakening the patient
           from anesthesia. This would be identified by the performance of esophageal manometry.

        4. A return of normal verbally stimulated pharyngoesophageal swallowing sequence accurately
           identifies a safe time to remove endotracheal tubes and/or reverse anesthesia. This
           verbally stimulated swallowing sequence correlated precisely with the return of
           objective pharyngoesophageal function.

      This pilot study will examine esophageal manometry in patients emerging from routine general
      anesthesia. Manometry of the esophagus is not a standard part of surgery or general
      anesthesia. The investigators will be using standard solid state high resolution manometry.
      One of the authors (JPC) evaluates all routine manometry for patients undergoing such
      procedures at both UCSF and SFGH. The use of manometry in patients recovering from anesthesia
      will permit the investigators to assess the recovery of a normal swallowing mechanism. An
      adequate determination of return of normal swallowing sequence is likely to determine the
      safe time for extubation. The investigators propose to, as a research study, investigate
      esophageal motor function using standard high resolution esophageal manometry in 10 patients
      recovering from general anesthesia. These studies are likely to document that the return of
      normal pharyngoesophageal function will coordinate with verbal commands to initiate
      swallowing. This pilot study will help clarify the precise timing of the return of normal
      function in the oropharynx and the proximal esophagus and thus determine the safe time for
      removal of the endotracheal or nasotracheal intubation.
