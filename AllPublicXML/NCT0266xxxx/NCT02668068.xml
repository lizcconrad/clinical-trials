  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumoconiosis is a kind of lung disease due to inhalation of dust such as silica(common
      named Silicosis), coal and rock dust, characterized by inflammation, coughing, and fibrosis.
      Currently there is no effective drug treatment. The whole-lung lavage(WLL) can effectively
      clear the protein-like substances and inhaled dust deposited in the alveoli and bronchioles,
      as well as the pulmonary alveolar macrophage(PAM) and the resulting induced inflammation,
      fibrosis induced factor, serve to improve respiratory function, relieve symptoms of efficacy,
      but can't slow down or reverse the progression of pulmonary fibrosis.

      By taking large volume whole-lung lavage (WLL) as a conventional therapy, this study intends
      to observe and evaluate the safety and efficiency of combined large volume WLL with
      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation for treatment of Pneumoconiosis. Moreover, the
      immune regulation effect between large volume WLL and combined large volume WLL with MSC
      transplantation will also be preliminarily investigated and discussed.
