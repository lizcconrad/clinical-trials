    <textblock>
      ABACUS is an open-label, international, multi-centre, window of opportunity phase II trial
      for patients with histologically confirmed (T2-T4a) transitional cell carcinoma of the
      bladder. The trial aims to test the efficacy of preoperative MPDL3280A and will include
      extensive biomarker work on samples from these patients. Eligible patients will receive two
      3-weekly cycles of MPDL3280A pre-cystectomy. Following cystectomy, patients will be followed
      up for safety, survival, and disease data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPDL3280A (also called atezolizumab) is an immune check point inhibitor which targets
      programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Overexpression of PD-L1 prevents the immune system from
      eradicating cancerous cells as it blocks antigen recognition. MPDL3280A inhibits this
      interaction, allowing immune-mediated tumour cell killing.
