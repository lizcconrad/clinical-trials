      This study aim to compare the efficacy, safety and quality of life of vinflunine/gemcitabine
      and carboplatin/gemcitabine in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer and impaired renal
      function.

    <textblock>
      Rational The standard first line treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma
      unfit for cisplatin due to renal impairment is carboplatin containing chemotherapy, with a
      median overall survival of approximately 8-10 month. New, more effective regimens in terms of
      tumor control and quality of life are urgently needed. Vinflunine has proven efficacy in
      urothelial carcinoma and is registered as second line treatment. The combination of
      gemcitabine and vinflunine has not yet been evaluated in first line treatment for patients
      with metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

      Objectives

        -  To compare the progression free survival (FPS) of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus
           carboplatin/gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional
           cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract unfit for cisplatin based chemotherapy due to
           impaired renal function.

        -  To evaluate the tumour response (ORR), overall survival (OS) and disease control rate
           (DCR) of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine

        -  To assess the safety and toxicity of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus
           carboplatin/gemcitabine.

        -  To investigate and compare Quality of life during treatment with vinflunine/gemcitabine
           and carboplatin/gemcitabine respectively.
