  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the impact of sleep workshops on sleep, mood,
      anxiety and well-being measures in a sample of college students. College students have a high
      prevalence of sleep problems including poor sleep hygiene, volitional sleep deprivation, and
      insomnia. Sleep disorders in college students negatively affect mood, social functioning,
      physical safety, and academic performance. Rarely recognized by the students themselves,
      these conditions are therefore often untreated. Participants in this study will be randomly
      assigned to receive the College Sleep Improvement Plan (C-SIP) or a control session.
      Participants will be asked to track their sleep as well as complete questionnaires; a subset
      of participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor.

    <description>Participants assigned to the C-SIP group will attend sessions where information about sleep is presented. In session I, information about sleep and the effects of lack of sleep will be presented. Participants will also be presented with advice and tips on how to improve sleep. Session II will focus on assisting participants overcome any barriers they faced in applying the advice they received in session I; participants will also receive additional information on sleep and sleep-related techniques.</description>
