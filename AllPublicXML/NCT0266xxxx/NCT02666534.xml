  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical excision is the standard treatment for cutaneous SCC. However, many patients
      diagnosed with SCC are elderly and ineligible for surgery. Ablative fractional laser-
      assisted photodynamic therapy (AFL-PDT) offered a higher efficacy than conventional
      Methylaminolevulinate (MAL)-PDT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lesions are potentially metastatic and can be life threatening.
      Hence, surgical excision is the standard treatment for cutaneous SCC. However, some patients
      are ineligible for surgery because of their poor general health, concomitant anticoagulant or
      immunosuppressive therapies, or allergy to local anesthetics.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methylaminolevulinate (MAL) is an innovative treatment
      modality that has been approved in Europe for the treatment of actinic keratosis, basal cell
      carcinoma, and Bowen's disease. However, currently, there is insufficient evidence to support
      the routine use of topical PDT for SCC.

      Ablative fractional laser (AFL) ablates the epidermis and dermis without significant thermal
      injury, creating microscopic ablation zones in the portion of the skin that the laser is
      applied to. Our previous studies showed that AFL-primed MAL-PDT (AFL-PDT) offered a higher
      efficacy than conventional MAL-PDT in the treatment of many other diseases, such as actinic
      keratosis, actinic cheilitis, and Bowen's disease.

      Investigators recruited Korean patients with microinvasive SCC and compared the efficacy,
      recurrence rate, and cosmetic outcomes of AFL-PDT with those of standard MAL-PDT.

    <description>The overall cosmetic outcome was assessed by each investigator for all lesions that achieved complete response at 24 months, and was graded using a 4-point scale: excellent (only slight occurrence of redness or change in pigmentation), good (moderate redness or change in pigmentation), fair (slight to moderate scarring, atrophy, or induration), or poor (extensive scarring, atrophy, or induration)</description>

    <description>Adverse events reported by the patients were noted at each follow-up visit, including severity, duration, and need for additional therapy. All events due to PDT were described as phototoxic reactions(e.g erythema, burning sensation, swelling, bleeding)</description>

    <description>Immediately after the AFL, a 1-mm thick layer of methyl-aminolevulinate (16% Metvix® cream; PhotoCure ASA, Oslo, Norway) was applied to the lesion and to 5 mm of the surrounding healthy tissue. The area was covered with an occlusive dressing (Tegaderm; 3M, Co., Saint Paul, MN, USA) for 3 h, after which the remaining cream was removed with saline gauze, and the red fluorescence of porphyrins was visualized with Wood's light.</description>
