        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥18 but ≤ 80 years of age at the time of dosing.

          2. BMI ≥ 18 and ≤ 32 at the screening visit.

          3. Females (if of child-bearing potential and sexually active) and males (if sexually
             active with a partner of child-bearing potential) who agree to use a medically
             acceptable and effective birth control method from the first dose and for 8 days
             following administration of study drug. Medically acceptable methods of contraception
             that may be used by the participant and/or his/her partner include abstinence, birth
             control pills or patches, diaphragm, intrauterine device (IUD), condom, surgical
             sterilization, and progestin implant or injection. Prohibited methods include: the
             rhythm method or withdrawal.

          4. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and able to understand and comply
             with protocol requirements.

          5. During the period of study confinement, subjects will be required to abstain from
             beverages containing grapefruit juice or caffeine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a known allergy to any ester based anesthetics including cocaine HCl, procaine,
             tetracaine, chloroprocaine, dibucaine, or benzocaine Amide based anesthetic allergies
             are NOT exclusionary. Amide based anesthetics are: Lidocaine, mepivicaine,
             bupivicaine, levobupivicaine, ropivicaine, etidocaine, prilocaine, and articaine.

          2. The use of amphetamines, methylphenidate or other stimulant prescription and
             nonprescription products such as pseudoephedrine, bronchial inhalers containing
             sympathomimetics (epinephrine or other beta-receptor agonist) or herbal products in
             the 7 days prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs during the course of
             the study.

          3. Use of any SNRIs/SSRIs antidepressants or tricyclic antidepressant up to7 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs
             during the screening period and throughout the time period of the trial.

          4. Use of MAO Inhibitor drugs up to14 days prior to screening or has a need to use these
             drugs during the screening period and throughout the time period of the trial.

          5. Has a history of abuse of controlled substances, nasal or otherwise, or has damage to
             the nasal space, that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the
             ability to absorb RX0041-002.

          6. Has severely traumatized mucosa or sepsis in the nasal cavity.

          7. Has participated in an investigational study or received an investigational drug
             within 30 days preceding the randomization.

          8. Is a pregnant or nursing mother.

          9. Has a positive pregnancy test at Screening or Day 1.

         10. Has a history of seizure, with the exception of febrile seizures.

         11. Has glaucoma, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, or moderate to severe hypertension
             (defined as an average SBP ≥160 mmHg or an average DBP ≥ 100 mmHg at the dosing
             visit).

         12. Has a known personal or family history of hereditary pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
             Study participants will be screened by asking about personal or family history of
             anesthetic reaction, anesthetic death, and previous diagnosis of psuedocholinesterase
             deficiency in a relative or personally. Subjects identified with pseudocholinesterase
             deficiency are at risk for delayed recovery with certain anesthetics (e.g.
             succinylcholine and ester-based anesthetics).

         13. Has a known personal or family history of pheochromocytoma. Study participants will be
             specifically asked if they have been treated for a pheochromocytoma previously or if
             they have a family member who has been diagnosed with pheochromocytoma (since 10% of
             these are familial).

         14. Has a known personal or family history of adrenal tumor.

         15. ECG abnormalities judged clinically significant by the investigator.

         16. Has a positive urine test result for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates,
             cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, opiates and oxycodone) at Screening or Day 1

         17. Hematocrit, WBC, or platelets outside the normal limits and judged clinically
             significant by the investigator.

         18. Serum potassium outside normal limits and judged clinically significant by the
             investigator.

         19. Serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin exceeding 2X ULN for the lab's reference values.

         20. Evidence of impaired renal function based upon laboratory tests and investigator
             opinion.

         21. Clinical chemistry abnormalities judged clinically significant by the investigator.

         22. Donation of blood (one pint or greater) within four weeks prior to administration of
             study medication.

         23. Not suitable for entry into the study in the opinion of the investigator.
