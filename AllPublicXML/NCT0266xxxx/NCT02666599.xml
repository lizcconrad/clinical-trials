    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the sensibility of the probe Forimtech to detect β+
      emission in vivo in humans and its usefulness during elective surgical procedure
      Hypothesis:The probe Forimtech is able to allow per-surgery detection of tumoral lesions
      sensible to 18F-FDG and to help in the realization of guided biopsies, minimally invasive
      surgery or complement of resection of tumors.

      The β+ emission detected by the probe Forimtech is correlated to the emission γ detected by
      the 18F-FDG.PET/CT

      Patients with a malignant neoplasic lesion known or suspected for which a surgery is planned
      will be presented with the protocol. If inclusion/exclusion criteria are fulfilled all the
      procedures will be planned. A 18F-FDG PET/CT will be done. Surgery will be conducted within 3
      hours after the I.V. injection of 18F-FDG according to the standard procedure applied in the
      visceral surgery department. During the surgery, emission of β+ from the lesion (s) seen
      during the PET/CT will be detected with the probe.

      Resected pieces will be analysed histologically.
