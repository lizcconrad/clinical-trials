  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. Smoking
      cessation is difficult, with the average smoker attempting to quit five times before
      permanent success. Moreover, the majority of smoking quit attempts result in relapse. Brain
      stimulation for smoke cessation is an exciting new area that builds on advancing neuroscience
      knowledge concerning the functional neurocircuitry of addiction. Cortical stimulation can now
      be performed non-invasively by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Several studies have
      shown that TMS can reduce cue-elicited craving in smokers. Previous research by group has
      shown that a single session of 15 minutes high frequency (10 Hz) repetitive TMS (rTMS) at
      100% motor threshold over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can reduce
      cue-induced craving compared to sham TMS. However, the mechanism by which craving is reduced
      by rTMS is poorly understood both at behavioral and neural levels. Neuroimaging studies in
      nicotine dependence have revealed cue-related responses in numerous brain areas, including
      frontal, parietal cortices and subcortical areas. Recently functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) studies by the group have shown that cue-induced craving induced brain
      activation in ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), including medial frontal, orbital
      frontal and anterior cingulate. This Chair Research Development Fund (CRDF) pilot proposal
      will integrate two new techniques- TMS and fMRI to investigate DLPFC-VMPFC pathway in
      smokers. Using double-masked methods investigators hypothesize that cue-induced exposure will
      induce brain activity in VMPFC, and 15 minutes rTMS over DLPFC will reduce cue-induced
      craving through modulating DLPFC-VMPFC pathway (increased activity DLPFC and decreased
      activity VMPFC).

    <description>The sham TMS system will be connected to an electrical generator on a 9 V battery and electrodes will be placed over the prefrontal cortex. The regulator is triggered by the TMS machine to allow brief, microsecond, pulses of the electrical current through to the skin on the subjects' forehead. Electrical stimulation will be triggered by the TMS machine to correspond to the sham TMS pulses.</description>
