  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obese adolescents, energy expenditure (EE) of chronic high intensity muscular exercise (&gt;
      70% VO2max) conducted one hour before a meal causes an anorectic effect at lunch and dinner
      the same day. The effect on food intake of the distribution of this exercise into two
      sessions during 24h remains to be determined. In addition, a multidisciplinary load of
      obesity generates a loss of body weight in the short term, which we do not know the effects
      on energy balance. To our knowledge, the impact of weight loss on the anorectic effect of
      muscle exercise is unknown.

      Two measuring sequences will be carried out before (M0) and after 4 months (M4) of a
      multidisciplinary treatment program of four months. Each sequence will have three days: a
      &quot;sedentary&quot; day (SED) and two days &quot;exercise&quot; (EX). During the exercise day &quot;EX1&quot;, a
      continuous intense exercise will be conducted for 40 min at 70% VO2max of subjects. During
      the second day exercise &quot;EX2&quot; teenage realize two exercise representing the same DE as EX1 in
      the morning (50% ED) and late afternoon (50% ED). The multidisciplinary management program
      (without energy restriction) controlled by institution consists of nutrition education,
      physical activity and therapeutic education. The exercise program will involve the activity
      sessions controlled and supervised by a sports educator and interactive sessions using a
      scientifically validated physical activity program (BiomouvÂ®).
