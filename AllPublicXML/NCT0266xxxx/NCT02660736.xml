  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Albiglutide (Alb) is a novel analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been developed
      and approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Currently, lyophilized
      albiglutide and the diluent are provided in a dual chamber Cartridge (DCC) single-dose pen
      injector, requiring reconstitution prior to use. A liquid formulation of albiglutide will
      enable the use of a liquid product in a ready-to-use single dose auto-injector. To support
      the development of the liquid auto-injector product, this healthy volunteer bioequivalence
      study will be conducted to compare the liquid drug product to the currently available
      lyophilized product. This is Phase I, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, single-dose,
      2-period crossover study in healthy volunteers. This study will compare the pharmacokinetics
      and safety of the albiglutide 50 mg liquid drug product with the albiglutide 50 mg commercial
      lyophilized drug product.
