  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the performance of biologically assisted core decompression with the
      PerFuse instrument and BioCUE in patients with bone lesions in the femoral head. The study
      will explore the potential impact of patient demographics and baseline characteristics on
      post-operative outcomes.

      This study will evaluate the performance of biologically assisted core decompression with the
      PerFuse instrument and BioCUE in patients with bone lesions in the femoral head. The study
      will explore the potential impact of patient demographics and baseline characteristics on
      post-operative outcomes. The study will evaluate change in Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 12
      months after treatment. The change in AVN lesion size will also be measured at 12 months
      after index treatment via MRI. Change in quality of life and pain measures will be measured
      at each follow-up. Adverse events will also be recorded throughout the study.

      This study will follow patients for 5 years after initial treatment.

      Data will be recorded in a online database that will be entered by the site or patient,
      depending on the report form. This database includes data checks to compare entered data
      against predefined rules for range.

      A risk-based monitoring plan will be put in place for source data verification.
