    <textblock>
      Feasibility and Safety study of autologous dendritic cell immunotherapy (AGS-003-LNG) in
      patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer tumor will be
      resected from the patient. RNA from the tumor will be amplified and subsequently
      electroporated into matured, autologous dendritic cells. The dendritic cells with tumor RNA
      will be dosed back to the patient. Study will investigate feasibility and safety.
