      The aim of our study is to investigate the effects of six months treatment with alpha-lipoic
      acid on clinical, endocrine and metabolic features in women affected by PCOS. Menstrual
      pattern, anthropometric parameters, hirsutism score, ultrasound ovarian featureas, an oral
      glucose tolerance test and hormonal assays are evaluated before and after therapy.
