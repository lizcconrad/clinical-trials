  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test causal links between dimensions of positive and harsh
      parenting and children's brain responses to rewards and errors, using a parenting
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are among the most frequently diagnosed psychological disorders, with
      persistent patterns of impairment evident from childhood through adulthood. Impaired
      functioning of core brain systems that respond to reward and errors may increase risk for
      depression and anxiety. Importantly, these neural risk markers for depression and anxiety
      appear to be shaped, at least in part, by environmental input. Problematic parenting is a key
      environmental factor involved in the intergenerational transmission of depression and
      anxiety. Low positive parenting is associated with blunted brain responses to reward and
      harsh parenting is associated with heightened brain responses to errors. This study uses an
      evidence-based parenting program to test causal links between dimensions of positive and
      harsh parenting and children's brain responses to rewards and errors. Participants will
      include 80 6- to 7-year-old children and their mothers who will be randomly assigned to
      participate in a parenting program (Parent Child Interaction Therapy: PCIT) or to a waitlist
      control group, and brain responses to rewards and errors will be assessed pre- and
      post-intervention.

    <description>PCIT includes 12-16 sessions across two phases: the first focused on enhancing positive parenting during child-directed interactions, and the second focused on reducing harsh parenting during parent-directed interactions. Parents receive feedback and coaching on their interactions with the child during sessions.</description>
