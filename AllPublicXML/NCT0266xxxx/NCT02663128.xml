      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of a new tablet formulation of lanabecestat
      gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it, compared to the
      current tablet formulation of lanabecestat. The effect of a high fat meal on how quickly the
      body absorbs the new tablet formulation will also be evaluated. In addition any side effects
      of the study drug using both the new and current tablet formulations will be evaluated. The
      study will last about 22 days, with screening required within 30 days prior to the start of
      the study.
