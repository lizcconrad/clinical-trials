  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of a kinematic measurement device to quantify the abnormal
      head movements and postures in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) in order to individualize
      and optimize botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection therapy. A single sensor captures five
      degrees of freedom of the neck and head that distinguish which muscle(s) contribute to CD and
      the amount of BoNT-A to inject into these muscle(s). The efficacy, relief and improvements in
      social, occupation and function by injections will be investigated. The efficacy of BoNT-A
      therapy using either BoNT-A injection parameters from clinical-based assessments and
      kinematically-based assessments will be investigated in CD patients. Individuals clinically
      diagnosed with CD will be randomized for two treatment conditions: A) injection parameters
      from a kinematic assessment only, or B) injection parameters from a clinical assessment only.

    <description>Physiological changes as a result of BoNT-A injection treatment will be assessed by validated CD assessment scale, TWSTRS part A for severity and C for pain, will be administered at each time-point to determine efficacy of using BoNT-A parameters based on clinical versus kinematics.</description>

    <time_frame>30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with significant relief of severity by objective kinematic reductions in angular deviation and amplitude measures over treatment course. Physiological changes in static/natural neck and head posturing, dynamic/tremor/dystonic movements superimposed on natural head position, range of motion will be assessed kinematically at each time-point. Angular deviations are calculated by degree of freedom angular bias from calibrated neutral position. Amplitude measures will be reported as root mean square values.</description>

    <description>A serotype of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) that has specificity for cleavage of SYNAPTOSOMAL-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 25 (SNAP-25). BoNT-A's pharmacological action is to inhibit the release of acetylcholine from the neuromuscular junction. BoNT-A peripherally applied using optimal parameters by intramuscular injections solely determined either by visual/clinical or by biomechanical analysis of dystonic movements for cervical dystonia therapy in neck and shoulder muscles every 12 weeks over 30 weeks. BoNT-A dose will range from 50-300 U.</description>
