  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study with a &quot;crossover design&quot;, where fasting with a day of complete
      fasting and a fasting day with the permission intake of calories- and carbohydrate-free foods
      are compared in a randomized order. Underlying hypothesis is that at the same basal insulin
      substitution with the fasting of both protocols , no significant differences in the
      glucose-day or -night profiles revealed. So the same conclusions regarding the &quot;consistency&quot;
      of basal insulin dosing revealed during the implementation of the part of patients is rated
      as more pleasant when calories and carbohydrates-free food are allowed.

    <description>Complete fasting: On a fast day under this Protocol no solid food may be eaten unless it is solid, medically prescribed part of a bedtime snack just before falling asleep (which must sometimes be to prevent nocturnal hypoglycaemia with injection of basal insulin before going to sleep) , Otherwise, the patient have ad libitum access to mineral water and unsweetened tea (possibly a fluid intake restriction should be considered for other diseases).</description>

    <intervention_name>Fasting day</intervention_name>
    <description>A day of fasting started at 18.00 clock with a blood glucose test and is only started when on the same day no significant hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;55 mg / dl) occurred, and when at 18.00 clock the blood sugar in the defined target range (70-180 mg / dl) is. Carried out during the fasting day standardized blood samples for measurement of plasma glucose with an appropriate laboratory method at 18.00, 20:00, 22:00, 12:00, 2:00, 4:00, 6:45, 9:00, 12:00, 14:00 and again at 18.00 clock. Because the determination of plasma glucose in the laboratory will take some time, is always for guidance and also measured with a fast measurement method, in order to treat at high levels of blood sugar with additional insulin correction, and to treat hypoglycaemia low blood sugar or to prevent hypoglycaemia.</description>
