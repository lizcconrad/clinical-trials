  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The modern era of cardiac surgery began in early 1950s with the introduction of
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Although it has been clearly shown that CPB is almost
      unavoidable for most open heart operations, an undesirable systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome (SIRS) is associated with its use. This complex chain of events has strong
      similarities with sepsis and may contribute to the development of postoperative complications
      and multiple organ failure (MOF). It has been shown that an excessive compensatory
      anti-inflammatory response (CARS) after SIRS can lead to immune paralysis and increased rate
      of hospital acquired infection. The balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
      mediators determines the inflammatory response and the clinical outcome. Accordingly, great
      efforts have been focused on therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the inflammatory
      reactions during CPB, including pharmacologic strategies and modification of surgical
      techniques or mechanical devices. Such therapies may provide improvements in patient outcome
      after open heart operations. Among pharmacologic strategies is the prophylaxis with
      corticosteroids, which have been used during open heart surgery for more than 30 years. Many
      studies, both experimental and clinical, failed to produce evidence in favor of steroid
      treatment. As far as medical devices are concerned, the use of extracorporeal cytokine filter
      CytoSorb looks promising in cardiac surgery. It was recently approved by European Medicines
      Agency as an active treatment to fight cytokine storm.

      Serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a lipo-lactonase, being associated with HDL that has an
      anti-inflammatory role and protects against atherosclerosis. Low levels of PON1 are
      associated with venous graft occlusion in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting. PON1
      reduces monocyte chemotaxis and adhesion to endothelial cells, leading to inhibition of the
      differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. The effects of cytokine adsorption therapy on
      PON1 are unknown.

      The aim of the study is to explore the effects of extracorporeal immunoadsorption during CPB
      on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory protective mediators and cellular immune status in
      cardiac surgery.

      Patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery with CPB (eg: combined valve and coronary bypass
      grafting surgery, concomitant valve surgery, surgery of the ascending aorta and aortic arch,
      as well as re-operations of the same type) will be enrolled in the study after giving the
      signed informed consent. They will be randomized into 3 groups: 1. study (CytoSorb) group, 2.
      control group, and 3. corticosteroid group. Immune response [TNF-alfa (tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha), IL(interleukin)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, complement C5a, lymphocyte cellular
      markers (CD64, CD163), miRNA (micro RNA), PON1 activity, as well as lipid status, hs-CRP
      (high sensitivity C-reactive protein), PCT (procalcitonin) and acute phase proteins, will be
      determined before CPB, during CPB, immediately after, 24h, 48h and 5 days after CPB. We will
      document demographic characteristics of patients, their preoperative medical status, as well
      as intraoperative data (type and duration of surgery, duration of CPB, period of ischemia,
      hemodynamic parameters, usage of inotropic/vasoactive therapy, insulin, fluids, blood and
      blood components); duration of mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU), duration
      of ICU stay, 30-day mortality and morbidity, as well as postoperative complications
      (bleeding, hemodynamic instability, impaired respiratory function, infection, worsening of
      renal, liver and cognitive function).
