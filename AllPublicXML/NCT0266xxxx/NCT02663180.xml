  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious mental health disease. It is generally characterized by sadness, loss
      of interest in activities, and decreased energy. Globally, it is estimated that almost 350
      million people suffer from depression. In Saudi Arabia, literature suggested that prevalence
      of depression among boy's secondary school students in Abha city was 38.2%. Another study
      found that the prevalence of depression was 22.4 % as moderate, 7.3 % as severe and 3.7% as
      very severe, with a clear predominance prevalence of depression in girls as in boys (1.5
      times). It is important to assess depression literacy including knowledge and beliefs about
      mental disorders among adolescent. A high level of mental health literacy on depression leads
      to a better understanding and outcomes of depressive disorders. Schools are a typical venue
      in which to embed mental health literacy because the school students are more familiar with
      educational activities. Studies concluded that educational intervention about depression
      literacy and destigmatization improves knowledge and may decrease stigma. Further research,
      intervention and activism are needed in the field of mental health in Arab countries to
      improve awareness of mental health problems.

      Objectives: This study is aimed to measure the effect of educational intervention program
      about depression among secondary schools in Jazan city on depression literacy and stigma
      during the academic year 2015-2016.

      The intervention: the intervention will held at each selected intervention school separately.
      The program will be over 2 weeks intervention as the following:

        -  Educational strategies: 2 Lecture about depression 30 minutes supported by group
           discussion, brochures and display of posters with mental-health slogans on depression in
           the schools.

        -  Contact strategies: the investigators will show a video of a young male who had been
           diagnosed (i.e., not an actor) with depression.

      Benefits:

      * The intervention group will join educational intervention program they expected to benefit
      from the program through increase their depression literacy and improve depression stigma,
      and control group will not join any form of intervention.
