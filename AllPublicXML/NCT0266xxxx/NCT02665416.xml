  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, two-part study is designed to assess the safety, PK, PD, and therapeutic
      activity of RO7009789 in combination with vanucizumab or bevacizumab in participants with
      metastatic solid tumors not amenable to standard treatment. Part I (dose escalation) is
      designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RO7009789 in this combination. Part
      II (expansion) is intended to characterize the safety and tolerability of RO7009789 in
      combination with bevacizumab among indication-specific cohorts and to confirm the recommended
      dose.
