      Clinical hypotheses:

      The increasing number of people aging with HIV is a matter of fact. Differences in prevalence
      of comorbidities between the general population and HIV-positive patients are mainly driven
      by duration of HIV infection rather than chronological age of HIV+ patients.

      People aging with HIV display heterogeneous health conditions. Host factors and duration of
      HIV infection are associated with increased risk of MM, independently from chronological age
      and these factors are responsible of the prevalence difference of comorbidities and MM in
      comparison to the general population.

      Objectives:

      The study objective is to assess the prevalence of, and risk factors for, individual
      co-morbidities and multi morbidity (MM) between HIV-positive patients with similar duration
      of HIV infection, but 30 years difference. We compared estimates across both groups to a
      matched community-based cohort sampled from the general population.

      This study is a case-control study, including antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced
      patients, coming from the two following cohorts:

        -  Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic (MHMC) cohort and

        -  Romanian HIV cohort (RHC). For this study only patients living with HIV ≥ 20 years will
           belong to these two cohort. The Aging-Young patients acquired HIV infection in
           childhood, and Aging-old patients acquired HIV infection above the age of 30.

      Aging-Young patients will be matched to Aging-Old patients considering gender and HIV
      duration (within 1 year interval) (This is the most important matching criteria. The exact
      number of year of HIV duration since HIV test is the major criteria). An HIV negative test
      within 5 years prior HIV diagnosis is required in the selection of patients from MHMC to
      avoid an unpredicted HIV time exposure in these patients.

      Then, Aging-young and Aging-old patients will be age, gender matched with a 1: 3 ratio with
      CINECA (Consorzio Interuniversitario di Calcolo) &quot;ARNO&quot; records (control group, called
      &quot;HIV-negative group&quot;). The study will analyse 200 HIV Aging-Young and 200 HIV Aging-Old
      patients in comparison to 1200 controls.

      In the first set of analyses, the prevalence of non-infectious comorbidities (NICM) and
      multimorbidities (MM) in HIV Aging-Young and in HIV Aging-Old groups will be compared to
      those of HIV-negative group using multivariable logistic regression models. In the second set
      of analyses, the probability of MM in the HIV Aging-Young cohort will be compared to the HIV
      Aging-Old one, using multivariable logistic regression models.
