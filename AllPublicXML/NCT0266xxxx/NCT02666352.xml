    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, non-randomized, open-label, single-dose study to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of uprifosbuvir (MK-3682), its metabolites M5 and M6, and ruzasvir
      (MK-8408) in participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency (HI) (Part 1) and in
      participants with severe HI (Part 2) compared to those in matched healthy particpants.

             the previous 2 months due to deterioration in hepatic function) HI features of
             cirrhosis;

          -  Part 1 only: Participant's score on the Child-Pugh scale ranges from 7 to 9 (moderate
             HI) at study start.

          -  Part 2 only: Participant's score on the Child-Pugh scale ranges from 10 to 15 (severe
             HI) at study start.
