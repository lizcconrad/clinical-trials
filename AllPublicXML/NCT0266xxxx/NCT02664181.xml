  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether treatment with the study drug
      tetrahydrouridine-decitabine (THU-Dec) in combination with nivolumab is more effective than
      treatment with nivolumab alone in patients with NSCLC.

      Decitabine is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by depleting DNA
      methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). DNMT1 is an enzyme, or protein that causes chemical changes,
      often increased in cancer. Blocking DNMT1 has been shown to reduce tumor formation.
      Decitabine is experimental in this study because it is not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for patients with lung cancer. Decitabine is approved by the FDA for
      treating patients with a blood disease called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, a condition
      where the bone marrow does not make blood cells normally).

      THU is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by blocking an enzyme that breaks
      down decitabine. This enzyme is highly expressed in solid tissues of the body, limiting the
      distribution of decitabine into these tissues, including solid cancer tissues. So, THU will
      increase the time cells are exposed to decitabine. The idea is that THU will also increase
      the time that the lung cancer cells are exposed to decitabine. THU is experimental because it
      is also not approved by the FDA, although it has been extensively used in clinical trials,
      including several cancer trials.

      Primary objective: To determine if non-cytotoxic oral THU-Dec when combined with nivolumab
      can improve objective response rates of nivolumab

      Secondary objectives:

      i) To evaluate clinical efficacy end points and toxicity of oral THU-Dec when combined with
      nivolumab ii) evaluate the induction of a T-cell response in patients with metastatic NSCLC
      iii) To evaluate hypotheses regarding mechanisms of resistance and predictive biomarkers for
      response to nivolumab

      Study design: This is a Phase 2 randomized two arm trial of nivolumab alone or in combination
      with THU-Dec, in previously treated patients with stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC). The primary goal of this trial is to compare the efficacy of oral THU-Dec as a way
      of enhancing the anti-tumor immune response to nivolumab to that of nivolumab alone. The
      primary efficacy endpoint is overall RECIST-defined response. To accomplish this goal 60
      patients will be randomized 2:1 to THU-Dec plus nivolumab or nivolumab only respectively.

    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of all randomized subjects whose best overall response (BOR) from baseline is either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. BOR is determined by the best response designation recorded between the date of randomization and the date of objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. For subjects without documented progression or subsequent anticancer therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the BOR determination. For subjects who continue treatment beyond progression, the BOR should be determined based on response designations recorded at the time of the initial RECIST 1.1 defined progression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks after beginning treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival: It is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause. Subjects who die without a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the date they were randomized. Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Progression will be assessed every 6 weeks (from the first on-study radiographic assessment) until disease progression is noted.</description>

             myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, severe peripheral vascular disease
             (claudication) or procedure on peripheral vasculature, coronary/peripheral artery

             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding (pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this
             study because oral THU-Dec has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with oral THU-Dec, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with oral THU-Dec.

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events

             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously
             administered agent; Patients who receive palliative radiation therapy within 1 week

             arthritis with no evidence of disease flare off immunosuppression for &gt;1year may be
             allowed after discussion with the study PI. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
