  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate uHear™, an iOS-based tool, as a screening tool to detect
      significant hearing impairment as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment in patients
      aged 70 years and older. The pass or fail screening cut-off is defined as having two or more
      consecutive hearing grades starting from the moderate-severe threshold zone ranging from 0.5
      - 2.0 kHz.
