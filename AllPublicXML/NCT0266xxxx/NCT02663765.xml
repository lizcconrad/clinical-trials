  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antenatal care is a key strategy for reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality
      rate because adequate utilization of antenatal health care services is associated with
      improved maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The trend of maternal mortality in developing
      countries has been increasing and various international organizations have reported that an
      important factor related to maternal and infant mortality has been linked to lack of
      antenatal care. According to Federal Ministry of Health, some of the dangers of pregnancy and
      childbirth can be avoided if the pregnant woman attends antenatal regularly. In order to
      decrease these mortality rates, regular antenatal care has to be instituted or reinforced
      which can only be achieved through identifying factors causing poor utilization of antenatal
      care services
