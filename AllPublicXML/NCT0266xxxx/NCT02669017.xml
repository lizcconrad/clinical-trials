    <textblock>
      This study evaluates ADCT-402 in patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lineage Non
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL). Patients will participate in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and
      dose expansion (Part 2). In Part 2, patients will receive the dose level identified in Part
      1.

      Study ADCT-402-101 is the first clinical study with ADCT-402 in patients with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).

      ADCT-402 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody directed
      against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a
      valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) patients will receive an
      infusion of ADCT-402, at escalating doses. Part 1 will continue until the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined. In Part 2 (expansion), patients will be assigned to the recommended dose
      level(s) and schedule(s) of ADCT-402 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering
      Committee.

      For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment
      period (until withdrawal), and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival
      for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be
      dependent on overall patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It is
      anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3
      years from first patient treated to last patient completed.
