    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the use of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) as a
      method of detecting early signs of damage to the heart that can be associated with adjuvant
      therapy of anthracycline (doxorubicin)-based combination chemotherapy followed by treatment
      with herceptin (trastuzumab for the treatment of (HER+) breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      HER 2 breast cancer that has been shown to respond well to adjuvant therapy of doxorubicin
      followed by trastuzumab. One of the side effects observed in women receiving this treatment
      is heart complications in which the heart muscle is weakened and no longer able to pump
      sufficient amounts of blood throughout the body. This complication can lead to the following
      symptoms: shortness of breath on exertion, swollen ankles and feet, lack of energy and a
      reduced capacity to carry out day-to-day activities.

      This research study is focused on identifying the early signs of such heart complications
      using CMR, which may allow preventative treatment options to be made available in future.
