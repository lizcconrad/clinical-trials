  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injection of platelet-rich plasma derived
      from patient's blood is effective in treatment of shoulder subacromial impingement syndrome
      as compared to the current protocol of methylprednisolone injection.

    <textblock>
      Patients presenting with shoulder pain to the study location will be screened by the
      principal investigator. Once diagnosed clinically with shoulder subacromial impingement
      syndrome, they will be invited to join the study. They will be invited to separate academic
      office to be explained about the study, its voluntary and confidential basis as per our
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols.

      After signing informed consent form and recruitment, they will be assigned randomly to one of
      the study arms through software-generated sequential allocation packaged in an opaque
      envelope. All involved except the principal investigator and patient are blinded.

      There are two groups/arms in the study. The experimental arm will include subacromial
      injection of study subjects with autologous platelet-rich plasma; wheres subjects in the
      other study arm will be injected with methylprednisolone.

      The outcome will be assessed through three scores. The study subjects will be asked to
      complete Oxford Shoulder Score questionnaire and health-related quality of life SF-36
      questionnaire and Constant-Murley score will be measured through physician-based assessment
      done by the residents involved in the study. This will be done during the baseline visit
      before injection and repeated at 2, 6, 12 weeks and 6 months follow-up visits.

      Also any adverse effects of both treatment arms will be monitored and reported as
      appropriate.

      The investigators hypothesize that injecting platelet-rich plasma into the subacromial space
      of patients with subacromial impingement will result in decreased pain and increased function
      at 6 months follow-up (assessed by Constant-Murley Score, Oxford Shoulder Score, and Short
      Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire) as compared to patients injected with methylprednisolone.
