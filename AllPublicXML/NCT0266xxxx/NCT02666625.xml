    <textblock>
      The constitution of a biological samples bank, attached to epidemiological studies Cohort
      F-CCSS on iatrogenic effects of treatment of childhood cancer, will identify genetic variants
      that can modulate the iatrogenic risks of these treatments. The main objective is to provide
      a biological samples bank to consider, besides the carcinogenic risks, the risk of other
      iatrogenic diseases in these children, in particular cardiac, cerebrovascular, lung, bone and
      kidney. These conditions can be very incapacitating and in some cases, fatal. Their impact,
      however, is poorly estimated as occurring in adulthood, they are rarely made in relation to
      the treatment received in childhood. The overall project is expected to eventually better
      define the iatrogenic effects prevention strategies for cancer treatment.
