  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : Chronic histiocytic intervillositis is a rare placental disease linked with poor
      perinatal outcome. In a recent study, a major antenatal increased alkaline phosphatase was
      suspected in patients affected by chronic histiocytic intervillositis. This increase may
      correspond to the release of alkaline phosphatase by the syncytiotrophoblaste prejudiced in
      this pathology.

      Aim : To confirm the association between high levels of alkaline phosphatase and the
      occurrence of chronic histiocytic intervillositis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-center study of case-control comparing three groups of patients matched for
      gestational age at the time of sampling. The case group will be composed of patients who
      experienced chronic histiocytic intervillositis which an alkaline phosphatase assay is
      available during pregnancy (retrospective recruitment). Two control groups will be
      prospectively: The first will include patients whose pregnancy is low risk. The second will
      consist of pathological pregnancies (IUGR, Preeclampsia and Death In Utero). All patients
      will have a blood sample with determination of serum alkaline phosphatase activity and
      examination of the placenta at delivery.
