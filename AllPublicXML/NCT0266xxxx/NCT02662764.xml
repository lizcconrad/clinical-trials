      Approximately 315 adult postoperative in-patients who are expected to require opioid
      analgesia for at least 24 hours, and up to 72 hours, after surgery will be enrolled. Patients
      will use the Zalviso™ (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) 15 mcg in order to
      self-administer a tablet of study drug as needed for pain. The System will be evaluated for
      usability and functionality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients who are 18 years of age or older.

          2. Patients who are scheduled to undergo surgery under general or spinal anesthesia that
             does not include intrathecal opioids during the operation.

          3. Patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I - III
             (Appendix I).

          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must be using an effective method of birth
             control at the time of screening visit and for 30 days following the end of the study
             period. Acceptable methods of birth control include oral or transdermal
             contraceptives, condom, spermicidal foam, intrauterine device (IUD), progestin implant
             or injection, abstinence, vaginal ring, or sterilization of partner. The reason for
             non-child bearing potential, such as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy,
             hysterectomy, or postmenopausal for &gt; 1 year, must be specified. Patients using
             hormonal forms of contraception must also be willing to use a barrier method of
             contraception from screening through 30 days following the study period.

          5. Post-surgical patients who have been admitted to the PACU, and are expected to have
             acute pain requiring opioids for 24 - 72 hours after surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have taken an opioid for more than 30 consecutive days, at a daily dose
             of 15 mg or more of morphine (or equivalent), within the past 3 months prior to
             surgery (e.g. more than 3 doses per day of Vicodin®, Norco®, Lortab® with 5 mg
             hydrocodone per tablet).

          2. Patients who are currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or have taken
             MAOIs within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.

          3. Patients with current sleep apnea that has been documented by a sleep laboratory study
             or are on home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

          4. Patients with an allergy or hypersensitivity to opioids.

          5. Patients who are currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or have taken
             MAOIs within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.

          6. Patients with current sleep apnea that has been documented by a sleep laboratory study
             or are on home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

          7. Patients who are receiving oxygen therapy at the time of screening.
