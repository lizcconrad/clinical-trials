      The investigators investigated the feasibility of the clinical application of
      novice-practitioner-performed/offsite-mentor-guided ultrasonography for identifying the
      appendix.

    <textblock>
      A randomized cross-over study was conducted using a telesonography system that can transmit
      the ultrasound images displayed on the ultrasound monitor(ultrasound sequence video) and
      images showing the practitioner's operations(background video) to a smartphone without any
      interruption in motion over a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. Thirty novice practitioners
      were randomly assigned to two groups. The subjects in group A (n=15) performed
      ultrasonography for the identification of the appendix under mentoring by an onsite expert,
      whereas those in group B (n=15) performed the same procedure under mentoring by an offsite
      expert.

      Each subject performed the procedure on three simulated patients. After a four-week interval,
      they performed the procedure again under the other type of mentoring. A total of 90
      ultrasound examinations were performed in each scenario. The primary outcomes were the
      success rate for identifying the appendix and the time required to identify the appendix.

    <description>The 30 participating examiners were randomly divided into two groups. In phase one, group A performed ultrasonography under onsite mentoring and group B performed the same procedure under remote mentoring. Each examiner was randomly assigned one expert and three SPs for phase one. Four weeks later, they were partnered with the same expert and SPs to whom they had been assigned in phase one and performed the procedure under the other type of mentoring (phase two). The examination order of the SPs was randomly assigned by choosing a number between one and six (1: A-B-C, 2: A-C-B, 3: B-A-C, 4: B-C-A, 5: C-A-B, 6: C-B-A) in each phase.</description>
