  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical trial with 40 patients randomized in 1:1
      ratio to either treatment (bilateral in-office placement of Propel following ESS) or control
      (post ESS standard of care) group and followed for 6 months

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial aims to assess the efficacy of
      a drug-eluting sinus implant placement following ethmoidectomy in addition to post-op
      standard of care (i.e. debridement, irrigation, and topical steroids) compared to the same
      standard care alone (control). A total of 40 patients will be enrolled at one site and
      randomized in 1:1 ratio to either the treatment or control group. Patients will return for
      follow-up examination at 2 weeks and again at 1, 3 and 6 months after placement. Follow-up
      examination will consist of patient-reported outcomes and endoscopic grading by clinical
      investigators and an independent blinded reviewer based on video-endoscopy review.
