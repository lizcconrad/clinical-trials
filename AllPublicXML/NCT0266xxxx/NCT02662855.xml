  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic efficacy of Favipiravir, a
      broad-spectrum antiviral drug against severe cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), which is the
      most difficult aspect for clinical management of EVD due to its high fatality rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, controlled phase 2 trial of Favipiravir among severe cases
      (cases with hemorrhage, severe dehydration, consciousness disorders, shock, and high blood
      viral load with Ct value below 20) of confirmed EVD patients in the capital area of Sierra
      Leone. Patients with 13 years of age or older would be assigned in an 1:1 randomised manner
      to receive WHO-recommended therapy (mainly symptomatic and supportive therapies, control
      group. WHO, World Health Organization.) or oral Favipiravir (1600 mg twice on the first day,
      followed by a twice-daily dose of 600 mg until negative blood viral load detection or death)
      plus WHO-recommended therapy (treatment group). The primary efficacy end point was case
      fatality rate.The secondary efficacy endpoint is blood (plasma)viral load. Optimal inclusion
      number is 240 cases (120 for each group), but considering the actual situation of pandemic
      area, the front line doctors have the right to reset the inclusion number, and modify the
      study protocol according to the actual situation in the front.

    <description>WHO-recommended therapies, mainly symptomatic and supportive treatments. Briefly: body fluid management (intravenous or oral, depending on patient status), balanced nutrition (including glucose, electrolytes, vitamin, et al.), preventing intravascular volume depletion, correcting profound electrolyte abnormalities, avoiding the complications of shock, defervesce, anti-diarrheal, acesodyne, anti-anxiety. For patients with positive Plasmodium detection or bacterial infection, apply artemether-lumefantrine or antibiotics respectively. Details refer to 'Manual for the care and management of patients in Ebola Care Units/Community Care Centres, Interim emergency guidance' and 'Clinical Management of Patients with Viral Haemorrhagic Fever: A Pocket Guide for the Front-line Health Worker' by WHO.</description>
