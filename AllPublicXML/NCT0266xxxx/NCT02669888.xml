      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that most commonly occurs in
      children. The aims of this project are:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of indigo naturalis ointment in treating AD topically;

        2. To evaluate the safety of indigo naturalis ointment in treating AD topically;

        3. To investigate whether indigo naturalis ointment treatment is associated with a change
           in total IgE, cytokines, eosinophils, and CRP in patients with AD;

        4. To evaluate whether indigo naturalis ointment treatment improves the quality of life in
           patients with AD.

      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that most commonly occurs in
      children. AD is characterized by itchy and dry skin that affects approximately 5 to 20% of
      children in the world. Currently, corticosteroids are the most widely prescribed medication
      in treating AD; however, there are concerns regarding the side effects such as skin atrophy,
      telangiectasia, striae, folliculitis and adrenocortical suppression that inhibits growth in
      children. Many patients and families seek complementary and alternative medications such as
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In TCM, indigo naturalis has been used to treat various
      infectious and inflammatory skin diseases for hundreds of years. Ancient TCM literature has
      recorded that indigo naturalis is also effective in treating facial eczema (AD) in infants.

      The aims of this project are: (1) To evaluate the efficacy of indigo naturalis ointment in
      treating AD topically; (2) To evaluate the safety of indigo naturalis ointment in treating AD
      topically; (3) To investigate whether indigo naturalis ointment treatment is associated with
      a change in total IgE, cytokines, eosinophils, and CRP in patients with AD; (4) To evaluate
      whether indigo naturalis ointment treatment improves the quality of life in patients with AD.

    <measure>Percentage change in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) scores from baseline to week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is used to measure the disease severity of erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification each on a scale of 0 to 3 (none to severe) as well as the percentage of disease area on a scale of 0 to 6 for the head ⁄ neck, upper limb, trunk and lower limb body regions. Each body region score is calculated by multiplying the disease severity score by the disease area score and by the multiplier. The scores are summed to give the total EASI score, ranging from 0 to a maximum 72.
The mean percentage change in EASI = (EASI baseline-EASI post-treat) / EASI baseline x 100%</description>
