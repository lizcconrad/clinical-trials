  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The question that this project seeks to answer, is whether mobile phones can be used to
      increase the measles vaccination coverage and timeliness in Guinea-Bissau. The intervention
      will be evaluated in terms of direct health outcomes and cost/benefit analysis, generating
      evidence that could help policy makers making informed decisions about implementing mHealth
      interventions at a national level.

      The intervention takes the form of a randomized controlled trial in which text messages (SMS)
      as well as voice calls are scheduled and delivered to mo thers to remind and encourage them
      to have their children timely vaccinated against measles. In addition, the messages will
      include relevant information about opening hours and availability of the measles vaccine at
      the mothers' local health facilities thus improving coordination. The trial will include
      three different randomization groups with approx. 350 participants in each group. The first
      group will receive SMS messages, the second group will receive a voice call in addition to
      the SMS messages, and the third group is a control group that does not receive any
      intervention.

      Study participants will be enrolled following birth at one of three health centers in
      different rural regions of Guinea-Bissau. Before the measles vaccine is scheduled to be
      given, at 9 months of age, mothers will receive the intervention message depending on their
      assigned randomization group. When the measles vaccine is administered, the child will be
      registered as having received the measles vaccination.

      A follow-up phone interview will be conducted at 12 months of age for all children
      participating regardless of randomization group and whether or not they received the measles
      vaccine. All participating children, who at that time still have not received the measles
      vaccine, will be offered the vaccine at the expense of the project.
