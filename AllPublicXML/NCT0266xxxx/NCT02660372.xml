        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects of the age of 18 years or older with a suspected diagnosis of functional
             dyspepsia according to Rome III criteria (see Appendix A) e.g. subjects suffering from
             bothersome postprandial fullness or early satiation or epigastric pain or epigastric
             burning AND no evidence of structural disease (including upper GI endoscopy) that is
             likely to explain the symptoms. Criteria fulfilled for the last 3 months. Symptom
             onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis.

          2. Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5-30.

          3. Absence of significant structural/organic abnormalities on abdominal ultrasound and
             upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed within the last 3 months prior to baseline
             to exclude a structural cause for the symptoms.

          4. Negative Helicobacter Pylori urea breath test.

          5. Presence of at least three out of the assessed ten symptoms judged to be at least of
             moderate or severe intensity, assessed after withdrawal of any medication potentially
             affecting the gastrointestinal tract and at least 7 days wash-out period.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             baseline visit.

          7. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female agree to the contraceptive requirements
             (including female partner's use of a highly effective form of birth control for at
             least 3 months before the study, during the study and for 3 months after the last dose
             of study drug) as outlined in Section 10.7.4.

          8. Able to read and understand the local language;

          9. Provide a signed and dated informed consent form prior to any study-related

             (see Appendix A).

          2. a) severe gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (typical symptoms - heartburn,
             regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia, and/or signs of reflux at upper GI endoscopy)
             at Screening visit.

             b) predominant gastroesophageal reflux symptoms defined as a Subject's Symptom
             Severity Score of 2 or more for heartburn and regurgitation at Baseline visit after
             the 7-days wash-out period (see questionnaire in Appendix B).

          3. Significant medical condition which may interfere with a subject's participation in
             the study, e.g. diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, renal insufficiency,
             congestive heart failure, electrolyte disturbances or autoimmune diseases requiring
             immunosuppressive treatment.

          4. Known hepatic, biliary or pancreatic disease.

          5. Known lactose or gluten intolerance or celiac disease.

             throughout the study period, including the following drugs:

               -  gastrointestinal medications including antispasmodics, prokinetics, proton pump
                  inhibitors, H2 blockers, antacids, alginate, bismuth preparations, sucralfate,
                  misoprostol, charcoal, diosmectite, enzymes (e.g. Kreon®, Mezim®).

               -  other medications that could interfere with gastrointestinal function e.g.
                  antibiotics (except for local application), theophylline, NSAIDs (except for
                  low-dose aspirin for prevention of heart disease), opioid analgesics, codeine,
                  ulcerogenic substances (e.g. oral glucocorticoids), anxiolytics, neuroleptics,
                  antidepressants, and/or others in the judgment of the investigator.

             coordinators, other site personnel, employees of Johnson &amp; Johnson LLC or McNeil AB
             subsidiaries, contractors of Johnson &amp; Johnson LLC or McNeil AB, and the families of
             each).

         15. Other severe, acute or chronic, medical or psychiatric condition(s) or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
