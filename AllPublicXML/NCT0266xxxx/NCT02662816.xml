  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glutathione (glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) is the main intracellular compound. It participates
      also in the detoxification of electrophiles molecules of which paracetamol. It is synthesized
      in the liver during the postprandial phase, which establishes a stock that is mobilized for
      the other tissues (muscle)during the postabsorptive period. It is of common knowledge that
      the decrease in glutathione concentrations associated with ageing could be involved in the
      development of the degenerative pathologies linked to the old age. These changes could be
      reversed by an increase in dietary cysteine, the amino acid limiting of the endogenous
      synthesis of GSH. The development of nutritional strategies aiming at an improvement of the
      status glutathione requires the determination of its concentration within tissues, where it
      is active. The quantification of tissue concentrations of glutathione by biochemical
      techniques requires tissue biopsies. Such a method can be performed for the muscle, but liver
      biopsy is not feasible outside of a surgery. It is necessary to set up a non-invasive method
      to quantify muscle and liver glutathione.

      The study will validate the detection and the quantification of glutathione in muscle and
      liver using 1H MRS. The accuracy of the method will be assessed from intra and
      inter-volunteer measurements. 1H MRS measurements will be performed with the Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3 Tesla system of the Hospital, twice for each volunteer.

      Prior to the measurements, volunteers will have a protein rich breakfast at home and a
      protein rich lunch at the Clinical Investigation Center.
