    <textblock>
      This was an observational pilot study to examine the usefulness of an electronic sensor that
      monitors short-acting beta-agonist inhaled medication use. The goals of this study were to:
      1) test the feasibility of using the inhaler sensor to measure worsening symptoms and
      exacerbations, 2) characterize physical activity in patients with COPD, and 3) examine
      whether environmental factors can be linked to mild exacerbations measured by the inhaler
      sensor.

      Objectives: This study tested the usefulness of a GPS-enabled inhaler to study the
      associations between air pollution, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      exacerbations, and physical activity. Specific aims are 1) test the feasibility of using the
      inhaler sensor to measure worsening symptoms and exacerbations, 2) characterize physical
      activity in patients with COPD, and 3) examine whether environmental factors can be linked to
      mild exacerbations measured by the inhaler sensor.

      Research Design: A 12-week observational, longitudinal pilot study of patients with COPD.

      Methodology: Participants recruited at VA Puget Sound performed spirometry and completed
      baseline questionnaires. An inhaler sensor was placed on their albuterol inhaler to record
      the time and location of inhaler actuation throughout the three month follow-up. Each month
      participants answered questions regarding their breathing symptoms and physical activity.
      Physical activity was measured by self-report using a weeklong Physical Activity Checklist. A
      pedometer was worn at three 7 day periods. Public use air pollution and meteorological data
      will be linked to the inhaler data. We will compute descriptive statistics for all measures,
      including sociodemographics, exacerbation rates, inhaler use, air pollution exposures and
      physical activity levels. In addition, a time series analysis will be used to test if the
      frequency of inhaler use is associated with higher levels of daily air pollution.
