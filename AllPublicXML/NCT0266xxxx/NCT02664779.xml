      Background: Arrhythmia recognition is a fundamental skill for the provider of advanced life
      support (ALS). Acquire it is difficult, leading to the birth of systematic methods in an
      attempt to simplify and optimize, however, it has not compared the effectiveness among the
      three methods with more evidence among professionals with varying degrees of medical training
      (ALS Workshop participants).

      Objective: To determine and compare the effectiveness of the three most widespread and with
      more evidence systematic methods (10, 6 and 4 steps) for the recognition of arrhythmias in a
      short-term and its perceived easiness among ALS workshop participants.

      Methods / design: Educational Cuasi experimental trial with pre and post intervention
      measurement, blind, with randomized allocation, in 84 ALS workshop participants. Three
      systematic methods to recognize arrhythmias will be taught and their effectiveness to
      diagnose in a short-term and its perceived easiness will be measured and compared.

    <description>For comparison of the percentage of subjects who achieve scores greater than or equal to 30 (approving minimum score) in the practical test of arrhythmia`s diagnosis, the test will be the Chi-square (X2), which allows to compare proportions in more than two groups; or Fisher's exact test, submitted that one of the expected values is less than 5.</description>

    <measure>change in the average scores in the groups</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes after delivered the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>In order to compare the magnitude of the change in the average scores in the groups trained with each of the 3 methods, both in the the theoretical and practical test of diagnosis of arrhythmias; ANOVA or Mann-Whitney`s U, according to the distribution of variables was performed. These comparisons are made to the post intervention measurements and Bonferroni correction for alpha according to the number of comparisons will perform. The analysis of the collected data will be using STATA 10.0 software.</description>

    <description>Of participants whom attending the workshop, we will take 84 whom agree to participate and sign the informed consent. They will be divided into subgroups according to their degree of medical training (nursing technicians, university nursing students, university medical students, nurse practitioners graduates, Professional medical graduates, residents of medical specialties and specialists) and randomly assigned one by one from each educational subgroup to 3 intervention groups A, B or C (A = 10 STEPS method, B = 6 STEPS method, C = 4 STEPS method ) so that each group has the third participants of each level of education ensuring matched groups on the level of training of participants in each group. Following this, an equal theoretical test will be performed for all groups to determine the knowledge base in arrhythmias.</description>
