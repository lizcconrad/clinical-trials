  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China. Most patients are unresectable
      or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic therapy was required for the
      patients with advanced stage. Platinum combined with fluoropyrimidines always were considered
      as first line treatment. After failure of initial therapy, single agent of taxanes was used
      as second line treatment. However, there is no relative standard chemotherapeutic regimen in
      the third therapy except oral anti-angiogenesis drug-Apatinib. So this study was designed to
      explore the role of single agent with irinotecan as third line treatment in patients with
      metastatic gastric cancer in China.
