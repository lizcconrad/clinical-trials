    <textblock>
      Hydrocephalus is a disturbance of cerebrospinal fluid production, flow and absorption leading
      to intracranial hypertension. Assessment of the change in intracranial pressure after
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery is important in guiding appropriate postoperative
      management. The optic nerve sheath diameter measured using ultrasonography has been verified
      as a non-invasive indicator of intracranial hypertension in various clinical studies. The
      investigators hypothesized that a change in optic nerve sheath diameter detected through
      ultrasonography could help ascertain a reduction in intracranial pressure following
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery in adult patients without the risk of serious
      complications.

    <description>A thick layer of gel is applied on the upper closed eyelid. The linear 7.5-MHz ultrasound probe is then placed in the gel, without exerting pressure on the eye. Three measurements are taken for each optic nerve in the transverse plane, with the probe being horizontal. The final ONSD is the mean of these measurements.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (20-90 years of age, ASA physical status 3 or less) who are scheduled
             for elective ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery with non-communicating hydrocephalus
             and communicating hydrocephalus except for normal-pressure hydrocephalus

          -  Non-communicating hydrocephalus is defined as a pattern of ventricular system or at
             the level of the fourth ventricle's outlets by lesions including tumor, giant
             aneurysm, or aqueductal stenosis.

          -  Communicating hydrocephalus is defined as paraventricular enlargement resulting from
             postoperative complication after cranial surgery, meningitis, subarachnoid or
             intracerebral hemorrhage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with previous history of shunt operation, ocular disease and ocular surgery

          -  Patients with anatomical or functional abnormality of optic nerve

          -  emergency patient
