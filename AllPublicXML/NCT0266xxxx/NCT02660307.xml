      This protocol proposes a well-being program based in stress reduction program for employees
      of a company.

      objectives: To evaluate the effects of a stress reduction program with a specific orientation
      for workers and taught to them within their companies.

      Methods: Participants with stress complaints were recruited and randomized into two groups:
      group 1 (G1) received the intervention while group 2 (G2) did not. Both groups were evaluated
      before the intervention (time 1 - T1); again after the eight weeks of the program for G1
      (time 2 - T2); and then at the end of a second eight-week period during which G2 received the
      intervention and G1 was simply instructed to maintain the practice they had learned without
      further instruction (time 3- T3).

      Disorders resulting from chronic stress are some of the main causes of absenteeism and
      reduced productivity in companies. A number of successful stress management programs are
      based on the principle of mindfulness and may help individuals to relieve stress symptoms and
      to improve well-being and pro-social behavior. The objective of this study was to evaluate
      the feasibility and efficacy of a weekly one-hour stress reduction program adapted for
      companies and if the possible benefits would be sustained 8 weeks after the end of the
      program. Participants with stress complaints were recruited in two companies and they were
      randomized into two groups: in the first period of the study, group 1 (G1) N=23 received the
      intervention while group 2 (G2) N=18 did not. Both groups were evaluated before the
      intervention (time 1 - T1); again after the eight weeks of the program for G1 (time 2 - T2);
      and then at the end of a second eight-week period during which G2 received the intervention
      and G1 was simply instructed to maintain the practice they had learned without further
      instruction (time 3- T3).
