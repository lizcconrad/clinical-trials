    <textblock>
      A Retrospective-Prospective Study of REDAPT Revision Femoral System Modular Stem is a
      post-market, retrospective-prospective, multi-center, single arm, consecutive series study
      design to provide data on the post market performance and safety of the study device. The
      study will collect retrospective data from medical records review and prospective data from
      observations data at 5 and 10 postoperatively clinical visits. There will also be a 7 year
      telephone follow up contact to assess for device status and adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the REDAPT™ Revision Femoral System
      modular stem cumulative revision rate at 5 years.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to provide 10 years of safety and performance data on
      the REDAPT™ Revision Femoral System modular stem in terms of radiographic and clinical
      outcomes.

      At least 132 subjects are expected to be enrolled in the study at up to 10 clinical study
      sites around the world.

      A Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be completed at years 5 and 10.
