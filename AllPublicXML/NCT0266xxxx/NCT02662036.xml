  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of analgesia provided by liposomal bupivacaine
      (Exparel) when compared to bupivacaine HCL as a transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block in
      terms of discharge milestones, opioid use, costs, and patient-reported satisfaction at 12,
      24, and 72 hours. The investigators propose that Exparel will lower opioid use, length of
      stay, and overall cost of abdominally-based autologous breast reconstruction, and will lead
      to greater patient satisfaction.
