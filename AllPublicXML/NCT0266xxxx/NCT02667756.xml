      This observational study seeks to identify and validate novel soluble biomarkers (within
      blood, synovial fluid, urine) which contribute to the prognostic assessment of an individual
      with an acute knee injury, a group of individuals in which ~50% will progress to symptomatic
      radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA).

      150 individuals will be followed over 5 years with clinical assessment including validated
      questionnaires, biological sampling and radiological imaging (X ray, magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI)).

        This is a non-intervention cohort study of subjects who have recently sustained a
        structural knee injury. Individuals are identified from the practice of a collaborating
        surgeon (AW) at a number of London sites, several of which are within private practice.
        Because of the practice of the surgeon investigator, a large number will be sporting
        professionals, or playing amateur sport at a high level.
