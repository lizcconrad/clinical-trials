      &quot;Moma&quot; call center is a result of collaboration between Maccabi Health Services and The
      Gertner Institute of Epidemiology and Health Policy Research. The call center provides remote
      continuous monitoring and support for patients with chronic illnesses, and has been found
      useful for improvement in treatment adherence and other clinical measures in patients with
      diabetes and CHF.

      The current project focuses on patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder and bipolar disorder. Patients that suffer from these disorders are prone to low
      adherence and are at risk for discontinuation of treatment and frequent relapses.

      The advantages of the &quot;Moma&quot; call-center include high availability, reaching out,
      collaboration between treatment centers and agents, and continuous remote monitoring. We
      hypothesize that these factors will enable improvement of support provided to these patients,
      early detection of their needs, connection with community care agents, monitoring of
      treatment adherence, and remote interventions targeted towards prevention of relapse.
