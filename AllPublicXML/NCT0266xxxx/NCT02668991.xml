      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of and to clinically validate the Autism
      Behavior Inventory (ABI) in measuring clinical symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
      compared with other gold standard measures.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational study (in which participants identified as belonging to study groups
      are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes) to evaluate the utility of Janssen Autism
      Knowledge Engine (JAKE) in measuring clinical symptoms of ASD in children and adults with
      ASD. The study will consist of 3 cohorts of participants. For Cohort 1 and 2, there will be
      14-day Screening phase and 8-week (Cohort 1) or 10 week (Cohort 2) data collection phase
      extending from Day 0 (Baseline) to Day 56 or Day 70, respectively. For Cohort 3, the study
      will consist of a screening visit and a single testing visit, which may be combined.
      Primarily, the usability of JAKE as a system to monitor clinical outcomes in ASD will be
      assessed. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>It will consist of planned 50 children and adults aged 6 and older who, as part of their standard care, happen to be beginning a behavioral intervention within 2 weeks after the baseline visit of the study. This intervention can be an applied behavior analysis (ABA) program or similar or a social skills program or a school-based autism program and must be intended to last at least throughout the duration of the study.</description>

    <description>It will consist of planned 30 normally developing children and adults. These participants will only have a single visit wherein they will undergo a single session with the task battery and biosensors. There should be 5 participants aged 6-9 years, 5 aged 10-12 years, 5 aged 13-17 years, and 5 aged 18 years and older. This cohort should approximate the male:female ratio in Cohorts 1 &amp; 2, with approximately 1 female for every 5 males.</description>
