  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves participants with recurrent glioblastoma brain tumors (GBM). This means
      that a participant's brain tumor has either returned after being treated by a previous
      therapy, or has continued to progress despite being treated.

      The purpose of this study is to provide proof of concept that suppression of MDSCs
      (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) is feasible in patients with GBM. Rather than targeting
      tumor cells or immune checkpoints, which has been the focus of recent therapeutic efforts,
      direct targeting of MDSCs with low dose capecitabine has the potential to reverse the
      immunosuppressed microenvironment of GBM and thereby reduce tumors

      Primary Objective: To achieve a 20-fold MDSC reduction in the concentration of circulating
      MDSCs after treatment with low dose capecitabine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the concentration of circulating MDSCs in patients with recurrent
           glioblastoma after treatment with low dose capecitabine

        2. To determine the concentration of tissue MDSCs and T-regulatory cells in resected
           glioblastoma after treatment with low dose capecitabine

        3. To determine the safety and toxicity of continuous low dose capecitabine with and
           without standard dose bevacizumab.

      Exploratory Objective:

      To obtain a signal for efficacy as measured by progression-free survival rate at 6 months

             pancreas.

             component of the investigational products or compounds of similar chemical
             composition.

          -  Unable or unwilling to swallow tablets.

          -  Evidence of significant medical illness, abnormal laboratory finding, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would, in the Investigator's judgment, make the patient
             inappropriate for this study.

          -  Arterial ischemic event (e.g., unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke) within
             6 months of study entry
