  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients requiring major ablative surgery in the oral cavity, including
      partial/radical mandibular or maxillary resection, due to a head and neck carcinoma,
      osteoradionecrosis (ORN), or medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) has not been
      accurately reported. Surgical reconstruction to restore oral function and aesthetics forms a
      challenge to maxillofacial surgeons, and greatly impacts patient' quality of life (QOL).
      Recently, an active collaboration between the surgeons of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery
      Unit and the prosthodontist (LB) of the Department of Dentistry at the General Hospital
      Saint-John Bruges led to the development of the &quot;Oncology-bridge (O-bridge)&quot; protocol, which
      offers (immediate/delayed) fixed prosthetic rehabilitation in a minimum of sessions and a
      strongly reduced two-week treatment time, consequently accelerating patient' improved QOL at
      a considerably reduced cost.

      The investigators aim to develop a prospective database in which patient demographics,
      surgical, dental, prosthetic and QOL parameters collected during consecutive visits within
      the framework of routine practice, are being registered for each oncological patient eligible
      for (immediate/delayed) fixed prosthodontic rehabilitation at time of oral cavity
      reconstruction This could provide the investigators with more information about potential
      patient, surgical and prosthetic factors influencing short- and long-term biological and
      mechanical stability, as well as patient QOL. Moreover, registration of those results could
      function as a measurement of quality of care, and could be used for sample size calculation
      for future large prospective trials.
