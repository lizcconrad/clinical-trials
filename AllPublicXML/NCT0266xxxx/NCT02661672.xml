      Objective: The primary objective of this multicenter prospective registry is to provide
      additional safety, technical outcomes and clinical outcomes data for minimally invasive
      endoscopic surgery (MIES) with Apollo for the evacuation of supratentorial brain hemorrhage
      in adult patients who do not qualify for the concurrent INVEST randomized controlled trial at
      active INVEST centers.

    <textblock>
      Study Design: This study will be a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, single arm
      registry that will enroll up to 50 patients, however may increase to 200 at up to 30 US
      centers and 5 centers outside of the United States.

      Patient Population: Adult patients with supratentorial brain hemorrhages (ICH and/or IVH) who
      do not meet all INCLUSION criteria or who meet one or more EXCLUSION criteria for the INVEST
      trial, but who will ultimately undergo MIES with Apollo or Artemis at active INVEST centers.

      Indication: The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device is used for the controlled aspiration of
      tissue and/or fluid during surgery of the Ventricular System or Cerebrum in conjunction with
      a Penumbra Aspiration Pump. The Penumbra Aspiration Pump is indicated as a vacuum source for
      the Penumbra Aspiration Systems. The Apollo system has been cleared for the controlled
      aspiration of soft tissue and/or fluid during endoscopically guided neurosurgery of the
      ventricular system. In the present study, the researchers propose to investigate the safety
      and efficacy of this system for the minimally invasive evacuation of brain hemorrhage - both
      IVH, IVH with ICH and ICH alone - in patients who do not qualify for the INVEST trial.
