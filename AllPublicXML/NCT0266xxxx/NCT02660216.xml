    <textblock>
      Nowadays, maxillary Le Fort I osteotomy is a safe and routinely performed procedure. The
      conventional approach is characterized by a vestibular incision extending from
      molar-to-molar, associated with a pterygomaxillary disjunction performed with a curved
      chisel. Adequate mobilization of the maxilla during Le Fort I osteotomy requires an effective
      separation of the maxillary tuberosity from the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone.
      However, as initially described by Precious (1991) and later by Hernandez-Alfaro (2013), a
      true pterygomaxillary osteotomy is not necessary to achieve successful disjunction.
      Furthermore, Hernandez-Alfaro combined his technique of pterygomaxillary disjunction, the
      so-called &quot;Twist technique&quot;, to a minimally invasive protocol, performing the complete Le
      Fort I osteotomy through a 20 to 30 mm long horizontal vestibular incision. Although
      promising, the technique remains highly sensitive from a technical standpoint, and its true
      accuracy has not been comprehensively evaluated.

      The purpose of this study is to present and validate a minimally invasive approach towards Le
      Fort I osteotomy, using a modified pterygomaxillary (PTM) disjunction technique. The primary
      outcome is to evaluate the accuracy of the technique using rigid voxel-based registration of
      the 3D virtual treatment planning and the 4 weeks postoperative CBCT images. Secondary
      outcomes include the surgical time necessary to complete the procedure and the presence of
      intraoperative and early postoperative complications.
