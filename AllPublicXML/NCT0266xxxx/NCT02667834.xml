  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social cognition and interaction training (SCIT), a group-based treatment that aims to
      improve both processing social information and functioning, may be an effective treatment for
      enhancing the social skills of people with schizophrenia. This study will compare the
      effectiveness of Social cognition and interaction training (SCIT) versus treatment as usual
      (ETP) in helping people with schizophrenia improve their social cognition and social
      functioning so specially on negative symptoms. Many studies show a connection between
      negative symptom and social cognition in schizophrenia.

      This is a multicenter (6 centers in France), randomized, controlled trial compared people
      aged 18 to 50 years with a diagnostic of schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and
      Statistical manual of Mental disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV-TR), the Social Cognition and
      Interaction Training (SCIT) program will be compared to an already validated neurocognitive
      remediation program : therapeutic education program (ETP) Social Cognition and Interaction
      Training (SCIT) is composed of three phases: emotion training, figuring out situations, and
      integration. Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT) will be delivered by therapists
      in 20 weekly sessions over 5 months.

      160 patients will be randomized as follows: - Arm1, experimental: Social Cognition and
      Interaction Training (SCIT): 30h with therapist, videos and photos exercises - Arm 2,
      control: therapeutic education program (ETP): 30h with therapist, only discussion between
      patients.
