  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the distribution of Florbetaben (NEURACEQ:
      FBB) in the brain in amyloid cerebral angiopathy (ACA) manifested by isolated hemosiderosis
      in non-demented patients with that observed in healthy subjects, patients with ACA and with
      lobar hematoma(s) and patients with Alzheimer's dementia without MRI signs in favor of ACA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary objectives of this study are to compare among groups:

      A. The associated micro-bleeds. B. Associated leukoencephalopathy. C. Contrast observed in
      lobar Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces. D. Apolipoprotein E genotypes.

        The groups will be matched according to sex and age (by increments of 5 years) to the
        extent possible. Because amyloid cerebral angiopathy is a very rare condition, matching the
        two factors may be difficult to achieve. We therefore anticipate where appropriate to focus
        matching on age.
