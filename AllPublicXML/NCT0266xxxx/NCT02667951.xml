    <textblock>
      The illness course and symptoms of dementia is usually very long and characterized with
      behavioral, psychological and physical changes. Family caregivers' stresses change during the
      illness trajectory as well. The purpose of this study is to compare the costs and
      effectiveness of two care models- home-based caregiver-training program model and routine
      care model for dementia elders in Taiwan.

      The illness course and symptoms of dementia is usually very long and characterized with
      behavioral, psychological and physical changes. Family caregivers' stresses change during the
      illness trajectory as well. Thus, the needs of the elderly persons with dementia and their
      family caregivers differ in different stage of dementia, and the services they require are
      multidimensional. According to the researchers' previous 2-year study, behavioral problem
      management and service utilization were found to be the most difficult and least prepared
      caregiving activities and the family caregiver's needs for assistance of these two caregiving
      activities differed in different stage of dementia.The purpose of this study is to compare
      the costs and effectiveness of two care models- home-based caregiver-training program model
      and routine care model for dementia elders in Taiwan.
