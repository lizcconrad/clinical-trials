  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, randomized, dose escalation study in healthy and
      hypercholesterolemic subjects. Each subject will receive 1 of 5 treatments as a single
      subcutaneous injection. Subjects will remain confined at the research clinic for
      approximately 2 days. After discharge, subjects will return to the research clinic 15 times
      during 12 weeks.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Apparent clearance is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance is estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

          -  Healthy and hypercholesterolemic subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 years.

          -  Healthy subjects must have fasting LDL-C &gt;/= 70 to &lt;/= 190 mg/dL at two qualifying
             visits.

          -  Hypercholesterolemic subjects must be on a stable daily dose of statin for at least 45
             days before dosing and fasting LDL-C must be &gt;/= 70 mg/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs within 7 days or 5 half-lives
             (whichever) is longer prior to the first dose of study medication. For
             hypercholesterolemic subjects the use of statin class medication is allowed.

          -  Prior exposure to bococizumab (also known as PF-04950615 or RN316) or other
             investigational PCSK9 inhibitors.

          -  Treatment with monoclonal antibodies within 6 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) before dosing.
