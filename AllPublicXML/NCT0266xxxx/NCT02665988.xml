  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an investigational device that has not been
      approved for the treatment of any medical condition by the FDA but is allowed to be used for
      research purposes. In clinical trials tDCS has been associated with pain relief by decreasing
      the intensity and duration of chronic pain. tDCS potentially works by stimulating the brain
      by delivering an extremely low-level electrical current to areas below the forehead - areas
      associated with chronic pain. It is anticipated that this current will increase brain
      activity or the likelihood of brain activity in these areas, affecting individual's ability
      to regulate pain.

      The purpose of this study is to compare eligible participants in the Pain Management Program
      at The Menninger Clinic receiving adjunctive real transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
      (tDCS) versus those receiving sham tDCS in the resolution of chronic pain. The primary
      objectives are: (1) improving pain tolerance and (2) improving subjective pain experience.
      Secondary objectives are: (1) improving subjective experience of sleep quality and (2)
      increasing physical activity.

      Chronic or persistent pain is pain that continues when it should not be present; it is
      ongoing or recurrent pain, lasting beyond the usual course of acute illness or injury, and
      which unfavorably affects the individual's well-being. The Institute of Medicine (2011)
      estimates that 116 million American adults experience chronic pain with direct and indirect
      costs to the US economy totaling in excess of half a trillion dollars annually. Current
      treatments for chronic pain are only partially effective, especially when used alone. There
      is a critical need to develop new and more effective treatments for chronic pain.
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) may be helpful as an additional treatment for
      patients with chronic pain.

      Doctors and scientists conducting this research study want to evaluate the effectiveness of
      an investigational device (tDCS) that delivers a form of brain stimulation as an additional
      treatment to standard of care in the Menninger Clinic's Pain Management Program. Stimulation
      with tDCS as an adjunctive to medication-based treatments as well non-medication treatments
      options (such as physical therapy and psychotherapy) may improve an individual's ability to
      tolerate the physical and emotional distress associated with chronic pain. Therefore the
      investigators propose to engage in a clinical trial of adjunctive tDCS for chronic pain,
      restricting enrollment to the population receiving services in the Pain Management Program.

    <description>Prior to initiating the real tDCS trial and to reduce the likelihood of irritation associated with electrical stimulation, a low dose (1/8 of an inch) topical lidocaine (4%) cream will be applied to the skin where the tDCS the sponge-coated, surface electrodes soaked in saline solution will be placed. Neurotargeting tDCS-explorer software, Version 2.3 will be used to locate the left and right DLPFC, where anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation of the right DLPFC will be received. Real tDCS will be applied during 20-minute periods over the course of 10 sessions. After each session, vitamin-E will be applied to the skin where the electrodes had been placed to reduce likelihood of skin irritation.</description>
