    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of RTA 901
      following escalating single and multiple oral doses of RTA 901 in healthy adult subjects.

      This first-in-human, Phase 1, single-center study consists of single ascending doses (SAD)
      and multiple ascending doses (MAD) conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 (SAD) of this study will be
      conducted in approximately 56 healthy subjects in up to 7 groups. Each group will consist of
      up to 8 subjects who will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of RTA 901 or
      placebo, respectively. Safety, tolerability, and available pharmacokinetics through Day 4
      will be assessed in each group prior to dose escalation.

      Part 2 (MAD) of this study will be conducted in approximately 30 healthy subjects in up to 3
      groups. Each group will consist of up to 10 subjects who will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to
      receive 14 daily doses of RTA 901 or placebo, respectively. Safety, tolerability, and
      available pharmacokinetics through Day 17 will be assessed in each dosing group prior to dose
      escalation.
