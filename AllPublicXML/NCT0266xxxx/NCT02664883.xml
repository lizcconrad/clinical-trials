      This pilot research trial studies the use of the Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells Clinical
      Assay in finding and monitoring kidney cancer. Studying samples of blood and urine from
      patients with kidney cancer in the laboratory may aid doctors in the early detection of
      cancer, monitor tumor response to therapy, detect the presence of occult spreading of
      disease, and identify early return of disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate a novel clinical assay (Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells [MDSC] Clinical
      Assay) to detect cancer associated immune cells in the peripheral blood of patients as a
      means to better detect and monitor malignant renal cell carcinoma in patients.

      II. Determine mean MDSC level, intra-subject variability, and inter-subject variability for
      three groups of subjects with variable renal cell carcinoma disease status at baseline.

      III. In patients with known localized renal cell carcinoma who undergo nephrectomy, determine
      the change in MDSC level from diagnosis to after nephrectomy.

      IV. In patients with known metastatic renal cell carcinoma who undergo systemic treatment,
      determine the change in MDSC level from baseline to after treatment (4 months) and,
      secondarily, to compare these changes to the changes in tumor burden as evaluated by computed
      tomography (CT) scan or other imaging modality.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups according to disease status.

      GROUP I: Patients with no evidence of cancer and no hematuria undergo collection of blood and
      urine samples at baseline and 2 months for analysis via the Flow Cytometry MDSC Clinical
      Assay.

      GROUP II: Patients diagnosed with localized renal cell carcinoma undergo collection of blood
      and urine samples at baseline and after nephrectomy for analysis via the Flow Cytometry MDSC
      Clinical Assay. Patients also undergo CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 30 days
      after nephrectomy.

      GROUP III: Patients diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergo collection of
      samples prior to baseline and then after 4 months of systemic treatment for analysis via the
      Flow Cytometry MDSC Clinical Assay. Patients also undergo CT or MRI after completion of 4
      months of systemic treatment.
