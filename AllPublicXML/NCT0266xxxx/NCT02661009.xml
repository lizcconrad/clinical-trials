      In this clinical trial, investigators select FFPE and plasma samples of non-small cell lung
      cancer which are used for quantitative detection of four kinds of EGFR(Epidermal Growth
      Factor Receptor) mutations. By the following two aspects, investigators evaluate the clinical
      performance of the EGFR quantitative kits.

        1. methodology validation: To certify the equivalence between the EGFR quantitative kit and
           the common used detection methods.

        2. analysis of the relationship between the type and proportion of EGFR sensitive mutation
           and EGFR-TKI benefit.

      According to the types of samples and the purpose of the study, the research consists of two
      groups: plasma and tissue matching group and predicting clinical efficacy group. The samples
      of the plasma and tissue matching group are the same period plasma and matched
      FFPE(formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue)samples which will be collected before the first
      time patients accept any anti-tumor treatment. The samples of predicting clinical efficacy
      group are FFPE samples which will be collected before the patients receive EGFR-TKI
      treatment. In addition, the subjects have the complete prognostic follow-up data.
