  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single
      ascending doses of emodepside (BAY 44-4400) in healthy male volunteers. This study will also
      conduct an exploratory investigation of the relative bioavailability of emodepside
      administered as tablets and determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics.

          -  Use of dietary supplements or herbal remedies (such as St John's Wort) known to
             interfere with the CYP3A4 and/or P-gp metabolic pathways during the 28 days before the
             first dose of trial medication (see list in Study Procedures Manual)

             prescribed, including inflammatory eye disease (dry eye allergic conjunctivitis
             [seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, atopic
             keratoconjunctivitis], uveitis and glaucoma)

          -  Past history of ocular disease requiring ongoing treatment

          -  Past ocular surgery including laser or other refractive corneal surgery

          -  Evidence of eye irritation, visual difficulties, corneal opacity, ocular surface
             (corneal or conjunctival damage, with or without ocular symptoms)

          -  Evidence of narrow anterior chamber angles causing increased risk of acute glaucoma

          -  Evidence of ocular media opacity including lens opacity/vitreous opacities

          -  Evidence of retinal or optic nerve pathology

          -  Evidence of pronounced colour blindness, as indicated by an Ishihara score of 9/13 or
