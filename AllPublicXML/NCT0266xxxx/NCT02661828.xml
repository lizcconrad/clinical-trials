  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two ways to stop taking an antidepressant medication
      and determine whether a faster or slower taper is better tolerated.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As abrupt cessation of antidepressant medication can cause distressing symptoms (including
      and not limited to worsened mood, irritability/agitation, anxiety, dizziness, confusion, and
      headache), the aim of this study is to compare the tolerance of two tapering regimens with
      the hypothesis that tapering the antidepressant dose over the course of two weeks will yield
      less discontinuation symptoms than a one week taper regimen. Additionally, it is suspected
      that discontinuing medications that inhibit the serotonin transporter (selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors/SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors/SNRIs) will have a
      greater difference in the frequency of discontinuation symptoms between the two and one-week
      tapering regimens versus antidepressants that don't inhibit serotonin transporter.

      Demographic and clinical features will also be identified that may predict discontinuation
      symptoms with the hypothesis that patients on SSRIs and SNRIs may experience more
      discontinuation symptoms versus patients on non-SSRI/SNRI medications. Whether or not the
      treatment duration is positively associated with the number of discontinuation symptoms will
      also be determined.

    <description>To determine a change in the frequency of Discontinuation symptoms, the Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale (DESS) will be administered by a trained clinician/rater to assess the frequency of discontinuation symptoms. The assessment has 43 items to evaluate discontinuation-emergent symptoms resulting from withdrawal from their antidepressant medication. Symptoms are rated on a scale of 1-5:
New symptom
Old symptom but worse
Old symptom but improved
Old symptom but unchanged
Symptom not present Total score = sum of number of new symptoms and old (but worse) symptoms (score = 1) and old and unchanged symptom, absent, or old symptom but improved (score = 0); total possible range 0 to 43.
Higher score = more symptoms.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently taking an FDA-approved antidepressant for at least four weeks on the list of
             approved medications: SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine,
             paroxetine, sertraline, vilazodone or vortioxetine), SNRIs (desvenlafaxine,
             duloxetine, levomilnacipran, venlafaxine) and other classes (amitriptyline, bupropion,
             desipramine, doxepin, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, phenelzine, selegiline,
             or tranylcypromine). Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant approved for the
             treatment of OCD, will also be included, but will be classed as an SSRI for this study
             because inhibition of the serotonin transporter is its primary therapeutic mechanism.

          -  No longer wish to take the antidepressant medication they are currently prescribed,
             due to one of the following reasons: 1) ineffective for symptoms; 2) intolerable side
             effect; 3) improvement of their illness for sufficient duration that it is clinically
             appropriate to consider tapering the medication.

          -  Primary psychiatric diagnosis of major depressive disorder, an anxiety disorder, OCD,
             or PTSD.

          -  Ability to read and understand English language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has met criteria at any time during their life for a primary psychotic disorder (e.g.
             schizophrenia), or dementia.

          -  Meets criteria for DSM-5-defined substance use disorder within three months of the
             screening visit.

          -  Currently taking two or more antidepressants.

          -  Presents with a clinically significant suicide risk, as assessed by a study physician.

          -  Presence of any unstable or central nervous system-related medical illness that would
             interfere with cognition or participation.

          -  Women who are currently pregnant or lactating, or plan to become pregnant during the
             study.
