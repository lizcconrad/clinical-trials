      PanCareLIFE Study is a cohort study of patients treated for cancer in childhood, and
      biological case-control study nested in the cohort (WP4) is coordinated by Erasmus MC-Sophia
      Children's Hospital in Holland.

      Ensure optimal patient quality of life throughout his life is a priority for the research
      teams. PanCareLIFE Study also aims to identify the factors that predispose to impaired
      quality of life. It is in this light that will be offered to patients a quality of life
      questionnaires during the period of treatment and then periodically during long-term
      follow-up.

      PanCareLIFE Study is a cohort study of patients treated for cancer in childhood, and
      biological case-control study nested in the cohort (WP4) is coordinated by Erasmus MC-Sophia
      Children's Hospital in Holland. At European level, approximately 1,200 women are expected in
      this latest study, the patients were already identified through certain regional or national
      registries in terms of cumulative doses of chemotherapy, surgery, radiation.

      Ensure optimal patient quality of life throughout his life is a priority for the research
      teams. PanCareLIFE Study also aims to identify the factors that predispose to impaired
      quality of life. It is in this light that will be offered to former patients to complete
      quality of life questionnaires during the period of treatment and then periodically during
      long-term follow-up.

      The SALTO-BIO study is the French part of the European study PanCareLIFE. CHU of
      Saint-Etienne as French promotor, will organize this study only on the Rhône-Alpes region
      (Lyon, Grenoble and Saint-Etienne centers) and will participate as co-investigator and &quot;data
      provider &quot;to WP2, WP3, WP4 and WP6. Indeed, ototoxicity is already studied by a French group.
