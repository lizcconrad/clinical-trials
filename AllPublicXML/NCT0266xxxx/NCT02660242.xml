  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project focuses on development of new strategy for the prevention of exercise-associated
      hypoglycemia using mini-dose glucagon.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the protocol is to determine if the administration of mini-dose
      glucagon administered subcutaneously just before exercise produces better glucose stability
      than no adjustments for moderate intensity exercise in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).
      It will also be assessed whether mini-dose glucagon before exercise produces better glucose
      stability than basal insulin reductions or extra carbohydrate consumption.

      This is a randomized, 4-way crossover trial. The trial will include 16 participants who
      complete the study.

      Each participant will undergo four aerobic exercise sessions (in random order), with
      different strategies for glucose regulation:

        -  Control Trial: Fasted exercise, no basal insulin reduction

        -  Strategy 1: Fasted exercise, basal insulin reduction only (50% reduction in basal rate
           at 60 minutes before exercise, for the duration of the exercise)

        -  Strategy 2: Fasted exercise, no basal adjustment + pre-exercise glucose tabs (buccal
           route-40 grams in total )

        -  Strategy 3: Fasted exercise, no basal adjustment + pre-exercise mini-dose glucagon (sc)

      In all 4 sessions, aerobic exercise will be performed in the fasted state (before a
      standardized meal) for 45 minuets at ~50-55% of the participant's per-determined aerobic
      capacity. The participant's pump will be blinded during the control trial, strategy 1, and
      strategy 3 and an injection of saline will be given during the control trial and strategy 1
      so that participant is blinded to strategy.

      The primary outcome for this study will be the glycemic response during exercise and early
      recovery.
