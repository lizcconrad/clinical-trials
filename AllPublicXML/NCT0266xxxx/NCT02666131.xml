  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DFU patients will undergo a one week screening period and those with changes in ulcer size of
      less than 30% will be eligible for randomization providing all other criteria are met.
      Participants enrolled in the study will receive treatment based on randomization into 1 of 2
      treatment arms for up to 12 weeks. The participants will have an additional 12 week follow-up
      period beyond the treatment period to assess durability of wound closure.
