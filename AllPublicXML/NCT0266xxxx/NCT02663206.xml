      Spastic disorders of the esophagus encompass hyperactive conditions of the esophagus due to
      either abnormal premature contractions or extreme vigor. In the current iteration of the
      Chicago classification, spastic esophageal disorders include spastic (type III) achalasia,
      diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), and hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus. Management of
      these spastic esophageal disorders is challenging and not clearly defined. Several medical
      therapies have been suggested and include acid suppression, nitrates, muscle relaxants, and
      visceral analgesics. For those who fail to response to medical therapy, the treatment options
      are limited.

      Botulinum toxin (BTX) injection is an effective therapeutic option for spastic esophageal
      disorders, however many patients experience symptoms relapse with this treatment requiring
      repeated injections.

      Heller myotomy is a surgical option for patients with esophageal spastic disorders. As
      compared to other types of achalasia, the response rate to surgical myotomy was lower in
      patient with spastic achalasia. The theoretical reason for this is that the disease involves
      not only the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) but also the esophageal body. Given data to
      suggest that surgical myotomy may be effective in treating patients with spastic esophageal
      disorders, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), which is a less invasive treatment modality,
      has recently been studied for these difficult-to-treat patients. An initial study reported
      high success rate of POEM for severe spastic esophageal disorders. The response rate as
      defined by Eckardt score to ≤ 3 was 96% in spastic achalasia, 100% in DES and 70% in those
      with Jackhammer esophagus after a median follow-up of 234 days in a largest case series of
      medically refractory spastic esophageal disorders.

      To date, the optimal treatment for patients with severe symptomatic esophageal spastic
      disorders who fail medical therapy is unclear. Here, investigators aim to compare POEM and
      BTX injection in a randomized design.

    <description>Drug/Device: Botulinum toxin injection; Endoscopic Botulinum toxin (BTX) injection at lower esophagus; Upper endoscopy with Botulinum toxin injection.
The procedure will be performed as an outpatient basis by an endoscopist. Sedation can be in form of conscious sedation, monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia. An upper endoscope will be inserted into the patient's mouth and advanced into lower esophagus. Botulinum toxin (Botox@) 100 units 8-10 (25 units/mL) will be injected in 1-ml portion in each of four quadrants about 1 cm above the Z-line (the LES region).
At 1 month follow-up, patients who do not response to the first botox injection (Eckardt score &gt; 3) will receive the second botox injection.
At 3-month follow-up, POEM will be offered as a rescue therapy to both non-responders (Eckardt score &gt; 3 at 3-month follow-up after the procedure) and relapsers (Eckardt score ≤ 3 at 3-month follow-up but becomes &gt; 3 during the follow-up)</description>

    <description>Procedure/Surgery: peroral endoscopic myotomy.
The procedure will be performed by an endoscopist (gastroenterologist or surgeon). General anesthesia will be started and upper endoscope will be inserted into the patient's mouth and advanced into the stomach. Endoscopic myotomy will be performed. Mucosal entry will then be closed using endoscopic clips or endoscopic suturing.
All patients will recover from their procedures according to standard practice. They will remain nothing per oral (NPO) the night after the procedure and started on intravenous proton pump inhibitors. A gastrografin esophagram will be obtained the next day and if no evidence of leak, the diet will be advanced to a soft diet for two weeks. The patients will be evaluated by study coordinator/PI on a daily basis during their hospitalization.</description>
