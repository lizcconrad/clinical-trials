    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of hot packs versus whirlpool and exercise for patients
      with distal radius fracture (DRF). Patients with recently healed DRF are randomized into two
      groups, with one group receiving hot packs during therapy and the other immersing the arm in
      a whirlpool for 3 consecutive therapy visits. The effect of these modalities on range of
      motion and volume of the hand are evaluated, with measurements taking place before and
      immediately after heat during each visit.

      This study investigates the short term effect of hot packs versus whirlpool and exercise for
      patients with distal radius fracture (DRF) during a therapy visit. Patients with recently
      healed DRF are randomized into two groups, with one group receiving hot packs during therapy
      and the other immersing the arm in a whirlpool for 3 consecutive therapy visits.

      Measurements of wrist and forearm range of motion, and volume of the hand are recorded before
      and immediately after heat for each visit, effectively creating six measurement time points.
      Change scores are recorded for range of motion and for volume, and analyzed using MANOVA to
      determine differences between groups.
