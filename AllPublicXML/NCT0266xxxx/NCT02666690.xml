    <textblock>
      RECIST criteria for evaluating tumor response are often inadequate for the evaluation of
      anti-angiogenic drugs. An evaluation model of tumor perfusion with contrast-enhanced
      ultrasonography was developed at Gustave Roussy. It assesses the tumor vascular response
      through the analysis of 7 different parameters. Several studies (four at IGR, involving 117
      patients, and a multicenter study involving 400 patients) showed that CEUS allows early
      evaluation of the effect of anti-angiogenic drugs. Two of these parameters are particularly
      interesting for the early identification of patients responding (or not) to treatment. Those
      are area under curve , and area under the wash-out. To further validate the use of these
      parameters, it is essential to measure and describe the level of their intra-patient
      variability.

          2. With at least one clearly identified metastatic tumor lesion (and accessible to
             ultrasound for acquisition 3 minutes without losing the target), measuring more than 2
             cm, less than 50% of the volume is necrotic.
