      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness
      of Tresiba® (insulin degludec) after switching basal insulin in a population with type 1 or
      type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    <description>Information will be collected from the medical records (paper/electronic) of each patient at several outpatient clinics to describe the two periods of medical history: before and after the initiation date of Tresiba®. For each patient, data will be collected, to describe a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 12 months in each period; thus, the study will collect information on 12 to 24 months of medical history for each patient.</description>

          -  Switched to Tresiba® (with or without prandial insulin) after any basal insulin (with
             or without prandial insulin). Switch must have occurred at least 6 months prior to
             data collection and the patient may or may not be treated with Tresiba® at the time of
             patient selection

          -  Previously treated with any basal insulin (with or without prandial insulin) for at
             least 6 months prior to switching to Tresiba®

          -  At least one documented medical visit in the first 9 months after Tresiba® initiation

          -  Minimum available data at the time of Tresiba® initiation: age, type of diabetes,
             HbA1c (Glycated haemoglobin), duration of diabetes, duration and type of insulin
             treatment, medical follow-up at the study site of at least 1 year, and an eGFR
             (Estimated glomerular filtration rate )value in the last 12 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in this study. Participation is defined as having signed the
             Informed Consent

          -  Participation in a diabetes clinical trial or receipt of any investigational medicinal
             product up to 12 months before or any time after the initiation of Tresiba®

          -  Current participation in another non-interventional study on insulin degludec
             (Tresiba®)

          -  Patients treated by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or premix insulin in the
             6 months prior to receiving Tresiba®
