    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate the pre-emptive effect of dexamethasone and
      diclofenac associated to codeine to prevent the pain, edema and limited mouth opening at the
      extraction of third molar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgery of third molar is usually associated with important post-surgical sequelae. The
      damage caused to tissue and bone may result in considerable pain, edema and trismus. The
      symptoms start gradually, peaking in 2 days after the extraction. The use of medications such
      as dexamethasone and diclofenac associated to codeine may support the prevention of
      post-surgical pain. This clinical trial aim compare the the pre-emptive effect of
      dexamethasone and diclofenac associated to codeine to prevent the pain, edema and limited
      mouth opening at the extraction of third molar.
