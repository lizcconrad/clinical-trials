  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of CK-2127107 relative to placebo on cycle
      ergometer exercise tolerance, assessed as change from period baseline in constant work rate
      (CWR) endurance time, utilizing a breath-by-breath metabolic measurement system with
      integrated electrocardiogram (ECG). The time to intolerance is assessed by a stopwatch and
      verified from electronic recordings of the cycle ergometer.

      This study will also assess cardiopulmonary and neuromuscular effects of CK-2127107 relative
      to placebo; the effect of CK-2127107 on resting spirometry relative to placebo; the safety
      and tolerability of CK-2127107 as well as the pharmacokinetics of CK-2127107.
