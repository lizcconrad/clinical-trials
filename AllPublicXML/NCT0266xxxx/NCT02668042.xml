      The main purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the activity of tissue engineering skin
      substitutes safety and efficacy studies for the treatment of difficult to heal wounds

      This study for 6 months for a single center, open, randomized, controlled clinical trials
      before and after itself, test contains preliminary screening, treatment and follow-up after
      discharge of the patient.After treatment in patients with early debridement, in the case of
      no infection of living tissue engineering skin substitute transplantation, observe the wound
      healing after transplantation, chronic wound evaluation activity of tissue engineering skin
      substitutes in the efficacy and safety of wound healing after transplantation.
