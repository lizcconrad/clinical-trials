      The type 1 Diabetes (T1D) TrialNet Pathway To Prevention (PTP) Study assesses and recruits
      at-risk subjects into clinical trials aimed at preventing the development of full blown T1D.
      Thousands of first and second degree relatives of persons with T1D are screened for
      autoimmune abnormalities and positive subjects are followed with metabolic and autoantibody
      tests. The investigators' ancillary study us designed to test whether characterization of the
      insulin- glucose-glucagon (IGG) interactions in participants in the PTP study can provide new
      information about the early stages of the disease. When completed, this study will improve
      the understanding of the pathogenesis of the early stages of T1D and provide new quantitative
      tools for prediction and evaluation of insulin-glucagon-glucose interactions relevant to
      individuals at risk for developing T1D, thereby enabling future preventive intervention
      trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed ancillary studies is to establish whether characterization of the
      insulin-glucagon-glucose (IGG) interactions in first and second degree relatives of patients
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can provide new information about the pathogenesis, prediction,
      and progression of the early stages of the disease. The project will enroll individuals from
      the &quot;Living Biobank&quot; of the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention (PTP) study who are phenotyped
      with respect to a variety of risk factors, including immunological abnormalities. To the best
      of available knowledge, the IGG relationships in general and the glucagon phenotype in
      particular have not been studied in this population. It is known, however, that in T1D the
      release of glucagon is altered, which is manifested by abnormal postprandial suppression and
      defective response to hypoglycemia. Several reports indicate that glucagon becomes
      dysregulated prior to the development of T1D, but comprehensive studies aiming to understand
      in detail the insulin-glucagon co-dynamics in people at risk for T1D have never been
      performed.

      Thus, the goal now is to expand the investigators' existing methodology and transfer
      expertise in clinical testing and analysis of the IGG system to characterize the IGG
      interactions in individuals at risk for developing T1D.

    <measure>Test the hypothesis that immunological abnormalities are associated with abnormally high glucagon responses to a meal and reduced glucagon responses to insulin induced hypoglycemia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To address this aim, subjects in all three groups which are at different level of immunological risk to develop T1D will undergo a single 10-hour clinical test consisting of a mixed meal drink followed by insulin-induced hypoglycemia (Metabolic Challenge) to estimate their postprandial and counterregulatory glucagon responses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlate metrics derived from a minimally-invasive Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) home test with glucagon responses to a meal and hypoglycemia measured in the hospital.</measure>
    <time_frame>Seven days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will undergo a CGM home test. They will wear a CGM for a week at home, keep a meal diary, and ingest a mixed meal of known amount with a subsequent collection of urine sample. A novel mathematical methodology will be used to extract from the field data estimates of the glucagon responses to a meal and to a decline in blood glucose levels. It will be then tested whether this estimates correlate to the glucagon responses measured in the hospital.</description>
