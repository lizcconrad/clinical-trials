  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to address the need for an effective school-based
      intervention for elementary school-aged students with Organization, Time Management, and
      Planning (OTMP) deficits by adapting an evidence-supported clinic-based intervention so that
      it can be implemented in school settings. Investigators are learning to adapt an individual,
      clinic based program (OST-C) for children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive
      Disorder (ADHD) to children with OTMP problems. Investigators will be collecting data . To
      this end, investigators will be collecting data on implementation (such as feasibility and
      acceptability), program development (what changes to the individual OST-C program were made
      based on findings during this study) and limited outcome data (repeated measures collection
      and pre- and post-treatment collection on a small sample, no control group).

    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HPCL (Anesko, Schoiock, Ramirez, &amp; Levine, 1987) was designed to assess various aspects of homework performance. Parents are requested to rate each of 20 homework problems on a scale from 0 = never a problem to 3 = very often a problem</description>

    <measure>Change in score on Academic Progress Report (APR)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The APR (Abikoff et al, 2013) assesses proficiency in six academic subjects relative to standard expectations (1=Well below standard expected at this time of year; 3=At standard; 5=Well above standard). The sum of ratings across the six academic subjects is the unit of analysis. Reliability is acceptable (coefficient alpha = .84), and this measure is sensitive to OST treatment effects (Abikoff et al., 2013).</description>

    <measure>Change in score on Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess satisfaction with treatment, and to serve as an index of treatment credibility, a consumer satisfaction questionnaire adapted from McMahon and Forehand (2003), will be completed by parents and teachers at post-treatment. Items (rated 1-7) tap overall satisfaction with treatment, perceived improvement of the child on the problems of concern to parent or teacher respectively, and evaluation of treatment providers.</description>

    <measure>Measures of Feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will gather feasibility data based on completed activities during the study. They will record information about treatment training, number of groups run, number of students per group, scheduling challenges, number of meetings/contacts OST-S trainers had with teachers and parents, materials support, or any other items related to implementing the program will be recorded for the duration of the study.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children will be recruited based on their parents' interest level in having them
             participate in a program to improve their organizational skills.

          -  Investigators will consider feedback from their 3rd to 5th grade general education or
             inclusion classroom teacher based on OTMP problems difficulties that interfere with
             functioning (difficulty in morning routine or end-of-day packing up routine, a high
             percentage of incomplete or missing assignments, messy desk or Seat Sack).

          -  Investigators will not use specific cutoffs on normed measures for determining
             eligibility based on these difficulties, as the intention is to develop a program that
             can be easily disseminated.

          -  Availability to attend twice-weekly sessions with the OTMP trainer either during the
             school day (during a time when they would not be pulled from academic content) or
             during after-school hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with Mental Retardation will not participate in the study, due to the
             difficulty they would likely have understanding the content of the sessions.
