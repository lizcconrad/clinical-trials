    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine the beneficial effects of two novel treatments
      for Gulf War Veteran's Illness (Tai Chi and Wellness intervention) and to establish the
      efficacy of these mind-body approaches to symptom reduction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: Over 40,000 Veterans who served in the 1991 Gulf War (GW) have a persistent form
      of chronic multisymptom illness that defines Gulf War Veterans Illness (GWVI). With no
      existing proven treatments to provide relief to these sufferers, it is critical to find
      efficacious and acceptable treatments for GWVI.

      The long-term goal is to develop a safe, readily available, mind-body treatment to reduce
      pain and other chronic symptoms and enhance wellness in Veterans with GWVI. Tai Chi is a
      traditional Chinese mind-body therapy that has been practiced for centuries. In the last
      decade, the investigators have demonstrated that Tai Chi can improve both physical health and
      psychological wellbeing in patients with a variety of chronic conditions.

      The proposed randomized trial will establish the effectiveness of a Tai Chi mind-body
      treatment in Veterans with GWVI. One hundred and twenty participants meeting criteria for
      GWVI will be randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi exercise or a wellness education group for
      12 weeks with a post treatment assessment, and follow-up assessments. The investigators will
      accomplish the following Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate whether the Tai Chi intervention will reduce symptoms of pain in
      Veterans with GWVI more than the Wellness intervention. The investigators hypothesize that
      participants randomized to the Tai Chi intervention will show a greater reduction in pain
      symptoms than those in the Wellness intervention and will maintain changes over a 9-month
      follow-up period.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate whether the Tai Chi intervention improves fatigue, cognition,
      quality of life, and physical functioning in GW Veterans with GWVI, as compared to the
      Wellness intervention. The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to the Tai
      Chi intervention will evidence more improvement in fatigue, cognitive functioning, quality of
      life, and physical functioning than those randomized to the Wellness intervention and will
      maintain changes over a 9-month follow-up period.

      Research Design: One hundred and twenty GW Veterans meeting criteria for GWVI will be
      randomly assigned to either the Tai Chi Condition or the Wellness Condition, half to each
      condition.

      Methodology: All participants will receive 12 weeks of the randomly-assigned intervention
      twice each week. Participants in both conditions will receive assessments at baseline, 12
      weeks (post-intervention), 24 weeks (3 months post-intervention) and 48 weeks (9 months
      post-intervention). Assessments include instruments to measure self-reported pain, fatigue,
      cognition, quality of life, and physical functioning.

    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Short Form BPI across 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a 9-item self-report measure that examines pain intensity and interference with functioning in various life domains, including general activity, mood, walking activity, work, relationships, sleep, and enjoyment of life. In addition, the BPI asks questions about pain relief, pain quality, and patient perception of the cause of pain. Although initially developed to assess pain in patients with cancer, it has been used and validated in a wide range of clinical conditions and is a gold standard measure for the assessment of pain and its impact. Participants rate their pain levels on a 0 to 10 Likert scale. Test-retest reliability has been studied in a variety of pain populations and ranges from .83 to .98. There is strong psychometric support for its underlying factors of pain severity and pain interference.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline SPPB at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB captures domains of strength, endurance, and balance and is highly predictive of disability. The SPPB score is based on timed measures of standing balance, walking speed, and ability to rise from a chair. Each of the three performance measures are assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest level of performance and 0 the inability to complete the test. A summary score (range 0-12) is subsequently calculated by adding the three scores.</description>

    <measure>Change in Trail Making Test (TMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline TMT at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TMT is one of the most popular neuropsychological tests and provides information on visual search, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, and executive functioning. It consists of two parts: A and B. Part A requires an individual to draw lines sequentially connecting 25 encircled numbers distributed on a sheet of paper. Task B requires a similar task, however a participant is asked to draw a line alternating between numbers and letters (e.g., 1, A, 2, B, 3, C, etc). The score on each part represents the amount of time required to complete the task.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline HVLT-R at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R is a verbal learning and memory test, consisting of 12 nouns to be learned over the course of three learning trials. The administrator reads the list of words and the participant is asked to freely recall them immediately. Approximately 20-25 minutes later, a delayed recall trial and a recognition trial are completed. The delayed recall requires free recall of any word remembered. The recognition trial is composed of 24 words, including the 12 target words and 12 false-positives, 6 semantically related, and 6 semantically unrelated. The three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score, the delayed recall score and the retention percentage. All together, the HVLT takes approximately 10 minutes to administer.</description>
