  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volume resuscitation is the mainstay of treatment in most types of shock, especially in
      hemorrhagic and septic shock. Septic shock is a main cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide. Although there has been a lot of research to evaluate optimal amount and
      composition of fluids for volume resuscitation (e.g. colloids, crystalloids, red blood cell
      transfusion, albumin, fresh frozen plasma) particularly in the past decade, results remain
      inconclusive and to some extent contradictive. The investigators would like to contribute to
      the establishment of new endpoints for the guidance of shock therapy focusing on the first 24
      and 48 hours, amending the currently used parameters (i.e. cardiac output, heart rate, blood
      pressure, central venous pressure) with new measurements (see study specific measurements).
      The goal is to decrease the need for renal replacement therapy, thereby eventually reducing
      patient morbidity and mortality.

      Background and Rationale, clinical evidence to date:

      All forms of shock and especially septic shock, in which tissue metabolic demands are not
      fulfilled by blood supply, are main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide and develops
      in one third of the patients admitted to the ICU. Not only is this high incidence alarming,
      the uncertainty about the undeceiving parameters for guidance of fluid resuscitation to not
      only avoid acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy but also the consequences of
      fluid overload, such as interstitial pulmonary edema, underline the importance of further
      research within this field. This is why the investigators would like to contribute to the
      establishment of new parameters for the guidance of shock therapy focusing on the first 72
      hours, amending the currently used parameters (i.e. cardiac output, heart rate, blood
      pressure, central venous pressure) with new measurements, including assessment of total body
      water, renal vascular resistance (renal resistive index (RRI)) and microcirculatory blood
      flow.

      Although the application of intravenous crystalloid fluids, red blood cell concentrates in
      anemia, and catecholamines or inotropes are the mainstay of shock therapy, no clear endpoints
      for the fluid resuscitation or the hemodynamic endpoints for catecholamine therapy have been
      established so far. Static parameters such as central venous or arterial pressure, cardiac
      output, or plasma lactate failed in the guidance of the amount of fluid administered. The
      administration of intravenous fluids in response to so-called dynamic tests, such as stroke
      volume variation in response to fluid bolus administration, also did not show an influence on
      organ dysfunction and mortality due to shock. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most frequent
      organ dysfunction in patients in shock. Despite a more aggressive early fluid resuscitation
      and correction of arterial blood pressure, the incidence of AKI does not seem to decrease.
      One possible reason is that the excessive amount of fluid administered to these patients for
      hemodynamic stabilization and maintenance of urinary output harm kidney function. Indeed, a
      correlation between total amount of fluid administered, high central venous pressure, organ
      dysfunction, and mortality has been shown in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
      Established static and dynamic hemodynamic parameters are not influenced by the severity of
      capillary leakage and microcirculatory impairment due to inflammation-induced injury in
      capillaries. The relatively low perfusion pressure together with interstitial edema,
      microcirculatory injury, and a high outflow pressure may harm renal function by a decreased
      glomerular urine excretion. Intraabdominal pressure, total body water, and central venous
      pressure together with the renal resistive index may be additional measurements to reduce the
      rate of acute kidney injury and to guide fluid therapy in shock.

      The goal of the present study is to refine fluid resuscitation endpoints with new
      measurements to administer the optimal amount of fluid with the smallest possible adverse
      effects. Complexity of therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock as well as in other shock
      states was the topic of numerous studies showing no benefit of advanced macro-circulatory
      parameters for guidance of fluid resuscitation in shock. If the chosen measurements are
      unable to establish new endpoints for guidance in shock therapy, the investigators' research
      might be expanded to the evaluation of future therapies, such as biomarkers or stem cells.
      After establishment of more regional resuscitation endpoints, the investigators plan to
      evaluate these endpoints in a randomized, controlled setting against established
      hemodynamically-guided shock therapy.

      Investigational measurements:

      The investigators will perform the following new measurements and assessments for guidance of
      fluid resuscitation at 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after shock diagnosis and concomitant
      fulfillment of eligibility requirements:

      Patient characteristics:

        -  Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, daily

        -  APACHE II score, first 24 hours

        -  Simplified Acute Physiology (SAPS) II score, first 24 hours

      Established parameters:

        -  Hemodynamic parameters (cardiac index [5], central venous pressure, blood pressure,
           heart rate, central/mixed venous oxygen saturation = ScvO2/venous oxygen saturation
           (SvO2), pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure (PAOP)

        -  Use of inotropic and vasoactive drugs (epinephrine, norepinephrine, milrinone,
           dobutamine, levosimendan)

        -  Laboratory parameters (lactate, sodium, potassium, blood sugar concentration and need
           for insulin therapy with respect to need for immunosuppressive therapy)

        -  Parameters of renal function (creatinine, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen,
           urine output, potassium, urinary protein, urinary sediment analysis, sodium excretion
           fraction, need for renal replacement therapy)

             -  Creatinine clearance after 24, 48, and 72 hours

             -  Urinary sediment analysis 72 hours

             -  Urinary protein screening after 72 hours

      Fluid administration:

        -  Total amount of fluids (ml) administered

        -  Total amount of crystalloids (ml) administered after onset of shock symptoms

        -  Total amount of colloids (ml) administered

        -  Amount of red blood cell and plasma transfusion

        -  Amount of albumin infusion

      Alternative parameters influenced by severity of capillary leakage and microcirculatory
      injury:

        -  Renal artery resistive index (Doppler analysis)

        -  Intra-abdominal pressure (bladder pressure management)

        -  Total body water (bio-impedance analysis): this is a commonly used method for assessment
           of body composition

        -  Microcirculatory blood flow (CytoCam incident dark-field illumination): &quot;hand-held
           device (â€¦), providing new means of directly visualizing the microcirculation and
           evaluating the effects of interventions on microcirculatory flow in easily accessible
           surfaces&quot;

      Outcome parameters:

        -  Acute kidney injury according to 'Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes' (KDIGO)
           criteria

        -  Need for renal replacement therapy

        -  Length of intensive care stay

        -  Length of hospital stay

      Safety: risks and benefits:

      Since the investigators are only performing noninvasive measurements, additional to
      interventions, pharmacotherapy and measurements in shock patients, there will be no
      contributing risk by study enrolment. Since there will be a more precise way for guidance of
      fluid resuscitation in shock evoked by these study-specific measurements (bio-impedance
      analysis, doppler analysis, CytoCam incident darkfield illumination), study patients might
      even benefit from enrolment.
