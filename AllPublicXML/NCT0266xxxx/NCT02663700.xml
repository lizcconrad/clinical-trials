      This study is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial
      of Sanaria's irradiated sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ vaccine). The primary objective of this
      protocol is to determine the safety and reactogenicity of the PfSPZ Vaccine in
      malaria-experienced healthy adults. The study duration shall be 34 months and subject
      participation duration shall be 15-26 months.

      protocol is to determine the safety and reactogenicity of the PfSPZ Vaccine in
      malaria-experienced healthy adults. The secondary protocol objective is to evaluate
      vaccine-induced immune responses, including but not limited to, anti-CSP antibody and T cell
      responses against whole P. falciparum sporozoites and a variety of P. falciparum antigens
      from different life cycle stages. The study duration shall be 34 months and subject
      participation duration shall be 15-26 months.

        clinic, which offers several means of contraception that are approved and recommended by
        the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health. Contraception (male or female condoms, diaphragm or
        cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine device, or hormone-based contraceptive) should
        be started 30 days before the first vaccination and continue until 30 days after last
        vaccination. 3. Written informed consent obtained from the participant before screening 4.
        Available and willing to participate in follow-up for the duration of study 5. Residing in
        Sapone region and environs 6. Appear to be in generally good health based on clinical and
        laboratory investigation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Previous vaccination with an investigational malaria vaccine 2. Use of an
        investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study vaccine(s) within 30
        days before the first study vaccination, or planned use up to 30 days after last
        vaccination 3. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants
        or other immune-modifying drugs within six months before the first vaccination. This
        includes any dose level of oral steroids, but not inhaled steroids or topical steroids. 4.
        Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
        within 30 days before the first study vaccination with the exception of tetanus toxoid 5.
        Confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition 6. Confirmed or
        suspected autoimmune disease 7. History of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis to artesunate
        and artemisinin derivatives, vaccinations or to any vaccine component 8. History of serious
        allergic reactions to any substance, requiring hospitalization or emergent medical care 9.
        History of allergy to any component of the vaccine formulation, including human serum
        albumin 10. Use or planned use of any drug with anti-malarial activity during the course of
        the study except for antimalarial medication administered by study clinicians 11. History
        of splenectomy 12. Confirmed or suspected pregnancy or current breastfeeding 13. Laboratory
        evidence of liver disease (ALT &gt; / = 1.25 x upper limit of normal) 14. Laboratory evidence
        of renal disease (serum or plasma creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal) 15. Laboratory
        evidence of hematologic disease (platelet count &lt;115,000/mm^3, or hemoglobin &lt;11.2 g/dL for
        males and &lt;9.5 g/dL for females). 16. Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen or
        hepatitis C virus (hepatitis C antibody) 17. Seropositive for HIV 18. Sickle cell trait
        carriage or sickle cell disease 19. Administration of immunoglobulin and/or any blood
        products within the three months preceding the first study vaccination or planned
        administration during the study period. 20. Simultaneous participation in any other
        interventional clinical trial 21. Acute or chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic,
        renal or neurological condition, severe malnutrition, or any other clinical findings that
        may increase the risk of participating in the study, as determined by the PI 22. Other
        condition that in the opinion of the PI would jeopardize the safety or rights of a
        participant in the trial or would render the participant unable to comply with the protocol
