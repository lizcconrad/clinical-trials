      To demonstrate the efficacy of new product IVIG prepared by minipool technology as assessed
      by Bleeding Score and platelet count at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks.

      The platelet response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects responding to treatment
      with an increase of platelet count from ≤ 20 x 10^9/L to ≥ 100 x 10^9/L and absence of
      bleeding (complete response) or platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and at least 2-fold increase the
      base line count with absence of bleeding (partial response), within the specified time frame.

      base line count with absence of bleeding (partial response), within the specified time frame.

      Secondary:

        1. To assess safety of mini-pool IVIG in patients with newly diagnosed ITP by assessing
           frequency of adverse events related to mini-pool IgG administration

        2. To compare data on efficacy and safety of mini-pool IVIG with data obtained from
           literature on standard IVIG.

      Study population:

      Patients with newly diagnosed ITP attending Hematology clinic Ain Shams Children hospital

      Sample size:

      Seventy- two patients will be enrolled. They will be divided into 3 groups:

      Group A; platelet non enhancing group Group B; group receiving standard IVIG Group C; group
      receiving IVIG New product 24 patients in each group in a ratio 1:1:1.
