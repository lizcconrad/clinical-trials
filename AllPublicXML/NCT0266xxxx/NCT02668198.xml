  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of using different endoscopic imaging
      technique (white light, white light with near focus, narrow band imaging (NBI), NBI with near
      focus) for detection of residual neoplastic tissue at site of prior EMR

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Residual neoplasia after EMR is a common. Optimal surveillance protocols are not clearly
      defined. There is a need for better imaging modalities to evaluate for residual disease.
      Suspected residual tissue can be confirmed with repeat colonoscopy or can be empirically
      treated. However, this can lead to either frequent colonoscopy or overtreatment. This
      presents more cost and financial burden to the patient. With the introduction of newer
      colonscopes that have near focus/zoom capability, it is important to assess whether the near
      focus technology offers better accuracy for detection of residual neoplastic tissue. With
      better accuracy to confidently rule out residual neoplasia using newer imaging modality,
      additional treatment or biopsy at the previous EMR may be avoided. Furthermore, the interval
      for surveillance colonscopy can be lengthened.

      Hypothesis of the study: Using standard white light with and without near focus does not
      provide better sensitivity and negative predictive value compare to narrow band imaging with
      and without near focus when assessing previous endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) site for
      residual neoplasia

    <description>For the 190 systems, the polyp was examined in standard focus and near focus modes, which provided in-focus images up to 2 mm from the optical lens, thus allowing true optical, in-focus zoom.
Near focus is used to help examine for any residual polyps.</description>
