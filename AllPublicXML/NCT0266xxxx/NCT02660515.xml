  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open reduction and internal fixation of intra-articular distal radius fractures leads to
      better functional outcomes the first 6 months compared to non-operative treatment. However,
      some patients continue to have a painful and stiff wrist post-operatively. Arthroscopically
      assisted removal of intra- articular fracture haematoma and debris may reduce pain and
      improve the functional outcomes following operative treatment of intra-articular distal
      radius fractures. Moreover, during arthroscopy the quality of the reduction and the presence
      of associated ligamentous injuries can be assessed. Therefore the objective of this study is
      to compare the functional outcome of internal plate fixation with additional wrist
      arthroscopy versus conventional fluoroscopic assisted internal plate fixation in adult
      patients with displaced intra-articular distal radius fractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fractures account for 17% of all fractures seen at the emergency department.
      Fifty percent of these fractures are intra-articular. The past several years an increase in
      open reposition internal fixation (ORIF) for distal radius fractures has been observed. This
      technique leads to a quicker resume of function the first 3 to 6 months compared to
      non-operative treatment. However, some patients continue to have a painful and stiff wrist
      postoperatively. Arthroscopically assisted removal of intra-articular fracture haematoma and
      debris may improve the functional outcomes following operative treatment of intra-articular
      distal radius fractures. Moreover, during arthroscopy the quality of the reduction and the
      presence of associated ligamentous injuries can be assessed.

      To our knowledge, no studies have been carried out to further examine the use of arthroscopy
      after internal plate fixation to remove fracture haematoma and debris on functional outcomes.
      Therefore, the purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to determine the difference in
      functional outcome, assessed with the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) score, after
      internal plate fixation with an additional wrist arthroscopy and conventional
      fluoroscopically assisted internal plate fixation in adult patients with displaced complete
      articular distal radius fractures. Secondary, we aim to determine the difference in
      functional outcomes with the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score,
      post-operative pain, range of motion, grip strength, complications, quality of life (SF-36),
      and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, for patients undergoing additional wrist arthroscopy
      the quality of reduction, associated ligamentous injuries and cartilage damage will be
      assessed.

    <description>The operation has to be performed within 3 weeks after the initial trauma. According to the current standard, antibiotic prophylaxis (Cefazoline, 1000 milligram intravenous) will be administered thirty minutes preoperatively. The distal radius will be approached according to Henry, which beholds an incision between the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis and the arteria radialis. After the fracture site is exposed, the fracture will be reduced and an appropriate volar locking plate will be positioned. The type and brand of the plate are at discretion of the treating surgeon. When a dorsal approach is deemed necessary the distal radius will be approached between the third and fourth dorsal extensor tendon compartments. To evaluate the quality of articular reduction, fluoroscopic images will be obtained. Wound closure will be performed using standard techniques.</description>

    <description>Surgery will be performed by a certified trauma surgeon, with experience in wrist arthroscopy. A delay of minimal 5 days before performing arthroscopy is mandatory to enable visualisation due to the organisation of the hematoma. During wrist arthroscopy, the forearm will be positioned upright and in neutral position, the elbow flexed by 90° and axial traction of 4-6 kg will be performed. Four portal entrees are created by superficial stab incisions and blunt preparation through the joint capsule; one midcarpal radiair and one midcarpal ulnar portal and the 3-4 and 6-R portal. A shaver is used for removal of fracture haematoma and osteocartilaginous debris. Cartilage damage will be graded using the Outerbridge classification system. With the 1 mm hook probe assessment of the quality of reduction and ligamentous injuries (TFCC, scapholunate and lunotriquetral) will be performed. Wound closure will be performed using standard techniques.</description>
