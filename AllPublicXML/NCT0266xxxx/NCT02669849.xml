      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of VX-210 in subjects with
      Acute Traumatic Cervical Spinal Cord Injury. Secondary objectives include the specific
      evaluation of the effects of VX-210 on neurological recovery and daily function after spinal
      cord injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute traumatic cervical SCI, motor level of C4, C5, C6, or C7 on each side:

               -  Screening UEMS score must be ≤16 points on each side.

               -  AIS A subjects with a C4 motor level on both sides must have at least 1 point of
                  motor activity between C5 and T1 on at least 1 side.

               -  AIS B subjects with a C4 motor level on both sides must have at least 1 point of
                  motor activity between C5 and C7 on at least 1 side.

          -  American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade A or AIS grade B.

          -  Scheduled and planned to undergo a spinal decompression/stabilization surgery that
             commences within 72 hours after the initial injury.

          -  Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is consistent with
             the subject's neurological deficit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in any other clinical study for acute SCI without approval by the
             sponsor.

          -  Inability to undergo decompression/stabilization surgery that commences within 72
             hours after injury.

          -  One or more upper extremity muscle groups untestable during screening ISNCSCI
             examination.

          -  Acute SCI from gunshot or penetrating/stab wound; non-traumatic SCI (e.g., transverse
             myelitis, acute disc herniation); brachial plexus injury; complete spinal cord
             transection; or multifocal SCI.

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or have a positive serum pregnancy test.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of ≥40 kg/m2 at screening.

          -  History of an adverse reaction to a fibrin sealant or its components.

          -  Unconsciousness or other mental impairment that precludes reliable International
             Standards for the Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI)
             examination.

          -  Known immunodeficiency, including human immunodeficiency virus, or use of
             immunosuppressive or cancer chemotherapeutic drugs.

          -  Any significant medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would significantly increase
             the risk of study enrollment and/or significantly interfere with study outcomes or
             assessments, in the judgment of the investigator.

        Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
