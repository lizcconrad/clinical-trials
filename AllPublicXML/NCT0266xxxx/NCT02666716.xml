  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are expected to be different in ICU patients compared to
      non-ICU patients. The investigators will determine fluconazole and free fluconazole
      concentrations in 20 ICU patients, who will get intravenous fluconazole as standard care.
      Switching to oral/enteral fluconazol is allowed after day 3.

      A full pharmacokinetic curve will be taken on day 3 of iv therapy and limited pharmacokinetic
      curves on day 7 of iv therapy and/or on day 3 of oral therapy; trough levels will be taken
      daily after intravenous therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are expected to be different in ICU patients compared to
      non-ICU patients and healthy volunteers due to underlying disease(s). Therefore,
      extrapolation of data from healthy volunteers and non-ICU patients is not possible.

      To be able to include 20 patients within the study duration, a multi-centre approach is
      necessary.

      Patients will receive standard care, as stated in the product characteristics or according to
      local protocols. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis will be retrieved through a
      central venous catheter. A maximum of 62 milliliter blood in total will be drawn for this
      study. Patients will be monitored daily during the treatment period for adverse events of the
      study drug.

      Full pharmacokinetic curves will be taken on day 3 of iv therapy. Limited pharmacokinetic
      curves will be taken on day 7 of iv therapy. These two moments of pharmacokinetic analysis
      will enable the determination steady state and enable the determination of intra-individual
      variability.

      As probably not all patients included will be treated with iv fluconazole for 7 days,
      switching to oral/enteral therapy is allowed after day 3. To assess bioavailability limited
      pharmacokinetic curves will be taken on day 3 of oral/enteral therapy.
