             a) Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),

             study entry and throughout the study until 90 days after the last investigational
             product administration. Adequate contraception as recommended by the Clinical Trial
             Facilitation Group (CTFG)

         11. Male patients are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they are
             vasectomized or agree to use of contraception during the study treatment period and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Platinum-resistant/refractory disease, defined as progressive disease at the first
             tumor assessment while receiving platinum-based chemotherapy or within 6 months after
             treatment (for patients in Part B; disease-specific expansion arms only).

          2. Patient has history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal
             antibodies (mAbs).

          3. Prior malignancy within the previous 2 years except for locally curable cancers that
             have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix or breast or bladder.

          4. Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastasis(es). Note: Baseline CT/MRI of the
             brain is required for SCLC patients enrolled in Arm 4. Patients with previously
             treated CNS metastasis(es) are eligible if the patients with previously treated CNS
             metastasis(es) are asymptomatic and radiographically/clinically stable and not
             requiring steroids within 4 weeks prior to first dose.

             Note: Non-SCLC patients without clinical signs or symptoms of CNS involvement are not
             required to have a computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of
             the brain unless it is considered standard of care.

          5. Prior therapies targeting PD-1, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), or PARP.

          6. Patients with active autoimmune diseases or history of autoimmune diseases should be
             excluded; these include but are not limited to patients with a history of
             immune-related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating)
             neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematous
             (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's
             ulcerative colitis, hepatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson
             syndrome, or anti-phospholipid syndrome.

             Note: Patient are permitted to enroll if they have controlled celiac disease,
             vitiligo, eczema, psoriasis, controlled Type I diabetes mellitus, endocrine
             deficiencies (including hypothyroidism) managed with replacement hormones including
             low-dose (≤10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) corticosteroids. Patients with
             rheumatological autoimmune diseases that are frequently limited in severity such as
             rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome are permitted to enroll if they do not
             require treatment with a non-biologic or biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic
             drug (DMARDs), e.g. cyclophosphamide or adalimumab. All patients with an autoimmune
             rheumatological disease require evaluation for severity and target organ involvement.

          7. Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks of the study drug administration.

             Note: Adrenal replacement doses ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in
             the absence of active autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to use topical,
             ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal
             systemic absorption); a brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g.,
             contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g.,
             delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.

          8. Has history of interstitial lung disease or non-infectious pneumonitis except for
             those induced by radiation therapies.

          9. Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status.

         10. Active infection requiring therapy, positive tests for Hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg) and/or Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive or Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             antibody positive at screening must not be enrolled until further definite testing
             with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titers and HCV RNA tests can conclusively rule out
             presence of active infection.

         11. Underlying medical conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, will make the
             administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of toxicity
             determination or adverse events (AEs).

         12. Inability to swallow oral medications (capsules and tablets) without chewing,
             breaking, crushing, opening or otherwise altering the product formulation. Patients
             should not have gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude the absorption of
             BGB-290, which is an oral agent.

         13. Has been administered a live vaccine within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of study
             therapy. Patients are eligible if 28 days have elapsed since receipt of vaccine and
             initiation of study treatment. (NOTE: seasonal vaccines for influenza are generally
             inactivated vaccines and are allowed. Intranasal vaccines are live vaccines; and are
             not allowed).

         14. Any of the following cardiovascular criteria:

               1. Current evidence of cardiac ischemia

               2. Current symptomatic pulmonary embolism

               3. Acute myocardial infarction ≤6 months prior to Day 1

               4. Heart failure of New York Heart Association Classification III or IV ≤6 months
                  prior to Day 1

               5. Grade ≥2 ventricular arrhythmia ≤6 months prior to Day 1
