    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, single-arm observational study aims to document the clinical
      performance and safety of a sterile, bacteria-binding, super-absorbent wound dressing for the
      intended use in a daily clinical practice. 50 patients (male/female) with superficial wounds
      of any etiology affecting only epidermis and dermis layer, with one or more clinical signs of
      infection or at high risk of infection and also high to very high exudate levels will be
      observed over a period of 14 days.

    <description>A cohort of 50 patients with superficial wounds of any etiology (see inclusion criteria), who need advanced wound care treatment in any case, will be observed over a period of 14 days; the exact duration for each patient depends upon the investigator's assessment. The observation consists of an initial visit, at least one dressing change after max. 7 days and a final visit. Patients will be treated with the CE-marked wound care product. This product is already in general use in the Netherlands and Germany. It is a sterile, bacteria-binding, super-absorbent wound dressing. Apart from the predefined study visits, daily dressing changes in accordance with daily clinical practice are possible.</description>
