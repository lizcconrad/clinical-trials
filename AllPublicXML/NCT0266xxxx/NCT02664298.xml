  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Edentulism is often associated with a negative psychosocial impact. The concept of prosthetic
      rehabilitation in which a prosthesis is supported by osseointegrated implants, was first
      introduced in the late 1960s by Br√•nemark et al. and offers an interesting alternative to
      removable prosthesis. However, for patients with a severely atrophic maxilla or mandible,
      cranial bone grafting of the jaw is required to increase bone width and height necessary for
      implant insertion. An active collaboration between the surgeons from the Oral and
      Maxillofacial Department and the prosthodontist from the Department of Dentistry has been
      established for continuous quality improvement of the concept of (immediate/delayed) implant
      loading in patients requiring cranial bone grafts to augment their severely atrophic jawbone.

      The investigators aim to develop a prospective database registering (immediate/delayed)
      implant loading data of all patients eligible according to the protocol. Patient
      demographics, surgical, dental, prosthetic and patient satisfaction parameters are collected
      during consecutive visits within the framework of routine practice.

      Development of a database registering immediate functional loading data secondary to cranial
      bone-grafting of a severely atrophic jaw, will provide more information about potential
      patient, surgical and prosthetic factors influencing long-term biological and mechanical
      stability, as well as patient satisfaction. Moreover, registration of those results could
      function as a measurement of quality of care, and could be used for sample size calculation
      for future large prospective trials.
