      The purpose of this study is to offer pre-natal Myelomeningocele (MMC) repair surgery to
      pregnant women with one of the former surgery exclusion factors

        -  A BMI of 35-40 kg/m2

        -  Diabetes; patients will require good glycemic control

        -  History a previous preterm birth, as long as it was followed by a full term birth

        -  Structural abnormality in the fetus; abnormality must be minor, not increasing the risk
           of prematurity. For example cleft lip and palate, minor ventricular septal defect,
           pyelectasis.

        -  Maternal Rh alloimmunization. Must have a low level of anti-red blood cell antibody that
           is not associated with fetal disease, specifically anti-E &lt; 1:4 or anti-M. Or
           alloimmunization with negative fetal red blood cell antigen status determined by
           amniocentesis.

      We will be extending the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMs) criteria by including
      these factors. Prenatal clinical and outcome information will be collected; safety and
      efficacy will be evaluated

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to extend the MOMs requirements for pre-natal MMC repair surgery
      and evaluate safety and efficacy. This will be accomplished through prenatal and
      post-operative observation and data collection.

      The data collected will be documented and collected from prenatal ultrasounds, operative, and
      delivery reports. We will share our preliminary data with NAFTNet in order to prompt a
      multicenter trial; this collaboration will help propagate further research and answer
      clinical questions regarding this extension in surgery criteria.

(well-controlled) Diabetes
Previous preterm delivery (followed by a full term delivery)
Maternal red cell alloimmunization (must NOT be associated with fetal disease, OR fetus must have negative red cell antigen status as determined by amniocentesis).
