      This is a phase III single-dose, randomized , placebo and dose-controlled study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of a RX0041-002 topical solution for local anesthesia during
      diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities
      (e.g. nasal/sinus endoscopy, sinusotomy, fracture nasal turbunate(s), lysis intranasal
      synechia, insertion of nasal septal prosthesis, biopsy intranasal, excision of nasal polyps,
      excision turbinate(s), removal of foreign body intranasal, septoplasty, sinus debridement).

             acceptable and effective birth control method from the first dose and for 8 days
             following last dose of study drug. Medically acceptable methods of contraception that
             may be used by the participant and/or his/her partner include abstinence, birth
             control pills or patches, diaphragm, intrauterine device (IUD), condom, surgical

          4. Has a history of abuse of controlled substances, nasal or otherwise, or has damage to
             the nasal space, that in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the
             ability of the subject or investigator to judge analgesia from the study drug.

          5. Has participated in an investigational study or received an investigational drug
             within 30 days preceding the randomization.

             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study, and for women 30 days and men
             90 days after the last dose of investigational product in such a manner that the risk
             of pregnancy and risk to pregnancy is minimized.

          8. Suffers from a condition, other than the need for a diagnostic procedure or surgery on
             or through the nasal mucous membranes, which in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             compromise the safety of the subject, the quality of the data, or the normal wound
             healing process.

          9. Has severely traumatized mucosa or sepsis in the nasal cavity.

         10. Subjects who have experienced a seizure while taking isoniazid (INH), phenothiazines,

             amitriptyline.

         11. Use of any analgesic up to 2 days prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs
             during the screening period and throughout the time period of the trial. This includes
             NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, ketoprofen,
             flurbiprofen, naprozen, opioids such as codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine,

             during the screening period and throughout the time period of the trial.

         13. Use of MAO Inhibitor drugs up to14 days prior to screening or has a need to use these
             drugs during the screening period and throughout the time period of the trial.

         14. Subjects who have experienced a seizure while taking isoniazid (INH), phenothiazines,
             chlorpromazine, thioridazine, theophylline, or tricyclic antidepressants such as
             amitriptyline. Has a history of seizure, with the exception of febrile seizures.

         15. Has a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, congestive heart
             failure, irregular heart rhythm, or uncontrolled hypertensions (defined as an average
             SBP ≥140 mmHg or an average DBP ≥90 mmHg) or is taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
             Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal

         16. Has a known personal or family history of hereditary pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
             Study participants will be screened by asking about personal or family history of
             anesthetic reaction, anesthetic death, and previous diagnosis of psuedochloinesterase
             deficiency in a relative or personally. Subjects identified with pseudocholinesterase
             deficiency are at risk for delayed recovery with certain anesthetics (e.g.
             succinylcholine and ester-based anesthetics).

         17. Has a known personal or family history of pheochromocytoma. Study participants will be
             specifically asked if they have been treated for a pheochromocytoma previously or if
             they have a family member who has been diagnosed with pheochromocytoma (since 10% of
             these are familial).

         18. Has a known personal or family history of adrenal tumor.

         19. Has used amphetamines, stimulant prescription and nonprescription products such as
             catecholamines (direct and indirect acting sympathomimetics), bronchial inhalers
             containing sympathomimetics (epinephrine or other beta-receptor agonist) or herbal
             products in the 2 days prior to screening or has a need to use these drugs during the
             course of the study.

         20. Has screening 12-lead ECG findings of any abnormalities. Generally, these are current
             or prior myocardial ischemia or infarction, dysrhythmia, or risk of serious
             dysrhythmia (such as prolonged QT interval). An exception to this would be if sinus
             bradycardia or sinus tachycardia is present, the Investigator must determine whether
             this finding is clinically relevant and exclusionary

         21. Has a positive urine pregnancy test at Screening or Day 1.

         22. Has a positive urine test result for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates,
             cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, opiates and oxycodone) at Screening or Day 1.

         23. Hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dl; a one-time retest will be allowed for Hb 8.3-8.4 g/dl.

         24. WBC &lt; 3.5 x 103 cells/mcl; a one-time retest will be allowed for WBC 3.3-3.4 x 103
             cells/mcl.

             90-99 x 103 platelets/mcl.

         26. Serum Potassium &lt; 3.5 or &gt; 4.5 mEq/L.

         27. Serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin not exceeding 2X ULN for the lab's reference values.

         28. Is not suitable for entry into the study in the opinion of the Investigator.
