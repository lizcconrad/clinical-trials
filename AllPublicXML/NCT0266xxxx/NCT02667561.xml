             physical examination and complimentary laboratory tests;

          -  Ability to understand the nature and objective of the trial, including risks and
             adverse events, which shall be confirmed by Informed Consent Form signature.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Screening laboratory tests results presenting clinically relevant deviations that, at
             the investigator discretion, prevent the subject to participate in the trial due to
             possible risks;

          -  Drugs addiction, including alcohol;

             organs, within 3 months before the trial, ;

          -  Participation in any other experimental research or administration of any experimental
             drug within six months before the initiation of this trial;

          -  Pregnancy, labor or miscarriage in the last 12 weeks before the antecipated date of
             the study treatment start;

          -  Any conditions, according to investigator's best judgement, that prevents the subject
             to participate in the trial.
