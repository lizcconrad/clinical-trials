  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to investigate the impact of aging on the responsiveness of
      peripheral blood immune cells. To this aim, the investigators will take advantage of a
      recently described syringe-based assay system that can reproducibly assess induced, innate or
      adaptive immune responses. Briefly, a total of 50 healthy volunteers will participate to this
      study: 25 will be older than 18 and younger than 30, and 25 will be older than 55. A total of
      14 ml of blood will be drawn including 5 X 1 ml in TruCulture™ tubes containing poly(I:C),
      R-848, LPS, CpG, or no stimulus, respectively. After 22 hours of incubation at 37°C, cellular
      supernatants will assessed for levels of 10 different chemokines using a MesoScaleDiscovery
      multiplexing platform.
