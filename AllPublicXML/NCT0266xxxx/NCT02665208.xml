  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to understand the feasibility of a text messaging
      intervention developed by the National Cancer Institute, known as Smokefreetxt, to improve
      smoking cessation among opiate and/or alcohol dependent participants discharged from an
      inpatient detoxification unit and enrolled in an office-based buprenorphine program patients
      (OBBP). Participants will be randomized to 1) treatment as usual (TAU) comprised of
      informational pamphlets and information for a 1800 quit line; and a prescription for a
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (i.e. nicotine replacement patches based on the quantity
      of baseline self-reported smoking, or nicotine replacement gum (2mg) #10, for 28 days which
      is offered routinely to all inpatients at Bellevue at the time of discharge) versus the
      SmokeFreeTXT intervention plus prescriptions for NRT.
