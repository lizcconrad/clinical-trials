        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent or progressive advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (no small cell
             component) NOTE: Pathology reports documenting the diagnosis of NSCLC are required to
             be reviewed to confirm outside diagnosis

          -  Treated with at least 1 and a maximum of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced
             NSCLC. NOTE:

               -  If the tumor is refractory (progressed) after a prior chemotherapy regimen, then
                  that regimen would count.

               -  If a prior chemotherapy regimen has been changed due to other reasons than
                  disease progression (e.g. poor tolerance, allergic reaction), then it would not
                  count as a separate prior regimen.

               -  A chemotherapy drug added for &quot;maintenance&quot; following disease stabilization or
                  response to a chemotherapy regimen (in the absence of prior disease progression)
                  does not count as a separate prior regimen.

               -  Chemotherapy as part of initial potentially curative therapy (given as part of
                  adjuvant or concomitant chemoradiotherapy) that was completed in &lt;1 year counts
                  as 1 prior regimen.

          -  Measureable disease by RECIST version 1.1 (appendix III)

          -  Post-menopausal defined as

               -  Age ≥ 55 years and 1 year or more of amenorrhea

               -  Age &lt; 55 years and 1 year or more of amenorrhea with an estradiol assay &lt; 20
                  pg/mL

               -  Surgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2 (appendix II)

          -  Adequate organ function within 14 days of study enrollment defined as

               -  Hematology:

                    1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm³, Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³,
                       Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

                    2. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 or prothrombin time (PT)/partial
                       thromboplastin time (PTT) within normal limits (WNL) of the institution

               -  Biochemistry:

                    1. Total Bilirubin within normal institutional limits

                    2. AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), except if there
                       is known hepatic metastasis, wherein transaminases may be ≤ 5 x
                       institutional ULN.

                    3. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl or glomerular filtration rate &gt; 50 ml/min

          -  Must have recovered to CTCAE grade 1 or better from the acute effects of any prior
             surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Chronic residual toxicity (i.e. peripheral
             neuropathy) is permitted

          -  A minimum time period must elapse between the end of a previous treatment and start of
             study therapy:

               -  3 weeks from the completion of radiation therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease
                  (2 weeks for brain metastases)

               -  4 weeks from the completion of chemotherapy or any experimental therapy

               -  4 weeks from prior major surgery (such as open biopsy or significant traumatic
                  injury)

               -  2 weeks from prior minor surgical procedures (such as chemotherapy infusion port
                  placement or core visceral organ biopsy)

          -  Tissue block or slides available from most recent resection or original diagnosis

          -  Voluntary written consent before any research related procedures or therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known active CNS disease - If patient has history of brain metastases, the brain
             lesions must have been treated with radiation and/or surgery and be stable on repeat
             imaging - patients should be neurologically stable and on a stable or tapering dose of
             corticosteroids

          -  Known diagnosis of osteoporosis

          -  Inability or unwilling to swallow study drug

          -  Any gastrointestinal condition causing malabsorption or obstruction (eg, celiac sprue,
             gastric bypass surgery, strictures, adhesions, history of small bowel resection, blind
             loop syndrome)

          -  Currently using hormone replacement therapy (oral or patch) or/and phytoestrogen
             supplements (i.e. black cohosh)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to exemestane or its excipients

          -  Any serious underlying medical condition that, in the opinion of the enrolling
             physician, would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment

          -  Prior malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated squamous cell or basal
             carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer, unless there is a 3-year
             disease-free interval

          -  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or St. John's wort as these may significantly reduce the
             availability of exemestane
