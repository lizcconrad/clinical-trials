      The purpose of this study is to compare the physical fitness performance—as measured by the
      Air Force Physical Fitness Test (PFT)—of subjects that, in conjunction with exercise, will
      take creatine supplementation over a four week period versus those that do not.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the physical fitness performance—as measured by the
      Air Force Physical Fitness Test (PFT)—of subjects that, in conjunction with exercise, will
      take creatine supplementation over a four week period versus those that do not. Based on the
      literature, there is evidence to support that creatine supplementation may increase available
      levels of muscle phosphocreatine (PCr), an important energy reservoir that is initially
      expended with intense muscular contraction and then regenerated during episodes of rest.
      While mechanistically plausible, the effects of creatine on the specific measures of the PFT
      (push-ups, sit-ups, 1.5 mile run, and abdominal circumference) have not been evaluated. The
      target population is Active Duty Air Force (ADAF) service members who perform perform the
      PFT. As such, this represents a population with occupational requirements to maintain their
      fitness at a designated level. If short-term creatine supplementation does help to improve
      PFT scores, trainers, commanders, and unit physicians may wish to consider recommending its
      use. While generally considered safe, additional data will also be collected to evaluate both
      the qualitative and quantitative side-effects of creatine supplementation over the study
      period. If the hypothesis is correct and creatine supplementation is shown to be both
      effective and safe, additional studies may be warranted to evaluate its impact on ADAF
      service members who have failed the PFT and/or are at risk of being separated from the AF for
      unsatisfactory fitness performance. In short, this study has the potential to dramatically
      affect the recommendations and practices of ADAF service members related to use of creatine
      supplementation.
