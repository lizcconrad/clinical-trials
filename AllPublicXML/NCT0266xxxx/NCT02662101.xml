  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic non-healing wounds considerably impact quality of life in affected patients and are a
      substantial burden on the Canadian health care system. Microbes colonizing a chronic wound
      play an important role in impeding effective healing. Chronic wounds are colonized by
      polymicrobial communities and no single organism can be seen as causal. Only a small fraction
      of wound bacteria are cultured by diagnostic tests and studies have shown little agreement
      between culture and molecular based approaches, therefore an effective diagnostic for wound
      microbes is required. It is know that the composition of the microbial community associated
      with a wound changes as it heals although the causal relationship is somewhat unclear.
      Although not very effective in treating chronic non-healing wounds, antibiotics are often
      administered, contributing to concerns of antibiotic resistance. The wound dressings produced
      by Exciton Technologies Inc. (ETI) effectively aid in the healing process in chronic wounds
      through unknown mechanisms. ETI's wound dressings contain a combination of silver salts with
      three different valence, +1, +2 and +3 that have antimicrobial activity and are effective in
      reducing biofilm formation in vitro. However, it is not known how these silver salts impact
      microbial ecology of the wound and the role this plays in wound healing. The objectives of
      this research are to develop a new diagnostic tool based on molecular characterization of
      wound sites so as to predict how to best treat wounds and to identify new microbes to be
      targeted by ETI's technology. This project will utilize molecular microbial ecology for the
      assessment and evaluation of topical silver interventions, gaining insight into the
      management of chronic infection. Substantiating the microbiota-modifying effectiveness of
      silver wound dressings towards increasing clinician and patient understanding to improving
      clinical outcomes.

          1. Signed or verbal informed consent

          2. &gt;17 yrs and &lt;70 yrs of age

          3. have a chronic wound (defined as &gt;6 weeks, non-healing), with or without clinical
             signs of infection.

          4. requires visitation or admittance to the clinic and subsequent visits for dressing
