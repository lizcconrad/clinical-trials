  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators looked at the effect that video instruction located at www.useinhalers.com
      would have on improving inhaler technique at a hospital in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The
      investigators compared this video instruction to written Spanish inhaler education. The
      investigators video taped participants before and after the intervention, and graded their
      technique on a pre-defined rubric.

    <description>These patients were video taped before they had any inhaler education using their own inhalers. They were then given online video education located at use-inhalers.com, and were asked to complete the education (took on average 5 minutes). They were then re-taped for their inhaler technique.</description>
