  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      27 subjects on SPT, each with at least two residual pockets ≥5mm, were recruited for this
      randomised, split-mouth controlled trial, providing a total of 72 sites. At baseline, probing
      pocket depth (PPD), recession, clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque and bleeding on
      probing (BOP) of all sites were examined. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were collected to
      determine level of cytokines IL-1β, -6, -8, TNF-α and MMP-8 via ELISA. Control sites received
      subgingival instrumentation and rubber cup polishing with pumice. In addition test sites
      received a single application of PDT using Fotosan® and photosensitizer consisting of
      toludine blue O solution. The subjects were recalled three and six months later and
      re-examined. Site level analysis was performed.
