  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial study to
      provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of a resistance exercise training program for
      maintaining white matter integrity and improving cognitive function in older adults with
      vascular cognitive impairment, compared with a stretch and relaxation program.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 88 adults diagnosed with vascular cognitive impairment will be randomized to
      either a 12-month twice-weekly resistance training program or stretch and relaxation program.
      There will be three measurement sessions: baseline, 6 months (midpoint of intervention
      period), and 12 months (end of intervention period).

    <description>The RT program will be a twice-weekly program. A pressurized air system and free weights will be used to provide the training stimulus. The pressurized air system exercises will consist of biceps curls, triceps extension, seated row, latissmus dorsi pull downs, leg press, hamstring curls, and calf raises. Other key strength exercises (with free weights) will include mini-squats, mini-lunges, and lunge walks. The intensity of the training stimulus will initially be at 50% to 60% of 1 repetition maximum (RM) as determined at week two, and progress to 75% to 85% of 1-RM at a work level of 6 to 8 repetitions (2 sets) by week four. The training stimulus will be increased using the 7 RM method, when 2 sets of 6-8 repetitions are completed with proper form.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study will specifically recruit individuals who fulfill the diagnostic criteria for
        SIVCI as outlined by Erkinjuntti and colleagues (1), which requires the presence of both
        cognitive syndrome (as defined in Section A below) and small vessel ischaemic disease (as
        defined in Section B below).

        A. Cognitive Syndrome defined as:

          1. Dysexecutive Syndrome: Some impairment in goal formulation, initiation, planning,
             organizing, sequencing, executing, set-shifting and maintenance, or abstracting.

          2. Memory Deficit: Some impairment in recall, relative intact recognition, less severe
             forgetting, benefit from cues.

          3. Progression: Deterioration of A1 and A2 from a previous higher level of functioning
             that are not per se interfering with complex occupational and social activities.

        B. Small Vessel Ischaemic Disease defined as:

          1. Evidence of relevant cerebrovascular disease by brain imaging (in the last 12 months)
             defined as the presence of both:

             i. Periventricular and deep white matter lesions: Patchy areas of low attenuation
             (intermediate density between that of normal white matter and that of intraventricular
             cerebro-spinal fluid) or diffuse symmetrical areas of low attenuation with ill defined
             margins extending to the centrum semiovale plus at least one lacunar infarct
             (correlating to the white matter grading scale greater than 3 from the Cardiovascular
             Health Study) (2,3); and ii. Absence of cortical and/or cortico-sub-cortical
             non-lacunar territorial infarcts and watershed infarcts, haemorrhages indicating large
             vessel disease, signs of normal pressure hydrocephalus, or other specific causes of
             white matter lesions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, leukodystrophies, sarcoidosis, brain
             irradiation, etc).

          2. Presence or a history of neurological signs as evidence for cerebrovascular disease
             such as hemiparesis, lower facial weakness, Babinski sign, sensory deficit,
             dysarthria, gait disorder, extrapyramidal signs consistent with sub-cortical brain
             lesion(s).

        In addition, individuals must meet the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (4) score less than 26 at screening;

          2. MMSE (5) score of &gt; 20 at screening;

          3. Community-dwelling;

          4. Lives in Metro Vancouver;

          5. Able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, and other trial procedures;

          6. Must be able to read, write, and speak English in which psychometric tests are
             provided with acceptable visual and auditory acuity;

          7. Stable on a fixed dose of cognitive medications (e.g., donepezil, galantamine,
             rivastigmine, memantine, etc.) that is not expected to change during the 12-month
             study period, or, if they are not on any of these medications, they are not expected
             to start them during the 12-month study period;

          8. Provide a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the
             individual (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent
             aspects of the trial. In addition, an assent form will be provided at baseline and
             again at regular intervals;

          9. Able to walk independently; and

         10. Must be in sufficient health to participate in study`s aerobic-based exercise training
             program. This will be based on medical history, vital signs, physical examination by
             study physicians, and written recommendation by family physician indicating
             individual`s appropriateness to participate in an aerobic-based exercise training
             program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Absence of relevant small vessel ischaemic lesions on an existing brain computed
             tomography (CT) or MRI;

          2. Diagnosed with another type of dementia (e.g., AD) or other neurological conditions
             (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, etc.) that affects cognition and
             mobility;

          3. Diagnosed previously with a genetic cause of SIVCI (e.g., CADASIL);

          4. At high risk for cardiac complications during exercise and/or unable to self-regulate
             activity or to understand recommended activity level (i.e., Class C of the American
             Heart Risk Stratification Criteria);

          5. Participating in regular RT in the last six months;

          6. Have clinically significant peripheral neuropathy or severe musculoskeletal or joint
             disease that impairs mobility;

          7. Taking medications that may negatively affect cognitive function, such as
             anticholinergics, including agents with pronounced anticholinergic properties (e.g.,
             amitriptyline), major tranquilizers (typical and atypical antipsychotics), and
             anticonvulsants (e.g., gabapentin, valproic acid, etc.); or

          8. Individual who plans to participate or is enrolled in a clinical drug trial concurrent
             to this study.

          9. Unable to meet the specific scanning requirements of the UBC 3T MRI Research Centre.

             nerves or bones, implanted infusion pump, history of any eye injury involving metal
             fragments, artificial heart valve, orthopedic hardware, other metallic prostheses,
             coil, catheter or filter in any blood vessel, ear or eye implant, bullets, or other
             metallic fragments.
