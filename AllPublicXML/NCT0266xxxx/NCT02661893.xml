  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of single- and multiple-dose of rifampin on
      the single-dose pharmacokinetics of JNJ-42847922 after oral administration to healthy male
      and female participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, fixed-sequence, single-center, multiple-dose study in 14 healthy
      adults. All participants will receive a single oral dose of 40 milligram (mg) JNJ-42847922 on
      3 separate occasions: Day 1 (JNJ-42847922 alone), Day 5 (JNJ-42847922 with a single dose of
      rifampin), and Day 12 (JNJ-42847922 in combination with steady-state rifampin). A daily dose
      of 600 mg (2 * 300 mg) rifampin will be administered from Day 5 through Day 12. Following
      JNJ-42847922 dosing, serial blood samples will be collected over 48 hours for the evaluation
      of plasma concentrations of JNJ-42847922 and its metabolites. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
