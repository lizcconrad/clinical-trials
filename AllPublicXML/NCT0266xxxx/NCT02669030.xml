  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression with ongoing insomnia is a common clinical presentation with patients. Clinical
      data suggests that patients with insomnia that receive concomitant treatment with a sleep aid
      experience a more robust antidepressant response along with a quicker response. The purpose
      of this clinical study is to compare the effectiveness of the FDA-approved insomnia
      medication suvorexant, also known as Belsomra®, as add-on treatment to an antidepressant to
      that of placebo plus antidepressant treatment in patients with depression and residual or
      ongoing insomnia.

      Many patients with depression suffer from residual insomnia. This study is a six week,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial to study suvorexant augmentation of
      continuing antidepressant therapy against placebo with continuing antidepressant therapy.
      Patient volunteers must be on a stable antidepressant treatment and will remain on this
      treatment for the duration of the study. Patient volunteers that qualify and enroll in the
      clinical trial will either receive suvorexant 10 mg/day and may have it adjusted to a dose of
      either 15 mg or 20 mg/day. Treatment is for a total of six weeks in addition to a clinical
      follow-up visit.
