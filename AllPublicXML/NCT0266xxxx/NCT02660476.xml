      QUDOS is a cross-sectional population study aiming to answer key questions about diabetes and
      its complications in Qatar as well as identify factors associated with the development and
      progression of diabetes complications.

      QUDOS aims to gain a better understanding of diabetes in primary and secondary care over a
      period of 24 months.

      A range of patients with diabetes will be sampled (including those with Type 1 diabetes as
      this group is under-studied in Qatar). This will be important in designing appropriate
      intervention plans that will improve diabetic patients' health conditions to prevent or delay
      the onset of complications and will provide a strong foundation for longitudinal study.

      The broad objectives of the study are:

      QUDOS 1: Aims to recruit 1,700 diabetic patients (including 200 with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (independent of healthcare setting)) attending the hospitals and primary care and to collect
      the following data:

        -  Demographics: age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic background, smoking status;

        -  Anthropometrics: vital signs, height, weight, body fat percentage, fat mass, neck and
           waist circumference;

        -  Medical History: medications, complications, comorbidities, latest HbA1c and lipid
           profiles and family medical history;

        -  Routine laboratory data;

        -  Lifestyle: diet, physical activity,;

        -  Sleep: quality and daytime sleepiness;

        -  Cognition and Mental Health: depression, anxiety, stress and memory;

        -  Diabetes microvascular complications: diabetic neuropathy, urine albumin/creatinine
           ratio; routine retinal screening data.

        -  Gut microbiome from a stool sample

      QUDOS 2: To further characterise 500 patients, from the total 1500 patients with T2DM
      recruited in QUDOS 1, who accept to continue with QUDOS 2 (a more detailed study and
      assessment).

      This phase aims to concentrate on the following aspects:

        -  Obstructive sleep apnoea;

        -  Sleep duration and quality;

        -  Diet;

        -  Objective physical activity;

        -  Stress;

        -  Quality of Life;

        -  Depression and anxiety;

        -  Perceived control of health;

        -  Detailed neuropathy screening;

        -  Cardiovascular function;

        -  Cognitive function;

        -  Biological samples.
