      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib or idelalisib works in treating patients with
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is
      persistent or has returned (relapsed) after donor stem cell transplant. Ibrutinib and
      idelalisib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve the outcomes of patients who have progressed or relapsed lymphoma or chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL)
      within 180 days following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) compared to
      historical data: 12-month overall survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety profile observed in these populations.

      II. Estimate the overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) by
      standard morphologic, flow cytometric, imaging, and molecular techniques.

      III. Assess progression free-survival.

      IV. Define incidences of grade III-IV toxicities and infections.

      V. Estimate incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality.

      VI. Estimate incidences of grade II-III and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
      chronic GVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 or idelalisib PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
