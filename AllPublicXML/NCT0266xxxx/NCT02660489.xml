  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a CRTH2 receptor antagonist, OC459,
      in preventing or attenuating the symptoms of an asthma exacerbation after rhinovirus
      infection. The study is a double blind, randomised trial in which half the subjects will
      receive OC459 and the other half placebo, before being inoculated with rhinovirus, that would
      normally induce a worsening of asthma symptoms i.e. an exacerbation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic respiratory disease, and in many countries prevalence is
      rising. The major morbidity, mortality and health care costs related to asthma are a result
      of periods of acutely increased symptomatology called 'exacerbations'. Most exacerbations are
      caused by rhinovirus, the virus associated with the common cold. There are few treatments to
      prevent and treat exacerbations, and despite these &gt;50% of adult asthmatics reported having
      an exacerbation in the last year. There is therefore a major unmet need.

      Experimentally infecting asthmatics with rhinovirus, a methodology that has been safely used
      for &gt;15 years, induces an asthma exacerbation in ~85%. This model offers the possibility to
      investigate treatment effects on asthma exacerbations with a small number of subjects,
      minimising the numbers exposed to a novel drug with limited safety data. In contrast, trials
      of therapies powered to evaluate an effect on naturally occurring exacerbations require
      several hundred subjects, a long study period to capture enough events, and are significantly
      more expensive to carry out.

      Using this model the investigators have shown that several inflammatory molecules, including
      prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), are significantly increased during rhinovirus-induced asthma
      exacerbations, with the levels of PGD2 strongly correlating with the severity of the
      symptoms. Moreover other studies have shown that when PGD2 binds the CRTH2 receptor, it
      stimulates the release of a number of inflammatory molecules also associated with asthma
      exacerbations. Blocking the CRTH2 receptor therefore appears an extremely promising target
      with potential to limit the virus-induced inflammation underpinning many asthma
      exacerbations.
