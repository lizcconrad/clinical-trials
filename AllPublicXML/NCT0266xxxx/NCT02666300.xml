      Postoperative Sore Throat (POST) is supposed to be the most frequently occurred respiratory
      complication related to endotracheal intubation .Whether the new type of ETT(TaperGuard ETT)
      to decrease or to increase the complications of general anesthesia compared with
      Cylindrical-shaped ETT is still unknown .In this study ,we will compare the different
      incidence of complications following general anesthesia between TaperGuard ETT and
      Cylindrical-shaped ETT under high endotracheal tube cuff pressure.

      BACKGROUND:Postoperative Sore Throat (POST) is supposed to be the most frequently occurred
      respiratory complication related to endotracheal intubation .Endotracheal tube size ,airway
      manipulation ,patients position et al. have been recognized as the factors affecting
      Postoperative Sore Throat .Controversy in respect of the relationship between the cuff design
      and POST is still existed. Whether the new type of ETT (TaperGuard ETT) to decrease or to
      increase the complications of general anesthesia compared with Cylindrical-shaped ETT is
      still unknown .In this study ,we will compare the different incidence of complications
      following general anesthesia between TaperGuard ETT and Cylindrical-shaped ETT under high
      endotracheal tube cuff pressure.

      METHODS:Patients undergoing elective non-throat and non-neck surgery were randomly allocated
      to receive either a TaperGuard ETT(group T) or Cylindrical-shaped ETT ( Group C).Patients
      received general anesthesia with different endotracheal tubes .Recoil of inflation syringe
      plunger was used to inflate the cuff. In the study , the cuff pressures of the endotracheal
      tube were recorded by a calibrated cuff manometer at two time: when the intubation was
      complited and before endotracheal tube was removed. The incidence and severity of
      Postoperative Sore Throat(POST),hoarseness, cough were collected by a single investigator
      blinded to the experiment at 0, 1,6, 12, and 24 hours post-operation.
