  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic insomnia may contribute to the development and exacerbation of heart failure (HF),
      incident mortality and contributes to common and disabling symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea,
      anxiety, depression, excessive daytime sleepiness, and pain) and decrements in objective and
      subjective functional performance.

      The purposes of the study are to evaluate the sustained effects of CBT-I on insomnia
      severity, sleep characteristics, daytime symptoms, and functional performance over twelve
      months among patients who have stable chronic HF and chronic insomnia. The effects of the
      treatment on outcomes of HF (hospitalization, death) and costs of the treatment will also be
      examined.

      A total of 200 participants will be randomized to 4 bi-weekly group sessions of cognitive
      behavioral therapy for CBT-I (behavioral was to improve insomnia and sleep) or HF
      self-management education.

      Participants will complete wrist actigraph (wrist-watch like accelerometer) measures of
      sleep, diaries, reaction time, and 6 minute walk test distance. They will also complete
      self-report measures of insomnia, sleep, symptoms, and functional performance. In addition
      the effects on symptoms and function over a period of one year.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 75% of HF patients, a group of about 5.1 million Americans who have poor function and
      high levels of morbidity and mortality, report poor sleep. As many as 25-56% of HF patients
      report chronic insomnia (difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or waking early in the
      morning, with non-restorative sleep that persists for at least a month). Chronic insomnia may
      contribute to the development and exacerbation of HF and incident mortality. It is also
      associated with common and disabling symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety, depression,
      excessive daytime sleepiness, and pain) and decrements in objective and subjective functional
      performance.However, insomnia is under-diagnosed and under-treated in this population.

      Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a multi-modal behavioral treatment
      focused on modifying beliefs and attitudes about sleep and is efficacious in many
      populations. The purposes of RCT are to evaluate the sustained effects of CBT-I, compared
      with HF self-management education (attention control), on insomnia severity, sleep
      characteristics, daytime symptoms, and functional performance over twelve months among
      patients who have stable chronic HF and chronic insomnia and receive evidence-based HF
      disease management. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CBT-I compared with the
      attention-control condition and explore the effects of CBT-I on event-free survival. We will
      address the following specific aims (*primary outcomes): (1) Test the sustained effects
      (baseline - 2 weeks, 6, 9, 12 months) of CBT-I provided in 4 group sessions over 8 weeks,
      compared with HF self-management education (attention control condition), on: (1a) *insomnia
      severity and self-reported and actigraph-recorded sleep characteristics (*sleep quality,
      *sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and duration); (1b) symptoms (*fatigue, anxiety,
      depression, pain, sleepiness, sleep-related impairment), and psychomotor vigilance (PVT); and
      (1c) symptom clusters [membership in clusters characterized by severity of specific symptoms;
      transition between clusters over time]; (2) Test the sustained effects of CBT-I on
      self-reported and objective functional performance; and (3) Examine the cost-effectiveness of
      CBT-I. Exploratory aim: We will explore the effects of CBT-I on event-free survival.

      A total of 200 patients will be randomized to 4 bi-weekly sessions of group CBT-I or an
      attention control condition consisting of HF self-management education. Wrist actigraph
      measures of sleep, diaries, psychomotor vigilance and 6 minute walk test distance, and
      self-report measures of insomnia, sleep, symptoms, and functional performance will be
      obtained at baseline and follow-up. Data analysis will consist of mixed effects models,
      latent transition analysis, stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis, and survival analysis.

    <measure>Insomnia Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia severity will be measured with the Insomnia Severity Index, a brief self-report instrument measuring patients' perception of their insomnia. The instrument includes 7 items assessing the severity of sleep onset and sleep maintenance difficulties, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeability of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and degree of distress or concern caused by the sleep problem. Each item is rated on a 0-4 scale (4 indicates greater severity) with a total score ranging from 0 to 28. Scores are categorized as not clinically significant, sub-threshold insomnia, moderate insomnia or severe insomnia.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency refers the ratio of time spent asleep to the amount of time spent in bed. Sleep efficiency will be subjectively measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, an instrument used to calculate self-reported sleep duration, sleep efficiency sleep latency, sleep disturbances, and global sleep quality. The 19 self-rated items are calculated to provide a global score ranging from 0-21, with &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty, and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulty in all areas. Sleep efficiency will also be objectively measured using actigraphy, a method of inferring sleep from the presence or absence of wrist movement. Participants will wear the Respironics Minimitter Actiwatch AW2, a wrist-worn actigraph, to elicit objective sleep efficiency for a two week period. Participants will also complete a daily diary (lights out/on, times/purpose of removal, hypnotic use) for use in interpretation of actigraphy data.</description>

    <description>Functional capacity will be objectively measured using the Six Minute Walk Test, which measures the distance that an individual can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes. The test is self-paced, and evaluates the global and integrated responses of all physiological systems involved during exercise. Participants choose their own intensity of exercise and are allowed to stop and rest during the test. Results are reported as an absolute value (distance walked), and interpreted according to change in functional capacity over time.</description>

    <description>Sleep efficiency refers the ratio of time spent asleep to the amount of time spent in bed. Sleep efficiency will be subjectively measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, an instrument used to calculate self-reported sleep duration, sleep efficiency sleep latency, sleep disturbances, and global sleep quality. The 19 self-rated items are calculated to provide a global score ranging from 0-21, with &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty, and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulty in all areas. Sleep efficiency will also be objectively measured using actigraphy, a method of inferring sleep from the presence or absence of wrist movement. Participants will wear the Respironics Minimitter Actiwatch AW2, a wrist-worn actigraph, to elicit objective sleep efficiency for a two week period. Participants will also complete a daily diary (lights out/on, times/purpose of removal, hypnotic use) for use in interpretation of actigraphy data.</description>
