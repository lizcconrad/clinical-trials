      This study evaluates the short and long term effect of dental cleaning and mouthrinsing for
      the treatment of bad breath
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of bad breath producing bacteria can be found in pockets around the gums and the
      top of the tongue. It is generally agreed that one of the most effective means of controlling
      the production of bad breath gases from these bacteria is their mechanical removal. Tongue
      cleaning has shown consistent results in the reduction of bad breath, while dental cleaning
      has shown positive, but less conclusive results. The addition of a mouth rinse to mechanical
      measures has shown medium-term effectiveness, however there is currently no information
      available that describes the long-term impact of mechanical and chemical measures for the
      treatment of bad breath and the appropriate interval for follow-up and on-going management to
      prevent difficult cases.
