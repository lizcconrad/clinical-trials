      The aim of this study is to assess the prevention of incision healing complications in
      patients undergoing revision TKA and THA treated with either Single-Use NPWT (PICO) compared
      to standard of care dressings (AQUACEL Ag Surgical Dressing). All patients undergoing a
      revision TKA and THA who consent to taking part in the study, and meet the eligibility
      criteria will be included onto the study. Patients will be followed up for a period of up to
      3 months to determine if there are any latent incision healing complications
