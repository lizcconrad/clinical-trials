      Multicentre, open, randomised, and controlled trial conducted in patients diagnosed with
      acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.The objective of
      GRAFT-trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with ACLF. All patients will receive standard
      medical care for ACLF according to the guidelines. Patients in the experimental arm
      additional receive subcutaneous injections of G-CSF.

    <textblock>
      The acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is characterised by a severe deterioration of liver
      function due to a precipitating event on top of an underlying chronic liver disease. As
      therapeutic options are limited the mortality rate lies between 40 and 80% at 3 months. The
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized stem- as well as immune cells and
      improved liver function in preclinical trials. G-CSF treatment reduced the rate of infectious
      complications and significantly improved patients´ survival in acute on chronic liver
      failure, shown recently in small randomised studies. Thus, G-CSF is a promising treatment
      option that needs to be evaluated in a multi-centre controlled trial. The GRAFT trial will
      randomise patients with ACLF between standard of care with and without G-CSF. All
      participants will be followed for 12 months in order to evaluate safety and efficacy of
      G-CSF. If successful, the GRAFT trial has the potential to change clinical practice in acute
      on chronic liver failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) according to the consensus criteria recently
