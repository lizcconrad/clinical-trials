  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to explore feasibility of testis functionality
      assessment and testis imaging obtained from Positron Emissions Tomography (PET) /Magnetic
      Resonance Imagine (MRI). Using advanced MRI metrics, investigators will study the
      three-dimensional structure of normal testis, the levels of specific elements and compounds
      in the tissues (which can only be found via these imaging techniques), and the directionality
      (and alterations in directionality) of tissue structure. Investigators hope to develop
      hypothesis that will in turn suggest bio-markers to be explored in subsequent clinical
      trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with proven paternity desiring vasectomy who are over 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bilaterally absent testes, unilaterally or bilaterally undescended testes

          -  Patients who have proven azoospermia or no proven paternity

          -  Inability to tolerate MRI including conditions such as claustrophobia or inability to
             lay flat for &gt; 45 minutes.

          -  Presence of pacemaker/IImplantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) or perfusion pumps

          -  Ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial
             heart, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, bullets, tattoos near the
             eye, or steel implants.

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with
             the patient's participation in the study

          -  All women are excluded as such patients do not have the relevant anatomy being
             considered in this study

          -  Anyone from a vulnerable population will be excluded from the study
