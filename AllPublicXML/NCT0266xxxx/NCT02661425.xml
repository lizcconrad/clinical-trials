  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study designed to gather outcomes data from existing medical charts
      from patients who have taken EnteraGam for management of their IBS-D for at least eight
      weeks. Data from two study periods will be collected: (1) the time during which the Standard
      of Care (SOC) therapy (i.e., prescribed or over-the-counter as well as FDA-approved or
      non-approved agents) that is used immediately prior to prescribing EnteraGam; and (2) the
      time during which EnteraGam is used as therapy.

      -  The first collection of information (Visit 1 - Chart Report Form) will be for the visit
           at which the SOC therapy, utilized immediately before the introduction of EnteraGam, was
           initiated. This data point will serve as the baseline for that SOC therapy.

        -  The second collection of information (Visit 2 - Chart Report Form) will be for the visit
           at which the original prescription for EnteraGam was written and the patient was
           instructed to begin the therapy. Captured data will consist of information contained in
           the patient's chart for a minimum of eight weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks prior to
           initiation of EnteraGam therapy. This data point will serve as the baseline for
           initiation of EnteraGam therapy.

        -  The third collection point (Visit 3 - Chart Report Form) will be at the next patient
           visit to the clinic - provided that visit is a minimum of eight weeks following
           initiation of EnteraGam therapy.
