      The present study was conducted to find out whether the bioavailability of 0.25 mg
      pramipexole tablets produced by PT Dexa Medica for PT Ferron Par Pharmaceuticals was
      equivalent to the reference drug (Sifrol速 tablet 0.25 mg, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &amp;
      Co. KG, Germany for Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Germany).

      This was a randomized, open label, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study under fasting
      condition. The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast and in the next
      morning were given orally one tablet of the test drug (Pramipexole 0.25 mg produced by PT
      Dexa Medica for PT Ferron Par Pharmaceuticals) or one tablet of the reference drug (Sifrol速
      0.25 mg, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany for Boehringer Ingelheim
      International GmbH, Germany).

      Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), at 20, 40 minutes, and
      1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours after drug administration. Seven
      days after the first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated using
      the alternate drug. The plasma concentrations of pramipexole were determined by validated
      ultra performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detector (UPLC-MS/MS).
