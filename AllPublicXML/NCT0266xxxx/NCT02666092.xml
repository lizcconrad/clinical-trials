  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anisakidae frequently infect fish species that are commonly eaten by humans. Some of them are
      recognized as zoonotic diseases agents, and have a high impact on human health.

      Infestation results from the ingestion of living larvae from contaminated fishes. It can be
      asymptomatic or symptomatic, resulting in acute gastric, acute intestinal or chronic forms.
      Allergic manifestations are frequently encountered in gastric forms, but allergic symptoms
      can also occur in isolation, after ingestion of Anisakidae antigens contained in raw or
      cooked fish, and may masquerade as fish allergy.

      In this study, we aim to characterize the relationship between Anisakidae and/or fish
      sensitization and the presence of allergic manifestations in patients recruited in the
      general population and presenting fish allergy resulting from ingestion, cutaneous or
      respiratory contact. We will also determine the respective role of Anisakidae or fish
      sensitization in patients with fish allergy. Then, we will determine the prevalence of
      previous Anisakidae infections among these patients and a matched control population. We will
      also compare the performances of serological tests (ImmunoCAP, immunoelectrophoresis and
      Western Blot) for the diagnosis of Anisakidae allergy or infection. Lastly, we will explore
      the relationship between domestic exposure to Anisakidae or fish antigens and the occurrence
      of associated pathologies (Anisakidae or fish allergy/sensitization; Anisakidae infection).

      First, 51 patients with fish allergy will be recruited from the Parasitology-Mycology and
      Immunology Laboratories of Lille University Hospital databases (serology for anti-Anisakis or
      anti-fish detection). Then, clinical (characteristics of allergic manifestations) and
      epidemiological (domestic exposure to fish) data will be collected, and anti-fish or
      Anti-Anisakis antibodies will be detected using ImmunoCAP (IgE), or ImmunoCAP,
      immunoelectrophoresis, Western Blot, respectively. Similar serological tests will be
      performed for a control group of 51 matched subjects who will be recruited among Lille
      University Hospital workers.
