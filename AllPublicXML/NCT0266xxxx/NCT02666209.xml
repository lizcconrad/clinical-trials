      Participant that has been diagnosed with Relapsed/ Refractory Multiple Myeloma and are
      currently participating in a clinical trial which is closing. This research study is studying
      Ulocuplumab as a possible treatment. It's an expanded access from NCT01359657

    <textblock>
      This research study is an Expanded Access Trial, which is a way to provide an investigational
      therapy to individuals who are not eligible to receive that therapy in a clinical trial, but
      have a serious or life-threatening illness for which other treatments are not available.

      The purpose of this expanded access program is to treat participants diagnosed with relapsed
      or refractory multiple myeloma with an investigational drug called ulocuplumab.

      Participants enrolled in the program will receive ulocuplumab with lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone or ulocuplumab with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Ulocuplumab is supposed to
      kill myeloma cells.

      Lenalidomide, which is also known as Revlimid® and Bortezomib, which is also known as
      Velcade®, are approved by the FDA for treatment of Multiple Myeloma. Dexamethasone, also
      known as Decadron®, is also approved by the FDA for other treatments. It is a type of steroid
      medication that fights inflammation.
