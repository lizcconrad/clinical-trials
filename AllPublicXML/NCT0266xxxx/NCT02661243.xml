    <textblock>
      Until now it has not been investigated whether placement of implants in SS patients is less
      successful than compared to non-SS patients. The risk factors and the efficacy of dental
      implants in dry mouth patients are not known because of the lack of scientific evidence. The
      aim of this study is to investigate changes in marginal peri-implant bone loss and the
      clinical performance of dental implants in SS patients compared to implants in healthy
      patients.

      Rationale: Until now it has not been investigated whether placement of implants in SS
      patients is less successful than compared to non-SS patients. The risk factors and the
      efficacy of dental implants in dry mouth patients are not known because of the lack of
      scientific evidence.

      Objective: to investigate changes in marginal peri-implant bone loss and the clinical
      performance of dental implants in SS patients compared to implants in healthy patients.

      Study design: A prospective multicenter clinical trial.

      Study population: N = 120

      Intervention: All patients receive Biohorizons Laser-lok bonelevel implants to replace the
      missing (pre)molars or to support a full denture in the upper and lower jaw .

      This study is comprised of four study groups:

        -  30 human adults affected by SS with the need of replacement of missing premolars or
           molars in the upper or lower jaw.

        -  30 healthy human adults with the need of replacement of missing premolars or molars in
           the upper or lower jaw.

        -  30 human edentulous adults affected by SS with the need of stabilization of the
           dentures.

        -  30 healthy human edentulous adults with the need of stabilization of the dentures.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: changes in marginal peri-implant bone loss of dental
      implants between the healthy and SS groups and differences in clinical performance 1.5 years
      after finalization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria (dentate group, Sjögren):

          -  The patient is at least 18 years and younger than 70;

          -  A diagnosed (by the AECG guidelines; see attachment; Vitali et al., 2002) primary or
             secondary Syndrome of Sjögren;

          -  The missing or lost tooth/teeth are premolars and/or molars in the upper or lower jaw.

          -  Sufficient healthy and vital bone to insert a dental implant with a minimum length of
             8 mm and at least 3.8 mm in diameter. In case of insufficient bone volume, a bone
             augmentation procedure will be performed with autologue bone. If necessary the
             autologue bone can be mixed with artificial bone (artificial bone graft substitutes in
             combination with a membrane).

          -  The implant site must be free from infection;

          -  Adequate oral hygiene (modified plaque index and modified sulcus bleeding index ≤ 1)
             (Mombelli et al., 1987; Loe and Silness, 1963)

          -  Sufficient mesio-distal, bucco-lingual, and interocclusal space for placement of an
             anatomic restoration;

          -  The patient is capable of understanding and giving informed consent.

        Inclusion criteria (edentulous group, Sjögren):

          -  The patient is at least 18 years and younger than 70;

          -  A diagnosed (by the AECG guidelines; Vitali et al., 2002) primary or secondary

             edentulous for 1 year.

          -  Problems with conventional denture retention, stability and/or adaptation, which could
             be solved by an implant, supported denture (lower or/and upper jaw).

          -  Sufficient healthy and vital bone to insert dental implants with a minimum length of 8
             mm and at least 3.8 mm in diameter. In case of insufficient bone volume, a bone
             augmentation procedure will be performed with autologue bone. If necessary the
             autologue bone can be mixed with artificial bone (artificial bone graft substitutes in
             combination with a membrane).

          -  The implant site must be free from infection;

          -  Capable of performing adequate oral hygiene;

          -  The patient is capable of understanding and giving informed consent.

          -  A history of radiotherapy to the head and neck region;

          -  Use of intravenous bisphosphonates or the use of oral bisphosphonates for more than 5
