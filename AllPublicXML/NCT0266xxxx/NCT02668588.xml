  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial to assess the effect
      of LF-PB on seroma formation in women with breast cancer undergoing Axillary Lymph Node
      Dissection (ALND).

      Recruited patients will be randomly assigned to receive LF-PB 30 mg or placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will randomize between 24 and 72 subjects that received an ALND. A staged adaptive
      design is employed with two intermediate analyses and a final analysis. The first interim
      analysis at 24 treated subjects (at least 12 in each group) and the second at 48 treated
      subjects (at least 24 in each group).

    <description>Subjects will undergo an echography at the operated axilla at every scheduled visit till Day 28 or until seroma resolution, whichever occurs first. In case of seroma presence the investigator will decide if an aspiration is required; the decision will be based on the clinical investigator's evaluation.
In case of aspiration, the subject with seroma will be considered amenable for the statistical analysis of seroma incidence.</description>

          -  ECOG PS ≤ 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous axillary surgery on the same armpit (sentinel lymph node surgery is not
             exclusionary);

          -  Previous radiotherapy within five years from study drug administration on the same
             armpit undergoing surgery in this study;

          -  Concomitant participation to other clinical trial;

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes;

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B or C by screening serology;

          -  Uncontrolled hypothyroidism: if patient is being administered Eutirox/ Levothyroxine
             (or analogues) and levels of T3, T4 and TSH are confirmed to be within the normal
             ranges at screening, the patient can be enrolled in this study;

          -  Pregnant or lactating;

          -  Ascertained or presumptive hypersensitivity to the active principle and/or the
             ingredients of the study drug formulation;

          -  Corrected QT (using the Bazett formula, QTc) interval at screening or baseline &gt; 450
             msec (as the mean of 3 consecutive readings 5 minutes apart);

          -  Presence of any disease or use of concomitant medication known to increase the QT
             interval;

          -  Clinically significant or relevant abnormal medical history, vital sign, physical
             examination or laboratory evaluation finding;

          -  Corticosteroid treatment on a long-term basis (i.e. treatment for more than 3
             consecutive days);

          -  Current or recurrent disease that could affect the results of the clinical or
             laboratory assessment required for the study.
