      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Pasireotide Long Acting Release
      (LAR) alone and in combination with weekly Pegvisomant (PEGV) in acromegaIy patients
      previously controlled with combination treatment of long-acting Somatostatin analogs
      (LA-SSAs) and PEGV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pasireotide Long Acting Release (Signifor ®), a novel long-acting multi-receptor ligand
      somatostatin analogue, has been shown to be more effective for the treatment of GH-secreting
      pituitary adenomas than currently used long-acting somatostatin analogues (LA-SSAs). The
      long-term efficacy of acromegaly patients using LA-SSAs in combination with PEGV was over 90%
      in terms of normalization of IGF-I. The combination of PEGV with pasireotide LAR has not been
      studied yet. Combining PEGV with pasireotide LAR could result in a lower dose and less
      injections of pegvisomant. This may ultimately lead to a more cost-effective treatment and
      improved quality of life.

    <description>After enrollment, acromegaly patients on combination treatment will half their regular weekly dose of pegvisomant (PEGV) for 12 weeks (run-in period).
When insuline-like growth factor 1 (IGF‐I) remains within the age adjusted normal limits after 12 weeks, PEGV and the LA-SSA (Octreotide Long Acting Release (LAR) or Lanreotide Autogel) with Pegvisomant (PEGV) are discontinued and patients are switched to pasireotide LAR 60 mg for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>When IGF-I rises above the adjusted normal limits after 12 weeks (run-in period), these subjects will switch their LA-SSA to Pasireotide LAR 60 mg every 4 weeks and continue with the reduced PEGV dose of the run-in period, for the remaining 12 weeks.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Between week 12 and 24 dose adaptations of PEGV are not permitted unless IGF-I drops below the age adjusted normal limits, then the dose of PEGV will be decreased stepwise with 20 mg weekly until IGF-I is within the age adjusted normal limits.
At week 24, efficacy will be assessed, as the number of patients with a normal IGF-I in the two different groups; the combination Pasireotide LAR 60 mg / PEG V dose and monotherapy Pasireotide LAR 60 mg.
From week 24 patients will continue with Pasireotide LAR 60 mg monotherapy, or Pasireotide LAR will be combined with 50% of the original dose of PEGV, or with an increasing dose of PEGV every 8 weeks depending on the treatment arm.</description>

             that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardize the subject's safety or
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objective(s)
             of the study.

          -  renal insufficiency, clearance &lt; 50ml/min
