  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, counterbalanced crossover design, in which 14 male subjects will
      complete two experimental trials. Each trial will be separated by a minimum of at least 12
      days (range: 12-30 days). The study aims to investigate the effects of low glycogen
      availability on skeletal muscle molecular response after a concurrent exercise day.

    <textblock>
      Two experimental exercise trials; a low carbohydrate (= LOW) and a high carbohydrate (= HIGH)
      trial. During both experimental days subjects will complete an continues submaximal cycling
      bout in the morning followed by a resistance exercise session in the early afternoon. During
      the LOW trial subjects will receive a low carbohydrate mixed meal, during the HIGH trial
      subjects will be provided with a high carbohydrate meal. In addition, on both experimental
      days subjects will receive adequate protein beverages. Lastly, protein will be provided post
      resistance exercise.
