    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of DS-5141b in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
      amenable to exon 45 skipping and to determine the dosage for subsequent studies.

    <description>DS-5141b, Subcutaneous injection
Part 1: DS-5141b will be injected subcutaneously once a week for 2 weeks at the following dose levels. Dose escalation will be performed. DS-5141b will be administered at dose levels 1 and 3 in Cohort 1 and at dose levels 2 and 4 in Cohort 2.
Level 1: 0.1 mg/kg
Level 2: 0.5 mg/kg
Level 3: 2.0 mg/kg
Level 4: 6.0 mg/kg
Part 2: Two doses of DS-5141b will be selected based on the results obtained in Part 1. Each selected dose will be administered subcutaneously once a week for 12 weeks.
Part 2-Extension: Two doses, 2.0 mg/kg or 6.0 mg/kg, of DS-5141b will be administered subcutaneously once a week for 48 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmation of out-of-frame deletion(s) that could be corrected by dystrophin gene
             exon 45 skipping.

          -  Intact muscles of adequate quality for biopsy to allow evaluation of the efficacy of
             the study drug.

          -  Boys aged from 5 years to &lt;11 years.

             6 months prior to enrollment in this study with no dose changes for at least 3 months
             prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A genetic mutation that can not be expected the expression of dystrophin protein by
             dystrophin gene exon 45 skipping.
