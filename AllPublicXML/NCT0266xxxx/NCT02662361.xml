      Objective: To investigate the patient-related risk factors for peri-implant disease in
      partially edentulous patients rehabilitated with implants supported crown or bridge so as to
      provide evidence for clinical prevention and control. Methods:A total of 131 patients will
      enroll in the study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is used to
      determine the patient factors associated with peri-implant disease. The variables include
      age, gender, smoking and alcohol consumption, presence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
      osteoporosis, bruxism, bleeding upon brushing, reason for extraction, oral hygiene and
      periodontal status.
