  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of an exercise and health education/auditory rehabilitation
      and socialization intervention on functional fitness, hearing handicap and psychosocial
      distress measures in older adults with hearing loss.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss is associated with functional fitness declines and increased risk for isolation,
      dementia, depression, falls, hospitalization and premature mortality. No studies have
      determined the effect of an exercise intervention on these measures in older adults with
      hearing loss.

      After baseline assessment of function fitness and several psychosocial measures, 60 older
      adults with hearing loss will be randomized into a 10 week exercise, health education,
      socialization and auditory rehabilitation program or auditory rehabilitation alone. The
      exercise program consists of 3/4 of an hour strengthening and resistance training followed by
      30 minutes of group walking. The educational session content is determined by participants
      and is interactive and may include such topics as wills and probate, diabetes treatment,
      healthy exercise etc. The 3/4 of an hour auditory rehabilitation sessions are modified from
      an online program and will include interactive sessions on education about hearing and
      hearing devices/technologies, psychosocial support and enhancing communication skills.

      At the end of the 10 week intervention the assessments of functional fitness and psychosocial
      measures will be repeated. The group that was randomized to the auditory rehabilitation alone
      will then be offered the exercise program.
