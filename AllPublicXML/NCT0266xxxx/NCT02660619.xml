      The purpose is to validate the PRISM-5-Op as a measurement of prescription opioid substance
      use disorder.

      &quot;Based on a review of the literature, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that
      more data are needed regarding the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose, and
      death associated with the long-term use of extended release/long acting (ER/LA) opioid
      analgesics. Thus, the FDA is requiring that ER/LA opioid analgesic drug sponsors conduct
      post-marketing studies to assess these risks. The present study, PMR Study #2065-2, focuses
      on addiction, and addresses the FDA requirement to conduct a validation study of the measure
      of addiction that will be used in PMR Study #2065-1.

      The primary objective for Study 2b is to validate PRISM-5-Op measures of DSM-5 prescription
      opioid SUD/addiction in patients who have, or have had, a prescription for opioids for at
      least 30 days to treat chronic pain&quot;

    <description>PRISM-5-Op diagnoses of DSM-5 SUD/addiction to prescription opioids. These diagnoses will be in two forms: unadjusted, meaning that the criteria will be rated positive if present without regard to the intent of the behavior, and adjusted, i.e., that criteria will be rated positive only if structured evaluation indicates that they represent addiction indicators (non-therapeutic intent) rather than treatment of pain (therapeutic intent).</description>

        Patients will be recruited from low-risk and high-risk treatment settings in the greater
        New York City metropolitan area, which includes the five boroughs of the city and Long
        Island. Thus, the population will be a mix of urban and suburban participants.
