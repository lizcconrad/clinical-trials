  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to test the effectiveness of two arms of an intervention that use
      videoconference technology for distance caregivers of patients with advanced cancer. The
      study is significant because the intervention will promote involvement of caregivers of
      patients with cancer and makes a compelling case for significance based on changing
      demographics and lifestyles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this randomized clinical trial is to compare outcomes (anxiety, distress,
      depression, health status) for distant care givers (DCGs) of patients with advanced cancer
      who are randomly assigned to either the full intervention arm (Closer), the video-only
      intervention arm (Video-C Only) or the control group (Web-Only). the goal is to determine
      which is most efficacious in improving outcomes over time for these caregivers. In addition,
      this study will examine the indirect effects of each arm of the intervention on DCG outcomes
      over time as well as explore the nature of relationships between patient and DCG distress,
      anxiety and depression over time.

      The specific research questions include:

        1. Is there a difference in DCG outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status)
           over time between caregivers in the Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only groups,
           controlling for DCG demographic variables?

        2. Are there significant indirect effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only on DCG
           outcomes (anxiety, distress, depression, health status) over time, controlling for DCG
           demographic variables?

        3. Are there significant relationships between DCG distress, anxiety, depression and health
           status and patient distress, anxiety and depression over time?

    <description>Compare the direct effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only on anxiety over time, controlling for DCG demographic variables. Anxiety will be measured using the 8-iten tool from the Patient Reported Outcomes measurement Information System (PROMIS). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the direct effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only on distress over time, controlling for DCG demographic variables. Distress is conceptually defined as a negative state in which coping and adaptation processes fail to return the individual to physiological and/or psychological homeostasis. It will be measured using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) distress thermometer - a clinical tool currently utilized with the cancer population.</description>

    <description>Compare the direct effects of Closer, Video-C Only, and Web-Only on health status over time, controlling for DCG demographic variables. Health status will be measured using a single item general self-rated health question (GSRH) from the Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the change of caregiver burden between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in DCG outcomes indirectly through effects upon caregiver burden, when Closer arm is compared to Video-C and Web-Only. Care giver burden is conceptually defined as a caregiver's subjective belief that resources are insufficient to meet role demands; it will be operationally defined using Zarit's Burden interview-short form (SF) where higher scores indicate a greater sense of burden.</description>

    <description>The full intervention (Closer) is a tested intervention that uses videoconferencing technology (WebEx) for delivery and delivers the highest dose of the intervention. This arm of the intervention will deliver personalized information to the DCG (aimed at enhancing self-efficacy) and emotional support via nurse coaching as well as the opportunity for the DCG to talk with the oncologist and patient in &quot;real time&quot; during a minimum of four patient-oncologist office visits over a 4-month period (at least once/month). For patients who have more than one oncologist-patient meeting/month, the study will use the videoconference technology to allow the DCG to join as many of the join in as many of the oncologist-patient office visits as desired.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Video-C Only</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm will involve the delivery of information solely via the use of videoconference technology during the patient-oncologist-DCG visit. There is always the possibility that the DCG will receive emotional support from the oncologist during the office visit (as would potentially occur during a face-to-face meeting) - but this will not be &quot;delivered&quot; systematically as in the Closer intervention. As with the Closer intervention, the DCG will be able to participate in the patient-oncologist visit in &quot;real time&quot; during a minimum of four office visits over the 4-month study period (total dose ~5 hours). The procedure for these meetings will be the same as outlined for Closer but will not involve having the nurse involved in the videoconference sessions with the oncologist, patient, and DCG.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Web-Only</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group will be provided access to a website that will provide the following major links: a) Caregiving Resources (links to National Family Caregiver Association,&quot; etc.), b)Resources for DCGs (links to the Caregiving from a Distance,&quot; etc.), c) Cancer Information (links to National Cancer Institute, etc.). DCGs will be told that the study team will track usage of the website in order to assess which areas of the website are used most frequently. Any questions or concerns regarding use of the website can be sent online to the study's technical site, and the support staff will respond within 24 hours. As is current practice, DCGs can call an oncology nurse or oncologist to ask specific questions. Web-Only will deliver the lowest dose of the intervention.</description>
