      The purpose of this prospective open labeled randomized study was to compare the
      &quot;laryngoscopic glottis view&quot; as well as &quot;ease of intubation&quot; between the two blades in
      routine intubations in non-difficult airways.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and fifty patients with predicted non difficult airway were randomly assigned
      into two groups. After induction of anaesthesia laryngoscopy was performed with respective
      blades and trachea intubated. Parameters monitored were: glottis view obtained during
      laryngoscopy (Cormack Lehane grade), ease of intubation, intubation attempts, total duration
      of laryngoscopy in seconds and encountered complications.

    <description>An intubation attempt is defined as &quot;intubation activities occurring during a single continuous laryngoscopy maneuver&quot;. Thus, even if several attempts were made to place an endotracheal tube during the course of a single laryngoscopy, this would be counted as a single intubation attempt.</description>

    <description>The duration of intubation was defined as the time taken from placement of the laryngoscope in the mouth to the time taken to remove the laryngoscope from the mouth following intubation.</description>
