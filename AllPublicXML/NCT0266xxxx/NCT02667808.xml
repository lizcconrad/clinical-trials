      The aim of this study is to identify reproductive health priorities among individuals living
      with HIV.This study also seeks to explore factors that influence fertility, family planning,
      and sexual behavior among individuals with HIV who are receiving antiretroviral therapy
      (ART).

      This is a mixed method study in which subjects will participate in focused group discussions
      and complete a questionnaire. Discussions will be 1-2 hours in length aimed to evaluate
      fertility intentions, family planning, and sexual health behaviors. Data collected from the
      focus groups will be analyzed for common themes to generate questionnaires to assess
      reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and practices related to family planning, and
      fertility and sexual health among persons living with HIV.
