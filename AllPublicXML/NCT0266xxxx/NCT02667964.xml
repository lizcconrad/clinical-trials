    <textblock>
      FGF-21 and insulin are key hormones in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Furthermore,
      both hormones are influenced by physical activity. The following hypothesis will be tested:
      FGF-21 is regulated insulin-dependent during exercise.

      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by rising global
      importance. In Germany alone, more than seven million people are being treated currently.
      T2DM is characterized by permanently elevated blood glucose levels, based on insulin
      resistance and followed by associated beta cell failure. In our previous work the
      investigators could already shown that increased FGF-21 levels are accompanied by an
      increased risk of T2DM. Physical activity is essential in the treatment and the prevention of
      T2DM. Interestingly, it was shown that acute physical exercise was leading to decreased
      insulin levels and increased FGF-21 values. In this study the effects of acute physical
      activity on FGF-21 values should be investigated in 3 groups: a) Healthy volunteers b)
      persons with T2DM c) persons with T1DM.
