  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will capitalize on the early predictive information stored in an
      individual's genetic risk for Parkinson Disease (PD) in combination with the subtle features
      of tremors that can be extracted from movement data gathered by modern compact accelerometers
      in order to determine if accurate discrimination of essential tremor (ET) from PD can be
      achieved. Both of these technologies have a proven but somewhat limited ability to inform
      diagnosis of PD or differentiation of PD from ET - especially at early stages of the disease.
      The investigators hypothesize that a combination of prior genetic risk and current disease
      symptomology can synergize for accurate and early discrimination of PD from ET and ultimately
      inform a cost effective approach to movement disorder diagnosis.

      In this study, the investigators will collect blood from individuals with confirmed
      late-onset diagnosis of PD and ET. Gold standard diagnosis status will be determined via the
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) - the accepted clinical gold standard for
      Parkinson's Disease diagnosis. DNA will be extracted from blood samples to characterize the
      genetic risk of individuals for PD via proven genetic risk models. In addition, participants
      will wear a wristwatch-like accelerometer device that will track their movements (tremors) at
      high temporal resolution and transmit movement data via a smartphone. Cognitive distraction
      tasks will be administered via mobile phones while simultaneously collecting movement data.
      Predictive tremor features will be extracted from movement data via signal processing
      approaches - e.g. discrete wavelet transformation. A final predictive model combining
      movement tracking information and genetic information will be designed in attempt to
      distinguish PD from ET individuals.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is the generation of genomic information that may inform the diagnosis and/or treatment of movement disorders. The endpoint will be derived from the successful implementation of genomic assays, appropriate bioinformatic and statistical analysis of the genomic data generated by those assays. These analyses and report generation activity may be based on comparison of the genomic profile of a patient with data obtained from other such studies or publicly available data in addition to comparison between datasets generated within this study.</description>
