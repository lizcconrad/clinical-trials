  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial consists of a series of parallel multi-centre single arm phase II trial arms, each
      testing an experimental targeted drug in a population stratified by multiple pre-specified
      actionable target putative biomarkers. The primary objective is to evaluate whether there is
      a signal of activity in each drug-(putative)biomarker cohort separately. A Bayesian adaptive
      design is adopted to achieve this objective and statistical details are given in the
      Protocol.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is primarily an enrichment putative biomarker design, including patients who are
      positive for at least one of the actionable targets included in the trial. Patients who are
      positive for just one putative biomarker will receive the experimental targeted drug specific
      for that putative biomarker. Putative biomarkers within each drug cohort have been chosen
      such that in the majority of cases it is not expected that patients will be positive for two
      or more putative biomarkers within the same drug. In the rare situation that patients are
      positive for two or more putative biomarkers relevant across different drugs, treatment will
      be allocated in accordance with the following strategy:

        -  All amplifications and rearrangements will be treated with targeted agent appropriate to
           them irrespective of concomitant mutations. This will yield crucial predictive biomarker
           information.

        -  For concomitant mutations decisions will be made by the Chief Investigator on a
           case-by-case basis and based on close consideration of pathway preference and likely
           dominance of one signal pathway over another together with any pre-clinical efficacy
           studies that address the activity of the drugs in the presence of concomitant mutations.
           A trumping strategy has been devised for this purpose.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have completed all standard of care therapy that the treating oncologist
             thinks is appropriate. As a minimum patients must have failed one or more lines of
             treatment (either radiological documentation of disease progression or due to
             toxicity).

          -  Patients who have progressed after surgical resection and adjuvant therapy will be
             eligible for entry without the need for the administration of first line metastatic
             therapy, if they have progressed within 6 months of completing their adjuvant
             treatment.

          -  Patients will also be eligible without the necessity for first line regimen if they
             have relapsed within 6 months of completion of definitive chemoradiation.

          -  Consented and provided an adequate specimen to adequately characterise the molecular
             genotype of the tumour in the molecular pre-screening according to the molecular
             exclusion rules (see section 6.4 for definition of an adequate sample).

          -  Histological or cytologically confirmed NSCLC stage III (not suitable for radical
             radiotherapy or surgery) or stage IV. This includes patients who may have abnormal
             histology, but IHC strongly support either squamous cell carcinoma (p63 positivity) or
             adenocarcinoma (Thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF1] positivity). If a physician and
             pathologist are convinced after multi-disciplinary review that the patient has stage
             III or IV NSCLC but where all the IHC is negative and the morphology does not
             distinguish a specific sub-type, these patients will be eligible for non-histology
             specific cohorts.

          -  CT scan of head, chest and abdomen within 28 days of treatment demonstrating
             measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1.

          -  Adequate haematological function within 7 days of treatment.

               -  Haemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L.

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L.

          -  Adequate hepatic function within 7 days of treatment in patients with no liver
             metastasis (see arm specific entry criteria for adequate hepatic function in patients
             with liver metastases).

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Alanine transferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

               -  Aspartate transferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Adequate renal function within 7 days of treatment.

               -  Creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt;50 ml/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and
                  Gault equation).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Females must agree to use adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast
             feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of
             child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing potential by
             fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:

               -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrhoeic for at least
                  12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments

               -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation.

               -  Women aged under 50 years old would be consider postmenopausal if they have been
                  amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone
                  (FSH) levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution.

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures, sampling and analyses.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access), chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
             any investigational agents or other anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             treatment.

          -  Nausea, vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease)
             that would preclude adequate absorption.

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition hampering protocol
             compliance.

          -  Concurrent malignancies or invasive cancers diagnosed within past 3 years except for
             adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ carcinoma of the
             uterine cervix.

          -  Judgement by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.

          -  Any unresolved toxicity of grade 2, 3 or 4 from previous treatment (excluding
             alopecia) at Registration (see CTCAE).

          -  Patients who have previous symptomatic brain metastases or spinal cord compression are
             excluded unless they have had adequate treatment, no evidence of progression or
             symptoms, and have had no requirement for steroid treatment in the previous 28 days
             before commencement of trial treatment.

          -  Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases picked up at screening CT scan are not
             excluded providing that in the view of the investigator they do not require immediate
             radiotherapy or surgical intervention, and have had no requirement for steroid
             treatment in the previous 28 days before commencement of trial treatment.

          -  As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             diseases, including active bleeding diatheses, or active infection including hepatitis
             B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus. Screening for chronic conditions is
             not required.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women
