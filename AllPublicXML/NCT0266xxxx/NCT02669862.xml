      This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study with 3 treatment
      groups. During Visit 1, the Investigator will identify 1 eligible common wart on the trunk or
      extremities on each subject. The wart will be treated up to a maximum of 8 times at 1 week
      intervals during the study.
