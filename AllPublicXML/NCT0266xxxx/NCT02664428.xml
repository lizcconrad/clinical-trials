      The first results of in vitro testing of the project PreBIOil have delineated the capacity of
      a flour of olives to modulate the microbial population of the human intestine in a manner
      comparable to that of inulin recognized as polysaccharide with a capacity prebiotic. Based on
      these results, and to others in the literature, the bakery product PreBIOil has been
      formulated. The product contains, flour of olives, buckwheat, pea, and chestnut.

      The overall objective of the study is to assess whether the introduction in the diet of a
      bakery product prepared with olive flour, mixed with buckwheat, pea and chestnuts flour can
      change the profile of the intestinal microbiota and the plasma cholesterol, in particular
      LDL. The study is set up as dietary supplementation, double-blind, randomized, parallel with
      the control group, in which the following product will be compared:

      i) a new bakery product designed study PreBIOil (test); ii) a bakery product control
      isoenergetic (control).

      Description of the Food supplemented in the Trial The test product is new baked product
      formulated with a mixture of flour from olives, buckwheat, pea and chestnut and has the
      appearance of a salty biscuit.

      Participants will be required to consume daily about 90 grams of test or control product. The
      exact quantities of each product batch will be determined following the assessment of the
      nutritional characteristics of the finished product in order to provide the same calorie
      intake with the two products.

      Digestibility, fermentability and modulation of the microbiota Buckwheat is considered a
      non-cereal that in addition to containing fiber, minerals and vitamins, such as B2 and B6,
      also represents a source of antioxidant compounds due to the content of flavonoids.

      The pea flour contains important components for human diet (starch, protein and other
      nutrients). The health benefits associated with consumption of peas primarily derived from
      the concentration and properties of starch, protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals and
      phytochemicals. The fiber contained in the integument and in the cell walls of the cotyledon
      contributes to gastrointestinal function. The starch content in pea flour is characterized by
      lower glycemic index. The proteins from pea may produce peptides with antioxidant activity.
      The vitamin and mineral content of peas can play an important role in the prevention of
      deficiency diseases, in particular those relating to the deficiencies of selenium and folate.
      Peas contain a variety of phytochemicals. These include polyphenols that may have antioxidant
      and anticancer, saponins which are present hypo colesterolemica and anticancer activities,
      and oligosaccharides of galactose that can exert prebiotic benefits in the large intestine.

      The nutritional components of chestnut flour consist of carbohydrates, protein and fat in the
      composition such as to provide an energy value about 350-400 kcal / 100 g. Chestnuts have
      been voted to have a positive effect on the metabolism of gut bacteria and are a source of
      long-chain fatty acids C18: 1 and C18: 2 and vitamins (vitamin E). The possible presence of
      polyphenols is limited to the outer skins, generally separated from the fruit during the
      production of the flour. The flour coming from olive paste is not described in the scientific
      literature for specific nutritional properties for the human diet. However olives are an
      integral part of the Mediterranean diet in which they are consumed as table olives and olive
      oil. The olive fruit contains 50% water, 22% fat, about 19% of carbohydrates and about 2% of
      protein; the polyphenol content varies in the range 1-3%. The olives are consumed or as olive
      oil or table olives. The olives are characterized by strong bitterness, caused mostly
      dall'oleuropein. The oleuropein can reach 140 mg / g dry weight in unripe olives and
      decreases and as the fruit ripens Table olives are treated to mitigate the bitter taste
      through processes such as maceration soda and fermentation in brine. However in the process
      of sweetening the bitterness over lost some important compounds present in olives such as
      polyphenols and fiber. There is no evidence on the ability of extra virgin olive oil
      polyphenols reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, but a large part of the possible
      effects of the components of the olive alone or in synergy with the polyphenols are still
      unexplored. In addition a large part of the water-soluble fraction contained in the olives,
      between which the fibers and polyphenols with proven beneficial activities on human health,
      is not removed in the process of oil production. There is evidence that some phenolic
      fractions as secoiridoids are poorly absorbed by the intestinal mucosa and are then available
      for the colonic microflora. Essentially the oil in its entirety would have the greatest
      potential as a food can modulate beneficially the composition and activity of microorganisms
      symbiotic human gut, as observed experimentally for other types of fruit.

      By means of simulation in vitro of colonic fermentation it has been observed that the olive
      paste, even after baking at 180°C for 30 ', is capable of modulating the human intestinal
      microbiota with a prebiotic effect or inducing a significant increase of bifidobacteria. Such
      simulation in vitro was carried out by incubation for 24 h in a batch fermentation system
      with control of pH and temperature, following inoculation with feces obtained from five
      healthy individuals. The analysis of total polyphenols (main antioxidants present in the test
      product) present in the flour of olives, in the mixture of the flour and in the test product
      did detect a loss of total polyphenols, as a result of baking equal to 40%.

      Clinical Results Clinical results have shown that daily consumption of 100 g of buckwheat in
      the form of flour has determined the increase in the HDL/cholesterol ratio and improved
      glucose tolerance and more recently it was observed that the consumption of biscuits made of
      buckwheat has reduced the serum level of a marker of inflammation, myeloperoxidase (MPO) in
      addition to a reduction of total cholesterol with better pulmonary vital capacity. A recent
      meta-analysis of several intervention studies on the human diet with supplementation of
      legumes, including peas, showed their ability to decrease serum levels of LDL cholesterol.

      Intervention studies on diet with olive oils, by-products of processing of olives and
      olive-based products have been conducted with healthy volunteers and subjects with various
      degrees of cardiovascular risk. Of these studies have been indicated the daily doses of total
      polyphenols introduced (from a few mg / day to 30 mg / day, up to 100 mg / day) depending on
      the type of olive oil and also enrichment with extracts. These interventions had in many
      cases a duration of about a month, and most of the studies measured the effects of
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory changes in the circulatory system, along with the values of
      plasma lipids, and other parameters related to oxidative stress. In particular in the study
      &quot;EUROLIVE&quot;, on a large sample of healthy individuals, it was observed that the phenols of
      olive oil were able to protect blood lipids from oxidation, increase the concentration of HDL
      cholesterol and the relationship between reduced and oxidized glutathione, however no changes
      dell'F2-isoprostane.

      In 2011 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has approved the claim that the olive oil
      polyphenols, especially hydroxytyrosol, protect LDL from oxidation, at a dose greater than or
      equal to 5 mg/kg/day. Other studies have also shown that olive oil polyphenols are related to
      the reduction of CRP, reduced atherogenic gene expression in blood cells, and decreased blood
      pressure. Although there are evidences on the ability of olive oil polyphenols to reduce the
      risk of cardiovascular diseases, a large part of the possible effects of the components of
      the olive alone or in synergy are still unexplored. Moreover, a large part of fibers and
      polyphenols contained in the olive is not extracted in the process of oil extraction and
      eliminated as a byproduct.

      Rationale of the Study The buckwheat flour adds fiber and flavonoids, the pea flour contains
      carbohydrates with low glycemic index, protein and is also a source of antioxidants, chestnut
      flour brings prebiotic substances and vitamins. Flour olive is the fruit of the olive is with
      its water-soluble components (eg. Fibers and polyphenols) and in the soluble fraction of
      polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and carotenoids that only
      partially pass extra virgin olive. These components are designed mostly as components of
      extra virgin olive oil and scientifically have given evidence to contribute to the
      improvement of lipid metabolism and plasma lipids framework, to heart health and protect
      against oxidative stress.

      Based on available clinical and experimental studies, it has been suggested that consumption
      of a baked product made from a mixture of flour from olive paste, buckwheat, peas and
      chestnuts can have positive effects on lipid plasma biomarkers and intestinal microbiota (for
      example, an increase of bifidobacteria) in adult participants with plasma content of
      cholesterol in medium to high levels even if not yet pathological.

      Statement of compliance statement This study will be carried out in compliance with the
      Protocol and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as described in ICH GCP for
      1996, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Declaration of Helsinki. With the
      signing of this protocol, the researcher agrees to comply with these requirements.

      tracings will be reviewed and interpreted by the outpatient part of the nursing home
      Hermitage of Arco.

      Blood pressure will be measured according to the guidelines for hypertension ISH / WHO 2004
      Anthropometric indices Weight and height will be measured on a standard scale. The measures
      will be carried out on subjects without shoes, coats or warm clothes. Body-mass index, BMI,
      is calculated as kg /m2.

      The waist circumference (umbilical) will be measured in a manner determined by the National
      Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.The ratio of the
      circumference of the waist and hip ratio (WHR) is calculated.

      Questionnaires All information will be collected and recorded in validated questionnaires,
      including personal identification, medical history and information on the risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease, medication use, physical activity and eating habits. Also a four-day
      food diary will be written by each participant.

      Participants included in the study will also be asked to fill in a sensory evaluation of each
      food offered in the first blind tasting and at the end of 8 weeks of supplementation.

      Sampling of blood and urine collection The blood (≤ 30 ml) will be drawn from a peripheral
      vein, after 10 hours of fasting. 24 h urine will be collected, the volume measured and sample
      will be stored at -80 ° C.

      Collection of fecal samples Fecal samples will be processed within 12 hours of sample
      collection. Aliquots of each fecal sample will be frozen directly at -80 ° C for analysis of
      metabolomic profile.

      Laboratory tests by the laboratory analysis of the Casa di Cura Eremo di Arco Blood samples
      will be centrifuged according to the requirements of the tests to be performed immediately
      after blood collection. Plasma or serum will be separated, in part immediately tested and the
      remaining fraction stored at -80 ° C.

      Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose will be evaluated with
      enzymatic method. LDL cholesterol will be measured analytically with enzymatic method.

      Insulin levels will be assessed by elettrochemioluminescenza. The blood count and platelet
      count will be assessed by method impedentiometric. The C-reactive protein (CRP) will be
      measured by turbidimetric assay. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsPCR) will be
      measured by turbidimetric assay.

      Apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I), ApoB, and Lp (a) were determined by immunoturbidimetry.

      The test for the verification of the absence of glucosuria will be made by measuring the
      concentration of glucose in the urine.

      Laboratory tests by the Fondazione Edmund Mach [EMF] Urinary and plasma metabolomic profile.
      The F2-isoprostanes will be measured in the urine as a measure of oxidative stress, by means
      of specific EIA kit, after purification by chromatography solid phase (columns SepPack).

      The analysis of LDL oxidized in the plasma will be conducted with the aid of ELISA kit.

      The samples of urine and blood (plasma and serum) will be subjected both to analysis of
      targeted metabolomics (UPLC-MS / MS for non-volatile compounds and GC-MS / MS for volatile
      compounds) that analyzes of non-targeted metabolomics (ULPC-Q -TOF-MS and Nano -FTMS-Q-TOF
      nonvolatile and GC-TOF for the volatile compounds). For profiles of targeted plasma
      metabolites, it will be used the MS-based Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ ® Kit P180, generating
      precise quantitative data on 180 human metabolites linked to the risk of diabetes. In
      addition, specific targeted analysis will be applied to the lipid profile of serum bile
      acids, short-chain fatty acids (short chain fatty acids, SCFAs) and quantification of
      metabolites of the polyphenols of microbial origin in biofluids (including feces) with UPLC /
      QQQ-MS / MS.

      Analysis of fecal microbiota. Changes in the faecal microbiota of specific bacterial
      populations will be evaluated using the method of in situ hybridization with fluorescent
      probes (FISH).

      Also changes in the faecal microbiota will be evaluated using a metagenomics approach using
      pyrosequencing 454. In short, after the collection of stool samples (n = 128, 2 stool samples
      at different times T0, T1 from 64 subjects before and after consumption of each food test and
      placebo) will extract the bacterial genomic DNA using the kit SPIN FastDNA (MPbio) specific
      for feces. Using primers specific for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (hypervariable region
      V1-V3) it will be performed by PCR amplification and then subjecting the amplified V1-V3 at
      454 pyrosequencing.

      Will use the GS FLX Titanium Chemistry with adapters Multiplex Identifier (MID) to get
      sequences of length 600 bp that will be analyzed by comparing the database of 16S rRNA
      phylogenetic, publicly available, via the pipeline QIIME that allows assignment to the genus
      level of human intestinal microbiota. It will be produced a total of about 20,000 sequences
      for each fecal sample. As quality control and analysis of microbial ecology, it will be used
      a multivariate statistical in order to correlate the changes in the composition of the fecal
      microbiota following the consumption of food testing or placebo.

      Randomization blinded Participants will be assigned randomly but equally distributed by sex
      and age to one of two treatments: bakery product test or control product even using specific
      software. The clinical researchers, investigators and laboratory personnel will be blinded to
      the randomization.

      Treatment The supplementation will be introduced in the daily diet through the consumption of
      a bakery product (test) for a daily consumption of 90 grams of product containing flour of
      olives, from buckwheat, from peas, chestnuts. The food will provide an analogue control
      calorie intake. The products under study (test or control) will be supplied in packs that
      will be labeled in the local language with the code number of the study. the manufacturer's
      name, the number of patients, the number of study visit. The products will be distributed to
      the participants from the visit T0.

      Duration of study and planning After eligibility will be assessed, participants will be
      randomized in two groups (product test or control) that will follow 8 weeks of dietary
      supplementation.

      The overall duration of the study, including the start-up period (run-in) and the treatment
      will be 10 weeks.

      The recruitment will start later and within three months of approval by the Ethics Committee.

      The run-in will begin within two weeks of the first visit (T-1). Subjects will be recruited
      over a period of 10 months and the study will be completed within 12 months from the time of
      the first recruitment.

      Criteria for study discontinuation In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH
      standards of good clinical practice, and the &quot;Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulations&quot;

      refusal of the subject to continue treatment or comments Unacceptable toxicity Decision of
      the researcher that the closure is in the best medical interest of the subject Unclear event
      of illness or complications Use of concomitant medications that are incompatible with the
      study. Pregnancy Abuse of alcohol or drugs Those who discontinue or is withdrawn from the
      study will not be replaced.

      Procedure for Terminating

      If an individual stop before the completion of the study, the reason and the cutoff date will
      be recorded. The date of the last dose of food in the study should be recorded. In the event
      of early termination, the following procedures must be performed:

      Clinical tests (systolic and diastolic, heart rate, weight and height to calculate BMI and
      waist and hip circumference).

      Taking blood and feces and urine collection. A food frequency questionnaire (weekly). In the
      event that the individual can not return for follow-up visit, the investigators will have
      groped to contact the person by phone to track any adverse events.

      If a person withdraws consent to receive food in the studio, you will be encouraged to remain
      in the study without receiving treatment for the collection of safety data.

      The procedures of reliability of the product under study The products (test or control) will
      be provided in packages labeled in the local language with the code number of the study, the
      number of site code, the manufacturer's name, the number of participants, the number of
      visits of the study, the number of lot, instructions for storage and expiration dates. The
      products will be distributed to the participants from the visit T0.

      Codes randomization The codes of randomization by sex and age, for each participant will be
      stored in a sealed envelope by qualified group of Sensory Quality (QS of the Department of
      Nutrition and Food Quality of the Research and Innovation Centre of the Edmund Mach
      Foundation).

      Data Source Control All data collected during the study will be obtained from primary
      sources, and will be recorded in written documents and electronic medical records as the
      subject. The results of clinical, laboratory results and ECG will be recorded in the
      electronic medical record file of the subject. No data will be inserted directly in the &quot;case
      report form&quot; (CRF), without being transferred from the primary source, such as paper records
      or electronic.

      Concomitant Drug Therapy Any medication taken from the subject within one month before the
      start of the study and / or administered during the study will be considered as concomitant
      therapy. Such treatment must be documented on the appropriate page of the CRF and the medical
      records of the subjects. Any changes to the concomitant therapy during the study must be
      clearly recorded and the reason for the change should be documented.

      A letter will be sent to the doctor of each participant, specifying what are the treatments
      concomitant incompatible with the study. The use of the following drugs will not be allowed
      during the study: blood thinners, antihypertensives, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers,
      systemic corticosteroids, neuroleptics, antibiotics, laxatives, vitamin supplements,
      antioxidants and minerals, dietary fiber, prebiotics (eg inulin, oligofructose) and
      probiotics. Therefore if the subject requires drug therapies incompatible with the study, the
      subject is notified by the treating physician to terminate the study and inform the head of
      the study and following the procedures for the early termination.

      Compliance Rating To assess compliance to supplementation, they will be measured urinary
      phenols in subjects that will be supplemented with food tests at T0, T1. In addition, all the
      unused or empty packaging at the end of each week will be returned to the experimenters.

      Methods Security There were no security problems during previous studies related to the
      consumption of products made from olives, buckwheat, pea flour, chestnut flour.

      The study will be monitored by medical and paramedical staff of the Casa di Cura Eremo of
      Arco. Adverse events will still be recorded throughout the study. Abnormal laboratory values
      that induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapeutic intervention will be promptly
      notified to the subject, if the subject has explicitly expressed that wish to receive such
      communication in the form of informed consent. The subject will be free to withdraw from the
      study in advance if in need of therapeutic intervention is not compatible with the study, or
      if you experience adverse events that cause a change in the criteria for inclusion of this
      subject in the study. The subject will still be free to withdraw from the study at any time,
      in case the study is due to discomfort following the procedure for early termination.

      Statistical analysis The basic features are listed by type of supplementation: continuous
      variables are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation or medians with interquartile ranges
      and as a percentage for categorical variables. Data with an asymmetric distribution will
      follow a log processing prior to analysis. The differences between the two supplements will
      be evaluated with univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The medium before and
      after the intervention will be compared with the General Linear Model (ANOVA) for repeated
      measures or for paired data. You will perform simple and multiple linear regressions to
      determine the relationships between independent variables; also we will run the test to
      evaluate differences in compliance detected in the types of supplementation. The results are
      expressed as mean +/- SEM and the differences will be considered significant when P &lt;0.05.
      Data with an asymmetric distribution will follow a log processing prior to analysis.

      The main analysis will be based on a comparison of the differences in mean levels after
      consumption of test product and after consumption of control. The differences between the
      mean values at the end of each supplementation (T1) in relation to the relative mean baseline
      value (T0) will also be measured.

      The differences in time between treatment arms will be evaluated by analysis of variance for
      repeated measures.The level of significance will be considered &lt;0.05 in two tails.

      The sample size for each supplementation has been determined to 32 to detect a decrease of
      LDL cholesterol in the plasma equal to about 15.44 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 14.28
      mg/dl using the equation Snedecor and Cochran with α equal to 0.05 and 1-β equal to 0.9 (Dell
      et al., 2002). According to this formula the minimum number of subjects to enroll is equal to
      28. Taking into account possible dropouts, 32 people for supplementation with the test
      product and 32 people for supplementation with control product for a total of 64 volunteer
      subjects in this study.

      The assessment is made on the basis of the abundance of the decrease of LDL cholesterol in
      plasma, on the basis of the measures (mean and standard deviation) of LDL cholesterol
      reported in a parallel study published in the European Journal of Nutrition. The parameter
      LDL cholesterol, in addition to being an effect on human health recognized is more
      restrictive and requires observation times longer than the extent of the modification of the
      intestinal microflora.

      Direct access to source data / documents Regulatory authorities may wish to carry out checks
      on clinical research to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP. Regulatory
      authorities may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the trial or after its
      completion). If an inspection required by a regulatory authority and / or the Ethics
      Committee for Clinical Trials c/o APSS Trento, the researcher must agree to provide access,
      regulatory authorities, the documentation related to the study.

      Data Management and Records The source of the data and documentation is defined as the first
      place where the data is recorded. Any original documents and should not be kept and made
      available at the same location. The researcher must keep the original documents for each
      person participating in the study.

      The data collected on the CRF during the trial will be documented in an anonymous way, and
      those will be identified by numbers or symbols. If in exceptional circumstances it is
      necessary, for reasons of safety or regulation, identifying the person, OlioCRU Ltd and the
      researcher are required to keep such information confidential.

      All data entered in the CRF shall be legible and recorded in black ink. Should you require a
      correction it should be made by deleting the entry with a single line and entering the
      correct information next to the item itself. The correction must be initialed and dated by
      the investigator, or a qualified person designated.
