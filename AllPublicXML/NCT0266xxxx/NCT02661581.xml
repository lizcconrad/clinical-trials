      PLEASED is a 12-month program that aims to help South Asians with type 2 diabetes improve and
      sustain diabetes-related health outcomes e.g. glycemic control, quality of life...) achieved
      from previous short-term diabetes education program. Our goal is to provide a new generation
      of education and support that can be ongoing, patient-driven, and flexible to the dynamic and
      evolving conditions of patients' &quot;real-word&quot; environment and life circumstances.

      Diabetes self-management education: In the first three months of PLEASED, patients with type
      2 diabetes will participate in 12 weekly sessions: 6 sessions will focus on diabetes
      education and be delivered by a health professional and 6 sessions will focus on lifestyle
      change and be delivered by a peer leader. Education sessions will be 2-hours long and be
      facilitated by nurses, dieticians, and pharmacists. Patients will learn about the diabetes
      disease process, lifestyle modification, healthy eating, physical activity, medications,
      monitoring, short- and long- complications, diabetes distress, and coping. Lifestyle change
      sessions will be 1-hour long and start with 30 minutes of physical activity followed by 30
      minutes of goal-setting, action planning, and problem solving. Additional activities such as
      recipe makeovers and exchanges will also be included.

      Diabetes self-management support: In the next nine months of the PLEASED program, patients
      will be invited to attend 32 weekly self-management support sessions (1-hour long)
      facilitated by a peer leader. The goal of these sessions is to help patients continue making
      positive lifestyle changes. Each support session will start with 30 minutes of physical
      activity led by the peer leader followed by a discussion where participants are invited to
      (1) discuss self-management challenges, (2) share thoughts and feelings about these
      challenges, (3) ask self-management questions, (4) engage in problem solving, and (5) set
      self-management goals and design behavioral experiments to achieve those goals. Patients are
      invited to attend as frequently as they need or as they are able to given other competing
      life demands. While these sessions focus on lifestyle change and emotional support,
      participants will be able to obtain responses to medical and clinical questions from 811 or
      the PLEASED hotline (hosted by dieticians, nurses, and pharmacists).

      All patients enrolled in the PLEASED program will undergo three free health assessments: at
      the start of the program, at 3 months, and at 12 months. Health assessments will include
      measuring glycemic control, ApoB, blood pressure, waist circumference, weight, and body mass
      index. All patients will also complete a survey assessing quality of life, social support,
      depression, and self-efficacy.

    <description>Peer support intervention group: During the first 3 months of DSME, participants in the DSMS intervention group will be invited to attend 6 lifestyle change sessions delivered a 2-person peer leader team and conducted bi-weekly. Immediately following the 3 months of DSME, participants are invited to attend 9 months of weekly DSMS sessions (60-minutes per session) delivered by a Peer Leader. These sessions are designed to sustain the self-management gains achieved in the 3 months of DSME.</description>

    <description>The intervention is lifestyle change. First, the peer leaders will be trained how to conduct diabetes self-management education and support sessions. During the first 3 months, all the participants will attend the diabetes self-management education sessions. The participants in the intervention arm will also receive diabetes self-management support sessions as well. In the end of the first 3 months, the intervention group participants will receive weekly support sessions for 9 months.</description>
