    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the functionality (e.g., as
      defined by the primary endpoints) of the fully integrated Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test
      (MSPT) device, when used by unsupervised participants with MS, or related conditions, with a
      broad range of disability, in multi-clinical-care environments. Secondary objectives include:
      Participant perception of usability of device; Participant satisfaction with the device;
      Ascertain the impact of different clinical environments on device usability; Ascertain impact
      of assistive devices in usability of device; Ascertain functionality of Bluetooth remote as
      compared with manual timing.

      This study does not involve evaluation(s) of the clinical efficacy of the MSPT device or the
      efficacy of MS therapies. This feasibility study is examining the usability of the fully
      integrated MSPT device. Study participants will be enrolled for same-day testing.

    <description>The MSPT software tool builds upon previously validated measures comprising the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) that represents a comprehensive functional assessment of MS participants that include: MyHealth: MS -Patient demographic, health and medication information; NeuroQoL - Neurological Quality of Life test -Participant reported; PST Processing Speed Test- Measures mental processing speed; Contrast Sensitivity Test (CST)- 50cm vision test; MDT Manual Dexterity Test- 9 hole peg test; WST Walking Speed Test - Timed 25 foot walk</description>

    <description>MSPT usability survey is a 10 item paper-based questionnaire to measure participant perception of the usability of the device. A study participant will meet the usability secondary endpoints if usability (agree/strongly agree or disagree/strongly disagree, as appropriate) is selected for 6 or more survey questions.</description>
