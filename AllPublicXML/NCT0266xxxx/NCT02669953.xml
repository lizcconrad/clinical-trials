  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy are among the most common
      disorders causing visual disability in elderly people. AMD leads to dysfunction and loss of
      photoreceptors in the central retina. Neovascular AMD (nAMD) affects visual function early in
      the disease process.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of switching from ranibizumab therapy to
      the current routine therapy using aflibercept in eyes with treatment naive, recurrent or
      persistent nAMD, treatment naive diabetic retinopathy and pretreated diabetic retinopathy.

      20 patients with recurrent or persistent nAMD, previously treated with intravitreal
      ranibizumab for up to one year will be included in this trial. Patients will be examined in
      monthly intervals over 12 months follow-up.

      Examinations carried out will include: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using ETDRS charts
      at 4m distance, Reading Performance (RP), Standard ophthalmic examinations (SOE incl.
      funduscopy and applanation tonometry), Optical coherence tomography (OCT), Autofluorescence
      fundus image (AF) &amp; red-free autofluorescence fundus image (RF), Color fundus photography
      (CFP), Fluorescein angiography and indocyaningreen angiography (FLA/ICG), Microperimetry
      (MP), as well as Non-invasive OCT based optical angiography (AngioVue).
