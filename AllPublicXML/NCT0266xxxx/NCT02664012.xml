    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure plasma nicotine uptake parameters, physiological
      measures, and subjective effect measures in smokers during and following a single ad libitum
      use of three menthol electronic cigarettes versus combustible menthol cigarettes and nicotine
      gum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess various elements that may provide information regarding the potential
      for menthol electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) to be adopted by current smokers. These
      various elements include: a) nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK), b) physiological measures of
      pulse rate and blood pressure, and c) subjective effects measured by Urge to Smoke, Urge for
      Product, Product Rating, Intent to Use Product Again, and Product Effects.

          2. Generally healthy male or female, 21 to 60 years of age, inclusive, at Screening.

          3. Expired breath carbon monoxide (ECO) level is ≥ 15 ppm and ≤ 100 ppm at the Screening
             and Randomization Visits, measured between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m.

          4. Combustible menthol cigarettes are the only tobacco product used within (≤) 30 days of
             Screening.

          5. Smokes combustible, filtered, menthol cigarettes, 83 mm to 100 mm in length.

          6. Agrees to smoke usual brand (UB) menthol cigarette throughout the study period. Usual

             attempt (prior to 30 days of Screening), or clinical study participation (prior to 30
             days of Screening) will be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator.

          8. Response at Screening to Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, Question 1 (&quot;How

             minutes&quot; or &quot;6 - 30 minutes.&quot;

          9. Willing to use UB menthol cigarette, the study electronic cigarette menthol brand
             styles and nicotine gum during the study period.

         10. Willing to abstain from tobacco and nicotine use for at least 12 hours prior to
             check-in at each Test Visit.

         11. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use a form of contraception

          1. Clinically significant or unstable/uncontrolled acute or chronic medical conditions at
             Screening, as determined by the Investigator, that would preclude a subject from
             participating safely in the study (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, asthma or other
             lung disease, cardiac disease, neurological disease or psychiatric disorders) based on
             safety assessments such as clinical laboratory tests, medical history, and
             physical/oral examinations.

          2. Systolic blood pressure of &gt; 150 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of &gt; 95 mmHg at

             days prior to Screening.

          6. Employed by a tobacco company, the study site, or handles unprocessed tobacco as part
             of their job.

          7. Use of any medication or supplement that aids smoking cessation, including but not
             limited to any nicotine replacement therapy (e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, patch),
             varenicline (Chantix), bupropion (Wellbutrin, Zyban), or lobelia extract within (≤) 30
             days of Screening.

          8. Females ≥ 35 years of age currently using systemic, estrogen containing contraception
             or hormone replacement therapy.

          9. A positive urine drug screen without disclosure of corresponding prescribed
             concomitant medication(s), at Screening or Randomization Visit. A positive alcohol
             result at Screening, Randomization Visit, or at any Test Visit.
