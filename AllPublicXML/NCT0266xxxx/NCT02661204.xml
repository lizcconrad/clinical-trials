  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a new ABUS system
      among 4 different population:

      Population A: women undergoing screening for familial or genetic predisposition for breast
      cancer.

      Population B: women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. ABUS performance will be compared to
      breast MRI in the pre-operative assessment of breast cancer extent.

      Population C: women with BI-RADS 3 or 4 lesions in a routine breast imaging examination. ABUS
      will be evaluate as a problem-solving tool.

      Population D: women undergoing breast MRI for the assessment of breast implants integrity.
      ABUS performance will be compared to breast MRI.

      Population A: women in the age range of 20 to 40 years, with a strong family history of
      breast cancer or a predisposing gene mutation such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. A total of 100 patients
      should be enrolled.

      Population B: women with new breast cancer diagnosis undergoing pre-operative local cancer
      staging.A total of 50 patients will be enrolled.

      Population C: women with lesions classified BI-RADS 3 or 4 in a routine breast imaging
      examination. A total of 50 patients will be enrolled.

      Population D: women undergoing breast-MRI for the evaluation of breast implants integrity. A
      total of 50 patients will be enrolled.

      The expected duration of subject participation is 5 years for population A: every year the
      patients will undergo ABUS examination and the results will be compared with HHUS
      examination.

      In population B, C and D only one examination will be performed and the data obtained with
      ABUS will be compared with HH-US and breast MRI data.

      Images will be evaluated by a radiologist with breast imaging experience and ABUS findings
      will be compared with findings from HHUS and MR imaging.

      Afterwards, two or three readers (radiologists with different levels of experience in breast
      imaging) blinded to clinical, HH-US and MRI data, will evaluate the interobserver agreement
      ABUS images will be evaluated by Methods of minimising bias Population A - During the
      recruitment, family history of breast cancer will be in-depth analysed in order to avoid the
      bias related to different levels of risk for breast cancer. In order to reduce the loss of
      patients to follow-up, women will be invited every year to undergo HHUS and ABUS examination
      at our department.
