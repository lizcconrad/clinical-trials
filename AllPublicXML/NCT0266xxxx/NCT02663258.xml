      This is a single arm, single agent, open label, exploratory translational research study in
      patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma being treated with Pembrolizumab.
      Suitable patients will undergo serial surgical core biopsies (nonradiological) of
      subcutaneous or lymph node metastases (as judged by an Oncological Surgical Consultant). As a
      primary endpoint, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of undergoing
      these biopsies within the patient cohort. A total of forty patients will be recruited over a
      period of two years.

      Patients who have provided consent and satisfied the eligibility criteria will undergo
      baseline CT scanning and peripheral blood sampling. At baseline, biopsies of suitable
      metastatic lesions will be undertaken and samples sent for histopathological assessment and
      analysis of molecular and immune parameters. Participants will be treated with Pembrolizumab,
      200mg, intravenously, every 3 weeks. At 6 weeks following commencement of Pembrolizumab
      therapy, a further biopsy or excision of metastatic disease will be performed, unless
      considered no longer possible on the basis of a near or complete response to treatment. Blood
      sampling will be performed prior to each cycle and repeat CT scanning will occur every 9
      weeks. Response evaluations will be performed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Pembrolizumab
      will be continued as long as study participants are deriving benefit and further biopsies of
      progressing lesions will be performed where possible.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the safety and feasibility of obtaining serial tumour
      biopsies or excisions of metastatic disease during treatment with Pembrolizumab with
      exploration of the i) mechanistic activity of Pembrolizumab, ii) identification of
      intratumoural and peripheral factors limiting response, iii) identification of candidate
      predictive biomarker panels based on (i) and (ii) and iii) use of circulating free DNA
      (cfDNA) as a surrogate marker of response and guide to duration of therapy.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the feasibility of obtaining sequential tumour biopsies will be achieved when sequential biopsies (at baseline, week 6 and at disease progression), have successfully been carried out in a minimum of 75% of patients (i.e. 29 out of 40).The percentage of patients with complete tumour response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) will be tabulated. Associated 95% CI will be provided for response rates. The duration of objective response (for patients with CR and PR) will be defined as the time from initial CR or PR to the time of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). For patients who do not die or experience PD, duration of objective response will be censored on the day of the last tumour assessment.</description>

    <description>Complication rate will be defined as the proportion of patients who have hospital admission due to complication of biopsy e.g. infection/bleeding/pain control and/or delay in Pembrolizumab treatment due to complication of biopsy.

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., Grade 1 or at

                  qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
