      To compare and analyze the effects on the electromyographic activity of preterm newborns
      placed in the hammock position with the activity of newborns not placed in this position.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial, according to CONSORT standards, with newborn preterm gestational
      age &lt;34 weeks and birth weight &lt;1500 g, admitted to the intensive care unit. Newborns will be
      randomized. Those selected for the control group (CG) will be placed in the incubator
      following the service routine. Babies in the intervention group (IG), will be positioned
      supine in a hammock in the incubator, with the appropriate postural adjustments. The
      evaluation of muscle activity will be carried out through surface electromyography.
      Evaluations shall be performed immediately before the intervention; immediately after 24
      hours of intervention; and within 24 hours without intervention, in order to compare the
      values before and after the intervention of the two groups, as well as if the effects of the
      intervention are maintained after its removal.

    <description>In preterm infants placed in hammocks with gestational age less than or equal to 34 weeks and birth weight less than or equal to 1500g:
Muscle activity of the elbow flexors (corresponding to the biceps muscle) and knee flexors (corresponding mainly to the hamstring muscle group) increases.
The increase in electromyographic activity persists 24 hours after removal of the intervention.</description>
