  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid carcinoma is the common endocrine system malignant neoplasm. At present it has become
      the malignant neoplasm of fastest growing incidence rate. More than 90% thyroid carcinoma is
      thyroid differentiated carcinoma（DTC）. Postoperative oral L-thyroxine suppressing thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH) treatment is the standard therapy in DTC patients. While
      TSH-suppressive therapy with L-thyroxine can cause subclinical hyperthyroidism in treatment
      of patients with thyroid differentiated carcinoma. The impact of this therapy on cognitive
      functions and mood have not been systematically studied. The investigators infer the
      subclinical hyperthyroidism caused by TSH-suppressive therapy may impact cognitive function
      and mood disorders in DTC patients. The aim of this study is to explore the possible
      mechanism of cognitive function impairment in the course of TSH-suppressive therapy by rat
      model of total thyroidectomy + TSH-suppressive therapy and clinical trials. The result of
      this study may provide clinical and experimental basis for the side effects risk result form
      TSH-suppressive therapy in DTC patients.

      1. Object:

           Patients aged 18-65 years; newly diagnosed differentiated thyroid carcinoma and
           undergone thyroidectomy according to the China thyroid association guidelines for the
           Management of thyroid nodule and thyroid cancer; followed by TSH-suppressive therapy 6
           /12 months.

        2. Clinical information, examination data and neuropsychological assessments:

      Information is obtained from medical record abstraction. Serum T3, T4, FT3, FT4, TSH, TG-ab,
      TPO-ab, TG levels and neuropsychological assessments are examined after TSH-suppressive
      therapy 6 /12 months. Cognitive complaints were assessed with the Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Digit Symbol test (DST), Wechsler Memory Scale
      (WMS), Aphasia Battery of Chinese （ABC） and patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).

      Healthy volunteers (normal T3, T4, FT3, FT4, TSH, TG-ab, TPO-ab, TG) are recruited to match
      the patients with age, gender, education level, etc.
