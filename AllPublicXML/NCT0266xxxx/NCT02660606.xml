    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the patient usability and reliability of the POMAQ
      survey to evaluate opioid misuse and abuse among adults with chronic moderate to severe pain,
      including patients who are opioid abusers, non-abusers, as well as non-opioid users

      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested, as part of a post-marketing requirement
      (PMR) for new drug application (NDA) holders of extended release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids,
      to conduct a study to develop and validate a measure of the opioid-related adverse events
      misuse and abuse among patients with chronic pain prescribed long-term opioid therapy. This
      measure will be used to assess misuse and abuse in PMR Study 2065-1A and PMR Study 2065-4B.

      Currently, no tool exists to meet this need except for the Self-report Misuse, Abuse and
      Diversion of Prescription (Rx) Opioids questionnaire (SR-MAD) which has undergone several
      rounds of prior content validation. The SR-MAD has been modified to meet the needs of PMR
      Studies 2065-1A and 2065-4B, and has been renamed the Prescription Opioid Misuse and Abuse
      Questionnaire (POMAQ).

      This study will seek to further develop and validate the POMAQ using the the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry, Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical
      Product Development to Support Labeling Claims (FDA 2009) as a reference for conducting
      qualitative research throughout the process of instrument development to ensure the content
      validity of a measure and to evaluate the comprehensibility of included questions. This
      qualitative study to evaluate content validity will be conducted prior to the quantitative
      study to evaluate construct validity
