    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of PVI irrigation to no irrigation for
      decreasing postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses in children with perforated appendicitis.
      Additionally, this study aims to verify the safety profile of dilute PVI for intra-abdominal
      irrigation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses are common occurrences after perforated appendicitis
      in pediatric patients despite utilization of evidence-based practices. Povidone-iodine is a
      commonly used antiseptic in surgical procedures and has been shown to be effective in
      reducing postoperative abscesses in adults with perforated appendicitis. This trial will be
      the first to rigorously test the efficacy of povidone-iodine irrigation in children and to
      verify its safety profile in this patient population.

    <description>Povidone-iodine (PVI) is an antiseptic solution consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidone with water, iodide, and 1% available iodine. It has bactericidal ability against a large array of pathogens, including those pathogens which commonly cause postoperative IAA in children with perforated appendicitis.
1% PVI will be used. Once the appendix has been removed and hemostasis ensured, the surgeon will perform the irrigation with 10cc/kg (minimum 100ml and maximum 1000ml) of 1% PVI. After completing the irrigation, the surgeon will suction out all intra-abdominal fluid into a suction canister.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who undergo an appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. (Appendicitis:
             Diagnosis is made intraoperatively by the surgeon. Diagnosis Method: The visualization
             of a gross defect in the appendiceal wall or the presence of intraperitoneal stool or
             a fecalith at the time of operation.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting with simple or gangrenous appendicitis

          -  Patients with a history of iodine sensitivity, thyroid disease or renal disease

          -  Patients undergoing interval or incidental appendectomy

          -  Patients/parents/legal guardians who are both non-English and non-Spanish speaking
