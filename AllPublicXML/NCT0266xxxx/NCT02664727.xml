    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of exercise of different intensities
      on psychological, physiological, biochemical, physiological and alcohol-related parameters in
      individuals with alcohol use disorders (heavy drinkers and alcoholic patients) in order to
      investigate possible biochemical mechanisms by which exercise may be a healthy alternative to
      alcohol abuse. For that purpose, a control group of individuals that do not exceed the limits
      for moderate alcohol use will be included.

      The mechanism of incentives that lead people to unhealthy habits such as excessive alcohol
      consumption is not only social, personal, and psychological, but also associated with
      neurochemical and neurobiological mechanisms.

      Several programs have been developed to stop excessive drinking, but the success rates are
      small, while the relapse rates are very high, reaching up to 90%. Although there is some
      evidence for the beneficial effects of exercise on alcohol use disorders (AUDs), research is
      limited. The present study investigates whether exercise could be a safe adjunct therapy for
      alcohol abuse cessation, and the possible mechanisms involved.

      One of the basic assumptions is that the appropriate form of exercise in individuals with
      AUDs will contribute to the secretion of beta-endorphin, which in combination with
      psychological pleasure, vitality, change of mood, reduced stress, increased confidence, and
      the shift of attention will help people to follow healthy lifestyles and abhor alcohol.

      The research project is divided in three phases. In the first phase, (current study) the
      effect of acute exercise in critical psychological, physiological, biochemical and
      alcohol-related parameters associated with excessive alcohol consumption will be examined. In
      the second phase, a long-term exercise program in conjunction with psychological support
      strategies aimed at alcohol abuse cessation will be developed, implemented and evaluated.
      Finally, in the third phase, based on the results of the previous phases, awareness programs
      in adolescent and adult populations will be designed and implemented as well as the
      dissemination of results and evaluation of the project will take place.
