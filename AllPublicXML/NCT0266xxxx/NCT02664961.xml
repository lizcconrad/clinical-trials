    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the overall response rate of single agent TRC105 and
      the combination of TRC105 and bevacizumab in patients with refractory GTN (including
      choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), and epithelioid trophoblastic
      tumor (ETT)). Up to 30 patients will be treated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to endoglin, an angiogenic target highly expressed
      on the tumor vessels and tumor cells in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).
      Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that
      inhibits angiogenesis and extends survival in patients with a wide variety of solid tumor
      types. TRC105 has been well tolerated as a single agent and when combined with bevacizumab.
      These antibodies may be efficacious in refractory GTN, a tumor type that is highly vascular
      and has been shown to densely express endoglin.

    <description>All subjects will begin by receiving single agent TRC105 weekly. In the case of a complete response to single agent TRC105, subjects will continue to receive single agent TRC105 for at least 3 months following complete response. In the case of a partial response (without a complete response) to single agent TRC105, bevacizumab every two weeks will be added. In the absence of a partial or complete response to single agent TRC105, subjects will receive single agent bevacizumab every two weeks. In the absence of a complete response to single agent bevacizumab, or for subjects who have documented disease progression on a prior bevacizumab containing regimen, subjects will receive TRC105 weekly and bevacizumab every two weeks.</description>
