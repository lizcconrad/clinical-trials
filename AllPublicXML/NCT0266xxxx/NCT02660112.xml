    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) is made up of a measure of ataxia, an activities of daily living subscale and a neurological subscale. This scale also includes the 8m walk at maximum speed (8MW), the 9-hole peg test (9HPT), PATA rate (assesses speech speed by repetitions of pronouncing &quot;PaTa&quot; ) and low-contrast letter acuity.
FARS is made up of a measure of ataxia, an activities of daily living subscale and a neurological subscale. This scale also includes the 8m walk at maximum speed (8MW), the 9-hole peg test (9HPT), PATA rate and low-contrast letter acuity. The scores from the three subscales are added to generate a total score ranging from 0 to 159, with a higher score indicating a greater level of disability.</description>
