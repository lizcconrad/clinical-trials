    <textblock>
      Skin cancer represents a large problem in today's healthcare setting. The majority of cancer
      diagnoses are attributed to malignant skin diseases including its major types: basal cell
      carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. Early diagnoses is critical given early
      detection of malignant lesions largely increases chances of successful treatment. The current
      gold standard of diagnosis is histopathological examination of biopsied skin. Biopsies are
      not only invasive and expensive, they have variable positive predictive value, meaning they
      may often be preformed unnecessarily. As such, we have developed a skin scanner, which is
      less bulky and expensive that existing similar technologies, as a tool to evaluate skin
      lesions prior to determining the need for a biopsy. Our objective is to obtain information in
      order to validate this skin scanner in the context of its ability to accurately identify
      basal cell carcinoma skin lesions.
