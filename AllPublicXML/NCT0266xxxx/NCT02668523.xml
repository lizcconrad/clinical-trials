      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Raindrop Near
      Vision Inlay implanted in bilateral pseudophakes with presbyopia for improvement of near and
      intermediate vision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The loss of near vision and the ability to perform tasks that require near vision is part of
      the normal aging process. This natural transformation in the eye occurs as a result of the
      loss of accommodation of the crystalline lens, a condition known as presbyopia. Presbyopia,
      characterized by a progressive, age-related loss of accommodation (i.e., the lens ability to
      focus clearly over a wide range of distances), is most prevalent of all visual deficiencies,
      affecting 100% of the population over the course of a normal life span.

      Presbyopia is also a natural outcome of pseudophakic subjects with monofocal or toric
      intraocular lenses. Treatment of pseudophakic presbyopia generally consists of reading
      glasses, contact lenses, or monovision LASIK which allows the patient to see near objects.
      All these options present limitations from the patient perspective.

      ReVision Optics has developed the Raindrop corneal inlay for the correction of near vision.
      The Raindrop is a 2mm corneal inlay, as small as a pinhead, thinner than a human hair and
      about 1/500th of a droplet of water. The inlay is the same refractive index as the human
      cornea. The inlay is placed in the non-dominant eye, centered over the pupil after a corneal
      flap or corneal pocket has been made. The Raindrop is expected to provide pseudophakic
      presbyopic subjects with improvement of near and intermediate vision.
