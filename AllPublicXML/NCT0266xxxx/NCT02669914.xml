  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are the most common intracranial malignancy occurring in 20-40% of all
      cancers, and the presence of CNS metastases is associated with a poor prognosis. As such, the
      median overall survival of patients with symptomatic brain lesions is a dismal 2-3 months
      regardless of tumor type. Because standard chemotherapy largely does not cross the blood
      brain barrier at a meaningful concentration, standard treatment is limited and usually
      involves surgical resection and/or stereotactic radiosurgery for isolated lesions and whole
      brain radiation for multiple lesions. Unfortunately, the median overall survival is only
      improved by about 6 months with this multimodality approach2, and there is a paucity of
      second-line therapies to treat recurrence. Furthermore, re-resection and re-radiation are
      often not feasible options due to concern for increasing complications or neurotoxicity,
      respectively. Thus, there is a dire clinical need for additional treatment options for this
      patient population.

      Checkpoint blockade therapy, in particular PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibition, has recently shown
      clinical efficacy in multiple types of solid tumors. The investigators propose to study the
      efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy in patients with solid tumors and
      refractory/recurrent brain metastases. The investigators will assess the efficacy of
      MEDI4736, a novel PD-L1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody, in this study.

             excluding NSCLC, including but not limited to ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer,

             disease is permitted as long as at least one untreated lesions meets criteria for
