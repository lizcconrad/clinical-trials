  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this interdisciplinary proposal is to conduct two randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) of the efficacy of self-administered systematic light exposure (Bright White
      Light (BWL)), an innovative, low cost, and low burden intervention to treat cancer-related
      fatigue. Another common and often overlapping treatment side-effect is cognitive impairment.
      A secondary outcome of the proposed RCT is, thus, cognitive functioning. Finally, possible
      underlying chronobiological (circadian activity rhythms, sleep), biological (pro inflammatory
      markers), and neurophysiological (brain morphology) mechanisms of BWL will be explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two independent but similar RCTs with a total of 144 breast cancer patients (Group 1 = 72
      high risk patients; Group 2 = 72 low risk breast cancer patients) post-treatment screened for
      fatigue will be randomized to BWL (36 in each of the two groups) or dim light(DL) (36 in each
      of the two groups) exposure for 30 minutes/morning for 4 weeks, and assessed before, during,
      immediately and 3 months after the intervention. Measures include questionnaires, cognitive
      assessment, actigraphy, blood samples, saliva samples, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      1.1 Aims and hypotheses. Aim 1: To test the efficacy of BWL on fatigue (primary outcome) in
      breast cancer patients.

      Hypothesis 1: Compared with control participants exposed to DL, participants randomized to
      BWL will report less fatigue immediately and 3 months after the intervention.

      Aim 2: To test the efficacy of BWL on cognitive functioning (secondary outcome).

      Hypothesis 2: Compared with controls, BWL recipients will show improved cognitive functioning
      immediately and 3 months after the intervention.

      Aim 3: To explore the effects of BWL on chronobiological, biological, and neurophysiological
      markers.

      Hypothesis 3: BWL will be associated with normalized circadian activity rhythms (3a);
      improved sleep (3b); decreased inflammation (3c); increased cortical and subcortical grey
      matter density (3d); and increased cortical and subcortical white matter integrity (3e). If
      hypotheses 1 and/or 2 are confirmed, the mediating effects of the markers will be explored.
