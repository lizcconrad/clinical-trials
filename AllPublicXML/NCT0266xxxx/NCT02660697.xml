    <textblock>
      The present retrospective study aims at assessing the clinical effects of a novel implant
      site development (Extraction site development - XSD) technique after tooth extraction
      compared with extraction alone in patients requiring dental implant placement following
      healing of extraction sockets.

      In advanced (Extraction Defect Sounding Class 3-4) alveolar defects, a minimally invasive
      tunnelised socket preservation technique utilising long term resorbable membranes and
      connective tissue grafting was used for extraction site development (XSD). The novel
      technique was evaluated in a retrospective comparative case series study including a total of
      54 extraction sites. In the test group, out of 33 single rooted teeth, 29 in the maxilla and
      4 in the mandible were removed, extractions sites were treated by the XSD method. Out of 33
      teeth, 27 were incisors, 2 canines and 4 premolars. In the control group, out of 21 single
      rooted teeth, 11 in the maxilla and 10 in the mandible were extracted and left for
      spontaneous healing. Out of 21 teeth, 13 were incisors, 2 canines and 6 premolars. CBCT scans
      were taken prior to tooth extraction and 6-9 months later in both groups. Radiographic
      evaluation was carried out using the I-CAT Vision (Imaging Sciences International, LLC;
      Hatfield, USA) and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) softwares. Following manual
      alignment of CBCTs vertical and horizontal linear measurements as well as planimetric
      measurements of cross-section areas were performed in pre- and postoperative data sets at the
      extraction sites.

    <description>In the test group 29 healthy patients presenting 33 single rooted teeth scheduled for extraction with Extraction Defect Sounding (EDS) Class 3-4 type buccal bony dehiscences were included. 29 maxillary single rooted teeth and 4 single rooted teeth in the mandible (27 incisors, 2 canines and 4 premolars) were removed and treated by the novel extraction site development method. Pre- and postoperative ConeBeam Computer Tomography (CBCT) data were collected for further analysis.</description>
