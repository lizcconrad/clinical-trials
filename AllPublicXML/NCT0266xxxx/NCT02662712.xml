      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety data including serious
      and other adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms
      (ECGs) and clinical laboratory results (including biochemistry, hematology, and urine).

      Part 1: This is a first-in-human (FIH), double-blind (neither the researchers nor the
      participants know what treatment the participant is receiving), randomized (study medication
      assigned to participants by chance), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend
      treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if
      the drug has a real effect) study. Part 1 includes healthy adult participants, divided into 3
      panels (Panel 1, 2 and 3) and in Part 2 adult Chronic Hepatitis B Participants will be
      included, in Sessions VIII to XI and Optional Sessions A-B-C (Panel 4). The study will
      consists of screening phase (part 1: [less than or equal to &lt;=28 days before the first intake
      of study drug; part 2: [&lt;=56 to greater than or equal to {&gt;=} 20 days before the first intake
      of study drug), Treatment Phase (multiple dose phase in part 1: Day -1 up to 12 or 19 days;
      part 2: up to 4 weeks) and Follow up Phase (part 1: 30-35 days after last study drug intake
      or after dropout; part 2: up to week 8 after actual end of study drug treatment).
      Participants' safety will be evaluated throughout the study.

             months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             level (greater than (&gt;)40 international unit per milliliter (IU/L) or
             milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL) in the postmenopausal range may be
             used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or
             hormonal replacement therapy, however in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a
             single FSH measurement is insufficient, or 2) Permanently sterile: Permanent
