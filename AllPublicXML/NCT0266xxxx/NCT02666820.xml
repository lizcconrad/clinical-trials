  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) combined with large balloon dilation (LBD) has been
      increasingly accepted as alternative method for removal of large bile duct stones. However,
      there were limited studies comparing the efficacy of EST in combined with LBD to EST with
      mechanical lithotripsy (ML). The purpose of this study to compare the efficacy and safety of
      combined EST- LBD versus EST-ML in the removal of very large bile duct stones.

    <textblock>
      The large common bile duct stones (CBDS) remains a therapeutic challenge in ERCPs. Large CBDS
      are generally refractory to be removed by EST and stone extraction balloons and or baskets.
      Traditional rescue therapy was the technique of stone fragmentation using ML. The previous
      reports have shown that EST with ML was successful in the fragmentation of large stones
      yielding stone clearance rate from 68 t0 79 %. EST-LBD has been shown favorable outcome in
      the treatment of large bile duct stone. A meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness and
      complications between EST-LBD and EST in the management of CBDS showed that EST-LBD was as
      effective as EST for the removal of large or difficult of CBDS in terms of stone clearance in
      the first ERCP session of 87.87 % vs. 84.15 % and overall clearance of 97.35 % vs. 96.35 %
      but EST-LBD was associated with fewer complications as well as reduced need for ML compared
      to EST. The efficacy of EST-ML versus EST-LBD as a therapy for relatively large CBDS, a mean
      stone size &gt; 20 mm in currently not well defined. The investigators, herein, compared the
      efficacy and complications between EST followed by LBD or ML for the removal of CBDS &gt; 15 mm
      with a mean stone size &gt; 20 mm.

    <description>After biliary sphincterotomy was performed with full extension to the full length of transverse fold. A 12, 15, 18 or 20 mm CRE-balloon was passed over guide wire and position across the papilla. The balloon was gradually inflated to the largest size of the bile duct stone and/or the bile duct diameter. When complete stone removal was unsuccessful , crossing over treatment was considered at the discretion of the endoscopists.</description>

    <description>After biliary sphincterotomy was performed with full extension to the full length of transverse fold. A 3x6 cm Trapezoid Rx retrieval stone basket was used to capture the stone and crushing of stones was done when simple stone extraction failed to remove the stone. The stone fragments were then retrieved with a basket and/ or a retrieval balloon. When complete stone removal was unsuccessful , crossing over treatment was considered at the discretion of the endoscopists.</description>
