  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the training of pelvic floor muscles, which
      associates an individualized treatment progressing to a group treatment, would be more
      effective than an individualized training only or groups only.

      Methods: Randomized controlled study which will be done from January to December of 2016, on
      Laboratory of Women's Health Research, Federal University of São Carlos-SP, Brazil.

      Inclusion criteria: women with stress UI, older than 18 years old. The sample size
      calculation was performed using the GPower Software (3.1.5, Germany) and it was estimated a
      sample of 30 women in each group. The volunteers will be assessed before the intervention by
      a urinary symptoms evaluation form, King's Health Questionnaire, miccional diary, PERFECT
      scheme and perineometry.

      After the evaluation will be performed the randomization of the volunteers by a blinded
      investigator and the volunteers will be allocated into three groups:

      Group 1: Individualized Training Group 2: Individualized training with progression to group
      training Group 3: Group training only

      For all groups it will be used the same protocol that was prepared according to the
      recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine. Later, volunteers will be
      reassessed after 12 treatments, three months and six months (from the discharge date). It
      will be added in the reassessment the Self-efficacy Scale for Pelvic Floor Exercises
      Practice.

      Primary outcome: severity measures of the King's Health Questionnaire.

      Secondary outcome: miccional diary, PERFECT scheme, perineometry and Self-efficacy scale for
      Pelvic Floor Exercises Practice. Data normality will be tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test (SPSS
      19.0). The comparison between the evaluations will be performed by ANOVA, and the comparison
      between groups will be performed by Student t-test (independent measures). In order to
      measure the practical significance of the data, the effect size and the confidence interval
      (CI) will be calculated. A 5% significance level will be assumed. This study was approved by
      the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Carlos, São Carlos- SP, Brazil
      (Protocol 1207393).

      This is a blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. Data collection will be performed at
      the Women's Health research laboratory (WHRL), allocated in the Department of Physical
      Therapy of Federal University of São Carlos, from January 2016 to December 2016.

      The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (REC) of Federal University of São
      Carlos (UFSCar) (Number 1207393). Patients will receive information about the research and
      those who consent to participate, will sign the free informed consent form.

      The sample size calculation was performed using the GPower Software (3.1.5, Germany) based on
      the study of Pereira et al (2011) considering the intergroup comparison of data post
      treatment of the severity measurement of the King's Health Questionnaire. It was considered
      the ANOVA (repeated measures), 80% power, effect size of 0.40 and 5% of significance level,
      being estimated a sample size of 30 subjects.

    <description>the volunteer will be placed in the supine position with flexed hip and knees. Initially, it will be observed the vaginal mucosa condition, the presence of atrophies, sensitivity, pelvic organ prolapse and the tone of the vaginal wall. Then, it will be performed the muscle function evaluation through the PERFECT scale which was developed, the researcher will introduce the index finger about 4 cm into the volunteer vaginal canal and will guide her to contract the PFM.After, it will be evaluated the pelvic floor muscles contraction pressure through the Peritron equipment (Cardio Design,Australia) and is equipped with a vaginal probe. The perineometer probe will be coated with a male non-lubricated condom and will be introduced with KY® lubricant gel into the volunteer's vagina.</description>

    <description>Participating volunteers of all groups will receive guidance about the anatomy and function of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and how to perform a properly contraction: as strong as possible and eliminating at the most the contraction of the gluteus, abdominals and adductors. For all groups it will be used the same protocol which was developed for this study, with progression parameters of the PFMT based on the recommendations for the strength training of the American College of Sports Medicine (VICKI, 2001).</description>
