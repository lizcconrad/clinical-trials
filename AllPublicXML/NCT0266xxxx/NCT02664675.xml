  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data found that peri-implantitis may differ from periodontitis at the histological
      level in terms of extent and composition of the cellular components. From human biopsies, it
      has been shown a deeper apical extension of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and a larger
      proportion of granulocytes and macrophages in peri-implantitis lesions compared to
      periodontitis lesions. Following experimental peri-implantitis, it has been observed a
      continuing bone loss around dental implants after ligature removal; whereas, such a
      progression was not observed around teeth after cessation of the experimental periodontitis.
      The factors influencing the recruitment and the activation of osteoclasts in both diseases
      have not been compared yet.

      Hypothesis : The more rapid and more severe alveolar bone destruction occurring in
      peri-implantitis compared to periodontitis is due at least in part to differences in the
      inflammatory process in these diseases.

      Aim: to study the cytokine profile produced by gingival explants from periodontitis or
      peri-implantitis sites and to test the consequences on alteration of bone remodelling
      activity using in vitro approach.

      Materials and methods The investigators will establish a collection of human gingival samples
      from patients undergoing surgical treatment of periodontitis or peri-implantitis. The
      investigators will test pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines release and consequences on
      osteoclast differentiation and activity.
