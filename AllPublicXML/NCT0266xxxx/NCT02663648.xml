  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves observing the level of cell cycle regulatory gene in patients with
      myeloproliferative disorders(MPD). These disorders include polycythemia vera (PV), essential
      thrombocythemia (ET), myelofibrosis (MF) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The abnormal
      blood and/or bone marrow cells, or materials derived from these abnormal cells, like DNA,
      RNA, protein or plasma will be used in laboratory studies.

      Cell cycle regulatory protein such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases(Cdks) and Cdk
      inhibitors(CKIs) play indispensable roles in processes such as transcription, metabolism and
      stem cell self-renewal. MPD are a group of diseases characterized by abnormally increased
      proliferation of erythroid, megakaryocytic, or granulocytic cells. The pathogenesis was still
      unclear. Detecting the level of cell cycle regulatory protein will be useful to look for the
      possible role in MPD and better understand the cause of MPD.

      In this study, the cell cycle regulatory message RNA and protein from patients' and healthy
      volunteers' bone marrow and peripheral blood will be extracted and quantified by real time
      polymerase chain reaction and western blot. The different level of cell cycle regulatory gene
      between patients and volunteers and the relationship between the level and patients' clinical
      characteristics such as age, gender, type of disease will be analysed by SPSS.
