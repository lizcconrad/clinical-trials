      The main objective of this study is to measure effectiveness at 6 months of personalized
      dietary advice versus dietary counseling via delivery of a standard advice sheet for
      optimizing dietary calcium intake (assessed by a food survey based on CIQUAL* data) in MS
      patients with ambulatory monitoring.

      *CIQUAL Data: Table of nutritional food composition available on the ANSES (National Agency
      for Sanitary Security of Food, Environment and Labour) website, published by the Observatory
      of the Nutritional Quality of Foods. This table includes 1,500 sheets of 58 nutritional
      components. The data is integrated into the software for calculating ingesta (DATAMEAL) at
      the Nîmes University Hospital.

      The secondary objectives of this study is to compare the two groups in order to:

      A- correlate the impact of the recommendations by sheet or consult with disability, cognitive
      status, fatigue, depression, quality of life of patients with MS.

      B- assess the prevalence of diet changes as an alternative therapy for lactose intolerance in
      the population and to correlate these changes with dietary calcium intake at baseline
      (assessed by a food survey based on CIQUAL* data).

      C- assess calcium intake of the patients included via the self-administered frequency
      questionnaire QALCIMUM® on day 0 and 6 months and to compare them with data obtained by the
      food survey based on data from CIQUAL.

      D- correlate calcium intake of the patients with vitamin D levels at inclusion and establish
      a biological collection of blood samples from the population.

    <description>Individual dietary consultations with a dietician will be held at inclusion, month 1 and month 3. Consults consist of a personal interview where the dietician delivers comprehensive information to the patient on how to optimize calcium intake and reduce the risk of fractures; the dietician questions the subject on his/her diet and reassesses the quality and quantity of calcium intake during the 3 days preceding the consultation through a survey calculation software based on data from CIQUAL.</description>
