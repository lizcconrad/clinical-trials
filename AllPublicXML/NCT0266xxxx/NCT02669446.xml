      This a comparative, open label, parallel group, non interventional study which compares the
      tolerability and influence of Ectoin containing Lozenges to saline solution and lozenges
      containing hyaluronic acid for the treatment of acute viral Pharyngitis. The observation
      takes place over a period of 7 days. Response to treatment is recorded at day 1 and day 7 by
