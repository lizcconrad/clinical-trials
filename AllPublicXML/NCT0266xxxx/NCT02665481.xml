  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of four interventions on age-related
      cognitive decline in healthy older adults. The investigators will examine the effects of
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) psychotherapy, multi-component intensity-based
      aerobic exercise, and their combination, compared to a discussion group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MBSR teaches mindfulness, or the focusing of attention and awareness, through various
      meditation techniques. Mindfulness meditation practices appear to produce neurocircuitry
      changes that are the reverse of those seen in age-related cognitive decline. It is widely
      available, acceptable to older people, and carries minimal risk of side effects or adverse
      events. Exercise - specifically, intense, multi-component exercise - also appears to affect
      brain structure and function and improve cognitive performance.

      The investigators will randomize 580 non-demented healthy adults aged 65 to 84 to one of four
      conditions: MBSR alone, exercise alone, MBSR + exercise, or a health education discussion
      group control condition.

      The study will consist of a 6-month acute intervention phase with weekly visits followed by a
      12-month maintenance phase with weekly or monthly visits and other prompts to maintain
      intervention behaviors.

      Assessments include cognitive tests, biomarkers, neuroimaging assessments, functional
      assessments to examine real-world benefits of the interventions, and other behavioral
      assessments to characterize participants and pave the way for further exploratory analyses.

    <description>The memory composite variable consists of the list recall, paragraph recall, and picture sequence memory tasks. For each memory variable, a z score is computed for each participant [(participant score - mean)/standard deviation]. Then the composite memory variable is created by summing up z scores.</description>

    <description>The cognitive control composite variable uses the CVOE, SART, Color Word Interference, flanker, dimensional change card sort, and list-sorting tasks.</description>

    <description>Self-report questionnaires assessed via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) measuring everyday cognition, anxiety, depression, and participation in social roles and activities. The same self-report (non EMA-based) questions will be administered via standard methods to provide cross-validity checks to the EMA questions. Additionally mindfulness and sleep are measured by EMA as a process measure.</description>

    <description>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction consists of a brief introductory meeting, eight weekly 2.5-hour classes, and a retreat, followed by monthly booster sessions for approximately 15 months. Content includes instruction in mindfulness meditation practices, gentle mindful movement, and exercises to enhance mindfulness in everyday life.</description>

    <description>The exercise protocol is optimal for improving aerobic fitness and insulin sensitivity in older adults, as well as improving strength and balance and reducing indices of frailty.It consists of classes twice weekly for 6 months, building up to 1.5 hr, under the direct supervision of trained exercise instructors, followed by once weekly classes for 12 months.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This condition will receive both MBSR and exercise as described above. Participants in this condition will come in once weekly to receive MBSR and twice weekly to receive exercise classes, with at-home exercise the other two days as well as daily, at-home mindfulness practice. After the initial classes participants will also attend additional weekly or monthly sessions until completion of the study.
Note that at each site a pilot group is undergoing MBSR + Exercise (not randomized, separate from the RCT).</description>
