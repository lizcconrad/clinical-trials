  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, controlled clinical trial, in healthy volunteers. They are in two groups
      : the test one will perform the vibration training (1h of Vibrasens 3 times a week, 24
      sessions) whereas the control group will not be training. The primary outcome is the maximal
      voluntary strength.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These last 10 years, a new idea born: vibrations could have potential effects on muscular
      reconditioning. Researchers have previously demonstrated the effects on plantar ankle
      flexion, with the increase of the strength, on healthy volunteers. Nowadays physicians would
      like to demonstrate the effects on another muscular group: ankle's dorsal flexors. 24
      sessions are programmed on 8 weeks.

      Moreover, the last results showed a modification of the nervous capacities of the cortical
      voluntary activation. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a great tool to explore the
      neuromuscular function, at the cortical stage. The use of this tool will allow the
      characterization the effects of the vibration training on the cortical activation state.
