  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia in a geriatric hospital
      ward.

      Sarcopenia is defined by a loss of muscle mass, loss of muscle strength and loss of muscle
      quality. It is a geriatric syndrome that, to this date, is not systematically tracked in
      clinical practice.

      In order to detect sarcopenia, the investigators will use the operational definition proposed
      by the European Working Group (EWGSOP) involving the measure of three parameters, namely the
      speed of walking, the muscle strength and the measurement of the muscular mass.

    <description>The assessment of sarcopenia is performed according to the recommendations of the EWGSOP (European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older people). Three measurements are made:
Muscle mass measurement by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
Walking speed measurement
Hand grip test
A diagnosis of sarcopenia is established if the walking speed is inferior to 0.8 m/sec, the muscular strength is low and the muscular mass is low.
Data regarding the geriatric characteristics of this sarcopenic population will be collected.</description>

        Each patient over 65 years admitted to the unit 83 of the Geriatric Department, CHU
        Brugmann Hospital, from 10/01/2016 till 30/03/2017 undergoes a comprehensive geriatric
        assessment at the end of its hospitalisation stay. The screening for sarcopenia is part of
        this geriatric assessment.
