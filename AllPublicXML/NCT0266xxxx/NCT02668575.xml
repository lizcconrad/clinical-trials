  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals living with cystic fibrosis (CF) commonly report high symptom burden, poor
      quality of life, and additional psychosocial stressors; these burdens are particularly
      heightened in advanced stages of the disease. Although supportive care (aka palliative care)
      has been shown to improve many of these outcomes among patients with illnesses such as
      cancer, no clinical trials to date have tested the impact of supportive care for patients
      with CF. The purpose of this pilot randomized clinical trial study is to evaluate the
      feasibility, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness of an embedded supportive care
      intervention, whereby a supportive care specialist will be integrated within the usual care
      experience of patients with advanced CF. The investigators will enroll 50 patients with
      advanced CF, who will be equally randomized to receive this embedded supportive care
      intervention or usual care. Secondary measures include: patient quality of life, mood, coping
      style, satisfaction with care, and symptom burden. This study will provide preliminary data
      to support the development of a larger, definitive, Phase III randomized clinical trial.

    <description>Patients in the intervention arm of the study will see a SC specialist during regularly-scheduled CF clinic visits; per usual care, these visits should occur on a quarterly basis. Using a structured intervention manual, these visits will span 30-60 minutes each. Each visit will have a specific focus, such as: 1) comprehensive palliative care assessment; 2) symptom assessment and self-management; 3) advance care planning; and, 4) coping and resilience. Patients requiring follow up with SC before the next CF appointment will receive telephone follow up or an extra SC visit at the discretion of the SC provider.</description>
