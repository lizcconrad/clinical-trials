  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this phase I/IIB is to evaluate the safety, the tolerance and the first
      efficacy trends of intracardiac injection of ProtheraCytes (autologous PB-CD34+ Stem Cells
      after automated ex-vivo expansion with the StemXpand machine) in patients with a De Novo
      acute myocardial infarction and decreased ejection fraction. ProtheraCytes will be reinjected
      using a dedicated catheter pushed through the femoral artery up to the left ventricle, thus
      avoiding open chest surgery.
