    <textblock>
      This study is intended to demonstrate that the Simplify® Disc is at least as safe and
      effective as conventional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) when used to treat
      one level between C3 to C7 for cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD) defined as
      intractable radiculopathy (arm pain and/or a neurological deficit) with or without neck pain
      or myelopathy due to a single-level abnormality localized to the level of the disc space in
      subjects who are unresponsive to conservative management.

      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Simplify® Disc for treatment of DDD compared to conventional ACDF for reconstruction of the
      disc space at one level between C3 to C7 for DDD defined as intractable radiculopathy (arm
      pain and/or a neurological deficit) with or without neck pain or myelopathy due to a
      single-level abnormality localized to the level of the disc space that is unresponsive to
      conservative management.

          -  Currently a prisoner;

          -  Currently involved in spinal litigation which may influence the subjects reporting of

          -  Participation in any other investigational drug, biologic or medical device study
             within the last 30 days prior to study surgery.
