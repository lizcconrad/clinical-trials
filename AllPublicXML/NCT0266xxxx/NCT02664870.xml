    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes joints in the human body to deteriorate over time.
      This condition affects more than 250 million people around the globe. Currently, the goal of
      treating osteoarthritis involves reducing the severity and pain that results from the
      disease. The ultimate goal of this study is to identify patients with pre-arthritic joints
      (before symptoms or disease characteristics appear) in an effort to find and use treatments
      that stop or slow the disease. Joints are filled with a naturally occurring liquid known as
      synovial fluid. Molecules (biomarkers) and genetic expression of various cell types within
      synovial joint fluid may serve as measures of onset and progression of osteoarthritis. These
      samples have the potential to improve diagnosis, classification, and treatment, possibly
      changing the natural history of this debilitating disease. The purpose of this study is to
      develop a collection of synovial fluid samples from the shoulder, hip and knee for the
      analysis of biomarkers and cellular and genetic components therein to better understand the
      pre-arthritic joint, progression to disease, and response to interventions.
