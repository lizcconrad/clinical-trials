  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadliest primary malignant neoplasm of
      the central nervous system in adults. Despite an aggressive multimodality treatment approach
      including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, overall survival remains poor.
      Novocure has shown that when properly tuned, very low intensity, intermediate frequency
      electric fields (TTFields) stunt the growth of tumor cells. The Optune system (NovoTTFTM
      Therapy) is a portable battery operated device, which produces TTFields within the human body
      by means of surface transducer arrays. The TTFields are applied to the patient by means of
      surface transducer arrays that are electrically insulated, so that resistively coupled
      electric currents are not delivered to the patient. Optune is currently FDA-approved as a
      single modality treatment for recurrent GBM when both surgical and radiotherapy options have
      been exhausted as well as combination with adjuvant temozolomide for newly diagnosed GBM.

      This research study is being performed to determine whether or not TTFields combined with
      pulsed bevacizumab treatment increases overall survival in patients with
      bevacizumab-refractory GBM compared to historical controls treated with continuous
      bevacizumab alone or in combination with other chemotherapy.

      Subjects who have evidence of bevacizumab-refractory GBM will be eligible to participate in
      this research study. Subjects will undergo 12 months of planned continuous treatment with
      TTFields followed by pulsed bevacizumab treatment when there is evidence of further
      progression per RANO, with the option of extending treatment up to a total of 24 months in
      patients who have not progressed and/or have adequate performance status at the 12 month
      mark. Pulsed bevacizumab dosing is defined by at least one cycle on and at least one cycle
      off. A cycle is defined as 8 weeks in length. If after one cycle on, there is no evidence of
      a repeat response; bevacizumab will be continued for one more cycle. If after two cycles on,
      there is no repeat response; bevacizumab will be continued with or without other standard
      chemotherapy until death. If after at least one cycle on, there is evidence of repeat
      response, bevacizumab will be discontinued for at least one cycle or until progression is
      noted again per RANO, whichever is later, at which time pulsed bevacizumab will be restarted
      as outlined above. The investigators believe that this approach will produce peaks and
      troughs in mitotic activities of glioma cells that render glioma cells more sensitive to the
      antimitotic activity of Optune during peak growth rates, thus lowering disease burden and
      increasing survival. In addition, the following will be performed: Bevacizumab will be given
      at 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Physical examination and quality of life (QoL) assessments will
      be performed bi-monthly. Brain MRI will be performed every 2 months.
