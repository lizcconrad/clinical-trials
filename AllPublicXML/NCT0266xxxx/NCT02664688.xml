      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of pain control and functional
      improvement in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis treated with &quot;lumbar
      stabilization exercises&quot; vs &quot;flexor exercises (williams exercises)&quot;

      This study is a randomized controlled trial in patients with the diagnosis of degenerative
      spondylolisthesis.

      To date, it is known that lumbar stabilization exercises are an effective treatment option in
      controlling pain and improving function in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis based
      on previous studies, but it is not known if is this a better treatment that another exercises
      routine for chronic LBP (Low Back Pain).

      The purpose is to compare the effectiveness on pain control and functional improvement of
      &quot;lumbar stabilization exercises&quot; vs &quot;flexor exercises (williams exercises)&quot;.

      All clinical evaluations are performed by a single physician who is blinded to the exercises,
      and include a full medical history, physical examination, and x-ray measurement.

      After initial evaluation, patients are given a sealed envelope containing the treatment (by
      simple randomization assigned by the investigator). The envelope is opened by the physical
      therapist which schedules a monthly session and verify the correct execution of each
      exercise. Each patient receives a sheet with instructions of the exercises to continue daily
      at home.

      Scales to assess pain and function will be recorded at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 months and at 6
      months to complete the follow up.

    <description>The home-exercise program included an initial phase, with use of therapeutic heat via a hot pack for 15 minutes at the lumbosacral region, stretching exercises of the thoracolumbar fascia, hip flexors, hamstrings plus the stabilization exercises to encourage stabilizing motor patterns and determine the neutral position of the spine, with the target in control of transversus and internal oblique abdominis, multifidus, pelvic floor muscles, and diaphragmatic breathing control. Progression stages included hot packs, stretching exercises, and lateral, anterior bridges, leg raises in supine position, and arm and leg lifts in quadruped position (&quot;bird-dog&quot;)</description>
