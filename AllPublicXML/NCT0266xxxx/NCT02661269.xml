      Can videomicroscopy of the sublingual microcirculation detect the increase in edema before
      peripheral edema will appear? By measuring the decrease in vesseldensity after strong
      positive fluid balances within septic patients versus euvolemic post-cardiac surgery
      patients. Measuring reactance and resistance (BIVA method) to determine volume status.

      Primary outcome:

      - Total vessel density (TVD)

      Secondary outcome:

        -  Fluid balance

        -  BIVA measurements (reactance &amp; resistance)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a lot of methods to determine if a patient is fluid-responsive, however a moment to
      stop fluid therapy is lacking. So the purpose of this study is to find a 'stop' moment for
      fluid therapy before peripheral edema will be present.

      With sublingual measurements of the vessel density with the Cytocam-IDF, comparing the septic
      patients with fluid overload , euvolemic post-cardiac surgery patients at the arrival on the
      ICU and healthy volunteers we can determine if there is a decrease in vessel density during
      fluid loading.

      To give a accurate view on fluid overload we include a bio-impedance measurement of reactance
      and resistance. Fluid balances are recorded very accurate by our electronic patient record.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in vessel density (mm/mm2) of the sublingual microcirculation between the two groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>Cardiac surgery within 4 hours of ICU admittance, 1 offline total vessel density measurement, Septic patients +/- third day of ICU admittance, 1 offline total vessel density measurement.</time_frame>
    <description>With the Cytocam-IDF we make movies off the sublingual microcirculation for 6 seconds on 3 different spots, with offline analysis we calculate a mean total vessel density (total surface of vessels divided by total area surface).
The cardiac surgery group will be measured within 4 hours of admittance on the ICU. The septic patients group will be measured on the moment that the highest fluid balance during the ICU stay, so on the moment that there will be started with diuretics of renal replacement therapy to induce a negative fluid balance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The correlation between a increasing fluid balance and the total vessel density in both groups separately.</measure>
    <time_frame>The cumulative fluidbalance (L) will be noted at the same moment as the microcirculation movies are made, this will be the cumulative fluid balance as measured on the ICU.</time_frame>
