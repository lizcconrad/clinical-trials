    <textblock>
      This prospective, monocentric, non-invasive clinical study is designed to measure normal
      structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer,
      and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is conducted in normal,
      healthy volunteers and glaucoma patients. The main goal of the study is to provide an
      analysis of the comparability of these parameters between two different software versions and
      their respective method of scan centration on the optic disc center. The study will include
      at least 40 eyes of 40 subjects; 20 normal, healthy subjects and 20 glaucoma patients. All
      subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination, and
      visual field testing in one single visit. Total study duration (first patient first visit to
      last patient last visit) is anticipated to be approximately 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, give consent, and to follow
             instructions

          -  Subjects that understand the nature of the trial

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Age : 18 years or older

          -  For &quot;normal subjects&quot;, &quot;normal&quot; means, there is no reason that would prevent imaging
             of the eye, therefore:

          -  Self-reported healthy eyes without prior intraocular surgery (except cataract surgery
             and laser in situ keratomileusis) and without clinically significant vitreal, retinal
             or choroidal diseases, diabetic retinopathy, or disease of the optic nerve (e.g.
             impacting central VA or RNFLT measurements as determined by the expertise of the
             investigator)

          -  Visual field GHT within normal limits

          -  For &quot;glaucoma subjects&quot;: Early to advanced glaucoma according to existing medical
             charts and visual field GHT outside normal limits on at least two occasions during the
             testing.

          -  Refraction between +6 and -6 diopters spherical equivalent and astigmatism ≤ 2
             diopters

          -  When both eyes are eligible, one randomly selected eye will be evaluated in the
             analysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vulnerable subjects (as defined in ISO 14155 GCP)with the exception of employees of
             the site, and , if applicable, students of the respective university. Staff that is
             directly involved in the study is excluded from participation.

          -  subjects unable to read or write

          -  Unreliable visual field. The reliability indices should be used as guide as well as
             the perimetrist's notes.

          -  Unusable disc stereo photos.

          -  Inability to undergo the tests.

          -  Insufficient quality of Spectralis OCT images (this is not determined until after
             Spectralis OCT examination, and is an unusual circumstance).

        Minimum requirements are:

          -  Retina completely included in image frame,

          -  Quality Score ≥ 20 in the stored ART mean images, and

          -  For ONH-R scan: Center position error ≤ 100 μm.

          -  Note: Inability of a subject to perform one of the two scan patterns or insufficient
             image quality in one scan pattern does not exclude the subject or eye from the study.
