  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer that has recurred within 12
      months of prior treatment that includes Platinum Chemotherapy are invited to take part in
      this study. This research study is studying a combination of a new chemotherapy drug called
      Ricolinostat together with the chemotherapy Paclitaxel and a drug called Bevacizumab as a
      possible treatment for this diagnosis.

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ricolinostat as a treatment
      for any disease. The FDA has approved Paclitaxel as a treatment option for Ovarian, Fallopian
      Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer . The FDA has approved Bevacizumab in combination with
      chemotherapy as a treatment option for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer .

      In this study, we are hoping to learn what is the highest dose of Ricolinostat that can be
      given safely together with Paclitaxel on a weekly basis or with Paclitaxel on a weekly basis
      and Bevacizumab every other week. Ricolinostat is a drug that stops cancer from growing by
      blocking the action of a protein called HDAC.

             for management of primary disease (e.g., a regimen containing carboplatin, cisplatin,
             or another organoplatinum compound). This initial treatment may have included
             intraperitoneal therapy, consolidation, biologic/targeted (non-cytotoxic) agents
             (e.g., bevacizumab) or extended therapy administered after surgical or non-surgical
             assessment.

        Participants are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted
        (non-cytotoxic) therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen.

          -  Participants must have recurrence within 12 months of their last platinum-containing

          -  The effects of both paclitaxel and oral ricolinostat on the developing human fetus are
             unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. In
             addition, no small molecule kinase inhibitors or any other type of investigational
             agent may have been administered within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment.

          -  Prior treatment with weekly paclitaxel for recurrent or persistent disease is not
             allowed. Participants may have received weekly paclitaxel as part of treatment for
             newly diagnosed cancer, but may not have received it as maintenance therapy following
             their initial therapy with platinum and taxane therapy.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic

             this study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with chronic viral illnesses such as HIV-positivity and active hepatitis B or
             C are ineligible because they are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy.

             obstruction

          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies as noted below, are excluded
             if there is any evidence of other malignancy being present within the last three
             years. Patients are also excluded if their previous cancer treatment contraindicates
             this protocol therapy.

               -  Carcinoma in situ of the breast or cervix

               -  Primary endometrial cancer meeting the following conditions: Stage not greater
                  than IA, grade 1 or 2, no more than superficial myometrial invasion, without
                  vascular or lymphatic invasion; no poorly differentiated subtypes, including
                  papillary serous, clear cell, or other FIGO grade 3 lesions.

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor OTHER
             THAN for the treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer within
             the last three years are excluded. Patients may have received prior adjuvant
             chemotherapy for localized breast cancer, provided that it was completed more than
             three years prior to registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or
             metastatic disease.

          -  Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease. This includes:

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as systolic greater than 140 mm Hg or
                  diastolic greater than 90 mm Hg despite antihypertensive medications.

               -  Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to registration.

               -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater congestive heart failure.

                  ventricular rate.

               -  Any history of congenital long QT syndrome

               -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula
                  (QTcF) &gt;500 ms within 28 days before randomization. Note: if initial QTcF is
                  found to be &gt; 500 ms, two additional EKGs separated by at least 3 minutes should
                  be performed. If the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is ≤500
                  ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard.

          -  Patients with serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days before
