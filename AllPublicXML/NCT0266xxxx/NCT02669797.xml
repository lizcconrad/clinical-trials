  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed Family Matters study is an 18-month, individual randomized controlled
      superiority trial (RCT) aiming to decrease childhood obesity in children ages 5-7 years old
      by increasing family meal quality (i.e., dietary intake, emotional atmosphere) and quantity
      (i.e., frequency of family meals) via innovative technology (i.e., ecological momentary
      intervention (EMI), video feedback). The RCT is a three-arm superiority trial including the
      following three arms: (1) Education (Edu)+EMI; (2) Edu+EMI+Video feedback; and (3) Attention
      Control. Delivery of the intervention will last 12 months for each family, which includes a
      12-week maintenance phase. The study will last 18 months, with four assessment time points
      including, baseline, 9 months, 12 months (i.e., post-intervention), and 18 months (i.e.,
      6-month post-intervention).

      The proposed study is an 18-month, individual randomized controlled superiority trial (RCT).
      The main aim of the study is to decrease childhood obesity in children ages 5-7 years old by
      increasing family meal quality (i.e., dietary intake, emotional atmosphere) and quantity
      (i.e., frequency of family meals) via innovative technology (i.e., ecological momentary
      intervention (EMI), video feedback). The RCT is a three-arm superiority trial including the
      following three arms: (1) Education (Edu)+EMI; (2) Edu+EMI+Video feedback; and (3) Attention
      Control. Delivery of the intervention will last 12 months for each family, which includes a
      12-week maintenance phase. All three arms will receive primary care visits with 5-2-1-0
      obesity prevention messages. The two experimental arms will additionally receive twelve
      in-home training visits focused on family meal quality and quantity and then will receive
      either EMI family meal tips via smartphones, or EMI family meal tips with video feedback. The
      attention control group will receive messages on general child health delivered in a similar
      manner and frequency as the experimental arms. After families have completed nine months of
      the study, a maintenance phase will ensue for three months. Having a maintenance phase is
      evidence-based and will provide incrementally less support to families to allow for
      self-efficacy to increase and sustainability of new behaviors to occur. For study arms 1 and
      2, EMI meal tips will be reduced to only the days in which parents report their highest
      stress levels. For participants in study arm 2, video feedback will be reduced to once per
      month. The attention control arm maintenance phase will include reductions in text messages
      and video-recorded tips at a similar frequency as arms 1 and 2. The study will last 18
      months, with four assessment time points including, baseline, 9 months, 12 months (i.e.,
      post-intervention), and 18 months (i.e., 6-month post-intervention). The eligible child and
      multiple family members (i.e., parent/primary caregiver, siblings) from low-income and
      diverse households (i.e., African American, Hispanic, Native American, White)--who are at
      greatest risk for obesity--will be recruited for the study. Additionally, partnerships with
      existing community-based healthcare systems will be utilized to reach participants in
      community settings where they have existing relationships and resources. This study utilizes
      innovative and research-informed intervention components (i.e., in-home visiting, EMI,
      video-feedback) to increase the likelihood of intervention effectiveness and sustainability.
      The &quot;Family Matters Intervention&quot; study will be carried out across two Phases, an R61 Phase
      and an R33 Phase. Main aims for each Phase are described below: Specific Aims for the R61
      Phase: Aim 1: Organize and prepare the study team, project materials, study protocols and
      procedures. Success of Aim 1 will be measured by meeting established R61 Planning Phase
      transition milestones. Aim 2: Test recruitment, evaluation, and intervention protocols in the
      first 24 (2 per race/ethnicity and study arm) eligible participants. Aim 2 success will be
      achieved by meeting transition milestones related to screening, enrollment, assessment,
      intervention delivery, and retention. Specific Aims for the R33 Phase: Aim 1: Conduct a
      three-arm RCT comparing Education (Edu)+EMI, Education+EMI+video feedback, and attention
      control arms in children ages 5-7 years old and their families to test the hypotheses that:
      Hypothesis 1: Family meal quality and quantity will increase in households with children in
      the Edu+EMI+ video feedback arm compared to children in the Edu+EMI or attention control
      arms. Hypothesis 2: Diet quality will increase and BMI z-score/BMI percentile will decrease
      in children in the Edu+EMI+video feedback arm compared to children in the Edu+EMI and
      attention control arms; family meal quality and quantity will mediate this association. Aim
      2: Examine intervention effects on parent and sibling weight and weight-related behaviors.
      Hypothesis 1: Restriction and pressure-to-eat feeding practices will decrease and coping
      skills will increase in parents in the Edu+EMI+video feedback arm compared to the Edu+EMI and
      attention control arms. Hypothesis 2: BMI z-score/BMI percentile will decrease in siblings in
      the EMI+video feedback arm compared to Edu+EMI and attention control arms.

    <masking_description>Like most behavioral interventions, it is not possible to double blind this RCT because interventionists will be delivering the in-home visiting components to participants. However, the proposed study incorporates participant, study staff, physician, and investigator blinding as much as possible. The intervention will be administered by trained staff assigned to the intervention team, who will not be involved with evaluation team responsibilities/meetings. Evaluation team members will carry out all measurement home visits and will be blinded to participant study arm assignment. They will not be involved with intervention team responsibilities/meetings. Specific co-investigators are responsible for training and supervising staff within the intervention team versus the evaluation team in to order to blind as many co-investigators as possible. In addition, physicians who will be a part of carrying out the 5-2-1-0 obesity prevention messages in the primary care clinics will be blinded.</masking_description>

    <description>During yearly well child visits at the child's primary care clinic, physicians will deliver obesity prevention messages (5=servings of fruits and vegetables/day; 2=hours of physical activity or more/day; 1=hour of screen time or less/day; 0=servings of sugary drinks). Standard work/protocol for physicians is that they walk through the brochure with parents providing education on each element of the 5-2-1-0 messages and encourage parents to set a goal in one of the areas. While 5-2-1-0 messages are not universally delivered at well-child visits, all clinics in the proposed study use 5-2-1-0 messages as part of their standard work. Thus, there is no risk of contamination across study arms. All study arms will receive the 5-2-1-0 obesity prevention messages from their primary care physicians.</description>

    <description>Families in Arms 1 and 2 will participate in twelve in-home visits (one per week for 12 weeks). The visits will focus on family meal quality (dietary, interpersonal) and quantity (meal frequency) factors found in prior studies to be associated with child weight and weight-related behaviors. Each home visit will last 90 minutes and will be delivered by behavioral health and dietitian team members using Motivational Interviewing, psychoeducation (e.g., topics related to both meal dietary quality and interpersonal quality), and SMART goal setting (i.e., specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound goals). Additionally, six of the twelve visits will include a family meal food preparation activity.</description>

Parents will receive daily EMI messages with suggestions for increasing meal quality/quantity via a smartphone app, based on the stress level and source of stress they reported earlier in the day via a push notification. Based on the reported stress level and source of stress, parents will be texted tips for carrying out a nutritionally and emotionally healthful family meal the same night, in the face of stress. Participants will use their own smartphone or a study smartphone. In addition, parents will be able to respond to the EMI messages indicating preferred tips so that EMI tips become more meaningful/relevant. The EMI tip will be time-stamped and whether the tip was accessed will be recorded.</description>

        STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA

        The inclusionary criteria used to select participants for the proposed study includes:

          1. Boys and girls (n=376) ages 5-7 years old who attend a University of Minnesota
             Physicians (n=4) or Fairview (n=8) primary care clinic and their primary caregiver
             (e.g., mother, father, grandparent) and at least one sibling. A second primary
             caregiver and other family members can also participate.

          2. Must eat ≤3 family meals per week. Research shows that youth who have more than three
             family meals per week are less likely to be obese ten years later. Thus, families who
             report three or fewer family meals per week will be recruited to optimize the
             potential for change in family meal frequency. Families will choose which meal (i.e.,
             breakfast, lunch, dinner) they would like to focus on to improve their family meal
             quality and quantity. This decision is based on: (1) Family Systems Theory, which
             indicates that change in one setting (e.g., family dinner) will generalize to other
             settings (e.g., breakfast, lunch, snacks); (2) prior research showing that families
             benefit from family meals eaten any time in the day (i.e., breakfast, lunch, dinner),
             and (3) to allow flexibility for families' preferences and schedules.

          3. Child with age and sex adjusted BMI ≥85th percentile (no upper limit).

          4. One of the following race/ethnicities: African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native
             American, or White. In order to examine racial/ethnic differences in study hypotheses,
             94 children per racial/ethnic group (total=376) will be recruited.

          5. Parent and family members who speak English or Spanish.

          6. Not expected to move within the next two years.

        STUDY EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        The exclusionary criteria used to exclude participants from the proposed study includes:

          1. Children with special dietary, physical, or behavioral needs (reviewed by MD from
             primary care clinics).

          2. Non-custodial parents, who the child does not live with more than 50% of the time.
