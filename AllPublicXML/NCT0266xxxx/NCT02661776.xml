  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellular immunity can be changed after surgery and anesthesia. Tissue injury by surgical
      procedures significantly reduces the immune function in proportion to the degree of tissue
      injury. In addition, the use of opioids as analgesics during the perioperative period depress
      cellular immunity, in particular the activity of the natural killer (NK) cells. This
      perioperative immunosuppression may cause deleterious consequences on postoperative outcome
      in cancer patients. The aim of this study is to confirm the presence or extent of the change
      of NK cell activity between before and after head and neck surgery. Additionally,
      investigators will identify the clinical or genetic factors related to the change of NK cell
      activity.

    <description>Preoperative NK cell activity will be measured using the NK vue diagnostic test before surgery and anesthesia. Postoperative NK cell activity will be measured using the NK vue diagnostic test after 24 hours since stopping the use of intravenous remifentanil as analgesics during anesthesia in the operating room or sedation in the intensive care unit.</description>
