      Multicenter, observational study to evaluate if there is a difference between the final
      position of the femoral stem and the last trial rasp when using the SL-PLUS™ MIA Ti/HA
      femoral hip stem with the appropriate set of instruments.

          -  Advanced hip joint wear due to degenerative, post-traumatic or rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Fracture or avascular necrosis of the femoral head

          -  Follow-on conditions after previous surgery such as osteosynthesis, joint
             reconstruction, arthrodesis, hemiarthroplasty or total hip replacement.
