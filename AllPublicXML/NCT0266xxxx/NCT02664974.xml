      Phase III, medical, multicentric, controlled, open label, two-parallel groups, randomized,
      clinical trial.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of home enteral nutrition on the
      nutritional status, the quality of life and tolerance to chemotherapy, in malnourished
      patients who undergo major gastrointestinal surgery for malignancy (oesophagus, stomach,
      pancreas, biliary tract). Patients were randomized to receive either home enteral nutrition
      (HEN, treatment group) or nutritional counselling (control group).

    <description>Home Enteral Nutrition was planned to cover the basal energy requirement calculated with Harris Benedict Formula, it was administrated preferentially during nocturnal hours as an integration of oral diet.
Enteral Nutrition included any standard polymeric formula providing 1-1.5 Kcal/mL with carbohydrates 50%-60%, lipids 25%-35% and protein 12%-20%.
Home Enteral Nutrition can be withdrawn in the treated group, after 2 months from discharge, whenever a weight gain ≥ 5% is reported, and oral alimentation is regular and adequate.</description>

    <description>Specific nutritional advices including total energy and protein requirements were provided to patients and oral high-calorie supplements were prescribed whenever necessary.
Home Enteral Nutrition can be started in patients of the control group, not before two months from discharge, if a further weight loss ≥ than 5% is reported.</description>
