             refractory AML is defined as either (1) primary induction failure (PIF) after 2 or
             more cycles of chemotherapy, (2 first early relapse after a remission duration of
             fewer than 6 months, (3) relapse refractory to salvage combination chemotherapy
             containing high-dose AraC, and (4) second or subsequent relapse

          -  Have documented CD45 expression by leukemic cells via flow cytometry (a &quot;blast gate&quot;
             on CD45 vs. side scatter analysis consistent with AML)

          -  Be at least 55 years of age

          -  Have a circulating blast count of less than 10,000/mm3 (control with hydroxyurea is
             allowed)

          -  Have a calculated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault equation) &gt; 50 mL/min

          -  Have adequate hepatic function (bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT), defined as ≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal [ULN])

          -  Have a Karnofsky score ≥ 70

          -  Have an expected survival of &gt; 60 days

          -  Have a central venous catheter line in place prior to study treatment administration

             or utilize acceptable contraception (intrauterine, injectable, transdermal, or
             combination oral contraceptive) through 1-year post transplant; Males who are sexually
             active with women of childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or using an
             acceptable method of contraception (defined as barrier methods in conjunction with
             spermicides) from time of screening through 12 weeks after last dose of study drug

             two different ECG readings and at least 15 minutes between readings)

          -  Have current or prior positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
             hepatitis B (HBV) or C. Subjects who have positive HBV test results due to having been

             surface antigen (HBsAg), negative anti- hepatitis B core protein (HBc) and positive
             antibody to the HBsAg (anti-HBs) are not excluded

          -  Have active serious infection uncontrolled by antibiotics or antifungals

          -  Have active malignancy within 2 years of entry. Active malignancy is defined as those
             malignancies requiring treatment with anti-cancer therapy or in the event of indolent
             malignancies, having measurable disease. Exceptions to this exclusion include:

             intraepithelial neoplasia, and successfully treated organ-confined prostate cancer
