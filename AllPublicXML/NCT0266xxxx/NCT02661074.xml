  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anisakidae frequently infect fish species that are commonly eaten by humans. Some of them are
      recognized as zoonotic agents, and have a high impact on human health.

      Infestation results from the ingestion of living larvae from contaminated fishes. It can be
      asymptomatic or symptomatic, resulting in acute gastric, acute intestinal or chronic forms.
      Allergic manifestations are frequently encountered in gastric forms, but isolated allergic
      symptoms can occur after ingestion of Anisakidae antigens in raw or cooked fish. Cutaneous
      contact or Anisakis allergen inhalation have also been reported to induce
      allergy/anaphylactic reactions or sensitization in the occupational setting in Spain, Italy,
      Sicilia or South Africa. But no data is available in France.

      In this context, the investigators propose to determine and compare the frequency and
      characteristics of fish allergy in fish workers (fishermen and fish-processing factory
      workers) and a control population of workers without occupational exposure to fish, in
      Boulogne-sur-Mer, which is an important fishing port in France, and the first European center
      for fish processing.

      162 fishermen, 162 fish-processing factory workers, and 162 control subjects will be
      consecutively recruited by their occupational doctor during a routine consultation. A
      standardized questionnaire will be used to collect epidemiological and clinical data on
      potential allergic manifestation resulting from digestive, cutaneous, or respiratory contact
      with fish. Domestic and occupational risk factors for fish and Anisakis exposure will also be
      collected for both allergic and non-allergic patients.
