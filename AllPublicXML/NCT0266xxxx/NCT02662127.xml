  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous disease effects 25% of the population and most healthy people experience venous
      symptoms after standing for too long. The prime function of leg veins is drainage. Failure
      leads to a condition called chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) with leg pain, heaviness,
      swelling, varicose veins, ankle skin changes, eczema and occasionally venous ulcers. The aim
      of the study is to identify blood components (biomarkers) that occur during the damaging
      phase of standing versus the healing phases of lying recovery and with medical compression
      stockings. This will be achieved by taking a blood sample from the ankle region at 3 separate
      visits (days) to the vascular laboratory at Ealing Hospital. The first visit will be after
      supervised standing for 1 hour. The second after supervised lying and the third standing
      whilst wearing a medical compression stocking. Healthy volunteers will be compared to
      patients with advanced CVI.

      The potential importance to patients and the public is threefold. Firstly, biomarker profiles
      will be obtained in each of the 3 states to increase understanding in the cellular mechanisms
      of damage and recovery. In this way &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; biomarkers can be identified. Secondly,
      drug treatments may develop from this research to adjust biomarkers towards a favourable
      profile. Thirdly, the success of treating CVI with surgery, venous intervention or
      compression can be monitored. Whilst it is known that relief of gravitational stress is the
      treatment for all forms of CVI, the mechanisms of repair and its discrimination from damage
      have yet to be identified.

      It is well known that graduated elastic compression stockings (GECs) provide a favourable
      environment by off-setting the damaging effects of dependency, reducing leg oedema,
      preventing leg ulceration and in symptom relief. On a haemodynamic level, their mechanism of
      action in augmenting the venous return has been quantified. However, on a molecular level,
      their action in modulating local endogenous biomarkers towards a favourable profile is poorly
      understood. This requires further investigation.

      Our hypothesis is that there are two types of biomarkers: (i) damaging inflammatory
      biomarkers which are increased after prolonged gravitational dependency, (i) healing
      reparative biomarkers which are increased after prolonged elevation recovery. Local venous
      blood samples draining the area of investigation may be more representative of loco-regional
      processes than systemic blood samples from the arm.

      This is a single centre, collaborative, interventional, controlled, proof-of-concept trial.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of GEC stockings on modulating
      biomarkers towards a healing profile.

      Planned interventions:

      There will be 4 study visits per subject.

        1. Recruitment, patient selection, distribution of information leaflets and consent form,
           explanation of the demands of the study, claiming of expenses, duplex scanning and visit
           scheduling.

        2. Formal consent. Blood test. The stage of &quot;damage&quot; will be in the afternoon after
           standing all morning plus an hour of extra standing in the laboratory.

        3. Blood test. The stage of &quot;healing&quot; will be in the morning after nocturnal sleep plus an
           hour of extra elevation (20 degrees elevated from supine) in the laboratory.

        4. Blood test. The stage of &quot;treatment&quot; will be from the effects of a class II below knee
           stocking after standing all morning plus an hour of extra standing in the laboratory.

      All venous blood will be taken from the ankle region. The samples will be taken during a
      gravitational stress, after elevation recovery and after the therapeutic effect of the
      compression stocking. These specifications must be met with due care and diligence to ensure
      that the results are meaningful. The samples will be collected in citrated tubes, centrifuged
      at 5,000 rpm for 10 minutes to achieve platelet poor plasma and stored at -20 degrees for
      batch analysis.

      Proposed biomarkers for quantification:

      Radox (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1α, IL-1β, MCP-1, EGF) and
      D-dimer.

      Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-12 and
      MMP-13) and also 4 tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3 and TIMP-4).
