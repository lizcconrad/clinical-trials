      Any adult patient age18 and above, scheduled for routine CTA of the chest or chest, abdomen
      and pelvis meeting inclusion criteria and not meeting any exclusion criteria will be included
      in the study. The patient will be administered a low dose of intravenous contrast based on
      the study examination.

      Any adult patient age18 and above, scheduled for routine CTA of the chest or chest, abdomen
      and pelvis meeting inclusion criteria and not meeting any exclusion criteria will be included
      in the study. The patient will be administered a low dose of intravenous contrast based on
      the study examination as described below.

      CTA of the chest: 40 mL of intravenous contrast at a rate of 5mL/sec. A region of interest
      (ROI) to trigger the scan will be placed in the aortic arch. If scan is performed using high
      pitch helical mode, the scan delay will be increased by 2 seconds.

      CTA of the chest and abdomen or CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis: 50 mL of intravenous
      contrast at a rate 5mL/sec. A region of interest (ROI) to trigger the scan will be placed in
      the aortic arch. If scan is performed using high pitch helical mode, the scan delay will be
      increased by 2 seconds.

      Following the examination, the primary investigator (PI) or team members will evaluate the
      images obtained with low contrast dose and each patient's prior CTA examination performed
      with routine contrast dose. This will be done by quantitative and qualitative measures. For
      the quantitative portion, the PI or team members will place regions of interest on
      predetermined arterial locations to obtain measure the degree of opacification. For
      qualitative measurement, the images will be presented in a blind fashion to two thoracic
      trained board certified radiologists and a board certified interventional radiologist to
      determine the quality of the images based on a Likert numerical scale. Qualitative and
      quantitative data for the images obtained with low contrast dose and those for the prior CTA
      examinations performed with routine contrast dose will be compared. This data along with
      details of the scan protocol (dose, dose rate, scanning parameters etc.) and demographic data
      (such as sex, age and BMI at the time of examination) will be recorded.
