    <textblock>
      This is a three arm, patient subtyping and parameter optimisation study for a neuromodulation
      treatment for tinnitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with chronic tinnitus will be provided with a CE marked neuromodulation device.
      Devices will be programmed with one of 3 stimulation parameter settings. After 12 weeks of
      use, differences in tinnitus severity scores will be compared between the 3 arms and within
      the arms for patient subtype analysis.
