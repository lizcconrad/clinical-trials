      This is a non-controlled, open label, Phase II Study of ipilimumab combined with a
      Stereotactic Radiosurgery. The study included an induction phase of four IV infusions of
      Ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks associated with a stereotactic radiosurgery performed 3
      days before 2nd ipilimumab administration. A Maintenance phase included Ipilimumab, IV, 10
      mg/kg once every 12 weeks, starting at week 24, in the absence of PD, unacceptable toxicity
      or withdrawal of consent or disease progression. The primary objective is the overall
      survival. The Secondary objectives include safety, ORR, PFS and peripheral blood absolute
      lymphocyte count (ALC) as a predictive biomarker.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to give written informed consent.

          2. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. Patient eligible to single dose Stereotactic Radiotherapy (Radiosurgery) as per the
             pluridisciplinary committee.

          4. Neurologically asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients. Patients with moderated
             neurological symptoms without systemic corticosteroids treatment can be included.

          5. Less than 4 brain metastasis at the MRI. Brain metastasis should measure less than 3
             cm in diameter. At least one brain metastasis &gt; 5mm.

          6. Maximum one prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease is allowed.

          7. Prior treatment with INTERFERON in the adjuvant setting is authorized. Prior treatment
             with anti-CTLA-4 is NOT authorized.

          8. ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1

          9. Within the last 2 weeks prior to study day 1 the following laboratory parameters,
             which should be within the ranges specified:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient requires concomitant chronic treatment with systemic corticosteroids or
             any other immunosuppressive agents 7 days prior to inclusion.

          2. Neurological symptoms treated with systemic corticosteroids (whatever the dose of
             corticoids).

          3. The patient has concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, that
             would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to
             unacceptable risk such as but not limited to: Cardiac insufficiency (III or IV as per
             NYHA classification), Renal insufficiency, ongoing infection.

          4. Any symptom of concomitant tumour meningitis

          6. Any concurrent malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix (Subjects with a previous malignancy but without evidence of disease for 5
             years will be allowed to enter the study)

          7. Uncontrolled infectious diseases - requires negative tests for clinically suspected

             Investigator and the Medical Monitor.

             excluded from this study as are subjects with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g.,

             Erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]).

          9. Subjects with motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain Barré
             Syndrome) are excluded from this study

         10. Previous treatment with a CTLA-4 antagonist agent, including treatment in adjuvant
             setting.

         11. The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability
             to give informed consent or to comply with the trial procedures.

         12. Lack of availability for clinical follow-up assessments.

         13. For female patients: the patient is pregnant or lactating.

         14. Women of childbearing potential: refusal or inability to use effective means of
