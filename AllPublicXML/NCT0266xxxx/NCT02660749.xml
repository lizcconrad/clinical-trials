      This prospective study analyzed surgical thoracotomy and sternotomy patients treated with
      analgesic drug when higher than 4 regularly. Clinical parameters include general
      demographics, preoperative and postoperative clinical examination status, pain scores,
      neuropathic pain scores, medication side effects, additional analgesic, antiemetic and
      lacsatif needs, vital functions, chest drains, blood transfusion needs, duration of
      cardiopulmonary bypass, cross clamp time and anaesthesia time. The screening tests for
      neuropathic pain is the Douleur Neuropathique 4. Using at postopertative 3.month DN4
