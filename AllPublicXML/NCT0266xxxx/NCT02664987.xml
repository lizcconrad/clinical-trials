  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned to investigate the pain control status in cancer patients in 6 South
      East Asian countries through evaluation of prescription pattern of analgesics, satisfaction
      of pain control, quality of life and assessment of the adequacy of pain control and
      relationship among these factors in cancer patients with pain. Cancer pain is undermanaged
      and it is hoped that this study will be used as a reference for effective cancer pain
      management in these countries.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prescription Pattern of Analgesics (Opioid or Non-opioid)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>At Visit 1 (Day 1) which was the only visit in the study, data was collected on whether each patient was receiving only opioid, only non-opioid or both opioid and non-opioid analgesic treatments for pain control.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction With Patient's Pain Control as Measured by 5-point Scale Answered by Patients and Investigators</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The scale used to measure a patient's satisfaction with pain control ranges from 1 to 5:
Very satisfied
Satisfied
Acceptable
Dissatisfied
Very dissatisfied
Patients and Investigators will each indicate their opinion on separate scales.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life as Measured Using EQ-5D-3L Questionnaire Answered by Patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L summary indices were calculated using the algorithm developed based on the valuation of EQ-5D-3L health states from an adult Thai population (Tongsiri &amp; Cairns, 2011). Applying the Thai algorithm, EQ-5D-3L summary indices range from -0.45 to 0.80, with an EQ-5D-3L summary index of 0.80 indicating the best overall health-related quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of Pain Currently and Over Past 24 Hours as Measured by NRS Scores Indicated by Patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Past 1 day up to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patients indicated their pain intensity using a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).
Their current pain intensity and pain in the last 24 hours were indicated on separate scales. A higher score indicates higher pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Disturbance Within Last 7 Days Assessed Using Questionnaire Answered by Patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Past 7 days up to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Patients answered &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the following question:
&quot;Have you had trouble sleeping due to your cancer pain within the last 7 days?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Performance Status as Measured by Investigator's Rating on ECOG PS Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) scale ranges from 0 to 4:
0- Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction
Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work
Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours
Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours
Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed or chair
A higher score indicates greater functional impairment.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-3L summary indices were calculated using the algorithm developed based on the valuation of EQ-5D-3L health states from an adult Thai population (Tongsiri &amp; Cairns, 2011). Applying the Thai algorithm, EQ-5D-3L summary indices range from -0.45 to 0.80, with an EQ-5D-3L summary index of 0.80 indicating the best overall health-related quality of life.</description>

        <description>The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) scale ranges from 0 to 4:
0- Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction
Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work
Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours
Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours
Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed or chair
A higher score indicates greater functional impairment.</description>
