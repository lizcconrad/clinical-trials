  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most devastating disorder worldwide. Hypertension has been confirmed to
      be a major modifiable risk factor for stroke.Even the casual visit hypertension has been
      managed ideally,there is still surplus risk for stroke re-attack.The purpose of this study is
      to explore whether variation of 24-hour ambulatory and visit-to-visit blood pressure
      variability (BPV) contribute to recurrent stroke.

      System hypertension has been reported to play the most important role in the development of
      stroke,and the anti-hypertension therapy is regarded as the cornerstone for stroke secondary
      prevention. However, even though some proper measures have been taken,there is still surplus
      risk for recurrent stroke. Recently the variation of system blood pressure has been focused
      as the candidate of another risk factor.Up to date,this hypothesis remains an intense debate
      and few studies has been done to clarify it.Besides, the definition of BPV and measurement of
      BPV parameters are still beyond conformity.In the current study, the long-term and short-term
      BPV will be taken respectively for patients with prior stroke. Bsed on these parameters, the
      cohort will be followed up for average 2 years. The predefined outcome include composite
      cardiovascular events, neuropsychiatric wording, and mortality during followup.
