      The purpose of this study is to quantify certain risks, and predictors of the risks,
      associated with the long-term use of ER/LA opioids for the treatment of chronic pain using
      coded terms in large health databases maintained by healthcare providers and health insurers
      using validated measures of these risks developed in companion studies and in parallel with a
      prospective, questionnaire-based cohort study of these risks.

        The source populations will be those members of the selected health plans and insurance
        programs identified for which full demographic, provider, facility and pharmacy data are
        available, and in which protected health information (PHI) can be linked to death
        certificate information.

        The four large healthcare systems that have established electronic databases for studying
        coded terminology outcomes selected for this study are: Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW);
        Group Health Cooperative (GHC); Optum with access to the Optum Research Database (ORD),
        containing United Healthcare commercial insurance data; and Vanderbilt University with
        access to Medicaid data for the State of Tennessee (TennCare)&quot;
