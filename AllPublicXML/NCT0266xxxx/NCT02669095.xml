      This study is a multi-site, 5-visit dispensing, bilateral double-arm parallel group design,
      double-masked clinical trial using an investigational contact lens and a marketed contact
      lens. The objective is to evaluate comfort of the contact lenses when worn on a daily wear
      modality.

    <measure>Acceptable Lens Fitting</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Lens fit was assessed and recorded for each subject and eye at post lens fitting, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4- week follow-up evaluations. Lens fit was a binary response acceptable and unacceptable lens fit. The proportion of eyes with acceptable lens fitting at post lens fit and across all four follow-ups was combined and reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Clue comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. CLUE Comfort was assessed at 1-, 2-, 3 and 4- week Follow-up evaluations. The average CLUE comfort score for each lens was reported for each visit.</description>

             this clinical protocol.

          -  The subject must be between 18 to 40 years of age at the time of consent.

          -  The subject's vertexed spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the range
             of +8.00 to -12.00 in each eye.

          -  Subject wears habitual contact lenses a minimum of 4 days per week, eight hours per
             day.

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye.

          -  The subject must be a habitual frequent replacement daily wear spherical silicone
             hydrogel soft contact lens wearer in both eyes.

          -  The subject must be able to wear contact lenses for a minimum of 8 hours each day
             during the study.

          -  The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be
             discontinued).

          -  Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          -  Any known sensitive/allergic to Ingredients of OPTI-FREE® PureMoist® solution.

          -  Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of
             recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or moderate or above corneal distortion.

          -  Any grade 3 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal neovascularization,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          -  Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days
             prior to study enrollment.

        <title>Acceptable Lens Fitting</title>
        <description>Lens fit was assessed and recorded for each subject and eye at post lens fitting, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4- week follow-up evaluations. Lens fit was a binary response acceptable and unacceptable lens fit. The proportion of eyes with acceptable lens fitting at post lens fit and across all four follow-ups was combined and reported.</description>

        <title>Overall Comfort</title>
        <description>Clue comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. CLUE Comfort was assessed at 1-, 2-, 3 and 4- week Follow-up evaluations. The average CLUE comfort score for each lens was reported for each visit.</description>
