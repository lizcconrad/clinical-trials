      The purpose of this study is to collect a multi-institutional database including all relevant
      data regarding the surgical and clinical features of patients underwent to laparoscopic
      lavage for complicated colic diverticulitis. The main objectives are:

        -  To determine the surgical and clinical outcomes, in the short and long term.

        -  To compare results according to the different type of techniques, device used and manner
           of execution of the different surgical steps.

        -  To relate results of different surgeries with baseline characteristics of patients and
           stage of disease.

      The purpose of this study is to collect a multi-institutional database including all relevant
      data regarding the surgical and clinical features of patients underwent to laparoscopic
      lavage for complicated colic diverticulitis. The main objectives are:

        -  To determine the surgical and clinical outcomes, in the short and long term.

        -  To compare results according to the different type of techniques, device used and manner
           of execution of the different surgical steps.

        -  To relate results of different surgeries with baseline characteristics of patients and
           stage of disease.

      This &quot;ad hoc&quot; registry will allow centers to retrospectively fill in the data of their
      patients; the information will be obtained from existing records, diagnostic tests and
      surgical intervention descriptions. Data will be collected and recorded by all institutions
      through a specific online shared system.

      To facilitate and standardize data collection through a shared database and to ensure the
      safety of sensitive data, a special online computerized web system has been developed.

      Investigators have to provide the required data as fully as possible; however, the lack of
      certain data does not preclude from sending the remaining data.

      Specific aims

        -  Analyze general outcome

        -  Analyze the different techniques of laparoscopic lavage

        -  Analyze the different inclusion criteria

        -  Analyze the different follow-up

      Primary outcome for this retrospective observational study is:

      the success rate of laparoscopic peritoneal lavage, defined as the rate of patients alive
      with no need of further surgical treatment for recurrent attacks of diverticulitis.

      Secondary outcomes are:

        -  conversion to any form of laparoscopy different from peritoneal lavage (with or without
           bowel resection)

        -  conversion to laparotomy (with or without bowel resection)

        -  30 days post-operative mortality;

        -  30 days post-operative surgical re-interventions rate;

        -  30 days post-operative percutaneous drainage rate;

        -  hospital readmission rate for recurrence of diverticulitis;

        -  - rate of visualisation of colonic perforation during laparoscopic peritoneal lavage;

        -  surgical strategies used in case of detection of a colonic perforation;

        -  consistency, if any, of visceral adhesiolysis performed during the procedure;

        -  duration of follow-up

        -  post-lavage elective resection rate (lavage &quot;bridge&quot; to resection)

      Eligibility Each patient is required to meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria.
