    <textblock>
      Doctor's attire acts as an important criteria in setting up good relationship between patient
      and physician. Recent evidence as well as strong viewpoints have highlighted the possible
      harm of wearing a white coat. In order to get the patient's perspective on the same, this
      observational study is being conducted to determine the effect of wearing a white coat on
      patient satisfaction in an Indian setting , in patients who visit rheumatology outpatient
      department,in Columbia Asia Hospitals,Bangalore,India.
