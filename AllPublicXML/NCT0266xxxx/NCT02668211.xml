  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this study to investigate the primary stability of
      its PROFEMUR® Preserve Femoral Components using radiostereometric analysis (RSA). RSA allows
      precise measurement of micromotion around orthopedic implants and hence, may estimate
      long-term fixation to bone.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the stability of the PROFEMUR® Preserve Classic stem with RSA to estimate its long-term performance.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the quantity of migration to determine if the total migration of the stem and cup at 2 years post¬operatively are less than 1.2 mm and 2.6mm, and also less than 0.4mm. Assessment of continuous migration to determine if continuous migration, defined as 0.2mm of motion between 1 and 2 years as measured with RSA exists in the stem and cup.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the migration patterns of the PROFEMUR® Preserve Classic stem with RSA</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of migration in each individual plane (x, y, and z), as measured in mm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess if migration pattern is greater than 0.2mm between 1 and 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if the wear rate device is substantially less than the scientifically accepted threshold of 0.1 mm/year for osteolysis. The outcomes will be compared to data from the literature, which states that motion greater than 0.2mm between 1 and 2 years suggests an implant is at risk for early loosening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient functional outcomes (HOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective is to determine if there is a significant difference in health status and functional outcomes (using the HOOS questionnaire) before and after total hip arthroplasty (THA) using the PROFEMUR® Preserve Femoral Components.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a candidate for primary THA for osteoarthritis

          -  Subject is able to undergo primary THA procedure

          -  Subject is a candidate to be implanted with the specified combination of components

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete required study visits and assessments

          -  Subject is willing to sign the approved Informed Consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any of the following contraindications at the time of the implantation:

          -  Overt infection;

          -  Distant foci of infections (which may cause hematogenous spread to the implant site);

          -  Rapid disease progression as manifested by joint destruction or bone absorption
             apparent on roentgenogram;

          -  Skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age at time of surgery);

          -  Inadequate neuromuscular status (e.g., prior paralysis, fusion, and/or inadequate
             abductor strength), poor bone stock, poor skin coverage around the joint which would
             make the procedure unjustifiable;

          -  Subjects 76 years of age or older

          -  Subjects with post-traumatic arthritis in the affected hip

          -  Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis in the affected hip

          -  Subjects with hip dysplasia in the affected hip

          -  Subjects with prior arthroplasty of the affected hip

          -  Subjects that are morbidly obese (BMI &gt; 35)

          -  Subjects that are immuno-suppressed

          -  Subjects with known or tested-positive allergy to metals

          -  Subjects currently enrolled in another clinical investigation which could affect the
             endpoints of this protocol

          -  Subjects unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document

          -  Subjects with substance abuse issues

          -  Subjects who are incarcerated or have pending incarceration
