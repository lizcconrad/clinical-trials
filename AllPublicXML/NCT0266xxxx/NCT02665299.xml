  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the DNA inside of human cells undergoes certain alterations (mutations), the cells may
      develop into a cancer. The cancer cells may shed this DNA into the blood stream. This
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be detected by very sensitive, specialized laboratory
      tests. Measurement of ctDNA has been shown to be useful for following patients with known
      cancer. It has also been found in the circulation of some patients with early stage cancer.
      The purpose of this study is to examine blood specimens for the presence of ctDNA in
      individuals without known cancer who are scheduled to undergo a screening or diagnostic
      colonoscopy in order to see if the ctDNA test can detect a cancer or precancerous condition
      at a very early stage before the patient becomes symptomatic. The results of this study
      should help define the role of ctDNA in the detection of early stage colon cancer and to
      define how sensitive it is (i.e. how well it picks up cancer when it is present) and how
      specific it is (i.e. how often is ctDNA found in patients with benign diseases or no
      abnormalities).

      After the participants have undergone the informed consent process, they will have 30
      milliliters (approximately two tablespoons) of blood drawn. This will be done prior to their
      scheduled screening or diagnostic colonoscopy. If the patient has indicated a desire to
      receive the results of their test, they will receive a written description, as will their
      primary care physician. The patients will be contacted yearly for up to 5 years by the study
      staff to learn whether they have been found to have a diagnosis of colon or other cancer.

      Blood is drawn and DNA is purified from the plasma. The DNA is analyzed for circulating tumor
