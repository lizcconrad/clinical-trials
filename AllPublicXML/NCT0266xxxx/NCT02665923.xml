    <textblock>
      Ultrasound imaging will be used to (1) evaluate gastric antral volumes in children presenting
      for anesthesia who have been fasted, and (2) to evaluate time for gastric emptying in
      healthy, fasting newborns, and infants following feeding of clear liquids and/or milk
      (including breast or formula).

      This dual-purpose study will have two wings. The first involves recruitment of fasted
      patients presenting for elective procedures at CHONY. These patients will undergo one
      ultrasound prior to their elective procedure after induction of general anesthesia.

      The second wing involves serial ultrasounds over several visits. Healthy newborns in the
      Newborn Nursery will be recruited to conduct this study. The initial pilot period will study
      a total of 30 healthy newborns who will be given formula feeding of known volume, and then
      serial ultrasound imaging of gastric antral volume will be performed until gastric emptying.
      Study willl perform follow up of these newborns at two later time intervals (between ages 4-6
      months, and 9-12 months). The purpose of follow-up is to evaluate whether there are
      age-related changes in gastric emptying.

        nursery. Any child in the well-baby nursery is eligible. Our initial pilot period will
