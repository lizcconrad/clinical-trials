    <textblock>
      Since its introduction in the late 1990s, immediate implant loading concepts (IL) have become
      a frequent alternative for delayed implant procedures. IL concepts reduce chair time, the
      number of surgical interventions and pain, and offer instant comfort to the patient. Its
      reduced treatment time results in obvious socioeconomic advantages. Although there is at
      present abundant evidence that supports IL, evaluation of long-term biological and mechanical
      stability outcomes of large patient populations could allow quality improvement and more
      accurate patient selection. The Departments of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the
      Department of Dentistry of the General Hospital Saint-John Bruges act as one of the pioneers
      of IL in Belgium, routinely performing the concept since 2001.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the biological and mechanical short- and long-term outcome
      of IL in partially or completely edentulous patients. Moreover, the investigators aim to
      detect potential influencing risk factors predicting undesirable prosthetic outcome.

        Patients of all ages with loss of all or almost all teeth due to terminal periodontal
        disease and/or untreatable endodontic problems, that requested treatment according to the
        IL protocol between 01/01/2001 and 31/12/2015. Patients should have adequate bone volume to
        predominantly receive an implant of ≥13x3.5mm anteriorly and an implant of ≥9 x 3.5mm
        posteriorly. All patients, with or without a pre-prosthetic sinus floor augmentation, are
        included in de study.
