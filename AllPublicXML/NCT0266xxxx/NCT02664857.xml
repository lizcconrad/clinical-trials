      In this study, effect of vitamin D supplementation on postoperative pain and
      sedation-agitation will investigate. Children with mental motor retardation between 7-17 age
      which dental treatment will be performed under general anaesthesia will be included in this
      study. 600 IU vitamin D will apply to group D per orally during 12 weeks. Group P will not
      take anything during 12 weeks. At first day and end of the 12 weeks, serum vitamin D,
      calcium, alkaline phosphatase, terminal telopeptide C(β-CTX) level will evaluate. At the end
      of the 12 weeks general anaesthesia will be performed for teeth check up, flouring, scaling
      polishing, tooth extraction, filling applications, amputations, root canal treatment. After
      then postoperative pain, sedation and agitation will be evaluate. All data will be
      statistically evaluate at the end of the study.

      Vitamin D deficiency could seem in children with mental and motor retardation. Some
      researches show that vitamin D supplementations can reduce pain. In this study, the
      researchers aimed to show effect of vitamin D supplementation on postoperative pain and
      sedation-agitation. These children which will be applied dental treatment under general
      anaesthesia included in this study. All subjects randomly divided to the two groups. Every
      group will include 30 subject. Group D included mentally retarded children which will take
      daily 600 IU orally vitamin D supplementation during 12 weeks. In the other group(group P)
      mentally retarded children will not take any supplementation during 12 week. At the first day
      and last day(after 12 weeks) of study, blood sample will take from all subject. Serum vitamin
      D, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, terminal telopeptide C(β-CTX) level will evaluate in this
      sample at the end of the study. All samples will be frozen and stored until testing. All
      children will be operated under general anaesthesia. Propofol 2mg/kg, rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg
      will apply for anaesthesia induction. Anaesthesia will maintain with sevoflurane and oxygen-
      nitrous oxide mixture. Non-communicating Children's Pain Check-list and Ramsey sedation scale
      will apply all children after postoperative care unit. All children will be evaluate every 15
      minutes. After data collection, all data will be analysed with statistically.
