    <textblock>
      Newly diagnosed WHO grade IV malignant glioma subjects who are eligible will be enrolled
      following surgery to remove the brain tumor. They will then undergo a leukapheresis to
      harvest cells for the generation of the study drug, Epidermal Growth Factor variant III
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor (EGFRvIII CAR) T cells prior to beginning standard of care (SOC)
      radiation therapy (RT) with temozolomide (TMZ). Once SOC RT with TMZ is completed, subjects
      will return for the post-RT brain imaging assessment, and if stable will start post-RT TMZ
      cycles. Patients will receive up to 3 cycles of dose intensified TMZ prior to receiving the
      EGFRvIII CAR T cells, which will be infused in dose escalation cohorts. Following a one month
      delay between cycles, the subject will resume post-RT cycles of TMZ and be monitored with
      blood work and brain imaging as per SOC. Once the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is reached
      in the dose escalation cohorts, an expanded cohort of 12 subjects will be enrolled to obtain
      a more precise estimate of the probability of unacceptable toxicity and to track the EGFRvIII
      CAR T cells using 111 Indium (111In) labeling. Computed Tomography (CT) will be done on days
      1, 2, and 3 post-infusion to determine intracerebral (IC) localization.

      Following consent, subjects will be enrolled onto dose-escalation cohorts. Patients will
      undergo leukapheresis to harvest Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) for the
      generation of EGFRvIII CAR T cells prior to beginning RT and concurrent TMZ. T cells will be
      isolated from the patient's PBMCs and transduced to express the CRA. Briefly, PBMC will be
      stimulated with Muromonab-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) (OKT3), an anti-CD3 monoclonal
      antibody (mAb) and transduced on RetroNectin® coated plates. Transduced cells will be
      expanded in interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 14 days.

      Patients will then complete standard of care RT and concurrent TMZ. Patients who remain
      eligible after standard of care radiation and TMZ will receive up to 3 cycles of TMZ at
      50-100 mg/m^2/day for 21 days of 28 day cycles, which is the standard dose-intensified (DI)
      TMZ regimen. If the CAR-specific T cells do not meet release criteria, the patient will be
      withdrawn before CAR treatment and replaced.

      At least 48 hours after the last dose of DI TMZ, the total dose of EGFRvIII CAR T cells will
      be delivered intravenously. If sufficient CAR-specific T cells cannot be generated to meet
      the targeted assigned dose within the dose-escalation portion of the study, the patient will
      be treated at a lower pre-defined dose level using available CAR-specific T cells and
      replaced in the assigned higher dose. The administered dose will be the highest defined dose
      level for which there are sufficient CAR-specific T cells available. Within the expanded
      cohort, if sufficient CAR-specific T cells can't be generated to meet the MTD dose, all
      available T cells will be administered.

      Following the infusion of EGFRvIII CARs, blood samples for immune monitoring will be drawn 1,
      5, and 10 days after the infusion, then 1, 3, and 6 months, then yearly until progression (or
      death or lost to contact). The return visits for immune monitoring at 3 months, 6 months, and
      yearly will coincide with standard of care clinic visits. Blood will also be taken for
      Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) per the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) at 3, 6 and 12 months during standard of care clinic visits. Lastly,
      blood for evaluation of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) will be drawn prior to cell infusion,
      1 and 4 hours after infusion, and on days 1, 2, 5, 10, and at one month. Measurements for CRS
      include IL-2, IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα), interferon (IFN) gamma,
      Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

      Patients will return to clinic one month following the EGFRvIII CAR T cell infusion to be
      evaluated for cycles of standard of care 5-day TMZ at 150-200 mg/m^2/day for the first 5-day
      cycle, followed by 200 mg/m^2/day for 5-days every 28 days per the treating oncologist. This
      will result in a &gt;30 day delay between the last cycle of DI TMZ and the first cycle of 5-day
      TMZ.

      Tumor progression will be documented histologically, unless there are clinical
      contraindications, to exclude inflammatory responses presenting as radiographic or clinical
      changes, which could indicate a potentially toxic or therapeutic responses and not tumor
      progression. If tissue is obtained through Tissue Bank Consent Institutional Review Board
      (IRB) # 2635, it will be used to confirm tumor progression histologically, and to assess
      immunologic cell infiltration and EGFRvIII antigen escape at the tumor site. Patients will be
      eligible for additional adjuvant therapy at the time of tumor progression.

      A classical &quot;3+3&quot; study design will be used to estimate the MTD for CAR-specific T cells
      treatment among patients with newly-diagnosed GBM. Four dose levels will be considered: #1:
      4.5 x 10^6/kg, #2: 1.5 x 10^7/kg, #3: 4.5 x 10^7/kg, and #4: 1.5 x 10^8/kg. Starting with the
      lowest dose level, cohorts of 3-6 subjects will be accrued at each dose level. If a patient
      is lost to follow-up during the first 4 weeks after CAR treatment without experiencing a
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then the patient will not be evaluable for the determination of
      DLT and will be replaced. The MTD is the highest dose level at which ≤1 of 6 patients
      experiences DLT during the 4 week observation period after CAR treatment.

      An expanded cohort of 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD of EGFRvIII CAR T cells in
      order to obtain a more precise estimate of the probability of unacceptable toxicity. This
      cohort will also have the cells radiolabeled with 111In to track their distribution. Briefly,
      CARs will be counted and re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 4-6x10^8 cells will
      be labeled with a total of 500 microCi of 111In. The cells will be washed and mixed with cold
      CARs to achieve the desired cell dose. The labeled CARs will be infused into the patient
      through an intravenous catheter within the Ambulatory Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Unit.
      Distribution of 111In-labeled EGFRvIII CARs will be evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 days
      post-infusion using scintigraphy.

    <description>The name of the drug is CAR gene-modified T cells or abbreviated as EGFRvIII CARs. The class of action is a biological and the mechanism of action is cytotoxicity. The drug substance is autologous T cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directed against the tumor specific antigen, EGFRvIII. EGFRvIII CARs are genetically engineered T cells that have been taken from patients with GBM ex vivo to express a CAR recognizing the GBM tumor-specific antigen EGFRvIII, which is expressed on a subset of GBMs but not in normal human tissues with the aim of mediating regression of their tumors. Patients' CARs will be radiolabeled with 111In for correlative studies in the expanded cohort.</description>
