    <textblock>
      Hypoxic modification of radiotherapy with nimorazole has previously been shown to increase
      radiosensitivity in hypoxic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).

      In Denmark, nimorazole is added the radiotherapy of most HNSCC, as it has not previously been
      possible to discriminate more hypoxic tumours from less hypoxic tumours.

      A hypoxia gene profile has shown to discriminate between responders and non-responders to
      nimorazole.

      In DAHANCA 30, expected hypoxia profile guided non-responders are randomized to +/-
      nimorazole during radiotherapy.This in order to verify clinical use of the gene profile in
      selecting the relevant patients for hypoxic modification of radiotherapy with nimorazole.

    <textblock>
      Hypoxic modification of radiotherapy with nimorazole has in the DAHANCA 5 trial been shown to
      increase radiosensitivity in hypoxic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC).

      Previously, it has not been possible to discriminate more hypoxic tumours from less hypoxic
      tumours. Thus, nimorazole has been added the radiotherapy of most HNSCC.

      Recently, a hypoxia gene profile has been developed, that discriminate between more and less
      hypoxic tumours. The basis of the discrimination is the cumulated expression of 15 hypoxia
      responsive genes, quantified from the tumour biopsy.

      The profile has been validated on the independent DAHANCA 5 cohort. There was a significant
      effect of adding nimorazole to the radiotherapy of more hypoxic tumours as estimated with the
      gene profile, whereas there was no effect of adding nimorazole to the less hypoxic tumours.
      In a test for interaction, there was a significantly different response to nimorazole in the
      more hypoxic tumours compared to the less hypoxic tumours.

      In the Dahanca 30 trial it is aimed to verify, that there is no benefit of supplying the
      radiotherapy of less hypoxic HNSCC with nimorazole. Thus, to explore whether it is possible
      to avoid the sideeffects of nimorazole without risk for the patient.

    <description>Hypoxia gene profile is expected to discriminate between HNSCC responders and non-responders to hypoxic modification with nimorazole during radiotherapy. In DAHANCA 30 expected non-responders are randomized to +/- nimorazole during radiotherapy (non-inferiority study). Thus, similar efficacy of radiotherapy is expected in these groups. More hypoxic tumours receive nimorazole after DAHANCA standards.</description>
