  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to compare the efficacy of the Bridge-Enhanced Anterior Cruciate
      Ligament Repair (BEAR™) technique with the current method of treatment for anterior cruciate
      ligament (ACL) injuries, ACL reconstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients will be randomized to either the Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair (BEAR)
      technique (new treatment) or an ACL reconstruction (current gold standard of treatment).
