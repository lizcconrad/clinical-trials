  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death in North America and Europe. Up
      to 30% of stroke survivors never recuperate completely and suffer from loss of function and
      poor quality of life. To improve recovery after stroke, innovative interventions should be a
      priority.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an intermittent inhalation of 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric
      chamber at a pressure higher than 1 absolute atmosphere (ATA). There is a growing body of
      evidence that HBOT can enhance ability of brain to changes its structure (neuroplasticity) in
      order to recover. Exercise program during HBOT can augment the effect. Although, recent
      randomized controlled trials in patients with chronic brain injury showed promising results,
      there are no studies demonstrating combine effect HBOT and exercise rehabilitation program on
      stroke recovery.

      The proposed study investigates feasibility, safety and efficacy of using a combination of
      HBOT and exercise program to improve arm function recovery in chronic stroke patients. In
      this pilot randomized control trial, investigators will compare the combination of HBOT and
      the focused rehabilitation exercise program versus exercise program alone on recovery of arm
      function in patients with chronic stroke.
