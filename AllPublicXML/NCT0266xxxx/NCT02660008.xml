      The trial is a single-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel trial in Group 1 and
      cross-over trial in Groups 2-4 with single doses of ZP4207 administered s.c. to hypoglycemic
      Type 1 diabetic patients to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ZP4207 as
      compared to marketed glucagon.

             blood glucose control with polyuria, polydipsia, or weight loss), as judged by the
             Investigator.

         20. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become

             contraceptive methods are considered those with a failure rate less than 1% undesired
             pregnancies per year including surgical sterilisation, hormonal intrauterine devices
             (coil), oral hormonal contraceptives, sexual abstinence or a surgically sterilised
             partner) or postmenopausal women being amenorrheic for less than 1 year with serum FSH
