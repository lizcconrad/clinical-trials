    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial using a non-myeloablative cyclophosphamide/ fludarabine/total body
      irradiation (TBI) preparative regimen followed by a related or unrelated donor stem cell
      infusion. The primary objective is to evaluate rates of acute graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD) grades II-IV and chronic GVHD with an updated GVHD prophylaxis of tacrolimus and
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with a non-myeloablative preparative regimen in persons with
      hematologic malignancies.

    <description>All patients will receive tacrolimus therapy beginning on day -3. Initial dosing of tacrolimus will be 0.03 - 0.05 mg/kg/day IV; if the recipient body weight is &lt;40 kg, dosing will be 3 times daily, and if ≥ 40 kg, twice daily or per current institutional guidelines.
An attempt will be made to maintain a trough level of 5-10 ng/mL and subsequent dose modifications will be provided by the pharmacist.
Once the patient can tolerate oral medications and has a reasonable oral intake, tacrolimus will be converted to an oral form based on the current IV dose providing normal renal and hepatic function and no major drug interactions.
The timing of the tacrolimus taper will be at the discretion of the treating physician, but in general:
Taper begins at day +100 +/- 10 days, if the patient is stably engrafted and has no active GVHD.
Taper to zero by reducing dose by approximately 10% a week (rounded to nearest pill size), with a goal to discontinue by month 6 post-HCT.</description>

Pediatric patient (&lt;40 kilograms) will receive MMF at the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours beginning day -3. MMF dosing will be monitored and altered as clinically appropriate based on institutional guidelines. Patients will be eligible for MMF dosing and pharmacokinetics studies.
MMF will stop at day +30 or 7 days after engraftment, whichever day is later, if no acute GVHD. (Definition of engraftment is 1st day of 3 consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count [ANC) ≥ 0.5 x 109 /L]). If no donor engraftment, MMF will continue as long as clinically indicated.</description>
