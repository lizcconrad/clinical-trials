  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to assess the ability of the radiotracer 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 to
      image atherosclerotic plaque that may rupture and break off artery walls. This is caused by
      apoptosis or cell death in the plaque. These ruptured plaques can block blood circulation in
      the arteries causing a lack of oxygen to the tissues. Atherosclerotic plaques can build up on
      any artery in the body.
