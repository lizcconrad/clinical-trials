  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and assess the efficacy of an integrated strategy
      that includes feasible and scalable interventions to identify, recruit, link to care, retain
      in care, attain, and maintain viral suppression among HIV-infected men who have sex with men
      (MSM) in the United States (US).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use deep-chain respondent driven sampling (DC-RDS) and direct recruitment
      (DR) to identify and recruit HIV-infected MSM who are not virally suppressed. A subset of
      these men will be enrolled into one of two study arms. The intervention arm will provide a
      Case Manager (CM) intervention package designed to enhance linkage to care, antiretroviral
      treatment (ART) initiation, treatment adherence and retention in care. The control arm will
      provide the standard of care (SOC) for linkage to care, initiation of ART, treatment
      adherence and retention in care. The primary outcome of the study is viral suppression 24
      months after enrollment. Phylogenetic methods will be used to evaluate the relationship
      between viruses in study participants. Mathematical modeling will be performed using
      demographic, behavioral, and clinical data generated from this study and other sources to
      estimate the population-level impact of the CM intervention on HIV incidence and to estimate
      the level of identification, linkage, ART coverage and viral suppression that would be
      required to achieve a substantial reduction in HIV incidence among MSM in the US settings
      where the study is conducted.
