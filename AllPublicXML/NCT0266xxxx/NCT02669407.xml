    <textblock>
      Patients admitted for acute heart failure and undergoing right heart catheterization will be
      enrolled in this study. Subjects will undergo catheterization of the heart to obtain central
      cardiac pressure and other cardiac hemodynamic parameters. Subsequently, the subject will
      undergo a regional nerve block of the splanchnic nerves. Patients will remain in the
      catheterization lab for the duration of anesthetic block and will be continuously
      hemodynamically monitored.

      This study will be a prospective, uncontrolled clinical trial. The study will not be
      controlled as invasive monitoring of hemodynamics will be performed, allowing clear
      demonstration of a cause-effect relationship. The goal of the study is to provide proof of
      concept.
