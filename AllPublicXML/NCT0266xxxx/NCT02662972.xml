  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia is one of the strongest pains known to humans. Some patients do not have
      enough effect with the available pharmaceutical treatments and are offered surgery. There are
      different types of procedures and most of them are complex with a risk for complications. The
      researchers want to start a pilot study on 10 patients with a new surgical technique using
      neuronavigation. The target will be a neural structure (sphenopalatine ganglion) which has an
      important role in facial pain. There have been a few trials trying to block this structure in
      trigeminal neuralgia, but none using this new approach with botulinum toxin. The researchers
      technique requires local anesthesia only (awake patient). The researchers believe that this
      treatment can become a &quot;low threshold&quot;-treatment for patients who do not have enough effect
      with pharmacological treatment and a better alternative to other complex surgical approaches.
      Using this new neuronavigation system the researchers can reach this neural structure with
      high precision.
