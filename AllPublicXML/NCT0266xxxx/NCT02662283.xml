      This prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial will evaluate the
      effect and security of reh-acteoside therapy for patients of IgA nephropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reh-acteoside (general acteoside of rehmanniae leaves) contains more than 10 kinds of
      bio-active mucopolysaeccharide, among which acteoside is the most effective ingredient,
      constituting 30 percent. It has been reported that acteoside can reduce mesangium lesion of
      IgA nephrology-model ddy-mice, mainly by reducing the expressing of TGF-β1, reducing
      proliferation of mesangial cell and glomerular sclerosis. Research also suggested that
      conjunctive use of reh-acteoside and benazepril showed better effect on reducing proteinurine
      than single use of benazepril, with no obvious side effect at the same time. Thus, we start
      this clinical trial to evaluate the effect and security of reh-acteoside therapy for patients
      of IgA nephropathy. We set 3 groups: methylprednisolone group, reh-acteoside group and
      methylprednisolone with reh-acteoside group. After followed-up for 8 weeks, remission of
      proteinuria and change of renal function will be evaluated.
