      To test the hypothesis that both lack and excess of growth hormone (GH) is associated with
      cardiac abnormalities. Cardiac function and morphology will be evaluated by MRI before and
      after treatment.

      It is an open prospective noninterventional clinical study. Treatment and follow-up will be
      according to usual guidelines, and will be unaffected by inclusion in the study. GHD patients
      will be treated with daily subcutaneous GH injections. Patients with acromegaly will be
      treated with either transsphenoidal surgery or by medical treatment with long acting
      somatostatin analogues, dopamine agonist, GH antagonist or combinations of these treatment
      modalities.

      Patients will be examined by Cardiac MRI before treatment and after one year of treatment.
