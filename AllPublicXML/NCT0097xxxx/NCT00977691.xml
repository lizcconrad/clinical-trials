    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Bone marrow transplantation (BMT), which involves transplanting a donor s marrow stem
           cells, is capable of curing some congenital anemias. BMT usually involves high-intensity
           treatment with chemotherapy and radiation to kill abnormal cells, which affects all
           systems of the body.

        -  People with anemias often have damage to other organs such as the kidneys, which can be
           further damaged by the chemotherapy. Only approximately 20 percent of patients have a
           full-matched donor, making treatment for many people with anemias unavailable. However,
           90 percent of patients may have a half-matched donor, but using a half-matched donor
           increases the toxicity of BMT.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine if a research BMT with half-matched donor cells, low-intensity radiation,
           immunosuppressant drugs, and no chemotherapy will be effective in patients with sickle
           cell disease and Beta-thalassemia.

        -  To determine the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressant drug, in
           preventing rejection of the donor cells.

      Eligibility:

        -  Recipients are individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with sickle
           cell disease and Beta-thalassemia, and who have a family member who is a haploidentical
           (i.e., half match) tissue match.

        -  Donors are healthy individuals between the ages of 2 and 80 who are found to be suitable
           donors.

      Design:

        -  Donors will undergo apheresis, which involves withdrawing blood from one arm vein,
           passing it through a machine that removes bone marrow stem cells, and returning the
           remaining blood through the vein in the other arm. Donors will receive a drug that
           causes the stem cells to be released into the bloodstream prior to the apheresis
           procedure.

        -  Recipients will undergo routine physical and laboratory examinations, including bone
           marrow sampling at the beginning of the study. After transplantation, physical and
           laboratory examinations will occur on a weekly or twice weekly basis at the outpatient
           clinic. Recipients will be examined every 6 months starting 100 days posttransplant for
           5 years.

        -  Recipients will receive low-dose radiation in two treatments 1 and 2 days before the
           transplant. They will also be given immunosuppressant therapy with alemtuzumab and
           sirolimus. Another immunosuppressant drug, cyclophosphamide, will be given in the future
           as needed to subsets of the recipients to prevent rejection of donor cells.

        -  Recipients will receive the donor stem cells through a previously inserted central line.
           The process takes up to 8 hours.

        -  Recipients will receive blood transfusions as necessary to prevent anemia and bleeding
           during the posttransplant period. They may also receive intravenous antibiotics to
           prevent infection.

      Nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplants are currently being
      investigated in phase I/II trials assessing engraftment, efficacy, and toxicity at a number
      of transplant centers. Our ongoing protocol for patients with severe congenital anemias,
      particularly sickle cell disease (SCD), and an HLA-matched sibling donor has had excellent
      preliminary results. None of the patients who engrafted had sickle-related events or any
      evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD). There was no significant toxicity associated
      with the conditioning regimen.

      Our main limitation has been a lack of HLA-matched sibling donors in the majority of
      patients. We performed a study in which patients with severe SCD who lacked a suitable donor
      underwent a search for a matched unrelated donor or umbilical cord donor. The vast majority
      of patients were not found to have an appropriate alternative donor. We therefore seek to
      develop a safe nonmyeloablative regimen to be applied to the haploidentical setting so that
      family members can serve as donors and greatly expand the donor pool.

      In this protocol, we propose PBSC transplantation in patients with SCD and thalassemia,
      considered at high risk for complications from or ineligible for standard bone marrow
      transplantation, with allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells from a haploidentical donor
      using a novel immunosuppressive regimen without myeloablation in an attempt to further
      decrease the transplant-related morbidity/mortality. The low intensity nonmyeloablative
      conditioning regimen will consist of a relatively low radiation dose for therapeutic
      radiation, Alemtuzumab (Campath ), Sirolimus (Rapamune ), and Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan ) as
      a strategy to provide adequate immunosuppression to allow sufficient engraftment for clinical
      remission with a lower risk of GVHD development. T-cell replete, donor-derived, granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSC will be used to establish hematopoietic and
      lymphoid reconstitution.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the percentage of patients who have sustained donor
      type hemoglobin without significant GVHD for patients with SCD, or who are
      transfusion-independent and without significant GVHD for patients with thalassemia. Other
      endpoints include degree of donor-host chimerism necessary for long term graft survival and
      disease amelioration, incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, incidence of graft rejection,
      transplant-related morbidity, as well as disease-free and overall survival.
