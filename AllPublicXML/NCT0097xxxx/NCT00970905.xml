  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe nausea and/or vomiting in patients receiving radiotherapy to the upper abdomen is
      common despite having received pre-medication with ondansetron, a standard preventive
      treatment. This study aims to reduce the incidence of significant nausea and/or vomiting with
      the addition of the NK1-antagonist aprepitant to standard ondansetron treatment. This study
      will also assess the safety and tolerability of prolonged administration of aprepitant over
      the 4 to 6 week period of radiation treatment.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Any patient with a diagnosis of malignancy localized to the upper abdomen and
             requiring chemoradiation or radiation alone.

          2. Receiving standard-fractionation radiation therapy (&gt; 40 Gy) 3D-conformal radiation
             therapy or IMRT to a field involving the upper abdomen, either alone or combined with
             radiosensitizing 5FU, capecitabine, or gemcitabine permitted.

          3. Age &gt; 18 years old

          4. Life expectancy &gt;3 months

          5. Performance status 0-2 inclusive

          6. No more than mild to moderate hepatic impairment corresponding to Child-Pugh Class A
             or B, respectively (Child-Pugh score 5 to 9). See Appendix V for Child Pugh
             Classification.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception such
             as abstinence or effective barrier and/or non-hormonal contraception for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          8. Adequate organ reserve to include: Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1500/mcl , Hemoglobin ≥
             8.0 g/dl, platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcl, creatinine ≤ 2.0, AST &amp; ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN

          9. Baseline ECG showing QTc value ≤ 480 millisecond

         10. Informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any other concomitant chemotherapy agent concurrently with radiation therapy
             aside from capecitabine, gemcitabine, or 5-fluorouracil (none of these agents are CYP
             3A4 substrates).

          2. Baseline vomiting is not controlled: Patients who have vomited or have nausea
             requiring antiemetic treatment within 24 hours prior to initiation of treatment.

          3. Scheduled to receive treatment within 24 hours prior to day one or during the study
             periods with other potential or known antiemetic agents including but not limited to
             serotonin antagonists aside from ondansetron per study protocol, phenothiazines,
             butyrophenones, substituted benzamides, antihistamines, and cannabinoids. Chronically
             used benzodiazepines may be continued as a single nightly dose for sleep.

          4. Any steroid use except topical steroids. Patients need to be off systemic steroid
             treatment for 7 days prior to start of chemoradiation therapy.

          5. Uncontrolled CNS tumor

          6. Other physical causes for nausea or vomiting (such as bowel obstruction) not related
             to chemoradiation administration

          7. Hypersensitivity to either of the study agents

          8. Planned simultaneous administration of any other investigational agents

          9. Pregnant or nursing women

         10. Patients taking other CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors would be required to discontinue
             their use for at least 7 days prior to initiation of chemoradiation therapy. Examples
             of CYP3A4 inducers include aminoglutethimide, carbamazepine, nafcillin, nevirapine,
             phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. Johns Wort. Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors
             include azole antifungals, clarithromycin, diclofenac, doxycycline, erythromycin,
             imatinib, isoniazid, nefazodone, nicardipine, propofol, protease inhibitors,
             quinidine, telithromycin, and verapamil.

         11. CYP3A4 substrates are not contraindicated. However, patients taking CYP3A4 substrates
             should be cautioned to consult with their physician to minimize their use, if
             possible. Example substrates include benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers,
             ranolazine, ergot derivatives, mirtazapine, nateglinide, tacrolimus, and venlafaxine.

         12. Concomitant use of pimozide, terfenadine, cisapride, and astemizole is contraindicated
             per the Emend™ [10] product circular as dose-dependent inhibition of CYP 3A4 by
             aprepitant could result in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs, potentially
             causing serious and life-threatening reactions. Patients taking these medications
             ineligible to participate in this study unless they are discontinued for at least 7
             days prior to start of aprepitant.

         13. Warfarin: Aprepitant may increase warfarin metabolism and the INR may be decreased.
             Twice weekly monitoring of INR recommended in the first 2-week period of radiation
             followed by weekly monitoring in subsequent weeks until discontinuation of aprepitant.
             Twice weekly monitoring is again recommended after aprepitant discontinuation until
             INR has stabilized.

         14. Contraceptives (estrogens and progestins): Aprepitant may decrease the plasma levels
             of estrogen and progestin contraceptives. Contraceptive efficacy may be reduced. A
             nonhormonal form of contraception is necessary during treatment and for 1 month
             following the last dose of aprepitant.
