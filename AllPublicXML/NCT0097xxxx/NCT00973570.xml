  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Most of the efforts to fight against young people's tobacco addiction have
      focused on smoking prevention and little on smoking cessation. A smoking cessation program,
      associating pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioural strategy, on a particularly vulnerable
      population (vocational trainees), was developed by a team of tobacco addiction specialist
      physicians. We developed a study to evaluate the efficacy of the program. Its main objective
      is to compare the efficacy of a smoking cessation program offered to all smokers in a
      population aged 15 to 20 years in Vocational Training Centers (VTC) with that in a control
      population. The objective of this paper is to present the TABADO study protocol and the
      results of the pilot study.

      Methods: The study is quasi-experimental, prospective, evaluative and comparative and takes
      place during the 2 years of vocational training. The final population will be composed of
      2000 trainees entering a VTC (in Lorraine, France): The intervention group (1000 trainees)
      benefited from the TABADO program while no specific intervention took place in the &quot;control&quot;
      group (1000 trainees) other than the treatment and education services usually available. Our
      primary outcome will be the tobacco abstinence rate at 12 months.

      The pilot study is a descriptive monocentric cross-sectional study conducted among the whole
      group of students, completed by a longitudinal prospective study of smoker volunteers.

    <description>The intervention takes place in 3 stages: (i) a general information session on tobacco consumption is delivered to all teenagers, both smokers and nonsmokers. (ii) For smokers wishing to join the program, this session is followed by individualized consultations with a team of tobacco addiction physicians. (iii) The volunteers then benefit from a small group approach, consisting of discussion sessions to share experiences, strengthen motivation, and prevent relapse. There will be 4 sessions in total, comprising individual counseling and work in groups spread over 3 months (taking into account the availability of the trainees because of their alternate-week training schedule).</description>
