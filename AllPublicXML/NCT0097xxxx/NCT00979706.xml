      Pilot study for the treatment of primary HIV infection with the objective to induce a strong
      specific HIV immune response able to control viral replication without HAART.

    <textblock>
      Pilot and open RCT in 20 patients with primary HIV-1 infection who were randomized to one of
      these two arms: 1) Control arm (A), Tenofovir +Lamivudine + Lopinavir-ritonavir (Kaletra) at
      standard doses for 44 weeks (W44); a short treatment interruption (TI) was performed at W36,
      and HAART was restarted for 8 weeks when plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (pVL) rebounded&gt;200
      copies/mL. At W44 HAART was stopped and patients were followed for 48 additional weeks (W92).
      2) Immune-based arm (B), same HAART schedule plus oral cyclosporine A (CsA)(serum levels
      250-350 mcg/L) for the first 8 weeks of HAART. During the TI, patients received sc GM-CSF
      (250 mcg TIW) plus weekly sc pegylated-interferon a2b (Peg-INF)(1.5 mcg/kg/week). During the
      last 8 weeks of HAART (until W44), patients received daily sc low-dose interleukin-2
      (IL-2)(0.75 MU/kg QD). The primary endpoint was pVL &lt;1000copies/mL (&lt;3.0 log10/mL) at 12
      (W56) and at 48 (W92) weeks after stopping HAART. Sample size was calculated in order to
      detect a pVL difference of 1.5log10 copies/mL at 12 (W56) weeks after stopping HAART between
      the control and the immune-based arms with a power of 80% and a level of significance of0.05.
