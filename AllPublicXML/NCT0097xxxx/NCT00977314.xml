      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using bone conduction
      via the teeth to treat Single-Sided Deafness (SSD).

    <textblock>
      The Sonitus Bone Conduction Device (BCD) is a bone conduction device for single-sided
      deafness (SSD). The Sonitus BCD consists of an Oral Appliance (OA), an external microphone
      component, worn behind the ear (BTE), a calibration interface cable and a PC-controlled
      calibration software for subject calibration. The Sonitus BCD picks up sounds from a
      microphone located within the ear canal of the deaf ear, capitalizing on the acoustics of the
      natural pinna and ear canal. The signal picked up by the microphone is then transmitted
      wirelessly to a removeable bone conduction oral appliance located on the upper molars. The
      oral appliance receives the acoustic signal from the BTE and applies an equivalent vibratory
      signal to the teeth that reaches the skull via bone conduction and routed transcranially to
      the contralateral cochlea.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Device- and Procedure-related Adverse Events at 30 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The safety parameters for the trial were monitored throughout the Evaluation Phase (30 days). The safety checks included:
Comprehensive Medical evaluation at Enrollment and at Termination Comprehensive Dental evaluation at Enrollment and at Termination, with interim dental checks at each visit in between, if needed Comprehensive Audiological evaluation at Enrollment and Termination.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy: Ability to Understand Speech in Noise</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy outcome was a measure of the ability to understand speech in noise while wearing the device compared with not wearing the device. The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) was utilized for this measure as it is the most widely used test for SSD devices. An improvement in HINT score is indicated as a negative (-) dB value change. A more negative (-dB) value indicates an improvement in understanding speech in noise. An improvement in a HINT score of -1 dB is equivalent to a 10% improvement in the ability to understand speech in noise and is likely of clinical benefit. The scores are calculated as HINT Advantage (aided compared with unaided) which depict the differences of using a device as compared to not wearing a device.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of Benefit of SoundBite Using Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB).</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of the benefit of the device was assessed using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), a 24-item self-assessment inventory in which the amount of difficulty in everyday situations is reported with larger numbers indicating more difficulty. Device benefit is calculated by subtracting the score obtained after using a device from the score obtained before using the device. A software program is utilized to score the APHAB and results are compared a different time points. The APHAB is well characterized and broadly used as a quantifiable measurement of device benefit. The APHAB benefit scores can range from -99 (treatment worse than no treatment) to +99 (treatment better than no treatment)</description>

    <description>The objective of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of the SoundBite hearing system by Sonitus Medical and to support its intended use for the treatment of unilateral hearing loss. The SoundBite hearing system is a Bone Conduction Device (BCD) and is occasionally referred to as such in the protocol and within this report.</description>

        <title>Efficacy: Ability to Understand Speech in Noise</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy outcome was a measure of the ability to understand speech in noise while wearing the device compared with not wearing the device. The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) was utilized for this measure as it is the most widely used test for SSD devices. An improvement in HINT score is indicated as a negative (-) dB value change. A more negative (-dB) value indicates an improvement in understanding speech in noise. An improvement in a HINT score of -1 dB is equivalent to a 10% improvement in the ability to understand speech in noise and is likely of clinical benefit. The scores are calculated as HINT Advantage (aided compared with unaided) which depict the differences of using a device as compared to not wearing a device.</description>

            <description>Effectiveness was defined as “Change from Baseline” analysis of the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), Noise on Better Side Scores between without the BCD at day one and with the BCD at day thirty.Effectiveness was determined as an improvement in the HINT score for which the device was designed, that is, the condition where noise originates on the normal hearing side and speech is presented from the front. .
An improvement in HINT score is indicated as a negative (-) dB value change. A change in the HINT score of -1 dB represents an improvement of 10% in speech intelligibility in that particular test condition. A 10% improvement in speech intelligibility in this very adverse listening condition is a noticeable benefit to the SSD subject. This amount of improvement is even more of a benefit in more realistic, less adverse listening conditions.</description>

        <title>Measure of Benefit of SoundBite Using Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB).</title>
        <description>The measure of the benefit of the device was assessed using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB), a 24-item self-assessment inventory in which the amount of difficulty in everyday situations is reported with larger numbers indicating more difficulty. Device benefit is calculated by subtracting the score obtained after using a device from the score obtained before using the device. A software program is utilized to score the APHAB and results are compared a different time points. The APHAB is well characterized and broadly used as a quantifiable measurement of device benefit. The APHAB benefit scores can range from -99 (treatment worse than no treatment) to +99 (treatment better than no treatment)</description>

            <description>The Global Benefit APHAB at 30 days is the change in APHAB scores between the unaided score at the start of the study and the APHAB score after 30 days of therapy. The APHAB questionnaire produces an overall Global score (GBL). The benefit provided by the SoundBite System can be determined by comparing changes in the mean APHAB score. The larger the APHAB benefit score the great the benefit. A negative APHAB score represents therapy resulting in a worse outcome than no therapy.</description>
