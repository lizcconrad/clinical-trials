  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW642444 is a potent and selective long-acting beta2 agonist; GSK573719 is a long-acting,
      inhaled, muscarinic receptor antagonist (or anticholinergic) bronchodilator. Both are in
      development as once daily (QD) monotherapies for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Development of these two inhaled drugs as a combination therapy is
      also planned and would have potential for improved efficacy and patient benefit as they both
      work through different receptor pathways and the combined bronchodilatory effect might be
      additive.

      This study is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study which
      will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      GSK573719 and GW642444 in sixteen healthy Japanese subjects. Subjects will receive four
      possible treatments as single inhaled doses, receiving the two monotherapies separately, the
      monotherapies concurrently, and placebo.

      Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be
      assessed by measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, ECG and twenty-four hour Holter
      monitoring, potassium, safety laboratory data and review of adverse events.

    <description>This is a four-way cross-over study. Subjects, healthy volunteers, will receive a single dose of GSK573719 (500ug), GW642444 (50ug), GSK573719 (500ug)+GW642444 (50ug) administered concurrently, or placebo at each of the four treatment periods. There is a minimum wash-out period of seven days between doses. On enrolment into the study, subjects will be assigned to one of four treatment sequences which are based on a Williams design in accordance with the randomization schedule generated by GSK prior to study start.</description>

             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

             grandparents and able to speak Japanese.

          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history
             (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked))

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject

          -  The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  Available to complete the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically important abnormality identified at the screening medical assessment
             (physical examination/medical history), clinical laboratory tests, or ECG (12-lead). A
             24hr Holter monitoring recording outside normal limits.

          -  A history of breathing problems (i.e. history of asthmatic symptomatology, unless
             asthma in childhood that has now resolved and no longer requires maintenance therapy
             which should not be an exclusion).

          -  A mean QTc(B) value at screening &gt;450msec, or an ECG that is not suitable for QT
             measurements (e.g. LBBB or poorly defined termination of the T wave).

          -  A history of elevated resting blood pressure or a mean blood pressure higher than

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates and
             benzodiazepines. The detection of drugs with a legitimate medical use would not
             necessarily be an exclusion to study participation. The detection of alcohol would not
             be an exclusion at screening but would need to be negative pre-dose and during the
             study.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

        than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an
        average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). Under Australian guidelines, one
        standard unit defined as 10g of ethanol, is equivalent to 250ml of full-strength beer, 470
        ml of light-strength beer, 100 ml of wine and 30ml of spirits.

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol. 17.
             Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history of regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products prior to screening.

          -  The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to ipratropium bromide,
             tiotropium, atropine and any of its derivatives.
