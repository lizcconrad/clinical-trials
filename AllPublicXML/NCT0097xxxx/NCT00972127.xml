      Primary:

        -  To assess the influence of acidified urinary pH on the renal excretion of Neramexane

      Secondary:

        -  To assess the influence of acidified urinary pH on the renal excretion of N-OH
           Neramexane

        -  To assess the steady state plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of Neramexane and N-OH
           Neramexane under physiological conditions and under the conditions of urine
           acidification

        -  To assess safety and tolerability of a repeated dose treatment of Neramexane under
           physiological conditions and under the conditions of urine acidification
