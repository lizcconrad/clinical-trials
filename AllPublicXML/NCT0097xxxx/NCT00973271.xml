  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that DCCR is effective as both monotherapy and in combination
      with a statin in lowering triglycerides in subjects with very high triglycerides
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very high triglyceride is a risk for pancreatitis. Studies have shown Diazoxide Choline has
      the potential to effectively lower triglycerides in patients with very high triglycerides.
