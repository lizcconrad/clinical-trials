  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study, randomized, single-blind, dose-ranging, multicenter study, will evaluate
      immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of two doses of adjuvanted and not-adjuvanted new
      swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus monovalent subunit vaccine in healthy children and
      adolescents. A booster dose will be administered 12 months after the first vaccination.
