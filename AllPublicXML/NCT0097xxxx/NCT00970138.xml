    <textblock>
      Apatinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor (VEGFR), and it's anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The
      investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the maximum
      tolerable daily dose is 850 mg. The purpose of this study is to determine whether apatinib
      can improve progression free survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic
      gastric carcinoma who failed two lines of chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Up to now, although FU based, cisplatin based and taxane based regimen, and ECF regimen have
      been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA, the efficacy of these treatment is
      still unsatisfied for their toxicity and limitation in prolonging survival. Based on the
      promising results of apatinib in the phase I study, this clinical trial has been designed to
      evaluate whether apatinib can improve progression free survival in patients with metastatic
      gastric carcinoma who failed two lines of chemotherapy compared with placebo. Patients will
      be randomized to 3 groups, one group patients will receive the treatment of apatinib 850mg
      qd, one group patients will receive apatinib 425mg bid, and the other group will receive
      placebo.
