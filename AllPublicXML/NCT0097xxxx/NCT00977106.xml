  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the onset and maintenance of effect of tocilizumab on relief in
      patients with active moderate or severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate
      response to DMARDs or anti-TNF. For the first, double-blind, part of the study patients will
      be randomized to receive an iv infusion of either 8mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo. After 4
      weeks this will be followed by 11 months treatment with tocilizumab 8mg/kg iv infusion every
      4 weeks. Methotrexate or DMARD therapy will be continued throughout study treatment. Target
      sample size is &gt;100.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significant Improvement in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI includes 20 questions concerning participant's activities of daily life, grouped in 8 scales of 2 to 3 questions for each activity. To respond to each question, a four-level response (score of 0 to 3 points), with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Scoring was as follows with respect to performance of participant's everyday activities: 0 (equals)=without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3=unable to perform these actions at all. Minimum score was 0, maximum score was 3. Relevant clinical improvement was defined as a reduction of at least 0.22 points in HAQ-DI.</description>

    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant's health status. Baseline = Last available value before Day 0 (screening or Day 0) for participants with first tocilizumab infusion at Day 0 and last value available before Week 4 (Week 1 or Week 4) for participants with first tocilizumab infusion at Week 4.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significant Improvement in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 4</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI includes 20 questions concerning participant’s activities of daily life, grouped in 8 scales of 2 to 3 questions for each activity. To respond to each question, a four-level response (score of 0 to 3 points), with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Scoring was as follows with respect to performance of participant’s everyday activities: 0 (equals)=without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3=unable to perform these actions at all. Minimum score was 0, maximum score was 3. Relevant clinical improvement was defined as a reduction of at least 0.22 points in HAQ-DI.</description>

        <description>Synovitis was assessed by ultrasonography (B-mode ultrasound and Power Doppler) and scored from “0” to “3”, for each of 40 joints (5 metacarpal phalangeal [MCP; left and right] joints, 5 proximal interphalangeal [PIP; left and right] joints, left and right wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles, and 5 metatarsal phalangeal [MTP; left and right] joints); synovitis scores were calculated by adding the sum of scores for each joint for a total score ranging from 0 to 120. A score of 0 indicated no damage and a score of 120 indicated most severe damage. Baseline = Last available value before Day 0 (screening or Day 0) for participants with first tocilizumab infusion at Day 0 and last value available before Week 4 (Week 1 or Week 4) for participants with first tocilizumab infusion at Week 4.

        <title>Synovitis Score During the Double-Blind Treatment Period Assessed Using Power Doppler Ultrasound</title>
        <description>Synovitis was assessed by ultrasonography (B-mode ultrasound and Power Doppler) and scored from “0” to “3”, for each of 40 joints (5 MCP [left and right] joints, 5 PIP [left and right] joints, left and right wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and ankles, and 5 MTP [left and right] joints); synovitis scores were calculated by adding the sum of scores for each joint for a total score ranging from 0 to 120 (higher score=more severe disease). Baseline = Last available value before Day 0 (screening or Day 0) for participants with first tocilizumab infusion at Day 0 and last value available before Week 4 (Week 1 or Week 4) for participants with first tocilizumab infusion at Week 4. Negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <description>To describe bone mineral density (BMD), standardized values were calculated for lumbar spine, hip, femoral neck, and trochanter, taking into account the type of Dual energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) used. All DXA at baseline were taken into account (done from before screening to Week 8). DXA at end of study were taken into account if they were done after at least 6 infusions of tocilizumab. Values were measured in milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm^2).</description>

Baseline is the closest value +/- 1 month around the first tocilizumab infusion. If values before and after the first infusion were eligible, the value before was taken into account.</description>

        <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness in Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) During the Double-Blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant's health status. Baseline = Last available value before Day 0 (screening or Day 0) for participants with first tocilizumab infusion at Day 0 and last value available before Week 4 (Week 1 or Week 4) for participants with first tocilizumab infusion at Week 4.</description>
