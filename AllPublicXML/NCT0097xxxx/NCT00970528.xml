      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acarbose in comparison
      with voglibose in type 2 diabetic patients whose blood glucose levels were inadequately
      controlled with insulin glargine alone or in combination with metformin.

               -  Treated with tolerable, stable dose of insulin glargine and/or metformin for at
                  least 3 months prior to screening
