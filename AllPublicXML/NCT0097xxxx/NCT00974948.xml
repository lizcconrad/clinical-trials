  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer presents with pain in the majority of cases. Destruction of the celiac
      ganglia by ultrasound guided injection of sclerosing agents such as alcohol is sometimes used
      for pain that no longer responds to treatment with narcotics. The investigators compare
      standard narcotic treatment to celiac plexus alcohol injection (celiac plexus neurolysis) and
      do so in patients with early, mild pain to see if celiac plexus neurolysis is more effective
      than narcotics and prevents escalating narcotic use.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, sham-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy
      of early EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN). &quot;Early&quot; refers to the fact that, in
      contrast to previous CPN trials, we targeted patients with inoperable, painful pancreatic
      cancer in whom pain was mild and who were taking little or no narcotics. Our a priori
      hypotheses were that, compared to conventional management with narcotics alone, early
      neurolysis: 1) will better control pain related to inoperable pancreatic cancer, 2) will
      prevent the escalating use of narcotics associated with disease progression, 3) will improve
      quality of life, and 4) will improve survival. The aim our study is to test these 4
      hypotheses.
