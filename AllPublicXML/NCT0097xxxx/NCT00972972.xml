  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dietary intervention with blueberry and
      grape juice extracts in elderly men with subjective memory problems would raise performance
      on neuropsychological memory tests and change biomarker of muscle damage and whole blood gene
      expression profiles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have shown that increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetable extracts
      high in antioxidants (e.g., blueberries, strawberries and spinach) can retard and even
      reverse age-related decline in brain function and in cognitive and motor performance in rats.
      This is the first placebo-controlled human study to evaluate the effect of dietary intake of
      fruit polyphenols on neuropsychological test scores and whole blood gene regulation

      Sixty-two non-demented, non-depressed men (age 67-77 years) with subjective memory decline,
      were randomly assigned to a blueberry/grape juice- and placebo-group in a 9 week double blind
      intervention study. Pre- and post treatment assessment were measured with a computerised
      neuropsychological test battery (CANTAB), including tests for motor speed, visual reaction
      time, and spatial memory. Dietary habits were registered before intervention and several
      clinical biomarkers were measured in plasma/serum before and after the intervention. Pre- and
      post intervention-samples for measurement of gene regulation were also collected
