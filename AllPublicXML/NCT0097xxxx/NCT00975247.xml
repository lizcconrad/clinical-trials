  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Achievement of colonoscopy outcomes depends on high-quality bowel preparation by
      patients; yet inadequate preparation is common.

      Objective: To develop and test an educational booklet to improve bowel preparation quality.

      Design: &quot;Before-and-after&quot; study followed by randomized controlled trial.

      Setting: Veteran Affairs medical center.

      Patients: Patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopy

      Measurements: The investigators first performed cognitive interviews to identify knowledge
      and belief barriers to high-quality colonoscopy preparation. The investigators then created a
      patient educational booklet addressing patient barriers to improve preparatory behaviors. The
      investigators tested the booklet in 2 sequential studies: (1) controlled &quot;before-and-after&quot;
      study in patients undergoing colonoscopy during 2 consecutive months: 1 without and 1 with
      the booklet; (2) randomized controlled trial. The outcome in both studies was bowel
      preparation quality measured on a 6-point Likert scale (&gt;5=&quot;good&quot;). In each study the
      investigators compared the proportion achieving a &quot;good&quot; preparation between groups and
      performed logistic regression to measure the effect of the booklet on preparation quality
      while adjusting for the purgative received.

      Limitations: Unknown impact on polyp yield and cancer reduction.
