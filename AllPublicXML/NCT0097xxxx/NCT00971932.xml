    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the antitumor activity of cetuximab when
      given in combination with cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for the first-line treatment of
      recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in Japanese
      subjects.

If participant developed non-hematological toxicities to cisplatin, carboplatin (area under curve 5 [AUC5]) was administered as IV infusion over 60 to 120 minutes on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle.</description>
