  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of life and heart health are intimately connected to childhood physical activity
      participation (PAP). Physical activity is critical to childhood growth, development,
      learning, socialization, and quality of life and is an essential component of life-long heart
      health. Research by the investigators of this study and others has shown that low PAP levels
      are common among children with heart defects, and that these sedentary lifestyles are not
      related to exercise capacity, medical status or heart function.

      Therefore, we hypothesize that psychosocial factors are important determinants of PAP in this
      population. Our most recent research with children who have univentricular heart indicates
      that gross motor skill and psychosocial factors are significant correlates of PAP. Important
      psychosocial factors include self-efficacy for activity, uncertainty about activity, and
      inaccurate perceptions of the child's PAP level, options, and abilities. This study seeks to
      determine whether gross motor skill and psychosocial factors influence PAP among children
      with a broad spectrum of cardiac defects. It will also determine the optimal changes to
      clinical care needed to encourage children with heart defects to develop health-related
      active lifestyles.

      We propose a prospective, randomized, cross-over preliminary clinical trial utilizing both
      quantitative and qualitative assessments. Through the cross-over design, each subject will
      complete both interventions (information, demonstration), with the order of intervention
      delivery randomly determined. Quantitative assessments will document moderate-to-vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA), gross motor skill, and health-related fitness. Qualitative
      assessments will evaluate parent/child anxiety about PAP and psychosocial factors influencing
      PAP. All factors will be assessed at each data collection point.

    <description>The demonstration intervention will be designed to demonstrate to the child and parent(s) specifically what the child is able to do in relation to fitness and motor skill activities. The demonstration intervention will consist of having the child complete a standardized exercise testing protocol on the treadmill, followed by discussions with the child and parent(s) to convey the results of the study testing of fitness and gross motor skill.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Successful repair of one of the following congenital heart defects: transcatheter
             device closure of atrial septal defect (ASD), arterial switch repair of transposition
             of the great arteries (TGA), surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), or Fontan
             procedure for a functionally univentricular heart (UVH).

          -  At least one year after most recent open heart surgery.

          -  4 to 11 years of age and attending elementary school at first study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Identification of exercise contraindications/limitations by the responsible
             cardiologist.

          -  Other disabilities or medical conditions that may influence PAP. Children who achieve
             90 minutes of MVPA on 5 or more days per week during the baseline assessment will be
             excluded from the intervention phase. The study interventions are not designed to
             increase MVPA among children who already achieve the Health Canada guidelines for PAP.
