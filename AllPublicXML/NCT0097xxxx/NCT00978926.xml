  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The well-established role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in carcinogenesis and
      tumor angiogenesis has led to the development of agents that target this pathway. Anti-VEGF
      agents the VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, and the small molecule VEGF receptor
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Angiogenic factors play a key role in the maintenance of lung
      integrity and normal endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in
      hypertension, proteinuria and retinopathy. One of the major issues of anti-VEGF agents is its
      long-term toxicity especially taking into account the lack of adequate knowledge in this area
      and the possibility of prolonged periods of therapy in non-progressing patients. Hypertension
      and proteinuria are commonly seen in patients treated with anti-VEGF agents. In addition, the
      investigators have also observed in a relatively high frequency of pulmonary air-filled
      lesions in patients with malignancy in the lung treated with an anti-VEGF agent. Objectives
      of this exploratory study are to 1) determine the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) on endothelial function 2) determine endothelial dysfunction as a marker of
      early response and as an indicator for the development of hypertension and proteinuria 3)
      characterize the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on the pulmonary function of patients with
      malignancy (primary or secondary) involving the lung in patients treated with anti-VEGF
      agents. Pharmacodynamic endpoints to be assessed are: blood pressure, brachial artery
      reactivity, retinal microvessels, microalbuminuria and proteinuria, pulmonary function,
      assess the effects of anti-VEGF therapy by assessing brachial artery reactivity, retinal
      vasculature and pulmonary function in a subset of patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy. The
      development of markers of endothelial dysfunction may result in the early identification of
      patients who are non-responders or develop toxicity from anti-VEGF treatment.

        This study aims to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of anti-VEGF therapy. The following
        groups of patients will be approached:

        Those who are starting on anti-VEGF therapy (such as but not limited to bevacizumab,
        sunitinib, and sorafenib) as part of routine clinical management or on clinical studies

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligibility

          -  Patients who are receiving single agent anti-VEGF therapy

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Patients with measurable pulmonary malignancy (primary or metastatic) as determined by
             RECIST will undergo assessment of pulmonary function

          -  Patients with a known allergy to intravenous contrast used in fluorescein and
             indocyanine green angiography will be exempt from these investigations but will
             undergo other study assessments
