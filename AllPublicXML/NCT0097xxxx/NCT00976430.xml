      This study is intended to look at the safety and efficacy of the use of autologous bone
      marrow derived stem cell transplant in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, still at its best can only be controlled
      by medical or surgical treatment. For more than two decades various groups have tried using
      modified cell transplants for curing this disease. Earlier results with use of fetal
      mesencephalic cell transplant were encouraging, but this had to be discontinued due to severe
      side effects.

      Current interest, in the use of Mesenchymal stem cells as a pluripotent cell for developing
      neural cells has been the background for this study. Reliance Life sciences had found
      encouraging results with the use of human MSCs in Rat model of PD. Based on this and other
      data, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre has initiated a pilot study to investigate the
      efficacy of Autologous MSCs in treating advanced PD. This cells will be harvested from bone
      marrow, processed at RLS laboratory and transplanted by stereotactic techniques into the
      striatum of the patient.

             neurologist) as per the standard criteria and guidelines.

          -  Patients with at least 5 years since the disease.

          -  Responsiveness to Levodopa or dopa agonist. This is defined as improvement between Off

          -  Stable Parkinsonian medications for the 60 days prior to the surgical therapy.

          -  MRI not showing gross atrophy or any other pathology of brain.

          -  Patients with score less than 19 for the Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) for
             Depression.

          -  NO Significant cognitive impairment.MMSE &gt; 24.

             all required tests and procedures.

          -  The participant (and/or LAR) must sign an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of intracranial surgeries or implantation of a device for Parkinson's disease
             two years prior to treatment.
