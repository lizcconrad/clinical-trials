  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two stages. In Stage 1, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be
      determined. In Stage 2, additional patients will be treated at the MTD of GDC-0152.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated early by the Sponsor for reasons unrelated to patient safety or
    anti-tumor activity.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic solid
             malignancies, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) without leukemic phase

          -  Disease (either target or non-target lesions) that can be assessed by imaging studies
             and/or physical examination

          -  For patients with solid tumors or NHL without leukemic phase, disease progression on
             or after standard therapy, or a malignancy for which there is no standard therapy

          -  All prior therapy-related toxicities have recovered to baseline-grade toxicity with
             the exception of alopecia.

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 60 days

          -  Resting oxygen saturation ≥ 92% on room air

          -  Agreement to use an effective form of contraception for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  History of central nervous system disease

          -  Chemotherapy, cancer hormonal therapy (except GnRH agonists), radiotherapy, or
             immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin)

          -  Use of any other investigational agent or device

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 3 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             Classification Grade 2 or greater congestive heart failure, a ventricular arrhythmia
             requiring medication within 1 year prior to Day 1, or NYHA Grade 2 or greater
             peripheral vascular disease on Day 1

          -  Known HIV infection

          -  Patients with ongoing inflammatory processes or a Grade ≥ 2 fever or Grade ≥ 2
             fever-associated constitutional symptoms (including rigors/chills, sweating, and
             others determined by the investigator), or a clinically significant systemic infection
             within the last month

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or renders the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications

          -  History of any chronic liver disease, active hepatic infection, or evidence of hepatic
             cirrhosis, or Grade ≥ 2 liver dysfunction.

          -  Baseline oxygen requirement or history of pulmonary fibrosis

          -  Any signs or symptoms Grade ≥ 2 by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 3.0, at study entry except for alopecia, pain,
             asymptomatic Grade 2 diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (at the
             discretion of the investigator) or where otherwise specified

          -  Patients who need to take a concomitant medication, dietary supplement, or food that
             is a known inhibitor/inducer of the CYP3A4/5 and/or the 2C8 metabolic pathway or that
