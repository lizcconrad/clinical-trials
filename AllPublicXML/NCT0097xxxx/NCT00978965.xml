  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to define groups of patients (among patients with a heart or kidney
      graft or a glomerular disease and nephrotic range proteinuria) who would either not profit
      from a therapy with mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) or need a higher than conventional dose to
      respond.

      Mainly there are 2 possible explanations for inter-patient differences in responsiveness to
      MMF therapy:

        1. Based on a mutation (in this study single nucleotide polymorphisms-SNPs-) in the inosine
           monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH 2) transcript as the target enzyme of mycophenolic
           acid (MPA) pathway, MMF cannot exert its effect.

        2. Based on a high enzyme activity of IMPDH 2 a higher MMF dose than in the conventional
           regimens is needed.

      To study the significance of these possible explanations there are 4 objectives in this
      study:

      Objective 1: Since there are no data on SNPs with functional relevance in IMPDH 2 transcript,
      we will first sequence all 14 exons of this gene in their entirety in 100 gender and age
      matched healthy individuals.

      Objective 2: The functional relevance of a detected SNP will be tested in vitro in a
      lymphocyte proliferation assay using various MPA concentrations.

      Objective 3: These functionally relevant SNPs will be searched in patients with kidney graft
      in a retrospective as well as prospective manner.

      Objective 4: Parallel to the genotyping experiments, IMPDH 2 activity and MPA plasma levels
      will be measured in all patients recruited in the study prospectively.

      An association between these SNPs or various IMPDH 2 activity / MPA plasma levels with MMF
      responsiveness will be examined.

      Objective 5: Strongyloides IgG titers are screened to evaluate the prevalence of helminth
      carriers in patients with immunosuppressive therapy.
