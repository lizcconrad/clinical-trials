  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the dose of WST11 and light energy necessary to obtain
      desobstruction of the bronchial lumen using Vascular Targeted Photodynamic therapy in
      obstructive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

      This study is designed as a multicentre, exploratory phase IIa, open label, single
      intravenous (IV) dose, escalating treatment regimen (Treatment regimen = a single dose of
      WST11 associated with a particular laser light energy) with a one month follow-up.

      Six escalating treatment regimens will be followed: 3 WST11 doses (5 mg/kg; 7.5 mg/kg and 10
      mg/kg) combined with 2 light energies (200 Joules/cm and 300 Joules/cm)

      The patient will be treated under local anesthesia. The light is produced using a specific
      laser at a wavelength of 753 nm at a fixed power of 250 mW/cm and locally delivered to the
      obstructing tumor through an optical fiber placed, during endoscopy, in the endoscope
      operating channel with visual control, possibly video-transmission assisted. The fiber
      illuminating diffusion length is fixed (2 cm).

          -  T1 to T4, N0-N3, M0-M1

          -  Patients with functional signs: hemoptysis, infection, cough and, above all, dyspnea

          -  Contralateral metastases not representing a contraindication insofar as they do not
             represent a risk of impairment of respiratory function during treatment

          -  The Karnofsky index should be greater than or equal to 40

          -  Patients should agree to and tolerate repeated bronchial endoscopy (a disadvantage of
             all endoscopic treatments)

          -  Male or female patients aged over 18 years, female patients should not be pregnant
             (menopause or contraception)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tracheal lesions and lesions affecting the carina tracheae

          -  Patients with painful bone metastases (not an absolute criterion since the extent of
             dyspnea is the decisive element)

          -  Patients with brain metastases

          -  Patients having undergone pneumonectomy

          -  Patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy or having undergone chemotherapy less
             than 4 weeks before the procedure or radiotherapy less than 4 weeks before the
             procedure

          -  Patients with risk of large vessel erosion or perforation resulting from lesion
             topography

          -  Leukopenia (WBC&lt;2000), Thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100 000), PT &gt; 1.5 normal, Fibrinogen &lt;
             2g/l, a PTT &gt; 1.5 ULN (Upper Limit of Normal)

          -  Renal insufficiency

          -  Hepatic insufficiency

          -  Patients having already received 70 Gy on the lesion

          -  Existing tracheoesophageal or bronchoesophageal fistula

          -  Emergency treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory distress caused by an
             obstructing endobronchial lesion
