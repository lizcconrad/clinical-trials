      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the Norwalk virus-like particle
      (VLP) vaccine as determined by the illness rate of viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE) during
      the inpatient stay.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called intranasal Norwalk virus-like particle (VLP)
      vaccine. Norwalk VLP vaccine is being tested to prevent viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE).
      This study will look at the illness rate of AGE in people who are administered the Norwalk
      VLP vaccine.

      The study enrolled 98 patients and was conducted in 2 stages: the Vaccination Stage and the
      Challenge Stage. In the Vaccination Stage participants were randomly assigned (by chance,
      like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which remained undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Norwalk VLP Vaccine (100 µg VLP) intranasally

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive powder) - this is a powder that looks like the study drug but
           has no active ingredient During the Challenge Stage participants were administered live
           Norwalk virus and were monitored for AGE.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was up to 29 weeks Participants made multiple visits to the clinic and were
      contacted by telephone 6 months after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), a single positive post-challenge stool sample.
Norwalk Virus Antigen, a single positive post-challenge stool sample.
Acute Gastroenteritis:

    <description>Vesikari Scoring System assesses the following symptoms: duration of diarrhea (days), maximum number of diarrheal stools/24 hours, duration of vomiting (days), maximum number of vomiting episodes/24 hours, fever and dehydration. Since the typical inpatient phase was four days in length, the duration of diarrhea scoring was modified to fit this time frame. Modified Vesikari Scale Total Score=17. Higher numbers are worse.</description>
