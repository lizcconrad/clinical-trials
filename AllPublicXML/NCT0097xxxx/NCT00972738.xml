    <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptoms. Patients were asked to rate each of the 4 nasal symptoms of Congestion, Rhinorrhea, Itching, and Sneezing daily on a 4-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 3 (worst)]. The average of the 4 individual nasal symptoms scores was reported as the Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score.</description>

Patients were asked to rate each symptoms of Nasal Congestion Upon Awakening, Difficulty Going to Sleep, and Nighttime Awakenings daily on a 4-point [Scale 0 (best) to 3 (worst)]. The average of the individual symptoms scores was reported as the Nighttime Symptoms Score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at the end of 2-week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed a validated, self-administered Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, which included 28 questions on a 7-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 6 (worst)], across 7 domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. The individual domain scores were calculated as the average values of all scores within a domain, then the scores for the 7 domains were averaged for the overall score.</description>

        <description>Patients completed a validated, self-administered Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, which included 28 questions on a 7-point scale [Score 0 (best) to 6 (worst)], across 7 domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. The individual domain scores were calculated as the average values of all scores within a domain, then the scores for the 7 domains were averaged for the overall score.</description>
