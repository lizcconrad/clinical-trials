  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the Air Barrier System device reduces
      airborne particulate and airborne colony forming units present at a surgery site.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Air Barrier System is a device that uses localized clean air flow to shield a surgery
      site from ambient airborne contamination. This study examines the hypothesis that the Air
      Barrier System can reduce the presence of airborne colony-forming units (e.g. bacteria
      colonies) and particulate at the surgery site.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgery Site CFU Density</measure>
    <time_frame>Ten minute intervals throughout surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Colony forming unit counts were collected from the air within 5 cm of the surgical wound using a bioaerosol &quot;slit&quot; sampling device. Air was drawn through a sterile PVC tubing located at the incision and impacted upon media (TSA 5% sheep's blood) plates located in the sampling device. The plates were exchanged every 10 minutes throughout the procedure. Values are presented as CFU/cubic meter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgery Site Particulate Density (Size &gt;10 Micrometer)Per Cubic Meter</measure>
    <time_frame>Ten minute intervals throughout surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Airborne particulate was measured using a particle analyzer (LASAIR II 310B). The analyzer sampled continuously during surgery at a rate of 28.3 L/min and recorded data at one-minute intervals. The samples were collected through a length of sterile PVC tubing with the end placed adjacent to the CFU sample tubing, within 5 cm of the surgical incision. Particles of various diameters were obtained; particles of size &gt;10 micrometer had the strongest correlation to the presence of CFUs at the incision site.</description>

        <title>Surgery Site Particulate Density (Size &gt;10 Micrometer)Per Cubic Meter</title>
        <description>Airborne particulate was measured using a particle analyzer (LASAIR II 310B). The analyzer sampled continuously during surgery at a rate of 28.3 L/min and recorded data at one-minute intervals. The samples were collected through a length of sterile PVC tubing with the end placed adjacent to the CFU sample tubing, within 5 cm of the surgical incision. Particles of various diameters were obtained; particles of size &gt;10 micrometer had the strongest correlation to the presence of CFUs at the incision site.</description>
