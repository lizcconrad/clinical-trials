      The number of children who are obese in the UK is steadily increasing with both short and
      long term consequences for health. The aim of this study is to determine whether the MEND
      Programme (a new national initiative for the treatment of childhood obesity) is a successful
      and sustainable treatment for childhood obesity and obesity related health problems.

      300 overweight and obese children will be randomly assigned to start immediately on the MEND
      Programme for 6 months or join a waiting-list control group for 6 months. Measurements of
      health outcomes will be taken at baseline, and at 6, 12 and 24 months after the Programme.
      After 6 months of waiting-list time, the control group will follow the same protocol as the
      immediate starters. The researchers will be unaware (blinded) to which group each child has
      been assigned to. The study will examine the effects of the MEND Programme on body
      composition, cardiovascular health and psychological health.
