  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines the biochemistry underlying human olfaction in both normal and diseased
      states.

      The study aims are: 1. to determine the levels of cAMP in olfactory tissue from people with
      chronic rhinosinusitis and other nasal disorders. 2. to correlate preoperative olfactory
      function with cAMP levels from biopsied olfactory tissue. 3. to determine odorant and
      pheromone-mediated activation of cultured human olfactory sensory neurons using calcium
      imaging and 4. to determine odorant and pheromone-mediated activation of cultured human
      olfactory sensory neurons using &quot;smell-chip&quot; technology.

      Subject will be recruited from those scheduled to have endoscopic sinus surgery and similar
      procedures. This study uses the tissue that would normally be discarded during the surgical
      process. The tissue is cultured and frozen for purposes of the following testing:

      odor detection and signal transduction, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and odor detection,
      the role of cAMP in olfactory dysfunction, and pheromone detection.

      Only tissue that would normally be discarded during the course of the surgery will be used.
      The study does not interfere with or change any clinical care.

      Samples consist of discarded tissue resulting from the following clinical procedures:
      endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis, endoscopic transnasal approach to the
      pituitary for pituitary tumor removal, endoscopic inferior turbinectomy or septoplasty for
      nasal congestion and endoscopic repair of CSF leaks. Samples will only be retained for 1 year
      post-surgery and then destroyed.
