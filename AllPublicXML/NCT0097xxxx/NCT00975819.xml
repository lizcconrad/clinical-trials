      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of sirolimus in the treatment of
      children and young adults with complicated vascular anomalies will prove to be safe and
      provide objective response resulting in improved clinical status and quality of life.

      Patients with vascular anomalies (VA) have a spectrum of diseases that can be broadly
      classified into vascular tumors and malformations. Complicated vascular anomalies can cause
      disfigurement, chronic pain, and organ dysfunction with significant morbidity and mortality.
      Despite the severity of potential complications, we lack uniform guidelines for the treatment
      and response to treatment of children and young adults with these diseases. There are
      pre-clinical and clinical data supporting the essential regulatory function of the
      PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in vascular growth and organization, and suggest a therapeutic target
      for patients with complicated vascular anomalies. The overall goal of this trial is to
      objectively determine the effectiveness and safety of the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin* in the
      treatment of children and young adults diagnosed with complicated vascular anomalies. We
      propose a Phase 2 trial with the diagnostic, therapeutic and response criteria experimentally
      determined in this study used as a framework for future Phase 3 clinical trials.

             known to occur. These patients must be discussed with the Study Chair on a
             case-by-case basis.

          7. Patients diagnosed with Kaposiform Hemangioendotheliomas or Tufted Angiomas will not
             require a washout period prior to enrollment, but will be required to discontinue the

                  voriconazole, clotrimazole

               -  Calcium channel blockers: verapamil, diltiazem, nicardipine

               -  Other drugs: rifampin, bromocriptine, cimetidine (Tagamet®), danazol,
                  cyclosporine oral solution, lansoprazole (Prevacid®).

               -  Grapefruit juice.

         11. CYP3A4 inducers: Patients must also avoid strong inducers of CYP3A4, and may not have
             received these medications within 1 week of entry. These include:

         12. Enzyme inducing anticonvulsants: Patients may not be taking enzyme-inducing
             anticonvulsants, and may not have received these medications within 1 week of entry,
             as these patients may experience different drug disposition. These medications
             include:

               -  Carbamazepine (Tegretol®)

               -  Felbamate (Felbtol®)

             be on a weaning dose of steroids.

          -  Patients who require medications that inhibit/induce CYP3A4 enzyme activity to control
             concurrent medical conditions.

             control. Women of childbearing potential will be given a pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to administration of sirolimus and must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test.

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol, or who in the opinion of the
