  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the intratumoral and plasma pharmacokinetics of AC480
      among patients who are candidates for a resection with a recurrent malignant glioma who are
      not on CYP-3A enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDS). Secondary objectives include the
      following: to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of AC480 by FDG-PET Scan; to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of AC480; and, to describe 6-month progression-free survival (PFS)
      and radiographic response.

      This is a single institution, open label, pharmacokinetic study of AC480 in patients with
      recurrent malignant glioma. The study will enroll 5 patients who are not on enzyme inducing
      anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs) and are scheduled to undergo salvage surgical resection for
      preoperative treatment with AC480 at 300 mg orally twice daily (BID) for 14 (plus or minus 2)
      days before surgery (Part I- Induction Therapy). After surgery (Part II- Maintenance
      Therapy), patients will continue to be dosed with AC480 until disease progression or
      intolerance, and will be evaluated after every other cycle (1 cycle is 28 days).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasma and tumoral pharmacokinetics, as well as FDG-PET data will be analyzed to determine
      the intratumoral and plasma levels of AC480 obtained and its antiproliferative activity.
      After recovery from surgery, all patients will resume AC480 at 300 mg orally BID until
      evidence of disease progression or toxicity (Part II: Maintenance Therapy). Those patients
      will be followed for determination of 6-month progression free survival. Patients will remain
      on treatment for as long as they have clinical benefit from the treatment. There will be no
      limit to the number of cycles of treatment a patient can receive providing they continue to
      benefit from and are not intolerant to AC480 administration.

      The data collected in this study will be summarized in tables listing the mean, standard
      deviation, and number of patients for continuous data, or in tables listing count and
      percentage for categorical data, where appropriate. All patient data will be listed by
      patient or by parameter, all statistical analyses will be performed and all data appendices
      will be created by using the SAS system. Pharmacokinetic analysis will be made to determine
      if AC480 reaches the intracerebral tumor tissue. Comparisons will be made between the data
      obtained from the plasma of the same patients treated on AC480, including determination of
      the tumor-to-plasma ratio. The most common side effects of AC480 are generally mild to
      moderate in severity and include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, cough, elevation of
      the liver enzymes, anemia, and rash.

             malignant glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma or anaplastic
             mixed glioma) and be surgical candidates. Recurrence will be defined based on the
             modified MacDonald criteria or based on histopathologic confirmation of tissue
             obtained via surgical intervention. Patients with prior low-grade glioma are eligible
             if histologic assessment demonstrates transformation to WHO grade III or IV malignant
             glioma.

             progression following anti-cancer therapy other than surgery, including non-surgical
             therapies that are considered standard treatment for high-grade glioma if administered

             tumor on 2 consecutive scans at least 4 weeks apart.

          -  An interval of at least 4 weeks from prior chemotherapy (except nitrosoureas which
             require 6 weeks) unless there is unequivocal evidence of tumor progression and the
             patient has recovered from all anticipated toxicities from prior therapy.

          -  An interval of a least 4 weeks from exposure to investigational agents, unless there

             guidelines. This informed consent shall include language whereby Ambit shall have
             access to the patient's protected health information. A signed informed consent must
             be obtained prior to any study specific procedures.

             replacement therapy [HRT] with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
             level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Even women who are using oral, implanted or injectable
             contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or
             barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or are
             practicing abstinence or where the partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be
