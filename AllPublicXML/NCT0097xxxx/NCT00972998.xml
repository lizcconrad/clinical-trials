      This is an open label, dose-finding study. Approximately 8 healthy subjects will be
      participating in this study.

      A screening will be used to determine subject suitability for inclusion in the trial.
      Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will enter a one
      day treatment period. During this period, 4 anal manometric studies will take place. Study
      medication (Coated Phenylephrine suppositories at various doses) will be administered at
      pre-determined intervals.

      This is an open label, dose-finding study. Approximately 8 healthy subjects will be
      participating in this study. A screening will be used to determine subject suitability for
      inclusion in the trial. Within one week after the screening visit, subjects who meet all
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will enter a one day treatment period.
      During this period, 4 anal manometric studies will take place. Study medication (Coated
      Phenylephrine suppositories at various doses) will be administered at pre-determined
      intervals. During the study, blood samples will be obtained for plasma Phenylephrine
      analysis.After determining baseline resting anal pressure with a manometric test, coated
      Suppositories will be administered intra rectally. Subjects will take rectally a total of 1
      Coated Suppository per study. 60, 120 and 240 minutes after the coated suppository insertion
      amnometric studies will be performed: The first 2 subjects in the study will receive 40 mg
      phenyephrine coated suppositories. If significant (&gt; 15%) increase in the resting anal
      pressure will occur with this dose, the rest of the study subjects will receive the same
      dose. If the raise in the resting anal pressure will not be significant AND no adverse events
      was observed, than the following subjects will receive 80 mg phenylehprine coated
      suppositories.
