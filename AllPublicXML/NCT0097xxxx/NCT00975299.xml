        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers:

               -  males &gt;/= 45 years of age

               -  patients with recurrent prostate cancer had a positive choline PET/CT for
                  detection, or staging, or restaging of cancer, evaluation of the primary prostate
                  cancer detection rate with BAY 86-4367 in comparison to histology as standard of
                  truth (choline PET/CT is optional).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for all healthy volunteers and patients:

               -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable other medical disease (e.g.
                  poorly controlled diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction
                  within 12 months prior to planned injection of BAY 86-4367, unstable and
                  uncontrolled hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, severe pulmonary
                  disease) which could compromise participation in the study

               -  Known sensitivity to the study drug or components of the preparation.
