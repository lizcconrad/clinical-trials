    <textblock>
      This study will summarize the safety of patients receiving figitumumab combined with
      etoposide and cisplatin (or carboplatin) vs. patients receiving etoposide and cisplatin (or
      carboplatin) alone as first line treatment for extensive stage disease Small Cell Lung
      Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study prematurely discontinued on January 26, 2011 due to slow enrollment. It should be
      noted that safety concerns have not been seen in this study and have not factored into this
      decision.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 2nd cycle (between Day 15-21, 1 cycle = 21 days) starting with Cycle 2 until disease progression, at the end of treatment visit (if more than 28 days have passed since last evaluation); and every 6 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>Median time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS time (days) = [event (progression or death) date or censor date - date of randomization + 1].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 2nd cycle (between Day 15-21, 1 cycle = 21 days) starting with Cycle 2 until disease progression, at the end of treatment visit (if more than 28 days have passed since last evaluation); and every 6 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR defined as ≥30% decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months until death or 12 months from the date the last participant was randomized</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was the duration from enrollment to death due to any cause. For participants who are alive, overall survival was censored at the last contact. Survival time (days) = [death date (last known alive date) - date of randomization +1].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to follow-up (90 days post dose)</time_frame>
    <description>AEs are any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given study treatment. The event does not need to be causally related to the study treatment. SAEs include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reporting Positive Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) Response for Figitumumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2 of Cycle 1 (or Day 1 of the initial cycle starting single agent figitumumab); Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 4; Day 28 and Day 90 post last figitumumab dose</time_frame>

    <measure>Cancer Dyspnea Scale (CDS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of every cycle (up to 17 cycles), at the end of treatment visit (28 days post last dose); then every 6 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>The Cancer Dyspnea Scale consists of 12 questions that assess 3 domains of dyspnea (sense of effort, anxiety and discomfort) related to lung cancer. The questions are answered on 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 &quot;Not at All&quot; to 5 &quot;Very Much&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of every cycle (up to 17 cycles), at the end of treatment visit (28 days post last dose); then every 6 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a 1-item self-reported questionnaire designed to assess &quot;worst pain&quot; severity. Overall scores range from 0 to 10, with low scores representing a lower level of pain.</description>

        <description>Median time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS time (days) = [event (progression or death) date or censor date - date of randomization + 1].</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, every 2nd cycle (between Day 15-21, 1 cycle = 21 days) starting with Cycle 2 until disease progression, at the end of treatment visit (if more than 28 days have passed since last evaluation); and every 6 weeks until disease progression</time_frame>
        <population>No analysis of progression-free survival was performed as the study was terminated prematurely due to low participants enrollment and the halting of the figitumumab development program. As a result, the only endpoint analyzed for the study was safety and tolerability of figitumumab ± cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide.</population>
