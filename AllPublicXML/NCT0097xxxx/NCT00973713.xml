  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness and safety of the study drug RAD001
      in patients with advanced (metastatic) cholangiocarcinoma. Palliative chemotherapy provides
      some benefit to this group of patients. However, chemotherapy treatment only shows low rates
      of radiological response and short times to tumour progression. Therefore, further treatment
      options are urgently required.

      In laboratory studies, RAD001 has been shown to interrupt the signals that cancer cells use
      to grow, spread and form new blood vessels (angiogenesis). RAD001 has been approved for the
      treatment of kidney cancer. It has also been approved for use in Australia for the treatment
      of patients with kidney and liver transplants, and has been used in thousands of patients
      worldwide for this indication. Preliminary studies suggest that RAD001 may have activity in a
      range of other cancers. This study will evaluate the activity of RAD001 in advanced
      cholangiocarcinoma.

    <textblock>
      27 patients from approximately four hospitals in Australia will participate in this trial,
      with approximately 15 patients being enrolled at Austin Health. All participants will receive
      the same treatment (RAD001 10mg/d given orally).

      After screening for eligibility, participants will receive RAD001 10mg/d until tumour
      progression.

      Participants will undergo regular CT scans (every 6 weeks during treatment) to evaluate the
      effectiveness of treatment. Providing they are tolerating treatment satisfactorily, they may
      receive study treatment until progression of disease.

      Blood samples will be taken during the screening phase and every 3 weeks during the treatment
      phase of the trial. Participants will be followed-up every 3 months to find out about
      survival status, new chemotherapy or biological treatment and the outcome of any ongoing
      adverse events.
