      Study measures will evaluate cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes for the children,
      school services received, and caregiver stress and depression. The main study outcome
      measures include cognitive status, school functioning, and behavior. Long-term outcomes will
      be studied in attempt to verify the 33 and 60 month significant differences found in school
      participation and behavior between the intervention and control groups.

      This study examines 8-year follow-up results from The MOM Program, a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) of a mixed professional home visiting program to promote positive developmental
      outcomes among children in poverty. The earlier study found significant differences in both
      school participation and behavior among the intervention group at ages 33 and 60 months of
      age. Families from the original MOM Program RCT that provide informed consent will be
      eligible for the study when the children are 8 years of age.

    <measure>Woodcock-Johnson Cognitive Ability Test, 3rd Edition (WJR-III, Cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 years post original enrollment in study</time_frame>
    <description>The WJR-III, Cog measures intelligence and cognition in children and offers a recent standardization sample and updated item content. The WJR-III, Cog was selected because it includes verbal, nonverbal, and language scales and its recent standardization sample includes an appropriate proportion of children from ethnic minority, limited parent education, and Northeastern U.S. regional families.The mean test score is 100, with a standard deviation of 15. The test yields scores from 55 (worst score) to 145 (best score).</description>

    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Internalizing</measure>
    <time_frame>8 years from study entry</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL is part of The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA)that measures a broad range of behavioral, emotional, and social behaviors. The CBCL is administered in interview format and respondents are asked to rate 112 problem items as 0 for &quot;not true of the child,&quot; 1 for &quot;somewhat or sometimes true of the child,&quot; and 2 for &quot;very true or often true of the child&quot;, based on the past two months. The raw scores from the 112 items are then compared with age- and gender-matched controls from the standardization sample, and standard scores are then derived with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Worst value is 80; best value is 30.</description>

        <description>The WJR-III, Cog measures intelligence and cognition in children and offers a recent standardization sample and updated item content. The WJR-III, Cog was selected because it includes verbal, nonverbal, and language scales and its recent standardization sample includes an appropriate proportion of children from ethnic minority, limited parent education, and Northeastern U.S. regional families.The mean test score is 100, with a standard deviation of 15. The test yields scores from 55 (worst score) to 145 (best score).</description>

        <description>The CBCL is part of The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA)that measures a broad range of behavioral, emotional, and social behaviors. The CBCL is administered in interview format and respondents are asked to rate 112 problem items as 0 for “not true of the child,” 1 for “somewhat or sometimes true of the child,” and 2 for “very true or often true of the child”, based on the past two months. The raw scores from the 112 items are then compared with age- and gender-matched controls from the standardization sample, and standard scores are then derived with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Worst value is 80; best value is 30.</description>

        <title>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL),Total Problems</title>
        <description>The CBCL is part of The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA)that measures a broad range of behavioral, emotional, and social behaviors. The CBCL is administered in interview format and respondents are asked to rate 112 problem items as 0 for &quot;not true of the child,&quot; 1 for &quot;somewhat or sometimes true of the child,&quot; and 2 for &quot;very true or often true of the child&quot;, based on the past two months. The raw scores from the 112 items are then compared with age- and gender-matched controls from the standardization sample, and standard scores are derived with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Worst score is 80; best score is 30.</description>
