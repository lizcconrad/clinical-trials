    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance (MR)
      imaging is able to detect certain heart abnormalities, such as a coronary artery narrowing.

      To this purpose, a conventional MR contrast medium (Gd-DTPA-BMA) will be used during an
      adenosine infusion (an approved substance which enlarges the arteries of the heart, so that
      the blood flow to the heart muscle increases). This magnetic resonance imaging technique will
      be compared with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a well-established
      technique to detect this heart abnormalities.

      Both, cardiac MR and SPECT will be compared with invasive coronary angiography, a technique
      which directly visualized the heart vessels and narrowings of these (=standard of reference).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, open label, phase III study in adult subjects designed to show
      that Gd-DTPA-BMA (a conventional MR contrast medium = OMNISCAN) enhanced myocardial MR
      perfusion imaging is non-inferior to myocardial SPECT. Both imaging techniques will be
      performed during adenosine stress (0.14mg/min/kg over 3 minutes IV). Gd-DTPA-BMA will be used
      twice (2 doses of 0.075 mmol/kg for the stress and rest study each) for the detection of
      myocardial perfusion defects. The standard of reference is invasive coronary angiography,
      which defines the presence of coronary artery disease, if vessels of at least 2mm in diameter
      show stenosis of at least 50% (diameter reduction). Patients with a history of myocardial
      infarction(s) are positive for coronary artery disease, even when coronary arteries are not
      stenosed as evidenced by the coronary angiography performed in the setting of this trial(=
      assigning patients as positive for coronary artery disease after successful
      PCI-revascularization of acute infarct(s) in the past).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is a man or woman and is 18 years of age or older.

          2. For women of childbearing potential, the results of a urine or serum human chorionic
             gonadotropin (beta-HCG) pregnancy test, done at screening (with the result known
             before investigational product administration), must be negative. Only those women who
             are surgically sterile (have had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented
