      This study will evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of intradermal vaccination of
      prostate cancer patients with alpha-type-1-polarized dendritic cells (DC1) loaded with
      apoptotic allogeneic tumor (LNCap). The study will target men with recurrent prostate cancer,
      who failed local therapy, have no measurable metastasis, but have a rising PSA with a
      doubling time of less than 10 months. The selection of this study group enables us to
      evaluate time to PSA progression, a highly relevant, clinical primary endpoint of efficacy in
      this two arm study. In order to facilitate infiltration of vaccination-induced T cells into
      tumor site(s) and to reduce tumor-specific tolerance, subjects will receive the vaccine in
      combination with limited androgen ablation (AA) with a LHRH analogue for 3 months. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of two cohorts. In cohort A subjects will be first treated
      with limited AA alone for 3 months, and at the time of PSA relapse (PSA ≥ 1 ng/dL) will
      receive the DC vaccine in conjunction with AA. In cohort B, the sequence of treatment will be
      reversed. Efficacy will be estimated as the within-subject difference in time to PSA relapse
      following the combination treatment as compared to the AA alone, thus, each subject will
      serve as his own control. All subjects will commence the DC1-based vaccination 2 weeks prior
      to treatment with the LHRH analogue. Each subject will receive 1 intradermal (i.d.) dose of
      the vaccine at weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13 for a total of 4 doses. Additional courses of
      vaccination may be administered to subjects without evidence of disease progression every 3
      months (±1 month) for up to 12 months depending on the number of doses originally produced
      and available after the 4 intended protocol doses. All doses of the vaccine will be
      administered intradermally (i.d.).

      Dendritic cells or &quot;DCs&quot; are special white blood cells that stimulate the immune system. This
      study is being done to test the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a specific type of
      dendritic cell when injected under the skin of patients with prostate cancer. The researchers
      conducting this study will evaluate the time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression
      and will also be performing tests to see how the immune system is responding to the
      injections.

      This is a 2 group crossover trial in which patients are randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment arms:

      A. 3 months of androgen ablation (AA) to be followed at PSA progression by 3 months of the
      combination of AA and alpha-type 1 dendritic cell vaccine (DC1); B. 3 months of the
      combination of AA and alpha-type 1 dendritic cell vaccine followed at PSA progression by 3
      months of AA.

      Primary Objectives

        -  Feasibility objective: the ability to successfully generate and administer the alpha-DC1
           vaccine.

        -  Safety objective: assess the tolerability and toxicity of the alpha-DC1 vaccine.

        -  Efficacy objective: evaluate the effect of the alpha-DC1 vaccine on time to PSA
           progression compared to AA alone. PSA progression is defined as a rise in the PSA value
           to e 1.0 ng/mL.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the change in PSA velocity prior to and following the proposed treatment.

        -  To evaluate (in all subjects) the vaccination-induced DTH responses to LNCap, the cell
           line vaccine, and to compare this with vaccination-induced responses to tumor-untreated
           antigen (KLH).

        -  To evaluate the vaccination-induced changes of Th1/Th2 profiles of the responses to PAP
           and PSMA.

        -  To evaluate the CTL responses in blood to the whole LNCap cells (in all subjects) and
           (in all subjects who are HLA-A2 positive) the CTL responses to HLA-A2.1 restricted
           peptides derived from PAP and PSMA.

        -  To comprehensively evaluate the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses (fine specificity and
           Th1/Th2/Treg cytokine profile) to the previously-identified and novel immunogenic
           epitopes of PAP and PSMA, using the EPIMAX system.

      This is a 2 group crossover trial in which patients are randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment arms:

      A. 3 months of androgen ablation (AA) to be followed at PSA progression by 3 months of the
      combination of AA and alpha-type 1 dendritic cell vaccine (DC1); B. 3 months of the
      combination of AA and alpha-type 1 dendritic cell vaccine followed at PSA progression by 3
      months of AA.

      In this crossover trial each patient will serve as their own control. Following either
      therapy the time to PSA progression, defined as the time between treatment and the first
      instance of PSA increase to 1ng/ml. The endpoint is the difference between time to PSA
      progression for the combination of AA + DC1 compared to AA alone. A total of 12 evaluable
      patients (6 patients/arm) will be enrolled on the trial. Patients who do not complete both
      courses (AA and AA+DCV) will be replaced. This schema will also help us better estimate the
      time to PSA recovery following 3 months of limited androgen ablation in our cohort of
      patients.

      All patients in Cohort B, will commence DC1-based vaccination 2 weeks prior to treatment with
      the LHRH analogue. Each patient will receive four i.d. doses of the vaccine at weeks 1, 4, 8,
      and 12. The LHRH analogue (Lupron 22.5 mg or Zoladex 10.8 mg), will be administered 2 weeks
      after the 1st dose of the DC vaccine. Additional courses of vaccination can be administered
      to any patients without evidence of disease progression, every 3 months for up to 12 months.

      Patients will undergo a thorough pre-study evaluation, and then undergo leukapheresis to
      generate the DC-based vaccine. Each patient will receive 4 doses of intradermal (i.d.)
      DC1-based vaccine at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12.

             radiologic imaging), and bone scan within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormonal, androgen deprivation therapy, or chemotherapy is
             allowed if it was last used &gt; 12 months prior to first vaccination.

          -  No therapy modulating testosterone levels (such as leuteinizing-hormone
             releasing-hormone agonists/antagonists and antiandrogens) is permitted within 12
             months prior to first vaccination. Agents such as 5α-reductase inhibitors,
             ketoconazole, megestrol acetate, systemic steroids (replacement doses of steroids are
             allowed), PC-SPES, and Saw Palmetto are not permitted at any time during the period
             that the PSA values are being collected.

          -  Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer as evident by a serum total testosterone level &gt; 150
             ng/dL or &gt; 6 nmol/L at the time of enrollment within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  All patients must have evidence of biochemical progression as determined by a
             reference PSA value followed by 1 confirmatory rising PSA value, higher than the
             previous value, obtained at least 2 weeks apart. All of these PSA values must be
             obtained at the same reference lab, and all must be done within 6 months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  The most recent of the PSA values must be ≥ 2.0 ng/mL. This measurement must be
             obtained within 1 month prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients must not be receiving other investigational agents or concurrent anticancer
             therapy.

          -  No uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients must not have active eczema, atopic dermatitis, or other exfoliative skin
             conditions (e.g., burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, severe acne, contact dermatitis,

          -  Presence of an active acute or chronic infection, including urinary tract infection,
             HIV or viral hepatitis. HIV patients are excluded based on immunosuppression which may
             render them unable to respond to the vaccine; patients with chronic hepatitis are
             excluded because of concern that hepatitis could be exacerbated by the injections. If
             clinically indicate, HIV/viral hepatitis testing will be performed to confirm status.

          -  Patients with a history of auto-immune disease such as, but not restricted to,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis. Patients receiving replacement thyroid hormone
             would be eligible.

          -  No concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for local (topical, nasal, or inhaled)
             steroid use. Adrenal replacement doses of corticosteroids are allowed.

          -  Subjects with concurrent additional malignancy (with exception of non-melanoma skin
             cancers and superficial bladder cancer or malignancy within last 3 years).
