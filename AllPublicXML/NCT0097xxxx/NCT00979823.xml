      The objective of this translational research is to study the effect of implementing an
      innovative simulated diabetes learning intervention within primary care residency programs.
      The intervention uses cognitive behavioral learning theory to provide goal-directed feedback
      to residents after every encounter over a series of virtual patient-physician encounters.
      Formulas derived from pharmacokinetic data and the experience of clinical experts model
      simulated physiologic responses to drug changes, health behaviors, and adherence factors. The
      online intervention is economical, sustainable, and addresses a number of current obstacles
      to outpatient diabetes training in primary care residency programs.

      In this group trial, we randomly assign about 20 primary care residency programs with up to
      700 residents total to either an (a) Early learning program group or (b) Delayed learning
      program group. We will assess the ability of residents to achieve evidence-based diabetes
      clinical goals and avoid potential medical safety issues for glycemia, blood pressure, and
      lipids on simulated assessment cases. Secondary analyses will evaluate the actual use of the
      tool by residents, direct costs of the program, and resident satisfaction.

      Specific aim 1: To examine the impact of a simulated case-based learning intervention on
      measures of quality of diabetes care delivered by primary care residents to simulated adult
      patients with diabetes mellitus.

      Hypothesis 1: Compared to delayed SimCare Diabetes learning program group residents, those
      residents in the early SimCare Diabetes learning program group will treat a higher proportion
      of simulated patients to evidence based diabetes goals including glycemic control (A1c &lt; 7%),
      blood pressure control (BP &lt; 130/80 mm Hg), and lipid control (evidence-based LDL,
      Triglyceride, and HDL levels).

      Specific aim 2: To examine the impact of a simulated case-based learning intervention on
      rates of appropriate drug intensification and number of risky prescribing events in the
      management of simulated adult patients with diabetes mellitus.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to delayed SimCare Diabetes learning program group residents, those
      residents in the early SimCare Diabetes learning program group will have improved rates of
      appropriate drug intensification in simulated assessment cases.

      Hypothesis 3: Compared to delayed SimCare Diabetes learning program group residents, those
      residents in the early SimCare Diabetes learning program group will have a lower number of
      risky prescribing events in simulated assessment cases.
