      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Radiation therapy
      may be effective in treating malignant spinal cord compression in patients who have received
      previous radiation therapy to the spine.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying radiation therapy in treating patients with
      malignant spinal cord compression.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of a biologically effective dose-based re-irradiation
           strategy, in terms of the response rate (based on the mobility score using the Tomita
           scale where improvement in mobility or stable mobility score will be regarded as a
           response) in patients with malignant spinal cord compression.

      Secondary

        -  To determine quality of life as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C15 PAL version 1.0
           questionnaire.

        -  To determine the non-spinal radiation-induced toxicity using standard RTOG criteria.

        -  To determine the rate of long-term spinal toxicity and radiation-induced myelopathy
           using the RTOG SOMA morbidity grading system.

      OUTLINE: Patients are divided into 2 groups according to the interval since their most recent
      radiotherapy to the involved area of the spinal cord.

        -  Group 1 (&lt; 6 months since prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy for a
           cumulative biologically effective dose (BED) ≤ 100 Gy_2 in addition to receiving other
           current treatment.

        -  Group 2 (≥ 6 months since prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo radiotherapy for a
           cumulative BED ≤ 130 Gy_2 in addition to receiving other current treatment.

      Mobility score is assessed and patients complete a quality-of-life assessment at baseline and
      at each follow-up visit starting at week 5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 5 weeks, at 3 months,
      and then every 3 months thereafter.
