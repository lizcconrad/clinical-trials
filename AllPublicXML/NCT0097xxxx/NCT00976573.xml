  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying how well carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab
      work when given with or without everolimus in treating patients with malignant melanoma that
      has spread from where it started to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, may block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Everolimus may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy given together
      with bevacizumab is more effective with or without everolimus in treating patients with
      metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess whether there is sufficient promise of an impact of the addition of everolimus
           to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab on progression-free
           survival that it would be recommended for further testing in patients with metastatic
           malignant melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the confirmed tumor response rate of each of the treatment regimens.

        -  To estimate the distribution of overall survival (OS) time for each of the treatment
           regimens.

        -  To assess the impact on the safety profile of the addition of everolimus to the
           combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to elevated LDH
      (above upper limit of normal) at baseline (yes vs no), location of metastatic disease (M1a
      [skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph node only] vs M1b [lung] vs M1c [other visceral sites])
      and prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15,
      paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Arm I. Patients also
      receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) 3 times weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomization to documentation of disease progression or death without documentation of progression;Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to documentation of disease progression or death without documentation of progression. The distribution of PFS times will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progression is defined using the RECIST Criteria as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm of target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, although unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>For this secondary endpoint, toxicity is defined as a grade 3 or higher adverse events that is classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The assignment of attribution to study treatment and grade (or degree of severity) of the adverse event are classified using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The percentage of participants reporting a grade 3 or higher toxicity is reported. For a list of all reported adverse events, please refer to the Adverse Events Section below.</description>

    <measure>Confirmed Tumor Response Rate (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed Tumor Response: A confirmed tumor response is defined to be a CR or PR (by the RECIST criteria) noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart. The proportion of tumor responses will be estimated by the number of confirmed tumor responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients. A ninety percent confidence interval for the true proportion of confirmed tumor responses will be calculated assuming that the number of confirmed tumor responses follows a binomial distribution.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from randomization to documentation of disease progression or death without documentation of progression. The distribution of PFS times will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progression is defined using the RECIST Criteria as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm of target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, although unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.</description>

        <title>Confirmed Tumor Response Rate (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria</title>
        <description>Confirmed Tumor Response: A confirmed tumor response is defined to be a CR or PR (by the RECIST criteria) noted as the objective status on 2 consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart. The proportion of tumor responses will be estimated by the number of confirmed tumor responses divided by the total number of evaluable patients. A ninety percent confidence interval for the true proportion of confirmed tumor responses will be calculated assuming that the number of confirmed tumor responses follows a binomial distribution.</description>
