  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized clinical trial with the study cohort comprised of all male
      and female patients over the age of 21 presenting to the study site for evaluation of lung
      cancer. The study will enroll 300 subjects, with 150 in each arm. Three sites will be in the
      study, Mayo Rochester, Mayo Jacksonville and Medical University of South Carolina. Mayo
      Rochester will enroll approximately 125 subjects. This study does not require subjects to
      undergo any additional procedures than what they would receive per standard medical care. The
      consenting subjects will receive EUS and /or EBUS- guided FNA or
      Mediastinoscopy/Thoracoscopy.

      This is a prospective randomized clinical trial of males and females age 21 or older being
      evaluated for lung cancer. The study will enroll approximately 300 subjects (150 in each arm)
      at 3 participating centers (MUSC, Mayo Clinic Rochester and Jacksonville). This sample size
      will provide sufficient statistical power (i.e. &gt;80%) using a non-inferiority study design
      with 1-sided hypothesis testing (Farrington and Manning 1990) to determine whether or not the
      sensitivity of the EUS/EBUS diagnostic technique is inferior (i.e. 10% or more lower) when
      compared to the sensitivity of malignant mediastinal adenopathy of about 40%. This study
      requires subjects to agree to the selection of their standard of care procedure. Subjects
      will be randomized (stratified computer generated randomization stratified y center and y CT
      positivity for pathologically enlarged [&gt;1cm short axis] node - 10 strata). Randomization
      will use variable block sizes (4-8), so that randomization allocation remains concealed as
      investigators will not be blinded. This study requires subjects to consent to the release of
      outcome data and follow-up data to be used for study analysis. No additional visit will be
      required for this study; this study will not require any additional time requirements beyond
      their scheduled evaluations.
