  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fixed-dose combinations (FDC) with two or more antituberculous drugs in one capsule or
      tablet are available to prevent the development of drug resistance. However, the fixed-dose
      combination regimen is not consistent with the dosages that are usually given. The present
      available FDC chemotherapy (Rifater) for pulmonary tuberculosis that is used in Taiwan has a
      higher ratio of isoniazid to rifampin and pyrazinamide. The higher risk of drug toxicity and
      adverse reactions when using fixed-dose combinations regimen should be considered. The aim of
      the present study is to compare the toxicity between using FDC regimen (Rifater/Rifinah) in
      Taiwan and single drugs in the treatment of newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis. The
      investigators also evaluate the efficacy of two regimens and determine the incidence of
      discontinuation of TB drugs and the predisposed factors between two regimens.
