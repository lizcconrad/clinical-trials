    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial are to estimate the following in Japanese patients with advanced
      NSCLC of stage IIIB/IV or with recurrence after failure of first-line chemotherapy.

      Phase I part The objective of the phase I part is to define the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)
      of BIBF 1120 at a dose level up to twice daily 200 mg with standard dose of pemetrexed (500
      mg/m^2) and to determine the Recommended Dose (RD) for the phase II part.

      Phase II, to investigate the efficacy and safety of BIBF 1120 in combination with pemetrexed
      (500 mg/m^2) as compared to pemetrexed (500 mg/m^2) + placebo

          <description>Treatments were administered in 21 day courses. Patients received pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 administered by intravenous infusion on day 1 and BIBF 1120 (nintedanib) 150 mg administered orally once on day 2 and twice daily (b.i.d.) from day 3 to day 21 in cycle 1 and b.i.d. from day 2 to day 21 in further cycles.
In case that a patient had to discontinue pemetrexed, the patient was allowed to continue nintedanib monotherapy if the patient had been treated with the nintedanib combination therapy with pemetrexed for at least 4 courses.</description>
