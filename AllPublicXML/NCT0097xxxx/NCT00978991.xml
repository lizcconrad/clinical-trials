  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is aimed to build a Duke University-specific longitudinal urologic
      surgery database. It will be used as the main resource to support future research within
      Urology and Duke University.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, the database will be used for the following future studies. (i) To characterize
      the biomarkers/protein signature associated with urological diseases; (ii) To clarify the
      clinical role of the risk factors and their interactions for early detection and optimized
      treatment of urological diseases, and improvement of post-treatment quality of life; (iii) To
      develop algorithms and nomograms to accurately predict the outcome of urological diseases.

      Retrospective review of subjects data prior to Institutional Review Board approval and
      prospective review of data on those consented after Institutional Review Board approval.
