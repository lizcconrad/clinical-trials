    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to determine the optimal treatment conditions to achieve prostate
      cancer tumour ablation and to assess the effects of WST11-mediated Vascular-Targeted
      Photodynamic therapy (VTP) treatment in patients with localized prostate cancer.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and quality of life following
      WST11-mediated VTP treatment,to assess the effects,safety and quality of life following a
      second WST11-mediated VTP treatment; and to explore optimisation techniques to reduce the
      duration of the VTP procedure.

      This trial is designed as a multicentre, phase II, open-labeled, multi-arm, single
      intravenous (IV) dose study. The patient is to receive general anesthesia. WST11-mediated VTP
      will consist of the combination of a single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 4 or 6
      mg/kg using 753nm laser light at a fixed power (150 mW/cm or 200 mW/cm or 250 mW/cm ) and
      light energy (200 J/cm or 300J/cm) delivered through transperineal interstitial optical
      fibers. The fibers are introduced into transparent needles that are positioned in the
      prostate under ultra sound guidance. The tumour location is established using transrectal
      biopsy and MR imaging. The number of fibers and the total light energy will be adapted to
      each patient based on a treatment planning proposed by treatment planning group.
