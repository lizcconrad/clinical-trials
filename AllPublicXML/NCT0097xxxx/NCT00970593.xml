        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with HbA1c level &gt;=7.0% and
             &lt;=11.0% and a fasting glucose level &lt;=280 mg/dL.

          -  Men or women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP), aged 18 to 65 years inclusive on
             study day 1.

          -  Body mass index in the range of 27 to 40kg/mÂ² (inclusive) and body weight &gt;=50 kg.

          -  Subjects must be otherwise generally healthy, but may be enrolled with a stable
             chronic illness, if it is well controlled and does not interfere with the primary
             objective of the study.

          -  Subjects must currently be treated for diabetes with metformin alone at a total daily
             dose of &gt;=1gm (administered QD or BID) and that dose must have been stable for at
             least 4 weeks before study day 1.

          -  Nonsmoker.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant disease with the exception of diabetes mellitus.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition that may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the investigational product.

          -  Acute disease state (eg, nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea) within 7 days before
             study day 1.

          -  Any clinically important problems in physical examination results, vitals sign
             measurements, ECGs, or clinical laboratory test results.

          -  Positive serologic findings for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies,
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.

          -  Positive findings of urine drug screen

          -  Use of any investigational or non-permitted prescription drug within 30 days before
             investigational product administration.
