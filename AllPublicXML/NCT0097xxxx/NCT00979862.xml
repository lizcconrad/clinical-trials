    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cediranib maleate when given
      together with cilengitide in treating patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma.
      Cediranib maleate and cilengitide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow
      to the tumor. Giving cediranib maleate together with cilengitide may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of cediranib (cediranib maleate) in combination with
      cilengitide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (Part A).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate overall survival. II. To estimate the proportion of radiographic responses in
      recurrent glioblastoma patients with measurable disease treated with cediranib and
      cilengitide.

      III. To estimate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months (APF6) in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated at the safe dose as determined in Part A (Part
      B).

      IV. To explore potential imaging techniques and biomarkers to capture the disease process
      through treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cediranib maleate. Patients are initially
      enrolled in the dose-finding portion of the study (part A). Once the safe dose of cediranib
      maleate is determined, additional patients are enrolled in the dose-expansion portion of the
      study (part B).

      Part A (dose finding): Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily on days 1-28
      and cilengitide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Part B (dose expansion): Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups according to prior anti-VEGF
      therapy (yes vs no). Patients in both groups receive cediranib maleate (administered at the
      safe dose determined in part A) and cilengitide as in part A.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months.

          -  Although the following medications are not contraindicated on this study, each should
             be used with extreme caution due to potential nephrotoxic effects: vancomycin,

             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cediranib is a VEGF inhibitor with

             are not eligible for treatment if deemed significant by the treating physician
