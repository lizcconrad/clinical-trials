  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine analysis of coagulation profile is recommended before adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy or
      ventilation tubes insertion in children.

      A proportion of those children reveal borderline abnormal values of Partial Prothrombin Time
      (aPTT) or Prothrombin Time (PT) and then they are referred to a consultant hematologist for
      further evaluation and recommendations before surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to summarize the causes of referrals in a cohort of 200 children
      and to assess the further laboratory analysis preformed and the results obtained.

      Data from about 200 children that were evaluated for abnormal coagulation tests performed
      before minor surgery.

      The data will include cause of referral, laboratory analysis performed and results.
