    <textblock>
      Background of the study:

      Fecal incontinence is a complex problem. The social consequences of this problem result in a
      lower quality of life. The exact prevalence of FI is unknown, literature reports vary from
      13-19%. There are variable treatment options depending on the patient and the etiology of the
      FI. Dietary manipulation, pharmacological intervention, pelvic floor physiotherapy, as well
      as surgical interventions are currently used to treat FI.

      A promising current treatment is Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS). The nerves in
      the spine that control bowel function also have branches which go to the ankle. Stimulating
      these nerves in the ankle has shown to be an effective treatment for FI in the short-term.
      The treatment has been shown to be safe and well tolerated by subjects with almost no
      morbidity in prior urology trials.

      Objective of the study:

      The objective of this study is to show that the results of PTNS are based on the treatment of
      electrical stimulation and not on a placebo effect with a sham treatment.

      Study design:

      This study is a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      The percentage of patients experiencing a ≥ 50% decrease in incontinence episodes from
      baseline after 9 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):

      Mean change in the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (CCF-FI Score)

      Mean change in Quality of Life scores in validated QoL questionnaires (SF-36, Digestive
      Health Status Instrument (DHSI), and Fecal Incontinence Quality of life)
