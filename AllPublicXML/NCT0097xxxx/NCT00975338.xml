      This project will describe and evaluate the impact of a unique partnership model designed to
      coordinate transfer of care by formally linking pediatric and adult heath care services. The
      experiences of young people receiving this model of care will be compared and contrasted
      against the experiences of young people receiving the current standard of care. Young people
      with a diagnosis of CP, ABIc, and SB will be followed during the transition period.
      Preparation for transition, health care, and transfer of care service delivery will be
      detailed in a process evaluation. An outcome evaluation will measure the ability of the two
      models of service to enable youth to maintain continuity within the health care system after
      transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Secondary outcomes, including how health,
      well-being, social participation, transition readiness, and health care utilization are
      affected will also be explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to advances in medical treatment, most children with disabilities such as cerebral palsy
      or acquired brain injury can expect to live normal lifespans. As children, these individuals
      are cared for by expert healthcare providers working in coordinated teams in specialized
      pediatric settings. As these children reach adulthood, the availability of services and
      expertise drops dramatically because the adult health care system has not evolved to meet
      their specialized needs. In addition, transitioning from pediatric to adult services is often
      very difficult and stressful. Young people and their families must leave familiar healthcare
      settings and providers, and secure care in unfamiliar adult health care environments.

      This proposed project will describe and evaluate the impact of a unique partnership model
      designed to coordinate transfer of care by formally linking pediatric and adult health care
      services. The LIFEspan model aims to (a) prepare youth and their families to adapt to adult
      healthcare provision, (b) provide a coordinated transfer process from pediatric to adult
      providers, and (c) establish sustainable access and appropriate adult care. The project will
      detail the specific service delivery that occurs with respect to preparation for transition
      and transfer of care in a process evaluation. An outcome evaluation will measure the
      effectiveness of the model in terms of its abilities to enable youth to maintain continuity
      within the health care system after transitioning from pediatric to adult care. Secondary
      outcomes, including how health, well-being, social participation, transition readiness, and
      health care utilization are affected by the LIFEspan model, will also be explored.
