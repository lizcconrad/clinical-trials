    <description>This is based on death or the first observed increase of at least 5 points from Baseline MELD score (whichever occurs earlier) at least 24 hours after the ELADÂ® Treatment Period is ended and up to Study Day 91 (90 days following Baseline).</description>

    <measure>Time to progression at which a 5-point or greater MELD score is recorded relative to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Study Day 91</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary Overall Survival analysis will use the same methodology as the primary time to progression efficacy analysis, except that an event will be defined as death. Secondary efficacy analyses will evaluate the proportion of progression free survivors (MELD score increased less than 5 points relative to the Baseline MELD score).</description>
