      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a
      certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      photodynamic therapy in treating patients with premalignant or early stage head and neck
      tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the toxicities associated with aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic
           therapy when administered continuously or in fractionated doses in patients with
           premalignant or early stage head and neck lesions.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of photodynamic therapy. Patients are randomized to
      1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral aminolevulinic acid and then undergo continuous
           photodynamic therapy 4-6 hours later.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive aminolevulinic acid as in arm I and then undergo fractionated
           photodynamic therapy 4-6 hours later.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months for 2
      years, and then annually thereafter.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of 1 of the following within the past 3 months:

               -  Erythroplakia with dysplasia

               -  Severe dysplasia

                  indicated, according to any of the following:

                    -  Medical condition that precludes surgery

                    -  Lesions that cannot be completely resected based on size or location
