  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older individuals account for one-third of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths in the
      United States. Older individuals are more susceptible to having a decrease in physical and
      mental function following chemotherapy treatment. Geriatric assessment may provide a way to
      identify those older individuals at greatest risk of functional decline before treatment
      starts and during the period of treatment. Geriatric assessment includes a set of screening
      questions and tests designed to determine the physical and mental status of the individual at
      a point in time. Geriatric assessment also includes review of medications and other medical
      conditions the individual may have that may affect function. The investigators are conducting
      this study to determine if older individuals are able to complete the geriatric assessment
      using a computer format and how that corresponds to their treating physician's assessment of
      their functional status before and after starting a new chemotherapy treatment for colon,
      rectal, breast or lung cancer. The investigators will also evaluate the usefulness of a
      computerized form of geriatric assessment.

      -  Participants will complete the geriatric assessment on the computer either at their home
           via the web (if they have internet access) or in the clinic at their next visit prior to
           seeing the doctor.

        -  All individuals will have a unique way to sign on to the computer program that protects
           the information so that only the participant and the research team will be able to view
           it. Individuals who require assistance to answer the questions will have help provided
           by a research assistant.

        -  We will ask participants to complete the geriatric assessment a second time at 4 months
           after they have enrolled on the study or 1 month after completing their chemotherapy
           treatment, whichever occurs first.

        Participants are identified by review of the clinic visit schedule at the Dana-Farber
        Cancer Institute, identifying individuals age 70 and older diagnosed with colon, rectal,
        breast or lung cancer

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients with colorectal, breast or lung cancer at any stage who are under
             consideration for initiation of or change in cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen. Patients
             must start chemotherapy within 4 weeks of enrollment. Chemotherapy regimens may
             include traditional cytotoxic therapy, oral biological agent, or combination of a
             biologic therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Patients age 70 or older at enrollment

          -  Patients must be able to read English and able to complete the web-based computer
             questionnaire

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a physical limitation preventing computer use (visual impairment,
             inability to use computer mouse or touch screen).

          -  Patients who are hospitalized or enrolled in hospice
