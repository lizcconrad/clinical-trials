  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being diagnosed and treated for cancer is usually associated with severe physical symptoms,
      impaired functional status, complex emotional, psychosocial and existential issues and
      substantial worries. Failure to help patients with their problems and worries can
      unnecessarily delay patients' recovery and rehabilitation, lead to chronic functional
      impairments, anxiety and depression and prolong patients' needs for health care and social
      services. The objectives of this interdisciplinary, international research project that
      includes collaboration with HELFO (The Norwegian Health Economy Administration), are to test
      and compare, in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT), the effects of (1) a
      practice-integrated online patient-provider communication (OPPC) service including access to
      asking questions to HELFO, (2) a multi-component Interactive Health Communication Application
      (IHCA) called WebChoice, and (3) usual care on: patient outcomes, health care and social
      services use and costs. Breast cancer patients undergoing treatment at three different
      hospitals in Norway will be randomized into two experimental and one control groups and will
      be followed with 5 repeated measures over one year. The proposed study will contribute to
      innovative methods and technologies that can radically improve patient-provider
      communication, care quality, and continuity of care. The two interventions tested in this
      study, the OPPC service with and without additional features of WebChoice, represent new
      forms of interactions and information sharing between patients and clinicians where patients
      can get seamless access to communication and information services from where and whenever
      they need it. This could significantly contribute to reducing unnecessary suffering, less
      fragmented health care, better efficiency, patient safety, patient satisfaction and have an
      impact on patients' health services utilization. The investigators' work addresses,
      therefore, important health policy goals with the potential for considerable societal gains.
