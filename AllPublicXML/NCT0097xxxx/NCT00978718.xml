      RATIONALE: Selenium supplements may stop or delay the development of prostate cancer in
      patients at high risk of prostate cancer. It is not yet known which dose of selenium may be
      more effective in preventing prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well selenium works in preventing
      prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether selenium (Se) supplementation decreases the incidence of prostate
           cancer.

        -  To determine whether Se supplementation inhibits the biochemical progression of prostate
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Treatment continues for up to 57 months in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of prostate cancer.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 200 μg of oral selenium (Se) as high-Se Baker's yeast daily.
           Treatment continues for up to 57 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
           diagnosis of prostate cancer.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive 400 μg of oral Se as high-Se baker's yeast daily. Treatment
           continues for up to 57 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of
           prostate cancer.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, at randomization, and then semi-annually for
      laboratory and other testing. Tissue samples may also be collected for biomarker analysis.
      Patients complete an initial questionnaire and urological-symptoms questionnaire at baseline,
      a follow-up questionnaire after randomization (to capture new illness, medications, and
      toxicity symptoms during the 30-day run-in period; a urological-symptoms questionnaire; a
      food-frequency questionnaire; and a mood questionnaire). Patients then undergo questionnaires
      semi-annually, including vital status, tablet compliance, nutrition, mood, new illnesses or
      medications, and any incidence of cancer or family history of cancer).

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Clinical indicators consistent with the community standards of medical care that would
             justify a biopsy of the prostate for the diagnosis of cancer, including ≥ 1 of the
             following:

               -  PSA level above the absolute value of 4 ng/mL or above a published age-ethnic
                  adjusted PSA level appropriate for the community

               -  Rising PSA that should represent a clinically significant PSA velocity (e.g., an
                  estimated annual change in the PSA velocity ≥ 0.75 ng/mL)

               -  Abnormal digital rectal examination of the prostate that identifies a clinically
                  significant change in the prostate (e.g., a prostate nodule or a change in the
                  firmness of the prostate)

               -  Documentation of the clinical assessment that justified the prostate biopsy that
                  allows classification of the patient to high-risk groups

          -  Prostate biopsy negative for cancer within the past 12 months

          -  Prostate biopsy negative for high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)

               -  PIN allowed provided it is grade 1

          -  SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2 times ULN

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2 times ULN

          -  No history of a prior malignancy except for the following:

               -  Adequately treated (i.e., complete surgical removal with negative margins) stage
                  I cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission

               -  Any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  See Disease Characteristics

          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy

          -  At least 90 days since prior and no other concurrent selenium &gt; 55 μg/day as a dietary
             supplement (including multivitamin supplements)

          -  More than 30 days since prior and no concurrent participation in any other clinical
             trial involving a medical, surgical, nutritional, or life-style intervention (e.g.,
