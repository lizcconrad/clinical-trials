      ABSTRACT

      Background:

      It is well recognized that excess dietary salt intake plays a major role in the development
      of hypertension. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is associated with excess salt and water
      retention (excess volume) which is associated with hypertension.

      Hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1:

      Dietary salt restriction will improve volume status in subjects with CKD stages 3-4 as
      assessed by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA).

      Hypothesis 2:

      Dietary salt restriction will result in improved blood pressure control in patients with CKD
      stages 3-4.

      Hypothesis 3:

      Dietary salt restriction will decrease albuminuria in patients with CKD stages 3-4.

      Patients and Trial Design: This randomized crossover pilot study is designed to assess the
      effect of salt restriction on volume status in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.

      Subjects will be randomized to a treatment order: (1) 4 weeks of salt restriction of &lt;85 mmol
      sodium per day, a 2 week washout period, and 4 weeks of usual salt diet, OR (2) 4 weeks of
      usual diet, 2 weeks washout, and 4 weeks of salt restriction. Patients will receive dietary
      counseling in person at each study visit and at weekly intervals by phone calls from study
      dieticians. At weeks 0, 4, 6 and 10, patients will undergo assessments for (i) physical
      examination with assessments for weight, blood pressure, pulse, anthropometrics and a
      standardized clinical assessment of volume status. (ii) volume status using bioelectrical
      impedance analysis (BIA) (iii) 24-hour urine testing for, albumin, creatinine and aldosterone
      Every 2 weeks throughout the study, a 24-hour urine sodium will be measured for compliance,
      and serum electrolytes will be assessed for safety.

      Data Analysis: BIA measurements in the low salt group will be compared with the regular diet
      group using the standard linear model analysis for 2x2 crossover trials. Additionally,
      24-hour ambulatory and static blood pressure and 24-hour urine aldosterone levels will be
      compared between the two groups.

      Future Implications: A significant reduction in the degree of volume expansion (as assessed
      by BIA) and blood pressure as a result of a salt restricted diet would have implications for
      renal and cardiovascular protection and would warrant confirmation by a larger randomized
      trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Individuals eligible to participate in this study must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the nature of the
             study has been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years and ≤ 85 years.

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures.

          -  Patients with eGFR of 20 to 60 ml/min/173m2 by the abbreviated (4-variable) MDRD
             equation and a relatively stable clinical course.

          -  Sitting systolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg prior to study entry (to exclude people at
             risk from hypotension from dietary salt reduction).

             unlikely to interfere with BIA measurements. The final decision will be left to the
