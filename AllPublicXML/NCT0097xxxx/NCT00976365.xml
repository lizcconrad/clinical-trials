      The purpose of this study is to obtain evidence from test article with efficacy in Metastatic
      Breast Cancer patients. The average of all changes from baseline to post-treatment
      evaluations in global health/quality of life (QoL) subscale assessed by self-administered
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire -
      Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30).

      The test article is extracted from many natural herbals, in which most or their components
      have been shown to have anti-tumor activity. A study in 2004 showed the test article could
      have strong immunomodulatory effect on the antigen-stimulated proliferation response (PR) of
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and T-cells from recurrent aphthous ulcerations
      (RAU) patients and suggested that it might be a potential immunoceutical agent for treatment
      of RAU. Subsequent study in 2005 also suggested the test article as a potential
      immunoceutical agent for treatment of RAU because the result showed it could modulate the
      antigen-stimulated cytokine production by T-cells isolated from RAU patients. Another study
      in 2005 showed the test article also had a broad-range tumor killing function and provided a
      molecular basis underlying therapeutic activity. It was also suggested in this study will
      could be a potential and promising cancer therapeutic or preventive agent.

      The aim of this current study is to explore the safety and efficacy of the investigational
      product with 20 ml, 3 times per day (daily dose: 60 ml) for a total of 24 weeks in the
      patients with metastatic breast cancer refractory to conventional treatment modalities.
