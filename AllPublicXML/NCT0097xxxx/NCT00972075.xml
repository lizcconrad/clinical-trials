  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this placebo-controlled randomized study was to evaluate the efficacy of Circadin™
      2 mg in improving total night sleep duration and stabilizing the circadian clock phase in
      totally blind subjects with non-24 hour sleep-wake disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a once-daily (QD) dose of
      Circadin™ 2 mg in subjects with non-24 hour sleep-wake disorder. Subjects were initially
      treated with placebo for 2 weeks and then were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      Circadin™ 2 mg or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period. The primary
      objective was to assess the effect of Circadin 2 mg given once daily for 6 weeks on total
      night sleep duration. Secondary objectives were other sleep variables recorded by the diary
      like sleep latency, daytime naps and sleep offset time. Other endpoints were CGIC score for
      Severity of Illness and Global Improvement and WHO (Five) Well-Being Index score.

          -  Male or female subjects aged 20-80, having no conscious perception of light.

          -  Meeting the criteria for diagnosing Non-24h cycle in the clinical setting: 1)
             difficulty initiating sleep or difficulty in awakening, 2) progressive delay of sleep
             phase with inability to maintain entrainment to 24-hour-day, and 3) presence of the
             sleep pattern for at least six weeks.

          -  Average total night sleep duration of less than 6 hours per night for at least six
             weeks.

          -  Ability to ingest oral medication and participate in all scheduled evaluations.

          -  Signing of the Informed Consent approved by the Ethics Committee. The Informed Consent
             will be written in both Braille and black-and-white forms for blind subject and
             sighted witness.

          -  Education or a work history sufficient to exclude mental retardation.

          -  Stable medications for non-excluded concurrent medical conditions for four weeks prior
             to the screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of medical disorders other than those related to blindness and medical
             treatment that may influence melatonin production, sleep or alertness. To be
             ascertained by medical history, complete physical examination including ECG and
             general biochemical work-up including complete blood count, serum chemistries, and
             urine analysis.

          -  Irregular lifestyle or life pattern (e.g. shift workers and patients unable to keep
             the study routine).

          -  Presence of a sleep problem revealed that may explain the subjects' complaints, such
             as sleep disordered breathing, restless leg syndrome or periodic limb movement
             syndrome.

          -  Use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics during the study and preceding two weeks or
             5 half lives whichever is longer.

             agonists

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with any investigational agent within two months
             prior to study enrollment.

          -  Patients incapable of performing the daily call to the study IVRS system and reporting
             on the questionnaires.
