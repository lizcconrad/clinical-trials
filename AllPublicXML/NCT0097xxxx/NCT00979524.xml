    <textblock>
      This project's focus is twofoldâ€”to change the culture of an employment training program for
      adolescents and young adults (Youth Opportunities, or &quot;YO&quot;) to more fully address the many
      mental health issues faced by its participants and to expand and improve the quantity and
      quality of mental health services for YO members. Four project components have been carefully
      selected to address the mental health issues of YO members: (1) Mental health
      education/training for YO staff and peer leaders, (2) Mental health education activities for
      YO members, (3) mental health screening on all newly enrolling YO members, and (4)
      comprehensive mental health services for YO members. These project components will be
      implemented at the HEBCAC YO Program (subsequently referred to as &quot;Eastside&quot; YO), with the
      Westside YO Program initially participating as a control site. Researchers at the Johns
      Hopkins University Center for Adolescent Health, led by Dr. Darius Tandon of the Department
      of Pediatrics, will conduct the research examining the effectiveness of these mental health
      services and supports.

      There are four project objectives. First, the proposed activities will increase YO members'
      knowledge of mental health resources and decrease stigma associated with seeking mental
      health services. Second, the investigators will see an increase in YO members' receipt of
      needed mental health services. Third, the investigators will see improvement in YO members'
      mental health. Fourth, as a result of their improved mental health, YO members will more
      actively engage in YO program activities and achieve more key program milestones (e.g., GED
      completion). These objectives are sequential, with later objectives predicated on the
      achievement of earlier ones.

    <description>Intervention group participants will receive an array of mental health education and services based on their level of need. Study participants will fall into low, moderate, or elevated risk based on results of baseline screening. Services will be provided to each group as specified below. Low risk group: (a) Initial meeting with one of the licensed clinical social workers (LCSW-C), (b) education activities to promote knowledge and change attitudes around mental health; Moderate risk group: (a) Initial meeting with one of the licensed clinical social workers (LCSW-C), (b) Short-term mental health services delivered by the LCSW-C, (c) Depression prevention intervention, (d) Education activities to promote knowledge and change attitudes around mental health; High risk group: (a) Initial meeting with one of the licensed clinical social workers (LCSW-C), (b) Mental health treatment services, (c) Education activities to promote knowledge and change attitudes around mental health.</description>

    <description>Newly enrolling Westside YO members will receive &quot;usual care&quot; services, which constitute a moderate level of mental health services and supports. The usual care services related to mental health at the Westside will include (1) the ACASI screen for all newly enrolling Westside YO members, (2) the initial visit with a LCSW-C, and (3) mental health training for Westside Case Advocates. More extensive mental health educational activities and services (e.g., additional sessions with LCSW-C, SOS Club) provided to the intervention group will not be available at the Westside YO Center during the initial study period. Also, Eastside Case Advocates will receive more extensive and ongoing mental health training.</description>

    <description>This study uses a quasi-experimental design to test the efficacy of a comprehensive mental health intervention to improve the mental health and employment outcomes of young adults (18-24) enrolling in the Eastside YO Program. Newly enrolling Eastside YO members will receive an array of mental health education and services based on level of need and serve as this study's intervention group. Newly enrolling Westside YO members will receive &quot;usual care&quot; services delivered by the staff at the Westside YO Program and serve as this study's comparison group.</description>
