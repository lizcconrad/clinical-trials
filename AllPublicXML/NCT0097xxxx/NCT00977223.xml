    <textblock>
      Data from the literature and previous in vitro research conducted in the investigators'
      laboratory (INSERM U413/EA4310, University of Rouen) suggest that adrenal corticosteroid
      secretion might be controlled by sympathetic nervous system. This neurocrine regulation of
      corticosteroid secretion involves locally released neuropeptides. Among them, substance P is
      able to stimulate aldosterone and cortisol production via NK1 receptors.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of a NK1 receptor antagonist,
      aprepitant, on adrenocortical secretions in healthy volunteers. Aprepitant is a drug already
      available for the treatment of nausea induced by chemotherapy.

      In the present phase IV trial, plasma aldosterone and cortisol levels will be measured under
      treatment with aprepitant versus placebo, in both basal conditions and after activation of
      the adrenocortical function by various stimuli, including upright posture, metoclopramide,
      and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. All healthy volunteers will be given the two substances
      (aprepitant and placebo) in a random order during two one-week periods separated by a 14
      day-wash-out.

      This study should allow to determine the role of substance P in the control of corticosteroid
      production in normal man.

      STUDY DESIGN

      Phase IV, proof of concept, interventional, monocentric, randomised, double blind, cross-over
      study: The effects of a substance P antagonist (Emend) on corticosteroid secretion will be
      compared to those of a placebo.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Main objective: to verify that adrenal corticosteroid secretion is actually controlled by
      substance P.

      Secondary objective: to determine the physiological conditions that involve the control of
      adrenocortical function by tachykinins.
