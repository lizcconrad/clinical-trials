      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether a quarterly feedback, education and
      performance improvement site-based intervention has a greater impact on quality performance
      and adherence to evidenced-based guidelines than existing on-demand feedback. This study will
      use a randomized design to compare changes in quality performance and adherence to selected
      measures among hospitals using existing on-demand reports and general quality improvement
      (QI) efforts versus those receiving intensive, targeted QI feedback via reports,
      teleconferences, webinars, and specialized tool kits.
