      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To observe the feasibility of biweekly oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil
           (FU)/Leucovorin (LV) in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who have prior
           exposure to taxane, fluoropyrimidine, and cisplatin

        -  To determine the activity of this combination regimen.

        -  To evaluate the treatment-related toxicities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is presently no chemotherapy regimen considered to be the standard of care for patients
      with advanced gastric cancer. However, more and more patients will receive fluoropyrimidine,
      platinum, and taxane combination or sequential chemotherapy. Unfortunately, about half of the
      patients receiving chemotherapy are unresponsive and treatment results of salvage
      chemotherapy are unsatisfactory. For these patients, there are currently no established
      palliative chemotherapy options, and there is urgent need for novel, active, and less toxic
      regimens for patients with advanced gastric cancer failing front-line chemotherapy.

      On these bases, we will investigate the activity of biweekly oxaliplatin and 5-FU/LV in
      patients with advanced gastric cancer who failed prior taxane, fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin
      chemotherapy.
