    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score Over 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptoms score.
Patients were asked to rate each of the 4 nasal symptoms of Congestion, Rhinorrhea, Itching, and Sneezing daily
on a 4-point scale. The average of the 4 individual nasal symptoms scores was reported as the Daytime Nasal
Symptoms Score. Scores were measured as 0 (best) to 3 (worst).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Nighttime Symptoms Score Over 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Nighttime Symptoms Score.
Patients were asked to rate each symptom daily on a 4-point scale, and the combined score of Nasal Congestion Upon Awakening, Difficulty Going to Sleep, and Nighttime Awakenings was reported as the Nighttime Symptoms Score. Scores were measured as 0 (best) to 3 (worst).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daytime Eye Symptoms Score Over 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Eye Symptoms scores.
Patients were asked to rate each of the 4 eye symptoms of tearing, itchy, red, and puffy eyes daily on a 4-point scale. The average of the 4 individual eye symptoms scores was reported as the Daytime Eye Symptoms Score. Scores were measured as 0 (best) to 3 (worst).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Global Evaluation of Allergic Rhinitis at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>An evaluation by the patient, administered at the last visit (or
upon discontinuation) using a 7-point scale, of the change in symptoms as compared to the beginning of the
study. Scores were measured as 0 (best) to 6 (worst).</description>

    <measure>Physician's Global Evaluation of Allergic Rhinitis at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>An evaluation by the physician, administered at the last visit (or upon discontinuation) using a 7-point scale, of the change in symptoms as compared to the beginning of the study. Scores were measured as 0 (best) to 6 (worst).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-life Questionnaire (RQLQ) Overall Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Patients completed the validated, self-administered RQLQ, which included 28 items on a 7-point scale across 7 domains: activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional. Scores for each domain were averaged, then scores for the 7 domains were averaged for the overall score. Scores were measured as 0 (best) to 6 (worst).</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Daytime Eye Symptoms Score Over 2 Weeks</title>
          <description>Mean change from baseline in Daytime Eye Symptoms scores.
Patients were asked to rate each of the 4 eye symptoms of tearing, itchy, red, and puffy eyes daily on a 4-point scale. The average of the 4 individual eye symptoms scores was reported as the Daytime Eye Symptoms Score. Scores were measured as 0 (best) to 3 (worst).</description>
          <population>The secondary efficacy analyses were based on the ITT (all-patients treated) principle, i.e., all patients who had a baseline and at least one posttreatment measurement were included.</population>
