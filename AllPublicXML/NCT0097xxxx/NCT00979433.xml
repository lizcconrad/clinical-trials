  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether CPAP delivered by bubble CPAP resulted in
      a greater proportion of infants being successfully extubated when compared with management
      with ventilator derived CPAP.

    <textblock>
      There have been no published randomized trials comparing extubation failure rates of Bubble
      CPAP with conventional ventilator derived CPAP. Infants of gestation &lt;32 weeks and of birth
      weight less than 1500 grams considered by the treating team to be ready for the initial
      extubation within first week of life were screened for enrolment. All eligible neonates were
      randomly allocated to bubble CPAP or conventional CPAP.The purpose of this study is to
      compare whether infants on Bubble CPAP had more chances of successful extubation as compared
      to infants put on Conventional CPAP.

    <description>Bubble CPAP will be delivered using Fischer &amp; Paykel CPAP system with a starting flow of 6 liters/minute. CPAP will be initially started at a pressure of 5 - 6 cm H2O and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.4 - 0.5. which will be adjusted to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) between 87 and 93%.</description>
