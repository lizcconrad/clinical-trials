  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infecton (UTI) is a very common problem in young healthy women, afflicting
      approximately one-half of women by their late 20's. One of the most common antibiotics used
      to treat UTIs is Trimethoprim-sulfa (TMP-SMX), usually for total of three days. However,
      concerns about increased antibiotic resistance have led to increased interest in studying
      other antibiotics for UTI.

      An alternative antibiotic which is also FDA approved for the treatment of UTIs is fosfomycin
      (Monurol). The effectiveness of fosfomycin in curing UTIs when given as a single dose is not
      well studied. The purpose of this research study is to determine what the cure rates are with
      a single dose of fosfomycin versus the more standard 3-day course of TMP-SMX.

      Procedures subjects will undergo once they have read and signed the consent are:

      Questions about their medical and sexual history and current symptoms of UTI. They will be
      asked to provide a urine and peri-urethral sample and then are randomly assigned to one of
      the two treatment groups.They will be given a sheet to record symptoms at home. They will be
      asked to return to the clinic in 5-8 and 28-30 days after completing antibiotic
      therapy.Follow-up questions will be asked and urine and peri-urethral will be self collected
      at each visit.
