  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suppression of the adrenal function is a common, potentially dangerous and unpredictable
      consequence of short term high dose glucocorticoid treatment. Identification of patients at
      risk would be of high clinical importance. The investigators hypothesized that the
      dexamethasone-suppression-test predicts the subsequent development of corticosteroid induced
      adrenal insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate if adrenal axis integrity investigated by the
      dexamethasone-suppression-test will predict the development of adrenal insufficiency after 14
      days treatment with 0.5mg/kg of body weight prednisone in healthy volunteers. The
      investigators hypothesize that subjects with a more suppressed cortisol level after
      dexamethasone will be more likely to develop adrenal insufficiency after 14 days intake of
      prednisone o.5mg/kg/body weight than subjects with less suppression of their cortisol levels
      after dexamethasone.

    <description>On the day getting the baseline data we will perform a low dose cosyntropin test to asses adrenal axis function.
All participants will then undergo an overnight 0.5mg dexamethasone suppression test. Thereby participants will take 0.5mg of dexamethasone at 11 pm and a fasting blood sample will be collected the next morning at 8 am to measure the serum cortisol level.
Six days later participants will start taking 0.5mg/kg body-weight prednisone each morning for 14 days.
On day 1, 3, 7 and 21 after withdrawal of prednisone the participant will undergo a low dose cosyntropin test. The investigators will take a blood sample before and 30 minutes after i.v. administration of 1ug of cosyntropin for the measurement of cortisol.</description>
