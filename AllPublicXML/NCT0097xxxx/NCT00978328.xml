  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe clinical and demographic characteristics of patients
      receiving prescription medications containing oxycodone immediate release (OXYRX), to
      characterize patient and prescriber perceptions of the effectiveness outcomes and
      tolerability of OXYRX treatment, to describe prescriber decision-making about pain management
      with a Schedule II opioid and to explore how prescribers identify suspected abuse of pain
      medications.

      Real-world utility of Schedule II immediate release opioids depends on both efficacy and side
      effects. Few existing data sources systematically captured opioid-related side effects and
      their impact on patient outcomes and physician practice. This study is expected to lead to an
      in-depth understanding of patient and prescriber perceptions of both effectiveness and side
      effects associated with medications containing the most widely prescribed oral Schedule II
      immediate release opioid for pain management, oxycodone immediate release (OXYRX), alone (eg,
      Roxicodone®) or in combination (eg, Percocet®, Tylox®) in actual clinical practice. This is a
      prospective, multi-center, observational patient registry. Adult outpatients who have pain
      due to a non-cancerous condition meeting study eligibility will be enrolled. Prescribers will
      treat patients according to their usual practice. Prescribers will treat patients, meeting
      study eligibility, with OXYRX according to their usual practice.
