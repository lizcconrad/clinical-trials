  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IFDVT) is associated with significant post
      thrombotic morbidity. The presence of both obstruction and reflux significantly increases the
      chances for development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Early thrombolysis may reduce the
      incidence of PTS as compared to treatment with conventional anticoagulant medication alone.
      Improvement of the health related quality of life (HRQOL) has been reported after surgical
      clot removal. The investigators hypothesize that such improvements could also be reached
      after catheter directed thrombolysis.

      Objective: To assess whether catheter directed thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of
      IFDVT can safely and effectively reduce post thrombotic morbidity after one year. The
      secondary objective is to study whether catheter directed thrombolytic intervention has a
      positive effect on the quality of life of patients with IFDVT and to assess late PTS.

      Study design: prospective, non blinded, randomized, controlled, multicenter, intervention
      study

      Study population: The study population includes all consecutive patients with IFDVT
      presenting at the emergency or outpatient departments of the participating centres. The
      thrombus should not be older than 14 days at randomization.

      Intervention: After randomization patients will be allocated to either conservative
      anticoagulant treatment or to catheter directed thrombolysis combined with conservative
      anticoagulant treatment.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary efficacy outcome is the incidence of PTS at one
      year; a decline in PTS incidence from 25% to 8% is anticipated. The secondary outcome is the
      Health related Quality of life and late PTS during follow-up. The principal safety outcome is
      major bleeding during anticoagulant therapy. Bleeding as well as events of recurrent
      thrombosis will be monitored. The patency of the venous system of the affected lower limb
      will be assessed as well as the percentage of clot lysis, after thrombolytic intervention.
      Additionally, measurements of markers of coagulation and inflammation will be performed
      during follow-up.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: For patients who are randomized to the intervention arm of the study a hospital
      stay for 24-36 hour is mandatory during catheter directed thrombolysis. All patients will
      undergo additional imaging by MRA-vasovist and air phletysmography (APG) at baseline and
      after 12 months. Clinical follow-up visits will be matching usual care at 3, 6, 12 months;
      blood will be taken at these visits. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires
      will be filled out by all patients at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months after the event; and once
      a year during the entire study duration. Further treatment will be in accordance with current
      guidelines for antithrombotic treatment. There may be an enhanced risk of bleeding in the
      thrombolysis group. The expected benefit is reduction of PTS from 25% to 8%, together with an
      improved quality of life.

    <description>Conservative treatment consists of an initial treatment with therapeutic doses of LMWH in combination with vitamin K-antagonists, followed by treatment with vitamin K-antagonist alone (after completing LMWH treatment of at least 5-7 days and after an INR above 2 has been reached on two consecutive measurements). Or alternatively the new direct activated factor X inhibitors can be used as anticoagulation therapy. Anticoagulant treatment will be installed according to national and international guidelines (ACCP 2008 [23], CBO 2008 [24]) tailored based on the character of the event (6 months of therapy for idiopathic DVT and 3 months for provoked DVT).</description>

    <description>Catheter directed thrombolysis will be performed with an Ekos Endowave ® system (EKOS Corporation, Bothell, WA). The system uses a standard guide wire to position the Intelligent Drug Delivery Catheter across the length of the target clot. The guide wire is introduced through the popliteal vein. Along the guide wire the catheter is positioned. The location of the dispersion catheter is controlled and if necessary adjusted by X-ray. The guide wire is then pulled out and replaced with the Microsonic core (a miniscule high frequency (2MHz) ultrasound transducer). The system automatically monitors and controls the microsonic energy delivery. This system does not fragment the thrombus but only gives a structural change by which a better penetration of the thrombolytic agent is achieved.</description>
