  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label dose escalation study of GC33 in combination with Sorafenib in
      patients with advanced or metastatic HCC. This study is designed to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Enrollment will proceed until a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and a recommended Phase II dose has been established.
