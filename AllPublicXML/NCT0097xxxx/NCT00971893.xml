        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients must be prescribed oral Medrol®
             tablets (4mg and 16 mg) for acute asthma as per the locally approved prescribing
             information. The prescription of Medrol® will be separated from the decision to
             include the patient in the study.

          -  Medrol® tablets, will be prescribed to the patient by the physician according to
             his/her usual practice. The decision to prescribe Medrol® tablet will necessarily
             precede and will be independent of the decision to enroll patient into the study. Only
             those patients who have been prescribed Medrol® tablets will be evaluated for their
             potential eligibility for the study

          -  Only those patients, who are ready and willing to sign an informed consent, will be
             included in the study

          -  Subject can be contacted through telephone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Based upon history or physical exam in the emergency department (ED) or Clinic,
             subjects with known or suspected cause of pulmonary symptoms other than asthma, such
             as COPD, CHF, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or angioedema
