  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the drug AZD6244 can improve the radioactive
      iodine uptake by the patient's metastatic thyroid cancer. The investigator will also be
      testing the tumor specimen taken at the time of your surgery for specific genetic changes to
      see if one of them in particular (the BRAF oncogene) makes your cancer more likely to become
      sensitive to radioactive iodine after treatment with the drug.

      The investigators want to find out if AZD6244 helps to increase the entry of radioactive
      iodine into thyroid cancer cells that have spread and are resistant to radioactive iodine
      therapy, especially if they have the BRAF mutation. To measure how much iodine can enter your
      cancer, the investigators will use iodine-124, a different form of radioactive iodine.
      Iodine-124 allows the investigators to measure precisely how much radioactivity can enter the
      cancer cells, whereas iodine-131 does not. The process of scanning with iodine-124 is called
      &quot;lesional dosimetry&quot;. Iodine-124 is an investigational agent approved by the FDA (Food and
      Drug Administration) for use in this research study.

    <description>Within 1 week of starting the study: Low iodine diet
The patient will receive three bottles of capsules containing the drug AZD6244. Each capsule contains 25 milligrams of AZD6244. They will take 3 capsules orally, by mouth twice a day for 4 weeks. AZD6244 should be taken on an empty stomach (either one hour before or 2 hours after meals). AZD6244 capsules should be taken with water only. Lesional dosimetry with iodine-124 PET will be done twice, at the beginning and at the end of the study. This is done the same way that a radioactive iodine scan is done and is spread out over 5 days. It requires injection with human recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) on day 1 and 2, as well as blood tests on day 1 and day 5. On day 3, you will receive the iodine-124 in form of an oral drink, and the PET scan will be obtained on day 5. You will need to follow a low iodine diet starting 5 days before and throughout the process.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt; or = to 18 years-old

          -  Patients must have histopathologically confirmed at MSKCC differentiated thyroid
             carcinoma of follicular cell origin (D-TC-FCO), which includes papillary, follicular,
             or Hürthle cell histology, along with their respective variants.

          -  Pathology specimen from the original tumor (thyroid) and/or metastases must be
             available for genotyping.

          -  RAI-refractory metastatic disease on structural imaging, defined as any one of the
             following (as described in MSKCC protocol 08-066):

               -  index metastatic lesion non-RAI avid on a diagnostic RAI scan performed up to 2
                  years prior to enrolment in the current study, OR

               -  RAI-avid metastatic lesion which remained stable in size or progressed despite
                  RAI treatment 6 months or more prior to entry in the study. Lesions will be
                  assessed by 2 independent observers in nuclear medicine and in endocrinology.

             effects on embryofetal development and survival at dose levels that do not induce
             maternal toxicity in mice. For this reason, female patients will need to be
             post-menopausal or with negative serum pregnancy test if pre-menopausal. Patients of
             childbearing potential must agree to employ adequate contraception throughout the
             study.

             equation: (140 - age in years) X (weight in kg) X (0.85 if female)/72 X serum Cr. If
             estimated creatinine clearance is &lt; 30 ml/min, a 24 hour urine creatinine clearance
             may be collected and a patient would be eligible if the creatinine clearance is &gt;30
             ml/min.

          -  Patients unable to follow a low iodine diet, patients requiring medication with high

            <description>AZD6244: Within 1 week of starting the study: Low iodine diet
The patient will receive three bottles of capsules containing the drug AZD6244. Each capsule contains 25 milligrams of AZD6244. They will take 3 capsules orally, by mouth twice a day for 4 weeks. AZD6244 should be taken on an empty stomach (either one hour before or 2 hours after meals). AZD6244 capsules should be taken with water only. Lesional dosimetry with iodine-124 PET will be done twice, at the beginning and at the end of the study. This is done the same way that a radioactive iodine scan is done and is spread out over 5 days. It requires injection with human recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) on day 1 and 2, as well as blood tests on day 1 and day 5. On day 3, you will receive the iodine-124 in form of an oral drink, and the PET scan will be obtained on day 5. You will need to follow a low iodine diet starting 5 days before and throughout the process.</description>
