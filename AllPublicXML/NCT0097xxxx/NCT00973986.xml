  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of CYP3A polymorphisms on the
      pharmacokinetics of Atorvastatin in Chinese subjects with coronary heart disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large variability exists in the individual response to statins. CYP3A polymorphisms likely
      contribute to variable response to those drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A including
      atorvastatin.
