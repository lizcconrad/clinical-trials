  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate high and low areas of growth, or proliferation,
      within the tumor. An imaging technique using a very small amount of a radioactive tracer
      called 18Ffluoro-deoxy-L-thymidine (18F-FLT) can detect areas of rapid growth within the
      tumor. This imaging technique is called a FLT PET imaging. This present study involves
      obtaining one scan using FLT PET imaging. The goal of this study is to investigate
      associations between the imaging findings showing differences in growth rate within the tumor
      and the biology of the tumor that is measured in the sampled tumor tissue. This information
      may be used in future brain tumor patients to determine the best combination of treatment for
      individual patients. These studies may also improve our understanding of the types of changes
      taking place in brain tumor tissue that could improve individual patient outcome. FLT is
      produced for human use by the MSKCC cyclotron facility under an investigational new drug
      (IND) approval issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that FLT is
      produced under strict rules and regulations, is considered safe, and has been approved for
      use in humans for certain disease conditions. 18F-FLT has been used in several research
      studies to date at this institution.

    <description>The patient will undergo MRI and 18F-FLT PET scans of the brain. A IV catheter will be placed in a superficial hand or arm vein for administration of 18F-FLT (approximately 370 MBq), prepared by the MSKCC Radiochemistry Core Facility. A second venous catheter will be placed in the opposite hand or arm for venous blood sampling. If a central venous catheter is present, it will be used for blood sampling or radiopharmaceutical administration, and only a single venous catheter will be placed. Sequential blood samples may be obtained following 18F-FLT infusion for assaying whole blood and plasma radioactivity. All catheters will be removed at the end of the day.</description>
