      The purpose of this research study is to determine the change in perceived levels of pain and
      dysfunction in 50 patients with chronic low back pain, following the use of custom-made shoe
      orthotics for a three month period. The hypothesis of this study is that custom orthotic
      intervention will improve the patients' low back pain and dysfunction symptoms.

    <description>This index measures the functional disability of the subject, points on this index can range from 0-50. A higher numeric value on this scale indicates a worse outcome or increased disability (e.g. 0-10: minimal disability; 11-20: moderate disability; 21-30: severe disability; 31-50: crippling). Absolute scores are reported in the data table.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females must be at least 18 years old.

          2. Subjects must be symptomatic with current pain between T12 and the Sacroiliac joints
             with or without radiating pain.

          3. Symptoms must have been present for at least three months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of custom-made shoe orthotics in the past year

          2. Brain disorders (i.e.: dementia or Alzheimer's Disease) that would lead to difficulty
             in questionnaire completion.

          3. Active conservative care (such as physical therapy or chiropractic care) for the low
             back received in the last six months (excluding the use of oral medications or daily
             at-home exercises for general well-being). We do not want to over-treat the patient or
             have any cross-over effects within this study from previous treatment.

          4. Not fluent or literate in the English language. We will not be able to provide
             multiple translators within this pilot study.

          5. Current or future litigation for low back pain.

          6. Chronic pain other then low back pain such as fibromyalgia

          7. Low back surgery in last six months.

          8. Other conditions that may affect the outcomes of this study or exclude patients from
             participation in the study, including contraindications to orthotic use.

          9. Peripheral neuropathy due to disorders such as diabetes.

         10. Low back or leg pain that is not reproducible.

        <description>This index measures the functional disability of the subject, points on this index can range from 0-50. A higher numeric value on this scale indicates a worse outcome or increased disability (e.g. 0-10: minimal disability; 11-20: moderate disability; 21-30: severe disability; 31-50: crippling). Absolute scores are reported in the data table.</description>
