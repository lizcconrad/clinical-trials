      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Cinnamon from the Cassae Plant is effective
      in the body as insulin could lower blood sugar levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is a condition in which body cells do not fully respond to the action of
      insulin, a hormone that controls the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood. As a result,
      blood sugar levels become abnormally high. Insulin resistance is common in women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study involves the administration of a nutritional
      supplement (cinnamon extract). The cinnamon extract like regular cinnamon powder comes from
      the bark of Cinnamon Cassae plant. It is believed that cinnamon may act in the same way as
      insulin and therefore could potentially improve insulin resistance and help to lower blood
      sugar (glucose) levels.
