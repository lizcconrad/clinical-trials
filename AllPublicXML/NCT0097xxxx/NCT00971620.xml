  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous leiomyomas are benign tumors of smooth muscle origin. They can be very painful, and
      current treatments for the tumors and for the associated pain do not produce satisfactory
      results. One potential treatment for localized severe muscle pain involves injections with
      botulinum toxin A. This study will investigate the effectiveness, side effects, and dosage of
      botulinum toxin A (BOTOX) as a treatment for patients with pain associated with cutaneous
      leiomyomas.

      This study will include 18 subjects, all of whom will be 18 years of age and older, who have
      pain associated with cutaneous leiomyomas.

      For the 24-week study, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.
      Neither the study team nor the patient will know to which group patients have been assigned.
      Before the study begins, all participants must provide a full medical history for research
      and evaluation purposes, fill out pain and quality-of-life questionnaires, and undergo an ice
      test in which researchers will apply ice to the site of the cutaneous leiomyomas and ask
      participants to evaluate the level of pain before and after ice application. Both groups will
      be required to keep a pain diary throughout the study to record their level of pain on a
      daily basis, and will be asked to avoid or restrict the use of specific medications or other
      remedies to treat the pain.

      At the first visit (Week 0), one group will receive a prescribed dose of botulinum toxin A,
      which will be administered as an injection into the leiomyoma, and the other (control) group
      will receive a placebo injection of a saline solution. Patients will return 4 weeks later, at
      which time they will undergo a medical examination, and the ice test, and complete
      questionnaires to assess responses and level of pain. Patients will return in Week 12, at
      which time the group assignment will be revealed (un-blinded) to investigators and patients.
      Patients who received placebo injections will be offered the opportunity to receive injection
      of botulinum toxin A into their leiomyomas. All patients will undergo a medical examination,
      the ice test, complete questionnaires, and continue completing their daily pain diaries at
      home. The final visit, in Week 24, will follow the same procedure as the Week 4 visit.

      At the end of the study, patients may be eligible to have one or more of the painful
      cutaneous leiomyomas surgically removed if the researchers believe that the skin lesions can
      be removed with a reasonable cosmetic result.

    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Cutaneous leiomyomas are smooth muscle tumors that may arise sporadically or in
           association with an inherited cancer-related genodermatosis.

        -  Leiomyomas may be severely painful, and current management is generally unsatisfactory.

        -  Studies demonstrate increased nerve density within and around leiomyomas as well as
           increased acetylcholinesterase staining of associated nerves.

        -  Botulinum toxin-A has been used in the treatment of pain syndromes.

        -  Based on the known mechanisms of action of botulinum toxin-A, treatment with botulinum
           toxin-A (BOTOX; Allergan, Inc.), may ameliorate the severe paroxysmal pain of
           symptomatic cutaneous leiomyomas.

      Objectives:

        -  Primary: To assess change in worst lesional pain in the past week based on Brief Pain
           Inventory (BPI) from Week 0 to Week 4 in treated patients versus controls.

        -  Primary: To assess improvement in pain based on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) after
           application of ice at Week 4 compared to baseline in treated patients versus controls.

        -  Secondary: To assess change in magnitude and in frequency of painful episodes based on a
           weekly patient diary in treated patients versus controls.

        -  Secondary: To assess persistence of pain control at Weeks 12 based on the BPI and VAS.

        -  Secondary: To assess the frequency of rescue pain medication use in treated patients
           versus controls during the 24 week study period.

        -  Secondary: To determine the impact of leiomyoma treatment on quality of life.

        -  Secondary: To assess change in patient s condition based on the Patient Global
           Impression of Change.

        -  Secondary: To evaluate the immunohistochemical staining of nerve fibers and muscle in
           cutaneous leiomyomas in control and treated lesions following the conclusion of the
           study.

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects greater than or equal to18 years with at least 1 symptomatic cutaneous
           leiomyoma.

        -  Pain symptoms must occur at least once a week and be characterized as greater than or
           equal to 5 out of 10.

      Design:

        -  A 12-week double-blind placebo controlled pilot study of 18 subjects with symptomatic
           leiomyomas will include initial assessment with BPI, photography, and skin biopsies,
           followed by treatment of subjects who initially received placebo.

        -  Cutaneous leiomyomas will undergo intralesional injection with botulinum toxin-A.

        -  Subjects will return at Weeks 4 and 12 for repeat assessment using pain and quality of
           life questionnaires and photography. Skin biopsies will be performed at week 12.

    <measure>Change in Worst Lesional Pain in the Past Week Based on Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Between week 0 and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Change in worst lesional pain in the past week based on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) from Week 0 to Week 4 in treated patients versus controls. The BPI uses an arbitrary units on a 0-10 scale. For the purposes of the statistical calculation, a difference of 1 standard deviation between groups at baseline vs. week 4 was considered significant. Any BPI value above zero (no pain) is abnormal. The mean change indicates mean change in pain score.</description>

        <description>Change in worst lesional pain in the past week based on Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) from Week 0 to Week 4 in treated patients versus controls. The BPI uses an arbitrary units on a 0-10 scale. For the purposes of the statistical calculation, a difference of 1 standard deviation between groups at baseline vs. week 4 was considered significant. Any BPI value above zero (no pain) is abnormal. The mean change indicates mean change in pain score.</description>

        <description>The VAS is a commonly used validated tool for assessment of pain. For this measure, a 10-cm VAS was used to assess current patient pain/discomfort before application of ice to study lesions at week 0 and week 4. A clinically meaningful change in chronic pain intensity using the VAS has been determined as a reduction of 2 points or 30%. Range is 0-10; 0 is no pain and 10 is worst possible pain.</description>

        <title>Change in Post-Ice Provocation Visual Analog Score (VAS) Between Week 12 and Week 24</title>
        <description>The VAS is a commonly used validated tool for assessment of pain. The 10-cm VAS was used to assess current patient pain/discomfort before and after application of ice to study lesions. A clinically meaningful change in chronic pain intensity using the VAS has been determined as a reduction of 2 points or 30%. Scale is 0-10. 10 denotes worse pain than 0.</description>

A clinically meaningful change in chronic pain intensity using the VAS has been determined as a reduction of 2 points or 30%. Scale is 0-10. 10 = worse pain.</description>
