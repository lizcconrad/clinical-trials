  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bladder cancer treatments, Mitomycin C (MMC) and
      Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), to find out which is better. In this study, the patient will
      get either the Mitomycin C (MMC) or the Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG). They will not get
      both.

      The patient had a Transurethral Resection (TUR) or an in office cystoscopy to make the
      diagnosis of bladder cancer. A biopsy was done and removed any tumors the doctor saw. Even
      after the doctor removes the tumors, the cancer can return. In this case, the doctor will put
      medicine into the bladder to destroy cancer cell. This is called intravesical therapy. The
      two most commonly used drugs for this purpose are MMC and BCG.

      Both drugs have been studied for many years. They both show good results when compared to
      other treatments. They have not been studied using the schedule that will be used in the
      study. The doctor does not know if these two drugs are equally effective in treating the
      cancer and preventing recurrence.

      BCG has been studied more often than MMC. The studies have shown that a long schedule of BCG
      is better than a short schedule of MMC. They have also shown that the side effects of BCG are
      more intense than with MMC. A recent study showed that a new dose of MMC is better than the
      old standard dose. Since the side effects of MMC occur less often, it is important to learn
      whether the two drugs are equally effective. That could help us decide between the
      treatments. In this study, the doctor will compare MMC and BCG when given for the same amount
      of time. The doctor hopes the study will tell us which drug is more effective in preventing
      the return of the cancer.
