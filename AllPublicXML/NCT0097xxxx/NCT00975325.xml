      -  Type: Bioequivalence study in male healthy volunteers, therapeutical indication
           (erectile disfunction) not studied

        -  Products, dosage, and route of administration:

             -  Test 1: Yohimbin &quot;Spiegel&quot;® (Desma GmbH, Germany), tablet containing 5 mg yohimbine
                hydrochloride, oral administration

             -  Reference: Yocon-Glenwood® (Glenwood GmbH, Germany), tablet containing 5 mg
                yohimbine hydrochloride, oral administration

        -  Duration of treatment:

           2 single-dose administrations of 5 mg yohimbine hydrochloride each under fasting
           conditions separated by a wash-out period of at least one week i.e. 6 treatment free
           days between all administrations

      Study objectives

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Characterisation of relative bioavailability of Test 1 in comparison to Reference after
           single dose administration under fasting conditions

        -  Assessment of bioequivalence of Test 1 vs. Reference after single dose administration
           under fasting conditions, determined by use of area under the concentration time curve
           AUC0-tlast and maximal concentration Cmax obtained for yohimbine

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Descriptive characterisation of safety and tolerability of the investigational products
           in the study population

        -  Descriptive characterisation of blood pressure and pulse rate around Cmax of the
           investigational products in the study population

      Analytical methodology:

      Yohimbine in plasma samples will be analysed by use of a validated HPLC-MS/MS; intended LLOQ
      for yohimbine is 0.5 ng/ml
