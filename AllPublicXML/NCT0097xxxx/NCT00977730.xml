  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Protandim on the degree of liver
      injury after one year of supplementation. Protandim is a nutritional supplement composed of
      the following 5 botanical extracts: Bacopa Moniera extract, Milk Thistle extract, Ashwagandha
      powder, Green tea, and Turmeric extract. Protandim is commercially available and can be
      purchased without a prescription. Our findings could lead to a better understanding of the
      role of oxidative stress and antioxidant therapy in NASH and may ultimately help improve
      patient care.

      Hypothesis #1: Protandim will lead to a significant improvement in NAS compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis #2: Protandim will lead to a significant decrease in serum markers of oxidative
      stress and liver chemistry tests.

      Hypothesis #3: Protandim will lead to decreased levels of TNF- Î± compared to placebo.
