      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the EndoBarrier
      Flow Restrictor in the glycemic control of diabetes in subjects with Type 2 diabetes.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is an assessment of glycemic control at week 24 or last
      assessment measured via HbA1c.

          -  Known infection (Subjects who have a known infection at time of screening can be
             enrolled if the infection is treated prior to their procedure; if they still have an
             infection on day of procedure they must be withdrawn)

             requiring medication that affects appetite (i.e. tricyclic antidepressants and
             atypical antipsychotic medications) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes
             the subject a poor candidate for device placement or clinical trial.
