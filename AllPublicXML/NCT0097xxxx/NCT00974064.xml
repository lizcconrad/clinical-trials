  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD,
      commonly known as chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Despite this clear link, only 15-20% of
      smokers develop COPD suggesting that genetic factors affect the lung's susceptibility to the
      stress of cigarette smoke. The cells lining the airways (epithelium) and cells that help
      defend the lung (alveolar macrophages) of smokers develop gene expression changes that are
      different from that of nonsmokers. In the investigators' previous studies they have
      demonstrated that there are greater than 200 genes that are responsive to cigarette smoke in
      these cells. But the investigators do not know whether the gene expression is static or
      changes as a function of time. Genes that show significant changes over time may be relevant
      to the progression of the disease. Even though quitting smoking reduces the rate at which the
      lungs decline, many-smokers still go on to develop COPD. This study will provide insights
      into the natural history of smoking-related gene expression of the lung cells in health and
      disease.

      Cigarette smoke is responsible for the majority of lung cancers and is the major cause of
      COPD, the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Despite the well established
      causal role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer and COPD, only 10-20% of smokers actually
      develop these diseases. This suggests that there are genetic predisposing factors that place
      some individuals at greater risk. Our prior work shows that healthy smokers (cigarette
      smokers with normal history, physical exam, lung function tests and chest x-rays) and smokers
      with COPD have marked up and down regulation of greater than 200 genes in the small airway
      epithelium and alveolar macrophages. There is however, a varied response to smoking among
      individuals, with some individuals abnormally expressing far fewer genes. The focus of this
      study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the response of the lung cells to the stress of
      smoking is unique to each individual but is consistent over time. Furthermore, individuals
      that stop smoking will each have a unique response, but is constant over time for each
      individual. By defining the patterns of biologic response over time among smoking, ex-smoking
      and nonsmoking subjects, we will be able to identify common biologic pathways as potential
      targets for intervention.

    <description>In individuals who quit but start smoking again despite the standard smoking cessation therapy, what are the effects on gene expression of returning to smoking. To assess whether baseline gene expression determines what genes rapidly change to a more &quot;normal&quot; expression pattern with smoking cessation. Does having established COPD determine the relative reversibility of the gene expression pattern with smoking cessation compared to healthy smokers.</description>

      Subjects will not have more than 550 mL of blood drawn over a period of 8 weeks. Airway
      epithelium from airway brushing samples and alveolar macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage
      is processed to yield high quality RNA. Complimentary DNA (cDNA) is transcribed from the RNA
      in vitro and the product is hybridized onto gene microarray chips.
