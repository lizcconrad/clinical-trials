      RATIONALE: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may slow the growth of tumor cells and be an
      effective treatment for women with breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well DHEA works in treating women undergoing
      surgery for stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To identify the effect of the adrenal steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), on tumor
           proliferation in women with estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative,
           HER2/neu-negative, and androgen receptor (AR)-positive stage I-III adenocarcinoma of the
           breast.

      Secondary

        -  To study the effect of DHEA on expression of AR in these patients.

        -  To assess the effect of DHEA on changes in serum estrogen and androgen hormone levels
           (e.g., estrone, estradiol, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, DHEA, and DHEA-sulfate) in
           these patients.

        -  To assess the toxicity of DHEA in these patients.

        -  To follow the clinical course of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) twice daily on days -14 to 0.
      Patients then undergo surgery on day 1.

      Tissue samples are collected at baseline and at the time of surgery for biomarker analysis
      (androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2/neu, Ki-67, and p53) by
      IHC. Blood samples are collected at baseline and after completion of treatment with DHEA for
      analysis of serum hormone (e.g., estrone, estradiol, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, DHEA,
      and DHEA-sulfate) and cytokine levels.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 1 week and then every 6 months
      for 3 years.
