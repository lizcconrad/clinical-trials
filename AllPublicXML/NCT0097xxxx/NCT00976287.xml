      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of autologous bone marrow
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation via hepatic artery in the treatment of liver
      cirrhosis. Liver function was monitored by serum examination. The levels of serum alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT) and albumin (ALB) were
      examined at pre-transplantation, and 3 days to 2 years post-transplantation. Child-Pugh
      scores and clinical symptoms were also observed simultaneously.

      Patients with liver cirrhosis were randomly separated into two groups. Autologous MSCs were
      infused to patients using interventional method via hepatic artery for One group. The
      catheter was inserted to proper hepatic artery. After the catheter placed at proper hepatic
      artery was confirmed by angiography, autologous bone marrow MSCs were infused slowly for
      20-30 minutes. The control group accepted conserved therapy.
