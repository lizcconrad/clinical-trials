  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year in the United States alone, a third of a million persons are hospitalized for
      traumatic brain injury (TBI), of whom approximately 1/4 die. Most are less than 30 years of
      age. Not only are the health care costs staggering for both initial care and rehabilitation,
      but the societal loss in terms of economic impact reaches into the billions of dollars
      annually in the U.S. alone. Despite advances in neurosurgical interventions and intensive
      care management, many survivors do not fully recover. A significant cause of this mortality
      and morbidity is thought due to potentially preventable secondary injury, namely oxidant
      injury, inflammation, and apoptosis in the penumbra (the area of brain surrounding the
      primary lesion, which is at-risk, but potentially salvageable), beginning in the first few
      hours after the severe traumatic event.

      Despite the current bleak outlook for many of these patients, a series of animal
      investigations have uncovered a promising solution to the problem of the secondary injury
      seen in severe TBI and other similar processes, namely the early administration of estrogen,
      a strong anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic compound. Based on these
      encouraging results from animal studies, the investigators hypothesize that early
      administration of IV PremarinÂ® in patients with severe TBI will safely reduce secondary brain
      injury, improve neurological outcomes, and improve survival.
