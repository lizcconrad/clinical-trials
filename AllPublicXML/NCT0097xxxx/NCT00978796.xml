  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of sitagliptin on glucose variability
      both after meals and overnight in adult patients with type 1 diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improved post prandial glucose control with multiple daily injections of insulin in the DCCT
      study demonstrated significant reductions in microvascular complication. Similar to type 2
      diabetes, patients with type 1 diabetes have a paradoxical increase in glucagon after meals
      which contribute to worsening post prandial glucose control. This proposed study is designed
      to determine if altering the glucagon axis by giving sitagliptin can improve glucose control
      in patients with type 1 diabetes.
