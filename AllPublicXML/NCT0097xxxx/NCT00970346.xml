  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease caused by a mutation in the gene that makes the cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein. As a result mucus stagnation, obstruction and
      plugging take place in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, the biliary and pancreatic
      duct, and in the reproductive system. The objective of this study is to determine the safety
      and tolerability of 3 days of daily dosing of OligoG CF-5/20 versus placebo in healthy
      volunteers.
