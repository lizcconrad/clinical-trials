  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central sensitisation is an increase in the excitability of nerves within the central nervous
      system, which can lead to heightened sensitivity to certain stimuli. This process is involved
      in some chronic pain conditions e.g. migraines and non−cardiac chest pain. Recent work by our
      group suggests central sensitisation may be an important mechanism leading to chronic cough.

      The main questions in this study include:

        1. Can the investigators induce temporary central sensitisation of the cough reflex in
           healthy volunteers for testing of new medications?

        2. Can the investigators demonstrate exaggerated sensitisation in patients with chronic
           cough (indicating these patients are already centrally sensitised)?

      In animal studies, acid infusion into the gullet (oesophagus) is able to induce central
      sensitisation of the cough reflex. Acid infusion into the oesophagus has also been shown to
      induce central sensitisation in human healthy volunteers, increasing the sensitivity to pain
      on the front of the chest but this study did not test the the cough reflex. Using human
      participants, the investigators plan to test whether acid infusion into the oesophagus
      increases the sensitivity of the cough reflex in healthy volunteers and also patients
      complaining of chronic cough.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy volunteers inclusion:

          -  Over 18 years

          -  Measurable cough reflex sensitivity − required as is the primary end−point

          -  No current or past history of chronic cough or chronic respiratory disease

        Chronic Cough Patients inclusion:

          -  Over 18 years

          -  Chronic persistent cough (&gt; 8 weeks) despite investigation and/or treatment trials for
             cough variant asthma/post−nasal drip and gastro−oesophageal reflux

          -  Normal chest radiograph − primary respiratory cause for cough excluded

          -  Normal lung function − primary respiratory cause for cough excluded Measurable cough
             reflex sensitivity − required as primary end−point

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recent upper respiratory tract infection (&lt;4 weeks) − this can lead to increased
             sensitivity of the cough reflex which resolves as the infection settles

          -  Pregnancy/breast−feeding − unknown effects of oesophageal acid infusion

          -  Current smokers or ex−smokers with &lt; 6 month abstinence or history &gt; 20 pack years −
             smoking can alter the sensitivity of the cough reflex

          -  Opiate or ACE inhibitor use or centrally acting medication − can alter the cough
             reflex sensitivity

          -  Symptomatic gastro−oesophageal reflux, post−nasal drip or asthma (chronic cough cohort
             may have been treated for these in the past but cough did not resolve) − these
             conditions are known to cause cough and alter cough reflex sensitivity

          -  Significant ongoing chronic
             respiratory/cardiovascular/gastro−intestinal/haematological/ neurological/psychiatric
             illness. We are aiming to recruit healthy volunteers and chronic cough patients who
             are otherwise healthy
