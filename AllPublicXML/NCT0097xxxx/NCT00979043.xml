    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effect of dietary weight-loss,
      exercise training, or a combination of both on physical function in overweight and obese
      adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA). In secondary analyses, the effect of weight-loss and/or
      exercise on OA progression, self-reported pain and inflammation were examined. In post-trial
      analyses, the effect of dietary weight-loss on total mortality was determined.

    <description>Participants participated in resistance training (15 minutes) and aerobic exercise (30 minutes) 3d/week for 18-months. The first 4-months of the exercise training were facility-based. After 4-months, participants were allowed to transition to a home-based intervention if they chose to.</description>
