      According to the above evidence, though the exact mechanism contributing to the
      Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) associated peripheral edema is still unclear, the investigators
      hypothesize that the genetic variations of certain candidate genes involved in peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma itself and PPAR gamma-regulated genes may
      contribute to TZDs-associated peripheral edema. Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct
      a case-control study to test the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      in certain candidate genes and TZDs related peripheral edema.

      A large fraction of individuals, both with type 2 diabetes (38-41) or who are at risk for
      type 2 diabetes, do not respond to TZD therapy. In individuals with type 2 diabetes,
      non-response has not been carefully characterized, but data from studies in at-risk
      individuals suggests that a lack of improvement in insulin sensitivity (Si) may account for
      the lack of response to TZD therapy. In the Troglitazone In the Prevention Of Diabetes
      (TRIPOD) study, around 30% of treated women did not show an improvement in Si; they gained no
      protection from type 2 diabetes when compared with the placebo group. Assessment of baseline
      clinical and physiologic measurements revealed similar levels of adiposity, fasting glucose
      and insulin, Si and β-cell function, fasting lipids, contraceptive use, and compliance with
      study medication between responders and nonresponders, suggesting that these measures do not
      predict TZD response.

      The adipose tissue-derived hormone adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity and its
      circulating levels are decreased in obesity induced insulin resistance. In ob/ob mice lacking
      adiponectin, the ability of PPARγ agonists, TZDs, to improve glucose tolerance is diminished.
      It implied that adiponectin is an important contributor to PPARγ-mediated improvements in
      glucose tolerance through mechanisms that involve the activation of the AMPK pathway. On the
      other hand, it has been shown that FOXO1 repressed PPARγ1 and γ2 promoters in primary
      adipocytes. It has also been reported that peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-γ
      coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) gene expression in brown and white adipocytes is a direct target of
      TZDs and activators of retinoid X receptor (RXR). Taken together, both FOXO1 and PGC-1α
      potentially played important roles on the antidiabetic action of TZDs.

      In summary, though TZDs have been widely used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, some
      of patients experienced TZD-related peripheral edema and some of patients had no good
      responsiveness to TZDs. The underlying contributing factors and molecular mechanisms have not
      been clearly elucidated. In this study, the investigators will identify the contributing
      factors of TZD-related peripheral edema and responsiveness to TZDs. The investigators will
      also identify the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of certain candidate
      genes with TZD related peripheral edema and responsiveness to TZDs. It may identify some
      clinical and pharmacogenetic factors to predict the occurrence of TZD-related edema and the
      responsiveness to TZDs.
