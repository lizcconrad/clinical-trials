  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This present study, randomized, single-blind, dose-ranging, multicenter study, will evaluate
      immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of two doses of an adjuvanted and not-adjuvanted new
      swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus monovalent subunit vaccine in healthy adult and elderly
      subjects. A booster dose will be administered 12 months after the first vaccination.

          4. Willingness to allow for serum samples to be stored beyond the study period, for
             potential additional future testing to better characterize immune response.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individual not able to comprehend and to follow all required study procedures;

          2. History or any illness that might interfere with the results of the study or pose
             additional risk to the subjects due to participation in the study;

          3. Any serious chronic or progressive disease according to judgment of the investigator

          4. History of any anaphylaxis, serious vaccine reactions, to any excipients.

          5. Adjuvanted influenza vaccine or documented confirmed or suspected influenza disease
             within 3 months prior to Day 1;

          6. Receipt of another investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to enrollment, or before
             completion of the safety follow-up period in this or in another study; unwilling to
             refuse participation in another clinical study through the end of this study;

          7. Any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or who are planning to receive
             any vaccine within 4 weeks from the study vaccines; only exception being plain
             seasonal influenza vaccines which are allowed until 1 week prior to and after 1 week
             study vaccinations.

          8. Receipt of blood, blood products and/or plasma derivatives or any parenteral
             immunoglobulin preparation in the past 12 weeks;

         11. History of progressive or severe neurological disorders;

         12. Surgery planned during the study period that in the Investigator's opinion would
