      The purpose of this study is to develop a recommended local anesthetic protocol and
      post-treatment pain management regimen, in order to assure patient comfort during
      office-based treatment with the MyoSure Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal Device. Subject
      self-reported pain scores (as rated on an 11 point scale) will be compared at multiple time
      intervals between all treatment groups.

      Forty subjects will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled study conducted at four physician
      offices or day surgery settings. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to a local anesthetic group
      (Group #1 or Group #2). Subjects will undergo a hysteroscopic tissue removal procedure to
      remove intrauterine polyps, type 0 fibroids, or type I fibroids. Subsequent to the procedure,
      subjects will be randomized 1:1 within the local anesthetic group to a post procedure pain
      management group (Group A or Group B). Subject self-reported pain scores (as rated on an 11
      point scale)will be compared at three time points: Immediately post procedure, prior to
      discharge from the treatment facility, and at 48 hours post procedure.

    <description>The MyoSure Tissue Removal Device consists of a hand-held tissue removal device comprising a mechanical drive assembly connected to a drive cable and associated control box on one end, and a 3 mm shaft on the other end of the device. The shaft is approximately 12 cm long and equipped with an open channel that houses an oscillating blade.When the side channel is exposed to target tissue and the motor is activated, the oscillating blade will cut the tissue within the channel. Once cut, the tissue travels down the center of the 3mm shaft via suction coupled to the proximal end of the tissue removal device, and is trapped in a vacutainer bottle.</description>
