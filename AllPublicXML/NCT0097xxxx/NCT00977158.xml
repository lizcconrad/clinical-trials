  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is characterize the changes in bacterial diversity of the upper
      respiratory tracts of infants with cystic fibrosis (CF). Another goal is to determine when CF
      patients become colonized with pathogenic bacteria that are responsible for the lethal lung
      damage in children with CF. Ten subjects will be recruited into the study. Throat swabs will
      be collected at 6-8 weeks of age, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months of age in order
      to chart any changes in the bacterial populations of the respiratory tract. Clinical data
      will also be collected to evaluate the possible influence of external factors on changes in
      the microbial communities. This study will provide preliminary data on whether probiotics can
      eradicate the colonization of the respiratory tract by pathogenic bacteria.
