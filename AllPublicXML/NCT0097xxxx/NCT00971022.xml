      The goal of this study is to learn about the factors that influence people to take part in
      discount generic prescription programs.

      The primary objective of this study is to identify the factors associated with awareness and
      utilization of discount generic prescription programs and how two low-income populations in
      Houston utilize the $4 for a 30-day supply or $10 for a 90-day supply, Generic Prescriptions
      Program offered by Kroger, Randalls, Target, Walmart, HEB, CVS, and Walgreens.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will take part in a focus group. The focus group
      will consist of about 8 people who will discuss beliefs about generic medication, awareness
      of discount generic prescription programs, and use of the discount generic prescription
      program. The focus group will last about 90 minutes.

      During the focus group, you will complete a form that asks for basic demographic information
      (such as your age and sex).

      The focus group discussions will be taped, and the recorded tapes will be transcribed
      word-for-word. The taped recording of the focus group study will be stored in a safe and
      secured locker by the study chair. The taped recordings will be destroyed after 5 years.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will end once you complete the focus group.

      This is an investigational study.
