  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies from both human and mice cancer models have demonstrated a crucial role for
      monocytes/macrophages in contributing to cancer progression and disease prognosis. However,
      since each cancer subtypes is associated with a unique tumor microenvironment in terms of its
      anatomical location, cytokine/chemokine profiles and stromal components, the functional
      contribution of tumor infiltrating cells such as the monocytes/macrophages can be equally
      diverse, depending on the type of cancer. Therefore to obtain a global understanding of the
      role of host immune cells in cancer progression, it is necessary to accurately characterize
      these cells in the context of the tumor microenvironment for several cancer subtypes rather
      than a single cancer. In view of this, this pilot proposal aims to carryout a systems
      approach in characterizing the functional phenotype of monocyte/macrophage lineage in 4
      diverse human cancer types [e.g., Colorectal Cancer, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hepatocellular
      (liver) cancer and Renal cell carcinoma (kidney cancer)] and the molecular basis of
      tumor-induced immunosuppression in each of these conditions. Besides providing a global view
      of the host innate immunity and its molecular basis in these human cancer, the outcome of
      this investigation will be crucial in defining the scopes of specific immunotherapy
      strategies to overcome tumor-induced immunosuppression and induce
      monocyte/macrophage-mediated antitumor response.
