    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess [123I]MNI-420 SPECT imaging as a tool to
      detect A2aR density in the brain of PD and HD research participants to be compared with
      similarly aged healthy subjects.

      -  To assess the dynamic uptake and washout of [123I]MNI-420 in brain using single photon
           emission computed tomography (SPECT) in Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease
           (HD), and similarly aged healthy subjects as a potential imaging biomarker of adenosine
           receptor type A2a (A2aR) in brain

        -  To acquire initial safety data following injection of [123I]MNI-420

          -  Huntington Disease Subject Selection. Subjects with a diagnosis of HD will be
             recruited for this study. The following criteria will be met for inclusion of HD
             subjects in this study:

                  genetic confirmation

               -  Subject is able to provide informed consent as judged by the investigator, or
                  assent can be obtained from the subject and informed consent provided by the
                  appropriate legal representative or next of kin.

               -  For females of child-bearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test on day of
