  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of HPN-100 as a formulation
      (GT4P-F) and GT4P as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (GT4P-API) administered to healthy
      male subjects.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, open-label, four-treatment, four-period crossover study in which healthy male
      subjects received a single dose of each of the following four treatments on four separate
      dosing days, 7 days apart:

        -  Oral sodium phenylbutyrate (Buphenyl®) equivalent to 3 g/m2 of 4-phenylbutyric acid
           (PBA) per dose

        -  Oral GT4P-F mole equivalents to 3 g/m2 of PBA per dose

        -  Oral GT4P-API mole equivalents to 3 g/m2 of PBA per dose

        -  Intravenous 10% sodium phenylacetate plus 10% sodium benzoate (Ammonul®) 2.75 g/m2

    <description>GT4P-F (80% GT4P) was supplied as an odorless, colorless, tasteless liquid oil in 125 ml bottles. This formulation was designed to be mixed in water and create a self-emulsifying suspension, thus administered in water for the trial. The administered dose was calculated to contain the number of moles of PBA equivalent to 3 g/m2 of PBA. GT4P-F was mixed in 50 ml of water, taken orally, and then the cup rinsed with 50 ml of water and taken orally. GT4P-F was stored at ambient temperature away from light.</description>

    <description>GT4P-API was supplied as an odorless, colorless, tasteless oil in 125 ml bottles. The administered dose was calculated to contain the number of moles of PBA equivalent to 3 g/m2 of PBA. GT4P-API was taken orally and washed down with 100 ml of water. GT4P-API was stored at ambient temperature, away from light.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Ammonul® was supplied as single-use glass vials of 10% sodium phenylacetate and 10% sodium benzoate for intravenous injection. Ammonul® was diluted before use with sterile dextrose injection 10% to a concentration of 9 mg/ml. Once diluted it was kept at room temperature and used within 24 hours. The dose was 2.75 g/m2 and was administered as an intravenous infusion over a 120-minute period. Ammonul® was stored at 25°C, within a range of 15-30°C.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Sodium phenylbutyrate or Buphenyl® was supplied as a white powder in 250 g bottles. The required amount of powder (equivalent to 3 g/m2 of PBA) was weighed out, mixed in 100 ml of water, and administered orally. Doses were calculated on a weight/volume basis and corrected for sodium content and purity. Buphenyl® was stored at ambient temperature.</description>

    <description>HPN-100 is a triglyceride that has a similar mechanism of action as Buphenyl. It is a liquid with minimal taste and odor. HPN-100 is broken down to phenylbutyric acid (PBA). PBA is converted to phenyl acetic acid (PAA) that is the active metabolite. Three teaspoons of HPN-100 (~17.4mL) delivers equivalent amount of PBA that 40 tablets of NaPBA do.</description>
