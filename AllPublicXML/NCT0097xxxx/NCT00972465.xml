  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in
      the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical
      efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The study assessed the safety,
      and efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with chemotherapy
      in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

      Nimotuzumab and Irinotecan will be administered to the patient until disease progression or
      development of toxicity preclude further treatment.Irinotecan will be administered once every
      14 days,the dosage is 180mg/m2; Nimotuzumab treatment be divided 3
      levels:200mg/w,400mg/w,600mg/w,weekly.The patients'blood test and liver and renal function
      tests will be monitored weekly, a physical exam and reassessment of the tumor will be
      performed and every 6 weeks,when the total result is the CR or PR, the result of the 6th and
      the 12th week should be compared.
