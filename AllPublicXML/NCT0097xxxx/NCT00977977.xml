      Background:

        -  Membranous nephropathy is associated with damage to the walls of the glomeruli, the
           small blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste products from the blood. This
           damage causes leakage of blood proteins into the urine and is associated with low blood
           protein levels, high blood cholesterol values, and swelling of the legs. These problems
           can decrease or go away without treatment in about 25 percent of patients, but if they
           persist, some patients may experience impaired (or loss of) kidney function, blood
           vessel and heart disease, and a risk of forming blood clots in veins.

        -  Kidney biopsies that show that antibodies have been deposited along the glomeruli
           suggest that specialized cells of the immune system, called B and T cells, are causing
           damage to the kidneys through their increased activity. To suppress the action of B and
           T cells and to decrease the harmful deposits in the kidneys, drug treatments are
           required.

        -  Patients with membranous nephropathy are often treated with immunosuppressive drugs such
           as cyclosporine or cytoxan plus steroids that attempt to reduce or suppress the activity
           of the immune system, decrease antibody production, and reduce antibody deposits in the
           kidney. However, not everyone responds to these medications and the kidney disease can
           return in some patients when the drugs are stopped. Also, there are side effects
           associated with long term usage of these medications. Rituximab, a different
           immunosuppressant, has also been used for this purpose. Although cyclosporine and
           Rituximab have been used separately, they have not been tried in combination as a
           possible treatment for membranous nephropathy.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of combining rituximab and cyclosporine to treat
      membranous nephropathy.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with membranous nephropathy
      based on a kidney biopsy done within the preceding 24 months, and who have had excess levels
      of protein in the urine for at least 6 months based on urine and blood tests.

      Design:

        -  Potential participants will be screened with an initial clinic evaluation and full
           medical history.

        -  Before the treatment, there will be a run-in period that will last up to 2 months.
           During this time, participants will be placed on a blood pressure lowering medication
           and will not take any other immunosuppressant medications.

        -  Participants will visit the NIH clinical center for a baseline evaluation, four
           intravenous infusions of rituximab, and also at 1- to 6-month intervals throughout the
           study.

        -  Active treatment period will involve a 6-month course of cyclosporine and a total of
           four doses of rituximab. Participants will take cyclosporine tablets twice daily, and
           have two infusions of rituximab given 2 weeks apart, After 6 months, the cyclosporine
           dose will slowly be decreased over several weeks and then completely discontinued.
           Participants will then receive another course (two doses 2 weeks apart) of rituximab,
           depending on results of blood work.

        -  Participants will have frequent blood and urine tests performed to monitor the results
           of treatment and reduce the chance of side effects.

      This is a pilot intervention study to evaluate preliminary evidence of the safety and
      effectiveness of a novel combination immunosuppressive regimen, Rituximab plus cyclosporine,
      in the treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Membranous nephropathy is a condition
      that affects the kidney and involves damage to the walls of tiny blood vessels filters in the
      kidneys called glomeruli. This damage allows blood proteins to leak into the urine
      (proteinuria). As a result, patients have low protein levels in the blood, high blood
      cholesterol levels and often develop leg swelling. This combination of symptoms and signs is
      called the nephrotic syndrome. Some patients with membranous nephropathy develop impaired
      kidney function and a proportion of these patients may develop kidney failure. The
      immunosuppressive drugs that are most often used to treat membranous nephropathy include
      cyclophosphamide plus steroids or cyclosporine. These vary in their effectiveness among
      patients and there are side effects with each treatment. Rituximab alone has been used
      experimentally to treat membranous nephropathy in small clinical trials. It has been
      associated with decreased proteinuria of variable degrees in some patients.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether the combination of Rituximab plus
      cyclosporine, two drugs with different effects on the immune system, results in a greater
      number of remissions of the nephrotic syndrome and more sustained remissions than is expected
      with cyclosporine alone. Although each of these medications has been used separately in
      membranous nephropathy, the potential benefits and risks of this combination have not yet
      been formally explored.

      Patients age 18 years and older with idiopathic membranous nephropathy will be eligible to
      participate in this study. Pregnant and nursing women may not participate. Candidates must
      have persistent nephrotic syndrome despite a 6 month observation period and treatment with
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker. Candidates will be
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, review of the
      medical records and kidney biopsy results.

      Participants will come to NIH in Bethesda, Maryland for evaluation and to receive intravenous
      infusions of Rituximab. Two doses of Rituximab will be given (2 weeks apart). Participants
      will also take cyclosporine pills twice a day. After 6 months, the dose of cyclosporine will
      be tapered over several weeks and then discontinued. Patients will be re-treated with a
      second course of Rituximab (two infusions given two weeks apart) after a minimum of 6 months
      has passed since completing the first course of Rituximab. The exact timing of the second
      course of Rituximab will depend on the results of blood tests. All patients will be followed
      for a minimum of 24 months from the time that therapy is initiated.

               4. Renal biopsy within the past 24 months must reveal typical changes of membranous
                  nephropathy by light and electron microscopy.

               5. There is no evidence to suggest secondary forms of membranous nephropathy.
                  Diagnostic studies for the common causes of membranous nephropathy are listed
                  under Baseline evaluation. Additional studies will be obtained as indicated.

          1. Age &lt;18 years old

          2. Estimated GFR&lt;40 ml/min/1.73 m^2 (determined by the 4 variable version of the MDRD
             Study prediction equation) while on ACEI/ARB therapy . Lab values from the preceding 2
             months prior to enrollment will be used to assess eligibility.

          3. Immunosuppressive medications or experimental medications of any type during the three
             month period prior to initiating Rituximab and cyclosporine.

          4. Prior exposure to cyclosporine or tacrolimus for more than 6 months and/or evidence of
