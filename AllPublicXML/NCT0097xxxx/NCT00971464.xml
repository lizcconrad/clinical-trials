    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced Age-Related Macular Degeneration will be randomized into one of two
      treatment groups. One group will receive eccentric view (EV) training while the other a
      closed circuit television (CCTV) training for 6 weeks. Reading speed and accuracy will be
      assessed pre- and post- treatment to determine if one treatment is superior to the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration is the single most common cause of visual impairment in
      Canada, affecting people over the age of 55 years. It causes loss of central, detailed
      vision, resulting in difficulty with fine vision tasks, such as reading and writing. At
      present there is no fully effective prevention or treatment for this condition, but people do
      benefit from visual rehabilitation. Two of the most common rehabilitation techniques are
      eccentric viewing training and an electronic magnification system called a Closed circuit
      television (CCTV). In eccentric viewing training the person is taught to use his or her
      remaining side vision, instead of central vision. The CCTV provides high levels of
      magnification to compensate for the loss of detail vision. The purpose of this randomized
      clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of these two interventions. In the study
      people will be randomly assigned to either receiving eccentric viewing training or a CCTV.
      This will happen after they have received basic, optical low vision services and training
      through the CNIB. We will assess their performance with either the CCTV or EV training with a
      variety of reading tasks and questionnaires. The results will give evidence for how it is
      most beneficial to use resources and as such will be very important in future planning of low
      vision services.

      Hypothesis: Eccentric Viewing Training will improve reading speed over CCTV by at least 10
      words per minute in patients with advanced AMD.

    <description>Eccentric viewing is the use of a retinal locus other than the anatomical fovea for fixation in cases when there is central vision loss. This other area (or areas) is called the preferred retinal locus (PRL). In eccentric viewing the patient is aware that they are &quot;looking to the side&quot; or &quot;using their side vision&quot;. Most patients with a dense central scotoma will develop eccentric viewing naturally over time. It is thought, however, that, in many cases the naturally developed PRL is not in the ideal position. The four components of eccentric viewing that will be taught are: 1) The optimal direction for eccentric viewing 2) Using large objects to teach eccentric viewing 3) Repetitive practicing of the technique and 4) Maintaining the eye in the eccentric viewing position.</description>

    <description>A CCTV is an electro-optical device mainly used for reading, but which can also be used for writing or viewing pictures. It is comprised of a video camera which faces downwards towards the reading material and which inputs the image to a digital monitor. Magnification is variable over a large range. By means of a zoom lens and the brightness, contrast, and image polarity (black letters on white or white on black) can be controlled to provide the best combination of viewing conditions for an individual user. The significant advantages of CCTV over optical magnifiers are that it provides high levels of magnification with a greater field of view (compared to the equivalent optical device), allows reading at a more normal viewing distance of about 40 - 50 cms and allows binocular viewing.</description>
