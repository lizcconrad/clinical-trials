      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of albiglutide in combination with insulin
      glargine as compared with the combination of insulin glargine and preprandial lispro insulin
      in subjects with type 2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study evaluates
      the safety and efficacy of a weekly subcutaneously injected dose of albiglutide in
      combination with insulin glargine as compared with the combination of insulin glargine and
      preprandial lispro insulin in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Subjects with a historical
      diagnosis of type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled despite the use of insulin
      glargine or other intermediate- or long-acting insulins for &gt;/= 6 months but &lt; 5 years, with
      or without oral antidiabetic medications, who are unable to achieve a glycosylated hemoglobin
      value of &lt; 7% will be recruited into the study. Subjects must also be willing and capable of
      pursuing an intensive regimen of both basal and preprandial insulin.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The BL HbA1c value is defined as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from BL was calculated as the value at Week 26 minus the value at BL. The analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, region, history of prior myocardial infarction (yes versus no), and age category (&lt;65 years versus ≥65 years) as factors and Baseline HbA1c as a continuous covariate.The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing post-BL HbA1c values; the last non-missing post-BL on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. HbA1c values obtained after hyperglycemic rescue were treated as missing and were replaced with pre-rescue values.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 36, 48 and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 36, 48 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. Baseline is defined as the last available assessment on or prior to the first dose of study drug. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. This analysis used observed HbA1c values, excluding those obtained after hyperglycemia rescue; no missing data imputation was performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. The Baseline FPG value is the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. The LOCF method was used to impute missing post-Baseline FPG values. FPG values obtained after hyperglycemia rescue were treated as missing and replaced with pre-rescue values. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Based on ANCOVA: change = treatment + Baseline FPG + Baseline HbA1c category + region</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved HbA1c Response Level of &lt;6.5% and &lt;7.0% at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who acheieved the HbA1c treatment goal (i.e., HbA1c response levels of &lt;6.5% and &lt;7.0% at Week 26) were assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Hyperglycemia Rescue</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study medication until the end of the treatment (up to Week 52)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who experienced persistent hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) could have qualified for hyperglycemia rescue. The conditions for hyperglycemia rescue were as follows: HbA1c &gt;9.0% and &lt;0.5% decrease from Baseline between &gt;=Week 4 and &lt;Week 8; HbA1c &gt;9.0% and &lt;0.5% decrease from Baseline between &gt;=Week 8 and &lt;Week 12; HbA1c &gt;8.5% and &gt;=4 weeks since uptitration between &gt;=Week 12 and &lt;Week 16; HbA1c &gt;8.0% and &gt;=4 weeks since uptitration; HbA1c &gt;7.5% and &gt;=4 weeks between &gt;Week 26 and &gt;=Week 48 since uptitration. Participants could have been rescued at any time after Week 4. Time to hyperglycemia rescue is the time between the date of first dose and the date of hyperglycemia rescue plus 1 day, or the time between the date of first dose and the date of last visit during active treatment period plus 1 day for participants not requiring rescue. This time is divided by 7 to express the result in weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Body Weight at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Baseline value is the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline weight minus the Baseline weight. The LOCF method was used to impute missing post-Baseline weight values. Weight values obtained after hyperglycemia rescue were treated as missing and replaced with prerescue values. Based on ANCOVA: change = treatment + Baseline weight + Baseline HbA1c category + prior myocardial infarction history + age category + region + current oral antidiabetic therapy.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 26</title>
        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The BL HbA1c value is defined as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from BL was calculated as the value at Week 26 minus the value at BL. The analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, region, history of prior myocardial infarction (yes versus no), and age category (&lt;65 years versus ≥65 years) as factors and Baseline HbA1c as a continuous covariate.The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing post-BL HbA1c values; the last non-missing post-BL on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. HbA1c values obtained after hyperglycemic rescue were treated as missing and were replaced with pre-rescue values.</description>

        <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. Baseline is defined as the last available assessment on or prior to the first dose of study drug. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. This analysis used observed HbA1c values, excluding those obtained after hyperglycemia rescue; no missing data imputation was performed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 26</title>
        <description>The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. The Baseline FPG value is the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. The LOCF method was used to impute missing post-Baseline FPG values. FPG values obtained after hyperglycemia rescue were treated as missing and replaced with pre-rescue values. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Based on ANCOVA: change = treatment + Baseline FPG + Baseline HbA1c category + region</description>

Participants could have been rescued at any time after Week 4. Time to hyperglycemia rescue is the time between the date of first dose and the date of hyperglycemia rescue plus 1 day, or the time between the date of first dose and the date of last visit during active treatment period plus 1 day for participants not requiring rescue. This time is divided by 7 to express the result in weeks.</description>
