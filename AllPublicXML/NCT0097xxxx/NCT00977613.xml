  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the apparent effect of 18 metabolic equivalent task-hours of activity/week in improving
      disease free survival in patients with treated stage 3 colon cancer and the survival benefit
      of exercise demonstrated in patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer, the primary
      objective is to evaluate compliance at 6 months with post-treatment recommendations for a
      minimum of 18 metabolic units of physical activity each week in patients who have completed
      therapy for stage 2 and stage 3 colorectal cancer.

    <description>One MET is the energy expenditure for sitting quietly for 1 hour. MET scores for walking were assigned based on the pace and duration reported. For other activities, a leisurely to moderate intensity score was selected. The scores for MET-hours per week for each activity were calculated from the reported hours per week engaged in that activity multiplied by the assigned MET score, and individual activities were summed to derive a total MET-hours per week.</description>
