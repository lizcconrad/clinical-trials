      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of ranibizumab in patients with
      retinal pigment epithelial detachment secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pigment epithelial detachments (PED) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have
      been excluded from practically all study populations of ranibizumab studies so far. PED
      represents a special entity in AMD. As yet, no standard treatment has been established for
      this disease.The stimuli that induce PED are not very well known, but there is evidence
      suggesting that angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) also
      play a role in the pathogenesis. Ranibizumab is an anti-VEGF antibody fragment that blocks
      VEGF activity in patients with neovascular AMD.
