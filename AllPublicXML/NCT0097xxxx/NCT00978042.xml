    <measure>Responder Rate Based on Improvement in Score on Validated 6-point Mid-Face Volume Deficit Scale (MFVDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary effectiveness variable was responder rate for the treatment group. The investigator evaluated the volume deficit of the patient's face using the MFVDS 6-point scale where: 0=none (best) to 5=severe (worst). To be considered a &quot;responder,&quot; the average of the blinded, independent Evaluating Investigators' assessments of the participant's overall score on MFVDS at 6 months had to be improved (reduced) by ≥ 1 grade compared with the average of the Evaluating Investigator pre-treatment assessments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Treatment Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of treatment effect was determined by Kaplan-Meier (KM) product limit estimate of the percentage of participants in the treatment group that maintained at least a 1-point improvement in the overall mid-face volume deficit score on the Mid-Face Volume Deficit Scale (MFVDS) based on the average of the 2 blinded Evaluating Investigators' assessments (with 95% Greenwood's Confidence Interval).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate Based on Improvement in Score on Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator evaluated the patient's overall mid-face volume using the GAIS 5-point scale where: 2=much improved to -2=much worse. To be considered a &quot;responder,&quot; the average of the blinded, independent Evaluating Investigators' assessments of the participant's overall score on GAIS at 6 months had to be improved (reduced) by ≥ 1 grade compared with the average of the Evaluating Investigator pre-treatment assessments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate Based on Improvement in Score on MFVDS by Facial Region</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator evaluated the volume deficit of the patient's face using the MFVDS 6-point scale where: 0=none (best) to 5=severe (worst). To be considered a &quot;responder,&quot; the average of the blinded, independent Evaluating Investigators' assessments of the participant's respective mid-facial area score on MFVDS at 6 months had to be improved (reduced) by ≥ 1 grade compared with the average of the Evaluating Investigator pre-treatment assessments. The percentage of responders is categorized by facial region.</description>

The investigator evaluated the volume deficit of the patient's face using the MFVDS 6-point scale where: 0=none (best) to 5=severe (worst). To be considered a “responder,” the average of the blinded, independent Evaluating Investigators’ assessments of the participant’s overall score on MFVDS at 6 months had to be improved (reduced) by ≥ 1 grade compared with the average of the Evaluating Investigator pre-treatment assessments.</description>
