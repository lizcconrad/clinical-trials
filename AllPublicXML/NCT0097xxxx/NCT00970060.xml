  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the effect of a 10-week exercise program on nerve
      function and number of nerve fibers in the skin in the lower leg in people with diabetic
      neuropathy.

    <textblock>
      The objective for this application is to quantify the benefits of exercise on nerve function
      including proprioception, and investigate the relationship of these findings with
      improvements in epidermal and dermal innervation. In this pilot project, we will pursue 2
      specific aims: 1) determine the effect of an exercise intervention on nerve function in
      people with diabetic neuropathy, and 2) assess changes in cutaneous innervation following
      participation in an exercise program.
