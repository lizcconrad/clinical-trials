  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze the pre- and post-operative clinical, hormonal and biochemical
      changes in moderately obese type 2 diabetic patients who are sub-optimally controlled on at
      least 2 anti-diabetic agents. Study participants will either receive implantation of the
      gastric contraction modulator or conventional treatment with insulin therapy.
