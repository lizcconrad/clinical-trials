  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The closure of the alveolar cleft as part of cleft lip and palate deformities is a procedure
      that, to this date, still demands great efforts from plastic surgeons. The feasibility of
      periosteoplasty for reconstruction of the alveolar arcade as well as the use of electrical
      stimulation in order to increase osteoneogenesis have been proven in the past. The present
      study attempts to combine both procedures that have only been reported separately worldwide.
      The objective of this study is to increase the osteogenic capacity and hence, dental
      eruption.
