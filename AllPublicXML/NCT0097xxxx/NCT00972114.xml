    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is in a phase I/II safety and efficacy study to evaluate the
      clinical effect of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) combined pedicled omentum wrapped
      autologous atrial tissue patch cardiomyoplasty for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the use of CABG combined
      pedicled omentum wrapped autologous atrial tissue patch cardiomyoplasty for patients with
      ischemic cardiomyopathy. The study hypothesis is that the combined surgical technique to
      perform pedicled omentum wrapped autologous atrial tissue patch cardiomyoplasty as adjunct to
      CABG, is safe to patients with severe ischemic heart failure and can improve regional
      myocardial perfusion contractility, which resulting in improved systolic and diastolic left
      ventricular function.

      The primary object of this study will be to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this novel
      combined surgical technique. The efficacy will be assessed changes in left ventricular
      ejection fraction by MRI. The secondary endpoint of the study is to assess the effects of
      this novel combined surgical technique on cardiac contractile function and functional
      outcome. The effects will be assessed on the basis of clinical status and imaging rests in 6
      month follow-up after enrollment. A maximum of 60 patients between 20 and 70 years will be
      enrolled in the study. These participants will be randomized to receive CABG, pedicled
      omentum graft combined CABG, or pedicled omentum graft autologous atrial tissue patch
      cardiomyoplasty combined CABG. The objective evaluations will be performed at baseline and
      during 6 months follow-up.
