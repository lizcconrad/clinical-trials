      The study will compare the outcomes of treating bone and joint infections with 6 weeks of
      intravenous antibiotics with 6 weeks of oral antibiotic treatment. The trial is of antibiotic
      &quot;strategy&quot; rather than of individual antibiotics. The study will be open label, but the
      primary outcome will be proven failure of infection treatment, determined by pre-established
      objective criteria for treatment failure. The null hypothesis tested is that there will be no
      difference in treatment failure rates.

    <textblock>
      A long course of antibiotic therapy given by a &quot;drip&quot; (i.e. intravenous) is recommended
      treatment for many serious bacterial infections. It is costly and inconvenient for the
      patient to remain hospitalised for therapy, so outpatient antibiotic therapy (OPAT)
      programmes have been established in many countries to deliver intravenous antibiotics safely
      and conveniently. The majority of patients referred to OPAT programmes have bone and joint
      infections. However, there is no clear evidence that bone and joint infection really require
      long courses of intravenous antibiotics rather than oral antibiotics.

      We will compare the outcome of treatment with intravenous versus oral antibiotic therapy for
      patients with bone and joint infection. The choice of antibiotic is complex, and antibiotics
      that are suitable oral choices are often not suitable intravenous choices and vice versa.
      Subjects will therefore be randomized to an oral or intravenous &quot;strategy,&quot; rather than to
      individual antibiotics. Outcomes will be determined by pre-established objective criteria for
      treatment failure.

      We have conducted a pilot study in one centre (Oxford), recruiting approximately 200
      patients, and are now expanding to include multi-centre recruitment in the UK, aiming to
      recruit 1050 patients.

    <description>The trial protocol does not specify individual antibiotics, as the trial question is one of strategy (i.e. oral vs intravenous route) rather than individual antibiotics.
Within allocated strategy (i.e. oral or intravenous) antibiotics will be selected by a clinician with reference to the subject's clinical condition, microbiological data and local guidelines.</description>
