  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder is a complex disease and most currently available antidepressants
      aiming at monoamine neurotransmission exhibit limited efficacy and cognitive effects.
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), one subtype of glutamate receptors, plays an important role in
      learning and memory. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) enhancing agents, such as sarcosine
      (N-methylglycine), have been used as adjunctive therapy of schizophrenia. Sarcosine improved
      not only psychotic but also depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. To confirm
      its antidepressant effect, the purpose of this study is to compare citalopram and sarcosine
      in efficacy for major depressive patients.

      Major depressive disorder is a complex disease and most currently available antidepressants
      aiming at monoamine neurotransmission exhibit limited efficacy and cognitive effects. Novel
      therapies via manipulating other neurotransmission (e.g. glutamate receptor) are being
      developed.

      NMDA enhancing agents, such as sarcosine have been demonstrated to improve negative symptoms
      and depressive symptoms of schizophrenic patients. The purpose of this study is to compare
      citalopram and sarcosine in aspects of efficacy, safety in major depressive patients.

      In the study, 40 major depressive patients are recruited into the 6-week trial and randomly
      assigned into the two groups (20-60 mg/d citalopram, or 500 - 1500 mg/d sarcosine) with a
      double-blind manner. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale(17-item), CGI(Clinical Global
      Impression), GAF(Global Assessment of Function)and side effects are evaluated every two weeks
      during the trial. The efficacies of two groups are compared.
