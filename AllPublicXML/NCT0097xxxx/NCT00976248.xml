      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of RAD001(Everolimus) and the
      highest dose of this drug that can be given to people safely. RAD001(Everolimus) is a drug
      that works by preventing cells in the body from growing and dividing. Information from basic
      and Phase I clinical research studies suggests that RAD001 also may help to prevent tumor
      growth in people with relapsed or refractory lymphoma.

      -  Participants will take RAD001 orally once a day in the morning. Each treatment cycle
           lasts for four weeks. Participants will receive up to 72 cycles of treatment.

        -  During each cycle, participants will be asked to visit the clinic for scheduled tests
           and exams. They will visit the clinic on the first day of each of the first three
           cycles, and then once every 3 cycles. During the visits, participants will have a
           physical exam and blood tests.. Participants may also have CT scans of the chest,
           abdomen and pelvis as well as a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.
