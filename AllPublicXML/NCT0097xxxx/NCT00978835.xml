  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes and hypertension co-exist in approximately 10 million people in the USA and
      constitute severe risk factors for the development of such complications as heart and kidney
      disease. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial in patients of community
      primary care practices to study a tailored telephone-administered behavioral intervention to
      improve control of blood pressure and blood sugar in patients with both hypertension and
      diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that 20% more patients talking to a nurse every other
      month about ways to improve blood pressure and blood sugar control will bring their blood
      pressure under control when compared to patients who talk with the nurse only about general
      health issues. If successful in improving control of these diseases this intervention can
      easily be adopted in other community primary care practices to lessen the burden of diabetes
      and hypertension in the USA.
