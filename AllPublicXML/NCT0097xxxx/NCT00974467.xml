      The purpose of the current protocol is to evaluate the ability of the AfterTheInjury website
      to increase parent knowledge and skills. Primary objective is to compare website condition vs
      control with regard to (a) immediate parent learning outcomes and (b) coping assistance
      provided by parents as reported at 6 wks. Secondary objective is to compare conditions as
      above with regard to child and parent PTS symptoms at 6 wks.
