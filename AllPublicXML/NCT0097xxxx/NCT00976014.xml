      This observational study looks at Carotid Stenosis in two groups of subjects using a
      non-invasive procedure, B-mode ultrasound.

      One group of subjects has had long-term intensive lipid altering therapy (lowering LDL-C plus
      raising HDL-C). The second group of patients has been on conventional &quot;standard of care&quot;
      treatment for carotid stenosis.

      The study will look at the Carotid Intima-media Thickness (CMIT) in both groups.

      Hypothesis: CIMT will differ between the two groups, such that the CIMT will be less in the
      subjects on intensive lipid altering therapy.
