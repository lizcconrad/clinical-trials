    <textblock>
      Despite the improvement of surgical resection as primary curative treatment for gastric
      cancer, more than 70% of patients with stage IIIB and IV disease undergoing radical primary
      tumor resection relapse and die within 5 years. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further
      improve the treatment for gastric cancer in this population. Recently reported phase III
      study comparing capecitabine/cisplatin (XP) versus 5-FU/cisplatin (FP), XP showed better
      activity and tolerability compared with FP. To improve treatment outcomes of XP chemotherapy,
      the investigators performed a phase I-II study of docetaxel, capecitabine and cisplatin in
      advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Phase I-II study of docetaxel, capecitabine and cisplatin as
      first-line chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (Kang et al, Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol
      22,328.2003). The docetaxel/capecitabine/cisplatin (DXP) chemotherapy was highly active for
      the 1st-line chemotherapy of AGC. These findings and experience encourages the investigators
      to design the adjuvant trial of DXP chemotherapy in patients with resected gastric cancer.
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvant DXP in this patient
      population.

    <textblock>
      Previous in phase II study of docetaxel, capecitabine and cisplatin,total 40 pts with
      measurable disease, median 6 cycles of chemotherapy, there were 4 confirmed complete
      responses (CRs) and 23 confirmed partial responses (PRs), with the overall response rate of
      67.5% (95% confidence interval, 52.7 ~ 82.3) in intention-to-treat analysis. Ten patients
      underwent surgical resection after 4 ~ 9 cycles of chemotherapy. Four pathologic CRs were
      identified. With a median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1 to 28), median time to progression
      was 7.7 months, and median overall survival was 16.9 months. The DXP chemotherapy was highly
      active for the 1st-line chemotherapy of AGC (Kang et al, Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 22,328.2003).
