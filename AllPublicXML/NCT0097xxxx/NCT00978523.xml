  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study in adults with advanced or recurrent solid tumors or
      lymphoma is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AR-12 by describing dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs), and thereby establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or, in the
      absence of reaching an MTD, a recommended dose (RD) for additional study of oral AR-12
      administered daily in cycles of 28 days (28 consecutive days of once daily treatment with at
      least a 7-day break between the first and second treatment cycles and recovery of toxicity to
      grade 1 or less, with no planned off-treatment days between subsequent cycles).

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single-agent, open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study in adult patients with
      advanced or recurrent solid tumors or lymphoma. Patients will receive orally administered
      AR-12 once daily for 28 consecutive days. The first dosing cycle will be followed by at least
      a 7 day off-treatment period; however, no off-treatment period will be scheduled between
      subsequent treatment cycles. If daily dosing is not tolerated by the study population,
      alternative dosing schedules may be pursued (eg, 21 consecutive days of dosing followed by 7
      days off treatment), as indicated by the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data;
      all changes to the protocol-specified dosing schedule must be agreed upon by the
      investigators and the medical monitor. If individual patients respond to AR-12 treatment with
      an objective response or stable disease according to RECIST criteria and meet pre-specified
      retreatment criteria, they may continue to receive cycles of AR-12 in the absence of untoward
      or serious toxicity; however, no patient is permitted to start a subsequent cycle after each
      bi-monthly disease evaluation until it is confirmed that disease progression has not
      occurred.

             trial.

          3. Patients must be 18 years of age or greater.

          4. Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or recurrent
             solid tumor or lymphoma for which standard curative or palliative measures do not
             exist or are no longer effective. Patients who have recurrent disease after previous
             surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy are eligible. No restriction is placed
             on the number of prior therapies. At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the
             completion of prior therapy, including major surgery, and patients must have recovered
             from all associated toxicities no greater than grade 1 at the time of Screening.
             Patients with prostate cancer must have discontinued anti-androgens (eg, bicalutamide,
             nilutamide) for at least 6 weeks; chemical castration with LHRH analogues can be
             continued.

          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease or disease that otherwise meets
             criteria for treatment and can be followed by an acceptable biomarker (eg, PSA or
             CA-125) documented within 28 days of starting treatment with AR-12. Pleural effusions,
             ascites, bony metastasis, and laboratory parameters are not acceptable as the only
             evidence of disease.

          6. Patients must have acceptable organ and marrow function documented within 7 days of
             registration, defined as follows:

          8. Patients must have adequate pulmonary function (no more than a grade 2 finding per
             CTCAE version 3) and oxygen saturation ≥93% on room air, measured within 14 days prior
             to initiation of treatment with AR-12.

          9. All patients who are sexually active must use a medically acceptable, as judged by the
             investigator, and highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the
             study and to continue for 30 days after the last AR-12 dose. A highly effective method
             of birth control is defined as any method that results in a low failure rate,
             including implants, injectables, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence, and
             surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy, tubal ligation, hysterectomy). Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test documented within 7
             days prior to Day 0. Furthermore, male study patients must also not donate sperm from
             Study Day 1 until 90 days after the end of treatment.

         10. Patients must have a life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must not have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or
             investigational agents within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior
             to entering the study. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy must have
             recovered to no greater than grade 1 from all AEs/toxicities (except alopecia) due to
             prior agents.

          2. Patients with a history of insulin- or non-insulin-dependent diabetes requiring
             antidiabetic medication.

          3. Patients requiring treatment with anticoagulants.

          4. Patients requiring chronic corticosteroids (dose equivalent ≥20 mg prednisolone).

          5. Patients requiring chronic Celebrex® (celecoxib) therapy.

          6. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition (eg, celecoxib).

          7. Patients who are unable or unwilling to swallow AR-12 capsules daily or who have any
             concurrent medical condition that may impact drug absorption, including a history
             suggestive of intermittent tumor-associated bowel obstruction, and partial small bowel
             resection.

          8. Patients with known or symptomatic brain metastases (including leptomeningeal
             disease). Patients with asymptomatic, treated brain metastases are allowed. Patients
             with primary brain tumors will be allowed in the MTD expansion cohort; however,
             radiotherapy must have been completed ≥90 days prior to Screening.

          9. Patients with any other prior malignancy are not allowed except for the following:

               -  Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer

               -  In situ cervical cancer

               -  Adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in
                  complete remission or other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free
                  for 2 years

         10. Patients may have had prior palliative radiation therapy; however, radiation must not
             have been to more than 15% of marrow-producing locations.

         11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects of AR-12 are not known. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             AR-12, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AR-12.

         12. Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not eligible for this
             study.

         13. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

         14. Patients with QTc &gt; 470 msec on Screening ECG or a clinically relevant ECG abnormality
             as determined by the investigator or his/her designee.

         15. Patients with left bundle-branch block.
