  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Norwegian Social and Welfare Act of 1992, opened for compulsory commitment of patients
      with serious alcohol and drug problems to inpatient care. Clinical research of compulsory
      committed dual diagnosed patients is to date unavailable and is demanded by the health
      authorities of Norway. Because there has been limited examination/screening and no
      post-treatment research efforts on this group of patients, the investigators have limited
      knowledge of the treatment as well as the patient group. Do compulsory treated patients
      differ from those voluntarily admitted? Does this type of treatment influence the patients'
      motivation to change their behaviour, and does the treatment effort lead to positive outcome
      effects in the long run?

      The primary aim is to acquire new and in depth descriptive knowledge about the compulsory
      treated group of patients according to: Drug dependence, psychiatric and somatic co-morbidity
      and socio-demographic characteristics, and investigate whether the treatment yields the
      intended outcomes in terms of improved substance abuse measures.

      A second aim is to compare the group with a corresponding group of voluntarily admitted
      patients within the same wards. A follow-up interview focusing on motivational issues within
      6 months post treatment to evaluate the long-term results of the treatment is planned.

      A quasi-experimental, prospective case-control study will be conducted. Compulsory committed
      patients in five counties during a two year period, will be compared to a group of
      voluntarily admitted patients. The groups will be compared regarding 1) description and
      screening 2) motivation to change and 3) outcome results after 6 months.

      Both official authorities as well as clinical practitioners would benefit from valid
      Norwegian results and knowledge within this field to form further policies and evidence based
      best practice for this vulnerable group of patients.

        In five counties there are a total of eight beds reserved for compulsory treatment
        according to the LOST § 6.2 regulation. Of these, four are situated at the Addiction Unit
        at Sørlandet Hospital (Kristiansand) and four at the Vestfold Clinic, part of the
        psychiatric section in the county of Vestfold, Tønsberg. It will be necessary to include
        both sites for two years of inclusion in this study to obtain sufficient samples, as there
        are only approximately 35 patients in the compulsory committed category annually in this
        region. All eligible patients compulsory committed to the two wards in Kristiansand and
        Tønsberg during a twenty-four month period will be asked to participate during their
        initial assessment.
