  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) requiring mechanical ventilation affects 1.1 million of the
      4.4 million people admitted to United States Intensive Care Units (ICU) every year. Patients
      with ARF have an average ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) of 8 and 15 days,
      respectively, with median hospital costs greater than $30,000 United States. Patients with
      ARF experience deconditioning, muscle weakness, joint contractures, dyspnea, depression, and
      reduced health-related quality of life, all of which may contribute to prolonged
      hospitalization and increased costs. Mechanistically, it is understood that patients with ARF
      demonstrate acute inflammation which may contribute to the above cited problems. While the
      investigators' research and that of others has shown that rehabilitation therapy can increase
      functional outcomes while lowering biomarkers of inflammation in the frail aged and other
      clinical populations, it is not known whether such rehabilitation therapy can result in
      improved functional capacity and functional performance and reduce inflammation in ARF
      patients. There is previous evidence for the feasibility and safety of rehabilitation therapy
      in ARF patients. Therefore, the investigators propose a two-arm, randomized trial in 326
      patients with ARF to compare Standardized Rehabilitation Therapy initiated in the ICU and
      administered throughout the hospitalization versus usual care (control). Standardized
      Rehabilitation Therapy will consist of: passive range of motion, physical therapy and
      progressive resistance exercise (strength training). The regimen will be administered 7
      days/week by a Mobility Team consisting of a critical care nurse, physical therapist and
      nursing assistant.

      The investigators will determine whether standardized rehabilitation therapy will reduce
      hospital LOS, improve functional capacity and performance, improve quality of life, reduce
      inflammation and reduce hospital costs as compared to usual care.

      This study's primary objective is to determine whether standardized rehabilitation therapy
      will decrease hospital length of stay.

      Hypothesis: Compared to usual care, standardized rehabilitation therapy will reduce hospital
      length of stay for patients with Acute Respiratory Failure.
