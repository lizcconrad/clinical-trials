    <textblock>
      -  At least 5, but not more than 20 participants will be enrolled in the study.

        -  Each wart is randomly assigned a test product prior to the start of the study

        -  Warts are equally distributed between products so that an equal number of warts treated
           on each person (2, 4, or 6), when possible one (1) product will be assigned to each hand
           to minimize treatment confusion for the participants

        -  The test product will be applied to a wooden applicator and gently rubbed into the wart,
           then covered with a latex free adhesive bandage.

        -  Subjects will log date and time of application and anything notable (such as changes in
           wart appearance or missed dose) in a log book.

        -  Measurement of wart (longest diameter) and photos taken at each visit by trained office
           medical assistants, LPNs, PA-C or MD.

        -  Time points for office visitation: Baseline (0 weeks), 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks
