  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-year, grant funded project will be conducted by the Division of Clinical
      Informatics in the Department of Community and Family Medicine at Duke University Medical
      Center. The project seeks to improve care quality and safety in an ambulatory care setting
      through clinical decision support for evidence-based (EB) pharmacotherapy delivered as
      point-of-care reports to clinic-based practitioners and as population health-based alerts to
      care managers.

      This project will build upon a regional Health Information Exchange (HIE) network created to
      connect providers serving 37,000 Medicaid beneficiaries from both rural and urban settings in
      a 5 county region in the Northern Piedmont of North Carolina. This network includes 16
      private practices, 3 federally qualified health centers, 5 rural health centers, 3 urgent
      care facilities, 10 government agencies, 5 hospitals, and 2 cross-disciplinary care
      management teams.

      The proposed information system will be based on an emerging standard for decision support
      and will utilize routinely available claims and scheduling data in order to serve as a
      replicable model for broader use of decision support for medication management. Increased
      availability and use of decision support tools for medication management can be expected to
      reduce medication errors, improve health care quality at an acceptable cost, and augment
      disease management for patients and populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the following four specific aims:

      Aim 1: Expand the functionality of an existing decision support system in use within a
      regional HIE network to incorporate EB pharmacotherapy guidelines and to promote medication
      adherence. Primary care clinicians will receive EB pharmacotherapy suggestions and a
      patient-specific summary of prescription claims data delivered to the point-of-care via fax.
      Care managers will receive alerts delivered via email to encourage patients to arrange
      follow-up clinic appointments because of possible medication non-adherence.

      Aim 2: Implement and evaluate the impact of the two interventions on adherence to EB
      pharmacotherapy recommendations among Medicaid patients with high priority conditions as
      designated by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in ambulatory care settings through a three-arm
      randomized controlled trial.

      Aim 3: Compare resource utilization and assess the economic attractiveness (cost-savings or
      cost-effectiveness) of the interventions to promote medication adherence and EB
      pharmacotherapy.

      Aim 4: Disseminate information regarding the development and impact of the interventions
      through Web teleconferences, professional meetings, educational lectures, and peer review
      journals.
