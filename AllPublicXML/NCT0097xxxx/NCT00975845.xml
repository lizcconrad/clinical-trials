      To compare the outcome of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction performed using the
      tibialis allograft to historical outcomes of ACL reconstruction patients and to establish if
      any correlation exists between the age of the graft donor and the clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single site, pilot study in patients with a ruptured ACL.. A total of
      fifty (50) subjects will be enrolled in this trial. All patients will have been scheduled to
      undergo ACL reconstruction and will receive a BioCleanse Tibialis allograft as part of the
      normal standard of care practiced by the treating surgeon. Follow up is for 2 years.

      The age of the allograft donor will be divided into 2 groups:

        1. 18-45 years of age

        2. over 45 years of age.

      However, there is no assignment of graft, specific to donor age, to the patients. All
      treatment will follow standard of care and this study assumes that there will be a normal
      distribution of graft donor ages, from 18 to 65 years of age.

      Patient outcomes will be compared between the 2 groups of tendon donor ages. Neither the
      surgeon nor the patient will be aware of the age of the graft donor, per typical standard of
      care.

    <description>The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) is a knee-specific patient-reported outcome measure. This is an indexed score form 0-100, with 0 being the worst possible status and 100 indicating no dysfunction, disability or pain.</description>

    <description>The SF36 measures the quality life as reported by the paritricpantm, and is an indexed score form 0 - 100. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability</description>
