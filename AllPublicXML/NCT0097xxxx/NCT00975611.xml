  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that amantadine might help to reduce the side effect of
      the medications which are prescribed to treat schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. High
      level of hormone prolactin, or hyperprolactinemia, is one of the side effects which might be
      developed in patients treated with the paliperidone ER or risperidone Consta.

      High level of prolactin might stimulate breast development, might decrease sexual desire
      (libido). The goals of this study are to demonstrate that amantadine lowers prolactin levels,
      decreases side effects, and improves psychiatric symptoms.

      Trial Description: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective, randomized trial to
      evaluate the effects of two doses of amantadine or placebo in the management of
      antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia and psychiatric status in patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are clinically stable on paliperidone ER or
      risperidone Consta. Placebo or amantadine 100 mg or 200 mg BID will be administered to
      participants for 4 consecutive weeks as an adjunctive therapy in 72 schizophrenia subjects
      treated with paliperidone or risperidone Consta to examine amantadine effects on fasting AM
      serum prolactin levels. Participants will be followed after suspension of amantadine or
      placebo for an additional 4 weeks for safety purposes. The goals of this study are to
      prospectively demonstrate that amantadine lowers prolactin levels, and evaluate the impact of
      amantadine on psychiatric symptoms, and on prolactin-related side effects in patients treated
      with paliperidone ER or risperidone Consta.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Too few subjects met study's eligibility criteria to run statistical analyses on primary outcomes. The baseline demographic data are reported here. Future research is needed to understand the prevalence of elevated prolactin in schizophrenia.</limitations_and_caveats>
