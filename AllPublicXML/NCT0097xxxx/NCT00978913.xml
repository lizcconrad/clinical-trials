      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of the vaccine and the combination
      of the vaccine and Cyclophosphamide, and to evaluate the immune response induced by the
      vaccine. The secondary aim is to investigate the clinical tumour response and duration of
      tumour and immune response.

      Phase I trial. Single center study; patients will be referred to the study center from other
      institutions in Denmark. 14 patients will be included in this phase I trial DC vaccination
      regime consists of primary 6 biweekly intradermal injections with transfected dendritic
      cells, followed by monthly injections until progression; Cyclophosphamide is used as vaccine
      adjuvant.

      Defined procedures are employed for generation of autologous dendritic cells for clinical
      application in a classified laboratory. Unmobilized leukapheresis will be used for isolation
      of large-scale mononuclear cells, and dendritic cells will be generated from monocytes by
      cytokine stimulation and transfected with mRNA encoding for hTERT, survivin and p53 if the
      tumour express p53. Frozen preparations of dendritic cells will be prepared using automated
      cryopreservation. Each patient will receive a minimum of 1x106 dendritic cells per treatment
      supplemented with Cyclophosphamide 50 mg twice a day every second week. Toxicity including
      autoimmunity will be evaluated using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC).
