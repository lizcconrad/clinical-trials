    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects and best way to perform genetic testing in predicting
      biomarkers of recurrence in patients with prostate cancer undergoing surgery. Collecting and
      storing samples of tissue, blood, and other body fluids from patients to test in the
      laboratory and collecting information about the patient's health and treatment may help
      doctors learn more about cancer and help predict the recurrence of prostate cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the performance of these models in predicting the
      likelihood of biochemical recurrence (BCR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the performance of these models in predicting upgrading
      and upstaging prior to surgery. II. To explore the performance of these models in improving
      risk stratification among patients eligible for active surveillance. III. To determine
      whether prostatic massage or surgery raises the count of circulating tumor cells (CTC) in
      post-digital rectal exam (DRE) blood specimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive prostatic massage and undergo a digital rectal exam (DRE).
      Laboratory assessments are performed and blood samples are collected for molecular biology
      testing. On the day of the scheduled prostatectomy, a second blood collection is performed
      prior to surgery.
