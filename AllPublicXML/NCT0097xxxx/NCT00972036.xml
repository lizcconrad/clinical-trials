  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done with a new therapy called &quot;Selective Internal Radiation Therapy&quot;
      (known as SIRT). Radiation is an effective treatment for destroying tumors. It is widely used
      in cancer treatment. However, radiation can harm normal tissue. SIR-Spheres are tiny plastic
      beads. They contain a radioactive agent called Yttrium-90. These beads can be delivered
      through a small tube inserted into the blood vessel that goes directly to the tumor. The
      radiation goes directly to the tumor. This spares healthy parts of your liver.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic confirmation of colorectal cancer.

          -  Unequivocal imaging of hepatic metastases.

          -  Dominant Liver metastases. (Small amount extrahepatic disease allowed.)

          -  Unresectable liver metastases.

          -  Liver Metastases non-eligible for, or progressed after ablation

          -  Failed prior HAC.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 1

          -  WBC &gt; or = to 1.5 x 109/L

          -  Platelets &gt; or = to 50 x 109/L

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl

          -  Age &gt; or = to 18 years

          -  Female patients must either be postmenopausal, sterile (surgically or radiation- or
             chemically-induced), or if sexually active, must agree to use an acceptable method of
             contraception.

          -  Male patients must be surgically sterile, or if sexually active, must agree to use an
             acceptable method of contraception.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months without any active treatment.

          -  No chemotherapy regimen administration for at least 4 weeks prior to SIRT
             administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of severe cirrhosis (CHILDS B and C), portal hypertension with
             gastroesophageal varices and liver failure as determined by clinical, radiologic or
             laboratory assessment.

          -  Previous radiotherapy delivered to the liver.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Any of the following are contraindications to the use of Yttrium-90 microspheres, and
             are therefore exclusion criteria:

               -  With a Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin (MAA) hepatic arterial perfusion
                  scintigraphy that shows any disposition to the gastrointestinal tract that cannot
                  be corrected by angiographic and embolization techniques.

               -  With more than 20% shunting of blood to the lungs as estimated in the Lung
                  Scintigram performed after the intraarterial injection of Tc MAA. Radiation
                  pneumonitis has been seen in patients receiving doses of Yttrium-90 greater than
                  30 Gy in a single treatment. This corresponds to the shunt over 20% presence of
                  vascular abnormalities, bleeding diathesis, making catheterization of the hepatic
                  artery contraindication.
