      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures such as MRI scans may help predict early response to
      treatment in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying MRI in predicting early response to chemotherapy in
      patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the technical feasibility of using MRI in a multicenter setting using the
           most commonly available magnetic resonance (MR) systems (i.e., is the trial able to scan
           patients to a specific protocol, using different types of MRI machine) measured by the
           number of MRI scans not completed to technical specifications (i.e., incorrect sequences
           or incomplete scans) or trial protocol (i.e., scans not completed or completed at the
           wrong time).

        -  To determine how reliably the imaging data can be analyzed in a centralized,
           semi-automated manner (i.e., can MRI data be reliably transferred from different centers
           and analyzed using software based in the center for MR investigations at the University
           of Hull) measured by the number of cases where automated data analysis of completed MRI
           scans was not possible (i.e., data could not be analyzed at all or data required manual
           analysis).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at baseline, 4-7 days after beginning
      after the first course of chemotherapy, at the end of their second course of chemotherapy,
      and at the end of their fourth course of chemotherapy (first regimen). MRI techniques may
      include dynamic contrast-enhanced, diffusion-weighted, and spectroscopic.
