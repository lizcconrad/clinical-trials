  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial skin aging is a complex process combining factors such as sun exposure, smoking and
      those that are believed to be inherited. Changes in the skin over time including decreased
      thickness result in skin atrophy, wrinkling, sagging, yellowness and changes in pigmentation.
      Redermic is a cosmetic cream that has been evaluated clinically but not in comparison to
      tretinoin nor in combination with tretinoin. There is no data on the safety and efficacy of
      Redermic as compared to topical tretinoin.

      Rejuva is a cream currently approved by Health Canada for the treatment of photodamaged skin.
      It contains 0.025% tretinoin one of the most widely studied topical product for skin aging.
      Studies have shown that topical tretinoin increases collagen synthesis and epidermal
      thickness thereby improving the appearance of skin aging. The efficacy of Rejuva combined
      with another topical cosmetic cream such as Redermic in the treatment of skin aging is
      unknown.

      One hundred and twenty (120) subjects with signs of skin aging participated in this
      single-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of Redermic versus Rejuva-A™
      (0.025% tretinoin) and Redermic in combination with Rejuva-A™ (0.025% tretinoin).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facial skin aging is a complex and multifactorial process combining extrinsic and intrinsic
      factors. Major extrinsic factors include sun exposure and smoking while intrinsic factors are
      believed to be genetically programmed.

      Changes in the dermis are responsible for many of the important clinical changes associated
      with skin aging. With age there is a decrease in the number of fibroblasts and a decrease in
      their ability to synthesize collagen which results in a decrease in collagen I and II. This
      is coupled with an increase in matrix metalloproteinases activity. Skin biopsies from elderly
      volunteers show changes in collagen bundles which become fragmented and disorganized as well
      as in elastin fibers which are decreased. Changes also occur in the epidermis including a
      decrease in epidermal thickness and a change in the morphology of keratinocytes of the basal
      layer. Clinically these changes result in skin atrophy, increased skin laxity, wrinkling,
      sagging, yellowness and changes in pigmentation.

      Redermic is a cosmetic cream containing vitamin C and madecassoside. A preliminary 20 subject
      split face study has shown that this product was well tolerated and could improve signs of
      skin aging. To evaluate changes in skin aging this study used a clinical evaluation of the
      face, skin hydration, the fringe technique, skin biopsies and skin elasticity measurements.
      The investigators did not perform transepidermal water loss (TEWL), facial skin evaluation
      using a photonumeric guideline, evaluation of photoaging by panel of blinded dermatologists
      or skin replica evaluations. There is no data on the combination of Redermic with tretinoin
      or on the safety and efficacy of Redermic as compared to topical tretinoin.

      Rejuva is a cream currently approved by Health Canada for the treatment of photodamaged skin.
      It contains 0.025% tretinoin one of the most widely studied topical product for skin aging.
      Studies have shown that topical tretinoin increases collagen synthesis and epidermal
      thickness thereby improving the appearance of skin aging. The efficacy of Rejuva combined
      with another topical cosmetic cream such as Redermic in the treatment of skin aging is
      unknown.

      The main objective of this single-blind study was to assess efficacy of the anti aging effect
      and the tolerance of Redermic alone compared to Rejuva-A™ (0.025% tretinoin) alone or in
      combination with Rejuva-A™ (0.025% tretinoin).

      One hundred and twenty (120) subjects with signs of skin aging participated in this
      single-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of Redermic versus Rejuva-A™
      (0.025% tretinoin) and Redermic in combination with Rejuva-A™ (0.025% tretinoin). Subjects
      were randomized (1:1:1) in three groups of forty (40), and were asked to apply study product
      to the face (except to eyelids, nostrils and other mucous membranes) for 24 weeks.

    <measure>Skin Aging Measured With the Photonumeric Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring was accomplished by matching each part of the face (forehead, glabella, corners of the mouth, nasal labial fold, crow's feet, below eyes and upper lip) to photographs in the scales and reporting the appropriate number in the tables. All individual scores were added to obtain the total score (Less signs of skin aging = 0, more signs of skin aging = 41.6).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Photographic Evaluation by a Panel of Blinded Dermatologists.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A blinded panel of two dermatologists had to identify independently which of the two photographs had an improvement or if there was no noticeable difference between them. The two photographs of each subject were randomized to keep the blind.
When the Week 24 photograph was selected as the one showing an improvement, it was scored by the statistician as &quot;improvement&quot;. When the Day 0 photograph was selected as the one showing an improvement, it was scored by the statistician as &quot;worsening&quot;. When there was no noticeable difference between the photographs, it was scored as &quot;stable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Trans-epidermal Water Loss (TEWL).</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) was measured with a DermaLab device (Cortex Technology, Denmark) equipped with a TEWL probe. Measurements were performed with the subject lying down on the back in a room with controlled temperature (20°C +/-2) and relative humidity (45% +/- 15%). All measurements were performed at least 30 minutes after the subject was transferred into this room. The measurements were performed on the cheek. Care was taken to use the same cheek for each subject throughout the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin Hydration (Conductance)</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Skin hydration was measured with a DermaLab device (Cortex Technology, Denmark) equipped with a skin hydration probe.
Measurements were performed in a room with controlled temperature (20°C +/-2) and humidity (45% +/- 15%). All measurements were performed at least 30 minutes after the subject had been transferred into this room. Care was taken to use the same cheek for each subject throughout the study. Higher values indicate greater hydration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin Elasticity.</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Skin elasticity was measured with a DermaLab device (Cortex Technology, Denmark) equipped with a skin elasticity probe. Pressure required to raise the skin 1mm was recorded. Measurements were performed on the upper cheeks and care was taken to use the same location for all measurements. Final measurements were the average of left and right cheeks. When the product is a moisturizer, lower pressures are indicative of efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Ratio - Analysis of Skin Replicas of Crow's Feet.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An illuminator is used to cross illuminate the specimen (silicone mold replicas) perpendicular to the major lines which accentuate the surface details. The resulting image which consists of a series of shadows that directly correspond to the pattern of wrinkles is digitized for analysis. One can measure changes in skin surface topography by selecting an area range (shadow size) that allows one to directly determine the projected area of the shadowed region associated with the wrinkles and major lines. The Area Ratio is the area of the shadows. The higher the ratio, the greater the wrinkling.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Skin Evaluation.</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical skin evaluation of the face was performed by a dermatologist using 8 scales (skin hydration, radiance, roughness, spots, laxity, skin tone homogeneity, softness, relief (variations in depth)). The individual scores were totalled (worst = 0, best = 47) and the total score was used for analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity of the Face Evaluated by Subject.</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity of the entire face evaluated by the subject was performed using 4 different 10 cm visual analog scales (pruritus, tingling, burning, tightness). Each score was analysed separately.
Each score is from 0 = absent to 10 important.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Facial Skin Self-evaluation.</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analog scale of 13 evaluations were performed by the subject. Scale is from 1 - 10 for each evaluation individually evaluated. 0 = absent, 10 = important.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerance Evaluated by Investigator.</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerance was studied by evaluating scaling, dryness, erythema and burning/itching sensation on a 5-point scale.
Scaling, Dryness and Erythema Evaluations
- None (0) - Very Severe = (4)
Burning and Itching Evaluation Scale
None (0) = Normal, no discomfort
Mild (1) = Slight discomfort that is not bothersome
Moderate (2) = Discomfort that is somewhat bothersome
Marked (3) = Discomfort that is bothersome and that occasionally interferes with normal daily activities
Severe (4) = Continuous discomfort that interferes with normal daily activities</description>

          <title>Crow's feet replicas - area ratio</title>
          <description>An illuminator is used to cross illuminate the specimen (silicone mold replicas) perpendicular to the major lines which accentuate the surface details. The resulting image which consists of a series of shadows that directly correspond to the pattern of wrinkles is digitized for analysis. One can measure changes in skin surface topography by selecting an area range (shadow size) that allows one to directly determine the projected area of the shadowed region associated with the wrinkles and major lines. The Area Ratio is the area of the shadows. The higher the ratio, the greater the wrinkling.</description>

        <title>Photographic Evaluation by a Panel of Blinded Dermatologists.</title>
        <description>A blinded panel of two dermatologists had to identify independently which of the two photographs had an improvement or if there was no noticeable difference between them. The two photographs of each subject were randomized to keep the blind.
When the Week 24 photograph was selected as the one showing an improvement, it was scored by the statistician as “improvement”. When the Day 0 photograph was selected as the one showing an improvement, it was scored by the statistician as “worsening”. When there was no noticeable difference between the photographs, it was scored as “stable”.</description>
        <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was intent to treat (ITT). Photographs taken at early termination visit were not available for every early termination subject as some subjects refused to have their photographs taken. Thus, early termination and lost to follow-up subjects were excluded from this analysis. The total number of subjects included in the ITT analysis was 92.</population>

          <title>Skin Elasticity.</title>
          <description>Skin elasticity was measured with a DermaLab device (Cortex Technology, Denmark) equipped with a skin elasticity probe. Pressure required to raise the skin 1mm was recorded. Measurements were performed on the upper cheeks and care was taken to use the same location for all measurements. Final measurements were the average of left and right cheeks. When the product is a moisturizer, lower pressures are indicative of efficacy.</description>

        <title>Area Ratio - Analysis of Skin Replicas of Crow's Feet.</title>
        <description>An illuminator is used to cross illuminate the specimen (silicone mold replicas) perpendicular to the major lines which accentuate the surface details. The resulting image which consists of a series of shadows that directly correspond to the pattern of wrinkles is digitized for analysis. One can measure changes in skin surface topography by selecting an area range (shadow size) that allows one to directly determine the projected area of the shadowed region associated with the wrinkles and major lines. The Area Ratio is the area of the shadows. The higher the ratio, the greater the wrinkling.</description>

        <title>Tolerance Evaluated by Investigator.</title>
        <description>Tolerance was studied by evaluating scaling, dryness, erythema and burning/itching sensation on a 5-point scale.
Scaling, Dryness and Erythema Evaluations
- None (0) - Very Severe = (4)
Burning and Itching Evaluation Scale
None (0) = Normal, no discomfort
Mild (1) = Slight discomfort that is not bothersome
Moderate (2) = Discomfort that is somewhat bothersome
Marked (3) = Discomfort that is bothersome and that occasionally interferes with normal daily activities
Severe (4) = Continuous discomfort that interferes with normal daily activities</description>
