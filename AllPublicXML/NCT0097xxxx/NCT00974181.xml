    <textblock>
      Two consecutive cohorts of subjects were each treated with the CoStar stent loaded with a
      different paclitaxel dose regimen. The first 145 subjects (Arm I), enrolled between 20
      January 2004 and 26 May 2004, were treated with 10 µg paclitaxel and the subsequent 137
      subjects (Arm II), enrolled between 15 December 2004 and 9 March 2005, were treated with 30
      µg paclitaxel. Both dose formulations eluted over 30 days (in-vitro).

      Subjects in both arms completed clinical follow-up at 1, 6 and 12 months post-index
      procedure, with angiographic follow-up at 6 months as outlined in the original study
      protocol.

      Based on results from previous studies and the initial EuroSTAR Trial results, Conor
      Medsystems decided to pursue the dosage used in Arm I, 10 μg/30 days, as the commercial dose
      formulation for the CoStar® stent. The EuroSTAR Trial addendum was proposed for the purpose
      of evaluating the long-term clinical outcomes of the CoStar stent.

      The EuroSTAR Trial (European Cobalt STent with Antiproliferative for Restenosis Trial) is a
      prospective, multi-center, two-arm study to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      CoStar® stent for the treatment of symptomatic ischemic heart disease attributable to
      stenotic de novo lesions of the native coronary arteries that are amenable to treatment by
      percutaneous stenting.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects admitted for PCI should be screened for study eligibility.

        The subject must meet the following criteria for inclusion into the Study:

          1. Subject is ≥ 18-80 years of age,

          2. Subject understands the risks, benefits and alternatives to Percutaneous Coronary
             Intervention (PCI) and has signed the Informed Consent as approved by the Institution
             for the implantation of the COSTAR™ stent,

          3. Subject is willing and able to return for the clinical and angiographic follow up,

          4. Subject is an acceptable candidate for planned PCI,

             leads, or by a CK greater than two times site upper limit normal value with presence
             of CKMB greater than the site upper limit normal value,

          4. Subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to cobalt steel, contrast medium,
             heparin, or aspirin,

         14. Subject is unable to comply with the follow up requirements, or would be unreliable
             for follow up documentation.

             Upon coronary angiography at the time of PCI, the lesion was excluded from the study
             if any of the following angiographic criteria were met:

         15. More than 2 lesions required treatment at the time of the procedure
