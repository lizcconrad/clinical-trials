      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of bortezomib in combination with
      dexamethasone and zoledronic acid on bone mineral density (BMD) and skeletal related events
      (SREs) in Patients with Multiple Myeloma who Have Relapsed after 1-3 Prior Lines of Therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single
      clone. The most common symptom in myeloma, affecting more than 70% of patients at diagnosis,
      is bone pain. The pain usually involves the back and ribs, and is precipitated by movement.
      Bone fractures are commonly seen in myeloma patients and may present with persistent
      localized pain.

      VELCADE (bortezomib) is a proteasome inhibitor used for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

      VELCADE seems to be the first agent to combine significant anti-myeloma activity and
      beneficial effects on bone remodeling. Thus, it appears to be a very promising tool for the
      treatment of myeloma patients.

      In this study, a regimen consisting of bortezomib/dexamethasone/zoledronic acid will be used.
      The rationale for using this regimen is that:

        -  VELCADE (bortezomib) is indicated for the treatment of relapsed myeloma patients
           participating in the study and it has also a beneficial effect on biochemical markers of
           bone formation.

        -  In phase II studies, the addition of dexamethasone in patients with a suboptimal
           response to bortezomib alone improved efficacy in relapsed or refractory multiple
           myeloma patients, without increasing adverse events. Therefore, in this study, the
           addition of dexamethasone aims at providing the optimal therapy for participating
           myeloma patients.

        -  Zoledronic acid, the most potent i.v. bisphosphonate, is used because of its established
           effect on reducing skeletal related events in patients with multiple myeloma due to its
           inhibitory effect on osteoclastic bone resorption.

      Dosages and timing of dosages are based on current recommendations and guidelines for the
      treatment of myeloma patients who Have Relapsed after 1-3 Prior Lines of Therapy.

Bone pain was measured with the use of the Visual Analogue Scale. The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.
The VAS for Bone Pain was constructed as follows:

          <title>Bone pain</title>
          <description>Bone pain was measured with the use of the Visual Analogue Scale. The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.
The VAS for Bone Pain was constructed as follows:
None Mild Moderate Severe Worst possible 1,2 3,4 5,6 7,8 9,10 Lower values are considered to be of a better outcome, higher values are considered to be of a worst outcome.</description>

Bone pain was measured with the use of the Visual Analogue Scale. The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.
The VAS for Bone Pain was constructed as follows:
None Mild Moderate Severe Worst possible 1,2 3,4 5,6 7,8 9,10 Lower values are considered to be of a better outcome, higher values are considered to be of a worst outcome.</description>
