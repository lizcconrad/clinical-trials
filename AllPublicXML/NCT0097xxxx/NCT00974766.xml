  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a pulmonary disorder caused by a complex
      hypersensitivity response to antigens released by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Oral
      corticosteroids are currently the treatment of choice for ABPA associated with bronchial
      asthma. They not only suppress the immune hyperfunction but are also anti-inflammatory.
      However, there is no data to guide the dose and duration of glucocorticoids and different
      regimens of glucocorticoids have been used in literature. The disorder is highly prevalent in
      India. The investigators have previously reported their experience with screening stable
      outpatients with bronchial asthma and acute severe asthma for ABPA. The investigators have
      also recently reported the prognostic factors associated with clinical outcomes in patients
      with ABPA.

      The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of two different glucocorticoid dose protocols in patients with ABPA.
