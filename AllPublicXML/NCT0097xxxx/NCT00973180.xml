    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to test the efficacy of an evidence-based, enhanced Rx
      container label design to improve patients' understanding of instructions for use.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=960) to evaluate the efficacy
      of the enhanced Rx container label to improve patients' understanding of actual prescribed
      medicines, compared to a standard label format. Patients with type II diabetes and/or
      hypertension at safety-net clinics affiliated with one central-fill pharmacy (Nova Scripts
      Central - NSC) receive their prescribed medicines from this location. Recruited subjects in
      this study will be randomly assigned to either intervention (enhanced Rx container label) or
      control (standard Rx label). All pill-form, regular dosing schedule medicines, including
      diabetes and hypertensive (i.e. ACE inhibitor) medicines associated with patients' treatment
      will be labeled according to study arm by the central-fill pharmacy. Study subjects will be
      interviewed at the time of dispensing the prescribed medicines at the clinic, again three
      months later (dispensing of refill), and finally nine months after baseline (dispensing of
      refill). Pharmacy refill data and medical record information - linked at these clinics - will
      be collected for exploratory analyses. Patients' ability to read and demonstrate Rx label
      instructions, including auxiliary warnings, will be the primary outcomes. Other exploratory
      outcome measures will also be measured, including 1) adverse effects associated with
      medication use defined by a) the rate of physician visits, b) the rate of emergency room
      visits, and c) the rate of hospitalizations and hospital admissions via emergency rooms for
      medication side effects (e.g. hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia); and 2) health outcome as
      measured by the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood pressure
      measurements. Data from the actual use trial will be processed, reviewed, analyzed (in order
      of hypotheses), and reports prepared during the final months of this last phase of the study.
