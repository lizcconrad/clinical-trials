  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and acceptability of an intermittent and daily PrEP
      regimen using Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate plus Emtricitabine (FTC/TDF) in men and women at
      risk for HIV, and it will directly compare adherence and intracellular drug levels in daily
      and intermittent PrEP recipients. It will also evaluate the relationship between drug
      adherence, sexual behavior and intracellular drug levels with an intermittent PrEP regimen.
      In addition it will evaluate the relationship between adherence to an intermittent PrEP
      regimen and timing of sexual activity in relation to PrEP dosing. The study will use
      objective medication event monitoring medication event monitors (MEMS) adherence measurement
      and evaluate the feasibility of newer adherence measurements such as hair sampling and plasma
      drug levels. The study will also evaluate the feasibility of using SMS (text messages) to
      collect sexual activity data in an African setting. It will allow study teams and communities
      to prepare for potential subsequent larger trials of intermittent PrEP. This study is not
      sized to evaluate efficacy. If the intermittent PrEP regimen is shown to be safe, feasible in
      terms of adherence, and achieves intracellular drug levels similar to daily PrEP, these data
      could be used to design a larger phase 2 study with one or more intermittent PrEP regimens.
      The goal of such a trial would be to provide bridging data if daily PrEP regimens are found
      to be effective or to prepare for efficacy or non-inferiority trials of intermittent versus
      daily PrEP.

      Investigation of immune responses associated with FTC/TDF will also be evaluated in the pilot
      study. The proportion of volunteers on FTC/TDF with HIV-specific immune responses, due to
      exposures that did not lead to established HIV infection, will be assessed at 2-3 time points
      and compared to responses in volunteers assigned to placebo. Immune responses may be
      correlated with risk behavior and host factors, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type.
      As noted above, very few HIV infections are expected to occur during the study, so
      correlation of HIV-specific immune responses and protection from infection or attenuation of
      disease progression will not be possible until a larger study is conducted.
