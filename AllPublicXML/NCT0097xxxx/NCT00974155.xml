      The EMC trial investigates for the first time prospectively whether Major Depression Disorder
      patients with non-improvement after 14 days of antidepressive treatment with EMC are more
      likely to become remitters compared to patients treated according to current guidelines,
      i.e., with a medication change after 28 days of treatment in case of non-response.

             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or render
             the patient at high risk from treatment complications

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal product or to any drug
             with similar chemical structure or to any excipient present in the pharmaceutical form
             of the investigational medicinal product

          -  Clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition that may preclude
             safe and complete study participation. Such conditions may include gastrointestinal,
             cardiovascular, vascular disease, pulmonary/respiratory, hepatic impairment, renal,
             metabolic diseases, endocrinological, neurological, immune‐deficiency, hematopoietic
             disease, or malignancies as determined by medical history, physical examination, or
             laboratory tests

          -  Participation in other clinical trials during the present clinical trial or within the
