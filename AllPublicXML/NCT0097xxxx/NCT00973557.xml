  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine whether the drug, Bevacizumab (a monoclonal anti
      VEGF-A antibody), which is approved to treat patients with metastatic colon cancer induces
      hyperprolactinemia (increased prolactin secretion) in humans with intact pituitary function.
      Past studies have shown Bevacizumab to shrink tumor size and also increase prolactin levels.
      The mechanism of the hyperprolactinemia might be inhibition of pituitary portal vein
      transport, suggesting that Bevacizumab induces prolactin secretion from normal lactotrophs in
      the pituitary gland.

      Patients who have been treated with Bevacizumab for at least one month will be recruited to
      participate.

      The subjects who are being treated with Bevacizumab by Dr. Stephen Wolin (a sub-investigator)
      will be screened by him for study eligibility. Dr. Wolin will approach eligible patients with
      all the information and background of the study and see if they have an interest in being
      consented.

      If consented, there will be 2 blood draws for the research that is not part of their standard
      care in which 10 ml of blood is collected and prolactin, growth hormone, IGF-I, TSH,
      thyroxine, ACTH, and cortisol will be measured. One 5ml blood draw will occur before the
      administration of Bevacizumab and the second 5 ml blood draw will occur after the
      administration of the Bevacizumab. The investigators will then review the laboratory results.
      The blood tests are of the hormones of the pituitary gland to test pituitary function and see
      if there are any abnormalities with the secretions of the gland. Pituitary function
      abnormalities and hyperprolactinemia are diagnosed by looking at hormone levels in the blood
      and comparing them to the normal reference ranges.

      This study will only involve 10 subjects and will be conducted entirely at Cedars-Sinai
      Medical Center.
