      RATIONALE: Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of everolimus and to see how well
      it works as first-line therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival at 12 weeks of patients with non-rapidly
           progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with everolimus as first-line
           therapy.

        -  Assess the activity and safety of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival at 24 weeks of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the percentage of PSA response from baseline to 12 weeks in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the changes in PSA-doubling time in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral everolimus once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3
      months.

Response at 12 weeks is defined as the percentage of change in PSA from baseline to 12 weeks (or earlier for those patients who discontinue therapy, in this case last PSA values recorded should be taken).</description>
