    <textblock>
      The objectives of this two-part study were to compare the single-dose and multiple-dose
      pharmacokinetics of extended release and immediate-release fixed combination formulations
      containing tramadol-HCl/acetaminophen and to evaluate the effect of food on the
      extended-release formulation.

      -  To compare the single (Part A) and multiple dose (Part B) pharmacokinetic profiles and
           bioavailability of DDS-06C tablets with the immediate-release tablet reference products
           Zaldiar® and Ultracet®.

        -  To assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profile of DDS-06C tablets following
           administration of a single oral dose.

        -  To monitor and record all adverse events.
