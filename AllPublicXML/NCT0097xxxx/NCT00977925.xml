    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and hemostatic effectiveness of the
      Fibrin Pad (FP) versus standard of care treatment (SoC) in controlling challenging severe
      soft tissue bleeding during abdominal, pelvic, retroperitoneal, and (non-cardiac) thoracic
      surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects &gt;= 18 years of age, requiring elective, open, abdominal, retroperitoneal,
             pelvic or thoracic (non-cardiac) surgical procedures;

          -  Presence of an appropriate severe bleeding soft tissue Target Bleeding Site (TBS) as
             identified intra-operatively by the surgeon;

          -  Subjects must be willing to participate in the study, and provide written informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may preclude
             conduct of the study procedure;

          -  Bleeding site is from large defects in arteries or veins where the injured vascular
             wall requires repair with maintenance of vessel patency and which would result in
             persistent exposure of the FP to blood flow and pressure during healing and absorption
             of the product;

          -  Subject with TBS within an actively infected field;

          -  Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony
             confine;

          -  Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the
             study product;

          -  Subjects unwilling to receive blood products;

          -  Subjects with known immunodeficiency diseases (including known HIV);

          -  Subjects who are known, current alcohol and / or drug abusers;

          -  Subjects who have participated in another investigational drug or device research
             study within 30 days of enrollment;

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing.
