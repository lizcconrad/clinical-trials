  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, open label trial to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD),
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of BIBW 2992 (an epidermal growth factor
      receptor(EGFR)inhibitor) to be used in combination with:

        -  radiotherapy alone (in patients with an unmethylated (functioning) MGMT gene regulator)
           or

        -  radiotherapy and Temozolomide (in patients with a methylated (silenced) MGMT gene) to
           treat newly diagnosed patients with Grade IV Glioblastoma (primary brain cancer).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Histologically-confirmed WHO Grade IV newly diagnosed malignant glioma.

          2. Proven MGMT gene promoter methylation status

          3. Available early postoperative Gd-enhanced MRI (within 72 hours after initial surgery).
             In case a patient did not perform a Gd-enhanced MRI within 72 hours post surgery, a
             Gd-MRI is to be performed prior to start of study treatment.

          4. Age more or equal to 18 years and less than 70 years at entry

          5. KPS more or equal to 70%

          6. Patients receiving corticosteroids have to receive a stable or decreasing dose for at
             least 14 days before start of treatment.

          7. Written informed consent that is consistent with local law and ICH-GCP guidelines.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Less than two weeks from surgical resection or other major surgical procedure at start
             of treatment.

          3. Placement of GliadelÂ® wafer at surgery.

          4. Prior or planned radiotherapy of the cranium including brachytherapy and/or
             radiosurgery for GBM.

          5. Treatment with other investigational drugs; participation in another clinical study
             including exposure to the investigational product within the past 4 weeks before start
             of therapy or concomitantly with this study.

         11. Patient is less than 3 years free of another primary malignancy except: if the other
             primary malignancy is either not currently clinically significant or does not require

             situ). Existence of any other malignant disease is not allowed.

         12. Cardiac left ventricular function with resting ejection fraction less than 50%.

         13. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1500/mm3.

         14. Platelet count less than 100,000/mm3.

         15. Bilirubin greater than 1.5 x upper limit of institutional norm.

         16. Aspartate amino transferase (AST) greater than 3 x upper limit of institutional norm.

         17. Serum creatinine greater than 1.5 x upper limit of institutional norm.

         18. Patients who are sexually active and unwilling to use a medically acceptable method of

         19. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.
