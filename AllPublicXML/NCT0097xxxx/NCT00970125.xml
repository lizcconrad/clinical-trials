      The purpose of this study is to study whether preferences for the goals of care for 80
      subjects with end-stage cancer are altered after viewing a video outlining the goals of care
      compared to their initial preferences after hearing a verbal description of the goals of care
      alone.

      The purpose of this study is to study whether preferences for the goals of care for 80
      subjects with end-stage cancer are altered after viewing a video outlining the goals of care
      compared to their initial preferences after hearing a verbal description of the goals of care
      alone. Subjects will choose among three goals of care, life prolonging care, basic medical
      care, and comfort care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Terminal, progressive cancer with poor prognosis whose treatment intent is palliative,
             based on the following definition:

               -  All patients with brain cancer, liver cancer, inoperable non-small cell lung
                  carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, or gallbladder cancer; OR

               -  Patients with the following cancers: metastatic colon cancer or stage III or IV
                  non-small cell lung cancer; OR

               -  Patients with the following cancers, if first-line therapy has failed and limited
                  response is expected to second-line therapy: breast cancer, colorectal cancer,
                  head and neck cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, melanoma, leukemia,
                  ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, sarcoma, lung cancer, myeloma, or
                  lymphoma.

               -  The terms terminal, progressive, poor prognosis, palliative intent and limited
                  response will be judged by the patient's oncologist (and not by the RSA or
                  consenting professional).

          2. Return patient visit (defined as a patient known to the oncologist from previous
             assessments and treatments, where the working and personal relationship has been
             established and not a new patient to the clinic).

          3. English speaking. Only English-speaking patients will be included in our present study
             since English is the validated language of our study tools.

          4. Given the sensitive nature of the study, clinicians will decide whether the patient is
             a potentially appropriate subject based on their knowledge of the patient.

          5. Able to provide informed consent.

          6. Age greater than or equal to 21.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. MMSE &lt; 25.

          2. Psychological state not appropriate for end-of-life discussion as determined by the
             treating clinician.
