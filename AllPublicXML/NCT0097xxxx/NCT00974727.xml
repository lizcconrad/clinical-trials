      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a summer gardening program on summer
      weight gain in overweight middle school children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past two decades, the combination of unhealthy eating and physical inactivity has
      contributed to doubling the percentage of children and adolescents who are overweight.
      Childhood overweight is known to lead to increased risk for several morbidities in childhood
      and into adulthood including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular
      disease. Recent data shows that children experience greater and more variable increases in
      BMI during summer vacation than during the school year. Our project aims to determine whether
      summer weight gain is due to a decrease in physical activity or an increase in daily calories
      as well as to assess the effectiveness of a summer gardening program on preventing summer
      body fat gain. We will randomize 40 middle-school children who are above the 95th percentile
      for BMI into either a control or intervention group. The control group will receive the
      standard of care and the intervention group will participate in Garden Fit, a summer
      gardening project at Troy Gardens in Madison, WI. As part of Garden Fit, subjects will
      participate in weeding, landscaping and trail maintenance activities as well as preparing
      meals twice a week with fresh foods from the gardens. We hypothesize that summer weight gain
      is due to a worsening of healthy lifestyle (decreased physical activity from school to summer
      and increased eating of high calorie snacks). Additionally, we hypothesize that an
      intervention that increases physical activity and provides increased access to healthy foods
      will reduce the trend of summer BMI increase.
