  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic tears of the sphincter ani muscles after delivery may result in symptomatic urinary
      and anal incontinence, particularly in primiparas.

      The efficacy of pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME) in treating urinary incontinence (UI)is
      well documented, however, to date there is little evidence to support the efficacy of PFME in
      treating symptomatic anal incontinence.

      This project consists of three separate studies. The prevalence survey/ study (1),
      investigates the prevalence of symptomatic anal incontinence among primiparas at Ostfold
      Hospital Trust Fredrikstad, Norway and St Olav's Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital,
      Norway, and the results in this study will form the basis of the two identical randomized
      controlled trials (RCT) investigating the treatment efficacy of PFME two groups of postpartum
      women. Women reporting symptomatic anal incontinence at six months postpartum (2) and women
      who have sustained a traumatic 3rd or 4th degree tear of the sphincter ani muscles during
      delivery (3), respectively, are randomized to an intervention group receiving PFME treatment
      for six months, or a control group. All RCT participants will undergo examination of PFM
      strength and activity, as well as anal ultrasound prior to randomization and after the
      intervention period.

  <detailed_description>

      The recruitment in RCT ( 2) has been lower than expected (49/72). Due to financial reasons
      and problems with logistics and preparations for the main hospital (Ostfold Hospital Trust)
      moving into a new hospital, we were unable to extend the recruitment period in study 1. In
      RCT (3) AI was not an inclusion criterion. However, as both RCTs had the same outcome
      measure; anal incontinence, and a joint randomization process, stratified on hospital site
      and whether the participants had sustained an obsteric anal sphincter injury at delivery or
      not, the results from these studies will be reported together.

    <description>Survey and interview using the questionnaire St. Mark's incontinence score ranging from 0 (no incontinence) -24 (complete incontinence) points for measuring anal incontinence (AI). The A total of 1069 women responded to the questionnaires at 6 months postpartum and 1031 at 12 months postpartum. Discrepancies in the number of included and analysed participants in the PFME trials are related to the number of women who did not attend the follow-up appointments as described in the published paper.</description>
