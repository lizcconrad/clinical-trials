  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually in the United States, approximately 30 million people require treatment for
      traumatic injuries in emergency departments. Two million of these patients require
      hospitalization, with several hundred thousand ultimately dying, often due to extreme blood
      loss. Importantly, these traumatic injuries are the leading cause of death and disability for
      children and young adults under the age of 44, with the total cost of trauma in the U.S.
      approaching $260 billion each year.

      Despite advances in pre-hospital care, early resuscitation, surgical interventions and
      intensive care monitoring aimed at the primary traumatic injury, many survivors never
      recover. A significant cause of this mortality and morbidity is thought due to potentially
      preventable secondary injury, namely oxidant injury, inflammation, and apoptosis beginning in
      the first few hours after the severe traumatic event.

      In spite of the current bleak outlook for many of these patients, a series of animal
      investigations have uncovered a promising solution to the problem of the secondary injury
      seen in hemorrhagic shock and other similar processes, namely the early administration of
      estrogen, a strong anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic compound. Based on
      these encouraging results from animal studies, the investigators hypothesize that early
      administration of IV Premarin® in patients with hemorrhagic shock will safely reduce
      secondary injury, and improve survival.
