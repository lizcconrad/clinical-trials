    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who are planned to undergo surgical removal of their tumor.
      The goal of the study is to evaluate the changes that occur in the tumor after brief (about 8
      days) exposure to the study drug.

      The A7471031 study was terminated on May 2, 2012. The decision for unplanned study
      termination was triggered by feasibility of further conduct of this trial as only 22 of the
      protocol-specified 75 patients were enrolled since the study initiated in February 2010.
      Based on this low accrual rate it was determined that the study was highly unlikely to
      complete accrual and provide meaningful data. The discontinuation of the study is not due to
      any safety issue.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiographs consistent with lung cancer for which resection is indicated upon
             histologic confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  Patient willing to take PF-00299804 for 5 to 11 days and provide blood and tissue
             specimens as required in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior or concurrent systemic anticancer therapy for cancer (immunotherapy,
             hormonotherapy, biological therapy, or chemotherapy) less than one year from time of
             consent.

          -  Prior or concurrent radiation therapy to tumor at site of planned resection.

          -  Congestive heart failure (LVEF &lt; 50%), uncontrolled hypertension, significant
             ventricular arrythmia.

          -  Drugs that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 for metabolism, or are generally accepted to
             have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes.

          -  Prior or concurrent radiation therapy to tumor at site of planned resection.
