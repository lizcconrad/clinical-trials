        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the without-urgency group:

               -  urinary frequency ≥ 8 micturitions per 24 hours no urgency on voiding diary (1 or
                  2 on a 5 urgency scale)

          -  For the with-urgency group:

               -  urinary frequency ≥ 8 micturitions per 24 hours symptoms of urinary urgency≥
                  2/day on the voiding diary (3 to 5 on a 5 urgency scale)

          -  Symptoms lasting for more than 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant stress incontinence as determined by the investigator; for
             female patients, clinically significant stress incontinence confirmed by a cough
             provocation test

          -  Total daily urine volume of &gt; 3000 mL as verified on the micturition diary before
             randomization

          -  Significant hepatic or renal disease, defined as having twice the upper limit of the
             reference ranges for serum concentrations of aspartate aminotra

          -  Any condition that is a contraindication for anticholinergic treatment, including
             uncontrolled narrow-angled glaucoma, urinary retention or gastric retention

          -  Symptomatic acute urinary tract infection (UTI) during the run-in period

          -  Diagnosed or suspected of interstitial cystitis

          -  Uninvestigated hematuria or hematuria secondary to a malignant disease

          -  Clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction defined by clinical symptoms and
             investigator's opinion according to local standard of care (residual urine&gt; 100mL of

               -  Any anticholinergic drugs other than a randomized trial drug

               -  Any drug treatment for overactive bladder. Estrogen treatment started more than 2
                  months prior to inclusion is allowed

             start such treatment during the study

          -  Receipt of any electrostimulation or bladder training within 14 days before
             randomization, or expected to start such treatment during the study

          -  An indwelling catheter or practicing intermittent self-catheterization
