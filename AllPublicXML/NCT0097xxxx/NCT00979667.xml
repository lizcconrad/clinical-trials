      To evaluate the efficacy of oseltamivir ,as compared with the placebo arm and zanamivir with
      its control arm with respect to symptoms duration among patients infected with influenza A
      (H1N1) virus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The outbreak of respiratory illnesses in Mexico that began in March 2009 was caused by a
      swine origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) that had not been recognized previously in pigs
      or humans. As of 17 May 2009, 39 countries have officially reported 8480 cases of influenza A
      (H1N1) infection.

      The H1N1 influenza A virus appears sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir in vitro, but
      resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. This study is to test the oseltamivir, zanamivir and
      placebo arms as the first line treatment for human swine influenza infection. Through the
      study, the investigators may have better understanding about the clinical and, biochemical,
      virological profiles of oseltamivir/zanamivir on the H1N1 virus, and optimizing the treatment
      strategy among the Chinese population.
