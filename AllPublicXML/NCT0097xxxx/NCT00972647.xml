  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The orthopaedic surgeon is frequently exposed to ionizing radiation, especially
      during intraoperative fluoroscopy. It is expected that using a laser guided fluoroscopy
      technique, which should improve accuracy of radiography, should also reduce the amount of
      time of exposure to radiation. Finally, the literature appears controversial in this matter
      with no clear conclusions that could be drawn from such.

      Hypothesis: The test hypothesis is that the use of the laser-aiming device for fluoroscopy in
      several orthopaedic procedures will reduce the exposure of the patient and the surgeon to the
      damaging effects of radiation. The null hypothesis then states that there will be no
      difference in exposure to radiation between the group using the laser device and the group
      not using the apparatus.

      Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial will be performed in which patients
      undergoing fluoroscopy will be randomly allocated to two groups. One group will undergo
      imaging with use of the device throughout the procedure and the other group will undergo
      radiation without the laser guided device. Number and time of exposure will be recorded for
      each procedure. It is of the utmost importance that the complexity of the procedures remains
      relatively similar. It is believed that a good measure of complexity is the surgical time.
      Therefore, any procedures that are statistically similar from a set mean (p &gt; 0.05) would be
      included into the study. It is also important that one or two surgeons with similar expertise
      and years of experience perform the surgeries to avoid confounding factors. It is expected
      that throughout the duration of the study (8 weeks) 50-100 cases would be reported which
      would produce statistically significant results. The results will be analyzed by calculating
      confidence intervals and differences between means of continuous data and significance levels
      by the Student's t test. Statistical significance will be set to P &lt; 0.05.

      Risks and Benefits: This study involves minimal risk. The use of the laser guide will not
      increase or introduce any risks other than the associated inherent surgical risks. The risks
      usually associated with this type of studies concern breach of confidentiality. To reduce
      this risk, research numbers will be assigned to subjects' data collected during the
      procedure, whose personal information will be found in another password-protected database.

      This study will help the investigators to investigate a technique that may help reduce the
      amount of time that a patient is exposed to radiation.
