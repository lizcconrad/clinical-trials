      Study Design: Treatment, Randomized, Open Label, Parallel Assignment,Safety/Efficacy Study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSC) expanded ex-vivo infusion for the treatment of patients who have developed a newly
      diagnosed extensive or refractory chronic graft versus host disease (chronic GVHD) to the
      usual therapeutic measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the main limitations to successful
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and has a substantial impact not
      only on survival but also on the quality of life of otherwise cancer-free patients. Half of
      the patients undergoing a HLA-identical allografts who survive beyond 100 days may require
      long-term immunosuppressive treatment for extensive chronic GVHD, often for more than 2
      years. More than one-third of patients with chronic GVHD do not respond to first-line
      therapy, which often involves combinations of corticosteroids and a calcineurin inhibitor.
      There is no standard second-line or salvage therapy for these patients and they have a poor
      outcome.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cells that can
      differentiate into various lineages and have been used to repair injured tissues. Recently,
      MSCs have also shown unique immunomodulatory properties ex-vivo, including inhibition of
      T-cell proliferation after stimulation by allo-antigens and mitogens, and prevention of the
      activity of cytotoxic T cells.MSCs have been used for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD and for
      the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD,but rarely have been used for
      extensive chronic GVHD.

      Development of new therapeutic agents and strategies to rescue patients with extensive
      chronic GVHD would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.

      In this study, a single center randomized, non blinded Phase II clinical trial is proposed to
      study the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the management of extensive
      chronic GVHD newly or refractory to the usual therapeutic measures.

      Expanded MSC will be infused at a dose of 2 million cells/kg twice a week for 2 weeks and
      weekly for the following two weeks (six doses totally)in patients based first-line therapy
      (steroid plus cyclosporin A ) or their primary immunosuppressive therapies.
