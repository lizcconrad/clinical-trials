      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and irinotecan hydrochloride,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy
      uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy, cetuximab, and
      radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal
      tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving capecitabine and
      irinotecan hydrochloride together with cetuximab and radiation therapy and to see how well it
      works in treating patients undergoing surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the downstaging effectiveness and tolerability of neoadjuvant
           chemoradiotherapy comprising capecitabine, irinotecan hydrochloride, cetuximab, and
           radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly in weeks 1-6 and irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 2-5. Patients also undergo pelvic
      radiotherapy once daily and receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-5 in weeks 2-6.

      Patients undergo surgery 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months.
