      We are investigating a needled micro-roller for use in improving the appearance of acne
      scars. The study is being conducted under the direction of Dr. Murad Alam of Northwestern
      University, Department of Dermatology.

      The needles on the micro-roller are designed to create small holes in the top and mid layers
      of skin in order to induce the formation of more collagen, which would in turn help improve
      the appearance of acne scars. To qualify for the study, you must have at least 2 large areas
      of the face with acne scars.

      The study is designed such that one part of your face, which has acne scars, will be treated
      with the device on 3 separate occasions, spaced 2 weeks apart at our clinic in Chicago at
      Northwestern. We would also ask you to return at 3 months and at 6 months to have photographs
      taken.

      If you are interested in participating, we would like to get you involved as soon as possible
