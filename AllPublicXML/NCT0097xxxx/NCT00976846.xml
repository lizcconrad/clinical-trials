  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to determine the appropriate balance between the removal of
      undesirable small molecular substances (urea, creatinine, phosphate) and large molecular
      substances (ß2-m) and the retention of important substances (e.g.albumin) for the Baxter
      Xenium XPH dialyzer type under defined therapeutic conditions of olHDF primarily concerning
      filtration flow rates in relation to blood flow/plasma water flow rates. Furthermore the
      possibility of the removal of certain protein-bound substances shall be investigated together
      with the impact of increasing ultrafiltration on the parameters of the micro-inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new high flux dialyser membrane Xenium XPH 210 from Baxter will show an considerably
      increased removal of ß2-Microglobulin with olHDF in post dilution mode together with a
      markedly increased removal of small molecules (urea, creatinine, phosphate). The loss of
      albumin will depend on the treatment modalities. However, the albumin permeability is
      tolerable over the whole range of total filtration rate selected and applied to the patients.

      Together with the albumin loss into the filtrate/dialysate a small amount of albuminbound
      substances is detectable.

      Parameters of micro-inflammation can be influenced by an increasing convective part of the
      treatment.
