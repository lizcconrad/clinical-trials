    <textblock>
      This study will follow a randomized, multiple-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      sequential dose-escalation study design. This healthy volunteer study will consist of five
      subcutaneous (SC) cohorts and one intravenous (IV) cohort. Each dose cohort will enroll 8
      subjects, randomized such that 6 subjects will receive AMG 157 and 2 will receive placebo
      (3:1 ratio). The doses of AMG 157 planned to be evaluated include 35 mg (SC every 28 days,
      Cohort 1), 105 mg (SC every 28 days, Cohort 2), 210 mg (SC every 28 days, Cohort 3), 210 mg
      (SC every 14 days, Cohort 4), 210 mg (SC every 7 days, Cohort 5) and 700 mg (IV every 28
      days, Cohort 6).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form

             oophorectomy);

          -  Male subjects with female partner of childbearing potential who agrees to inform their
             female partner of their participation in this clinical study and use highly effective
             methods of birth control during the study. (Highly effective methods of birth control
             may include abstinence, vasectomy, or a condom with spermicide in combination with
             either hormonal birth control, IUD or barrier methods used by the woman.);
