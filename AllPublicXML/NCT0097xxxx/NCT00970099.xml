  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the following primary hypothesis:

        -  Aerobic exercise training will improve insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant subjects
           through changes in the major cellular signaling pathways and and/or their regulators.

      Accordingly, the proposed study is designed to accomplish the following specific aims:

        -  Quantitate how exercise training improves insulin sensitivity and decreases
           cardiovascular risk factors in a general population of lean, nondiabetic, insulin
           resistant subjects. Effects on known cardiovascular risk factors including blood
           pressure and serum lipoproteins will be evaluated. Change in regional adiposity will
           also be measured

        -  Determine the effects of a program of regular aerobic exercise on in the insulin
           receptor signaling pathway. Biopsies of vastus lateralis muscle from insulin resistant
           subjects will be obtained before and after a hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp. This
           procedure will take place in the untrained state and after exercise training. The
           investigators will measure changes in the insulin receptor and the activity of the major
           components of the intracellular insulin signaling pathway. The investigators will also
           look intracellular proteins that regulate this signaling pathway.

    <description>Patients exercise under supervision on either a treadmill, Stair Master, or LifeCycle apparatus. Exercise frequency, duration, and intensity will be incrementally increased to minimize the risk of injury. During weeks 1-3, you will exercise for 30 minutes 3 days per week at 70- 80 % of your maximum heart rate (MHR); weeks 4-7 will consist of exercising for 40 minutes 4 days per week at 70-80% of your MHR; and weeks 7-12 will consist of exercising for 45 minutes 4 days per week at 80-85% MHR</description>
