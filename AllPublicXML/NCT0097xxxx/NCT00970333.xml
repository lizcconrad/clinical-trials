  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultimately a marker of microglial activation could be used for large-scale quantitative brain
      imaging trials in Alzheimer Disease (AD), Parkinson Disease (PD) or Multiple Sclerosis (MS),
      specifically to investigate the agent as an objective biomarker in treatments aimed at
      reducing inflammatory changes in these conditions. The significance of this work lies in
      applying state-of-art quantitative neuroimaging tools to develop a relevant biomarker in
      individuals with neurodegenerative diseases with the intention of using this efficiently in
      large clinical imaging trials.

      The adaptation of imaging agents like [18F]-FEPPA as a biomarker of microglial activation in
      neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases requires human validation studies. Expanding
      upon our previous work with B-amyloid ligands (123I-IMPY, 123I MNI-187) for AD and dopamine
      transporter ligands (123I B-CIT, Altropane) for PD, we desire to develop and characterize
      [18F]-FEPPA as a potential marker for microglial activation in association with neuronal
      damage that may be applicable to multiple neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases.
