  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ipilimumab is a manufactured monoclonal antibody, much like the antibodies usually made by
      the human body to fight off infection; however it is not known why the human body does not
      &quot;fight off&quot; a cancerous tumor. The idea behind developing this experimental drug is to
      stimulate the immune system to make antibodies to kill cancer cells. This research study is
      considered &quot;experimental&quot; because it has not received approval from the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of this type of cancer.

      This monoclonal antibody has been specifically made to block Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4
      (CTLA4), which is a protein found on cells of the immune system. CTLA4 seems to slow down the
      immune response, so blocking it with an anti-CTLA4 antibody may make the immune response more
      active. The purpose of this study is to see if Ipilimumab affects the response of the
      patient's immune system toward their cancer.

             may present as any of the following groups:

          -  Primary melanoma with clinically apparent (overt) regional lymph node metastases,
             confirmed by pathological diagnosis (biopsy).

          -  Clinically detected recurrence of melanoma at the proximal regional lymph node(s)
             basin, confirmed by pathological diagnosis (biopsy).

          -  Clinically or histologically detected primary melanoma involving multiple regional
             nodal groups, confirmed by pathological diagnosis (biopsy).

          -  Clinically detected single site of nodal metastatic melanoma arising from an unknown
             primary, confirmed by pathological diagnosis (biopsy).

          -  Patients are eligible for this trial either at presentation for primary melanoma with
             concurrent regional nodal metastasis, or at the time of clinically detected nodal
             recurrence. Patients must undergo biopsy (punch) or open biopsy (if done as part of a
             clinically indicated baseline diagnostic procedure) within 14 days of entry into the
             study. Lymphadenectomy will be performed after at least 2 and generally not longer
             than 4 weeks of ipilimumab therapy. Additional delays for definitive lymphadenectomy
             are allowed if clinically indicated while awaiting the resolution of potential adverse
             events from ipilimumab therapy.

          -  Patients must have been evaluated by standard-of-care full body imaging studies (CT,
             PET-CT or MRI) as part of the initial clinical work-up at baseline (no more than 4
             weeks prior to study enrollment) and after completion of 2 doses of ipilimumab (at 6-8
             weeks after the first dose of ipilimumab and prior the definitive lymphadenectomy
             procedure).

          -  Required values for initial laboratory tests:

               -  White Blood Cell ≥ 3000/uL

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

               -  Bilirubin ≤ ULN, (except patients with Gilbert's Syndrome, who must have a total
                  bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL)

               -  PT/PTT ≤ ULN (No active or chronic infection with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis
                  C.)

          -  Men and women, ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 8 weeks after the
             last dose of ipilimumab. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who
             has not undergone a successful surgical sterilization procedure (hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post-menopausal.
             Post-menopause is defined as:

               -  Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another cause, or

               -  For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy
                  (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥ 35 mIU/mL.

          -  Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal
             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to
             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg,
             vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential. WOCBP must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
             units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinical, radiological/laboratory, or pathological evidence of distant
             metastatic disease.

          -  Patients with evidence of soft tissue involvement by gross extranodal extension of
             tumor manifest by fixation to the fascia, or matting of nodal tissue that would
             compromise surgical resection as determined by the surgical oncologist.

          -  Patients who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI
             obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel
             perforation.

          -  Any other malignancy from which the patient has been disease-free for less than 5
             years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease are excluded
             from this study, as are patients with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid
             arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus,
             autoimmune vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of
             autoimmune origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome).

          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

          -  Patients with underlying heart conditions who are deemed ineligible for surgery by
             cardiology consult.

             for his current disease or any immunotherapy including tumor vaccines,
             interferon-alfa, interleukins, levamisole or other biologic response modifiers within
             the past 4 weeks.

          -  Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon, or other non-study
             immunotherapy regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other
             investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids; unless
             discontinued ≥ 4 weeks.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined above in Section 4.1, who:

          -  are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid
             pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 8 weeks after cessation of
             study drug, or

          -  have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or

          -  are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for
             treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious) illness.

        during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy.
        All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If the
        pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not be
        enrolled in the study.
