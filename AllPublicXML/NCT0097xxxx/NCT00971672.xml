  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frequency of iron deficiency anemia was extensively studied in infants on the first year
      of life. There is not enough information about the frequency of iron deficiency during the
      second and third years of life. In a previous study performed in Israel and published in
      Pediatrics 2006 the incidence of anemia does not decrease towards age 18 months. Then there
      is reasonable to study the iron deficiency frequency beyond this age.

      The purpose of this study is to analyze the frequency of Iron deficiency anemia in a group of
      400 toddles from age 18 months to 36 months.

      Two groups of children will be included, 200 children from Jewish origin and 200 from non
      Jewish origin, mostly Arabs.

      A questionnaire that included demographic characteristics, nutrition and iron supplementation
      in the first year, growth status, and laboratory results will be filled for each patient.

      The laboratory analysis will include complete blood count and serum ferritin analysis.

      Children that were previously diagnosed suffering from iron deficiency, children suffering
      from chronic diseases or were born premature will not be included in the study.
