  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  PSA (prostate specific antigen) is a protein found on normal and cancerous prostate
           cells. Levels of this protein are used to identify men who are at risk for prostate
           cancer and to monitor responses to treatment in men who have been diagnosed with
           prostate cancer.

        -  Research has shown that men who continue to have an elevated PSA level following primary
           treatment for prostate cancer are at increased risk for cancer progression. Studies have
           shown that the change in PSA levels over time, or PSA doubling time (PSADT), can be
           accurate in predicting how quickly the cancer is likely to progress. Individuals with a
           PSADT of less than 3 months are at extremely high risk for disease progression and death
           from prostate cancer. Individuals with a PSADT of greater than 15 months have a very low
           risk of death from prostate cancer.

        -  TARP is a protein that is found in about 95% of prostate cancers and is known to
           stimulate the immune system. The TARP prostate cancer vaccine is made from pieces of the
           TARP protein called peptides and includes peptides that have been modified to make them
           more effective at stimulating immunity. Although these TARP peptides have been shown to
           stimulate the immune systems of mice, information is needed to determine if they also
           stimulate the immune system in humans. Since it is unclear what is the best way to give
           peptide vaccines, the TARP peptides will be given with substances known to stimulate the
           immune system or in a vaccine made with the patient s own cells.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the immune system s response to vaccination with TARP peptides.

        -  To determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide vaccination.

        -  To determine if vaccination with the TARP prostate cancer vaccine can slow down PSADT in
           men with an intermediate PSADT of 3 to 15 months.

      Eligibility:

        -  Males 18 years of age and older who have completed their primary treatment for prostate
           cancer, have stage D0 disease, are HLA A*0201 positive and who have a PSADT greater than
           3 and less than 15 months.

      Design:

        -  Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms:

        -  Arm A will receive the TARP vaccine with other substances that stimulate the immune
           system.

        -  Arm B will receive the TARP vaccine that includes a patient s own white blood cells.

        -  First week of study, after screening for eligibility has been completed:

        -  Day 1: Apheresis procedure to extract white blood cells to test the immune response to
           the vaccine.

        -  Day 3: Flu vaccine to allow researchers to determine how well a patient s immune system
           is working.

        -  Clinic visits in Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 for physical examination, blood samples, and
           administration of the TARP peptide vaccine.

        -  Physical examination and blood samples only in Weeks 18 and 36.

        -  Additional blood samples and apheresis procedures in Weeks 24 and 48.

        -  A 6th dose of TARP peptide vaccine will be administer to those patients who have a
           response to vaccination at week 24.

        -  No follow-up or long-term study is associated with this study.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  T-cell receptor alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is expressed by both normal and
           malignant prostate cancer tissue and is found in about 95% of prostate cancer specimens.
           TARP is immunogenic and hence is a target antigen for vaccination.

        -  The immunogenicity of TARP peptides can be augmented through epitope enhancement that is
           achieved through amino acid substitutions resulting in increased peptide binding
           affinity.

        -  Two HLA-A*0201 TARP peptide epitopes are associated with generation of catalytic T-cell
           responses: TARP27-35 and TARP29-37. Substitution of Val for Leu at position 9 in
           TARP29-37, results in a peptide with increased binding affinity (TARP29-37-9V) that
           induces antigen specific T cells able to recognize wild type and multiple modified TARP
           peptides. The affinity of the TARP 27-35 peptide, corresponding to a distinct but
           overlapping epitope, is high enough that no enhancement was required.

        -  Stage D0 prostate cancer patients have no evidence of visceral or bony metastatic
           disease but have persistently elevated or rising PSA levels (biochemical progression)
           and are at increased risk for disease progression. Since they lack much of the immune
           dysfunction associated with the high tumor burden characteristic of end-stage metastatic
           disease, they are an ideal population in which to study therapeutic vaccination to slow
           or prevent disease recurrence and progression.

        -  Dendritic cells (DC) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system
           and are being studied extensively for anti-tumor activity in a broad spectrum of cancer
           patients.

        -  As the optimal method for therapeutic immunization with peptide vaccines in patients
           with cancer is unclear, vaccination with TARP peptides in Montanide ISA 51 VG adjuvant
           plus Sargramostim will be studied in a randomized fashion with autologous, TARP
           peptide-pulsed DCs in HLA-A*0201 Stage D0 prostate cancer patients.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of TARP peptide and TARP peptide-pulsed dendritic cell
           vaccination in patients with Stage D0 prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the T-lymphocyte immune responses to TARP peptide vaccination with Montanide
           ISA 51 VG plus Sargramostim or autologous dendritic cells as measured by tetramer
           staining, IFN-gamma ELISPOT and (51)Cr release CTL assays.

      Secondary:

        -  Determine the effect of TARP peptide vaccination on serum prostate specific antigen
           doubling time (PSADT) in patients with PSADT greater than 3 months and less than 15
           months.

        -  Determine the effect of TARP peptide vaccination on PSA growth rate and regression rate
           constants.

           3 months are allowed.

      STUDY DESIGN:

        -  This is a randomized, prospective, pilot study of vaccination with a mixture of wild
           type (TARP27-35) and epitope-enhanced (TARP29-37-9V) TARP peptides in HLA-A*0201
           patients with stage D0 prostate cancer.

        -  Vaccination with TARP peptides admixed with Montanide ISA 51 VG plus Sargramostim
           administered by deep subcutaneous injection will be compared with vaccination with TARP
           peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs) administered intradermally.

        -  Autologous dendritic cells will be matured from peripheral blood monocytes with
           Sargramostim, IL-4, IFN-gamma and LPS and pulsed with wild type and epitope-enhanced
           TARP peptides.

        -  Apheresis will be performed on all patients at weeks 0, 24, 48 and 96.

        -  Randomization and assignment to received TARP peptide vaccine with Montanide ISA 51 VG
           plus Sargramostimgiven by deep subcutaneous injection or TARP peptide-pulsed autologous
           DCs given ID will be performed at week 0.

        -  All patients will receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (FluMist ) when seasonally
           available at the very end of their week 0 visit as a control vaccine to assess cytotoxic
           T lymphocyte responses.

        -  TARP Peptide vaccines will be administered every three weeks at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and
           15, with a sixth and seventh booster dose of vaccine at Week 48 and 96. Follow-up will
           be through 144 weeks on study.

        -  The trial uses an optimal 2-stage design targeting an immunologic response between 10
           and 40%. We will initially accrue 9 patients in each arm. If 0-1 patients develop an
           immunologic response, then no further patients will be enrolled. If 2 or more of these
           patients develop an immunologic response, we will accrue 11 additional patients for a
           maximum total of up to 20 patients in each arm. A stopping rule for excessive toxicity
           will be incorporated.
