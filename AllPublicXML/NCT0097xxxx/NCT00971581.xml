      Primary Objective:

      To confirm the safety and tolerability of the fixed dose combination of a Non-Steroidal
      Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), ketoprofen, associated to a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI),
      omeprazole, in Mexican patients.

      Secondary Objective:

      To confirm the efficacy of the combination:

        -  Relief of pain (Visual Analyzed Score (VAS))

        -  Patients global assessment of disease activity, scored as a scale of 1 (no limitation of
           normal activities) to 5 (inability to carried out all normal activities)

             developing NSAID associated benign gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers and gastroduodenal
             erosions in whom continued treatment with NSAIDs is necessary.

          -  Presenting at the inclusion visit an acute episode of recent onset (&lt;48 hours) defined
             by average pain within the last 24 hours &gt;=50 mm on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Hypersensitivity to ketoprofen or to omeprazole or to another proton-pump inhibitor or
