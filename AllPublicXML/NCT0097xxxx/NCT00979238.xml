  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of giving a normal factor IX gene to
      treat individuals who have an abnormal or no factor IX gene. Recruitment will be limited to
      adults (≥ 18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of hemophilia B (HB), resulting from a
      missense mutation in the coagulation factor IX (FIX) gene or a nonsense mutation that has not
      been associated with an inhibitor. Only subjects who have no evidence of active hepatitis or
      anti-hFIX antibodies, and who have been treated/exposed to Factor IX concentrates for at
      least ten years and have had an average of 3 bleeding episodes per year requiring FIX
      administration will be enrolled. Patients will be recruited within the United States for
      treatment at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and patients will be recruited in England
      and other countries for treatment in London by our British collaborators.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia B is caused by an absence or abnormality in the gene that produces the factor IX
      protein. Affected individuals cannot make a blood clot effectively and suffer from severe
      bleeding episodes. Repeated bleeding episodes, specifically into joints, can cause chronic
      joint disease and lead to disability. This research study will test the safety of giving an
      affected individual a normal factor IX gene which can produce factor IX protein in his body.
      We will give the normal gene for factor IX by using an inactivated (not able to function)
      virus called &quot;the vector.&quot; The vector used in this study was developed from an
      adeno-associated virus that has been changed so that it is unable to cause a viral infection
      in humans. This inactivated virus was further altered to carry the factor IX gene and to
      locate within liver cells where factor IX protein is normally made.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males ≥ 18 years of age with established severe HB (FIX:C&lt;1u/dl),

          -  Treated/exposed to FIX products (e.g., concentrates or fresh frozen plasma) for at
             least 10 years or 50 exposure days.

          -  A minimum of an average of 3 bleeding episodes per year requiring FIX infusions or
             prophylactic FIX infusions because of frequent prior bleeding episodes

          -  Able to give informed consent and comply with requirements of the trial

          -  Currently free of inhibitor and have no history of inhibitors to FIX protein

          -  A negative family history for the development of an inhibitor,

          -  Willing to practice a reliable barrier method of contraception until 3 sequential
             samples are negative for vector genomes using our PCR assay.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active infection with Hepatitis B or C virus as reflected by HBsAg or NCV
             RNA positivity, respectively. To be considered negative for active infection, two
             negative assays at a minimum of a six month interval are required.

          -  Exposure to Hepatitis B or C who are currently on antiviral therapy.

          -  Serological evidence of HTLV or active HIV infection. Individuals who are effectively
             being treated with antiretroviral therapy are eligible. Specific criteria for
             effectiveness of treatment include the following:

               -  Documented CD4+ T-cell count of &gt; 350 cells/mm^3.
