          -  ASA Classification I or II (Appendix II); and

          -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential);

          -  Have the study procedure attempted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI &gt; 35;

          -  Diffuse peritonitis;

          -  Use of anticoagulants or anti-platelet agents (use of daily cardio protective doses of
             aspirin, up to 81 mg/day, is acceptable and shall not constitute an exclusion
             criterion) or the presence of coagulopathy;

          -  Clinical diagnosis of sepsis;

          -  History of peritoneal trauma;

          -  Co-morbid condition(s) that could limit the subject's ability to participate in the
             study or to comply with follow-up requirements, or that could impact the scientific

          -  Planned concurrent surgical procedure;

          -  Prior or planned major surgical procedure within 30 days before or after study
             procedure;

          -  Participation in any other investigational device or drug trial that has not completed
             the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current study endpoints;

          -  Previously enrolled in the current series of 4 trials investigating the EES NOTES GEN1
             Toolbox; or

          -  Any condition which precludes compliance with the study (Investigator discretion).
