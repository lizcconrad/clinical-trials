  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single arm phase II non-randomized study of dasatinib in
      which subjects with systemic mastocytosis (SM) will be treated with a continuous regimen of
      dasatinib.

      Upon completion of a treatment induction period, subjects will be treated with dasatinib at a
      dose of 100 mg per os (OS) once daily (QD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dasatinib may have clinical efficacy and is safe in subjects with SM. This Multicenter,
      open-label, single arm Phase II study will investigate the clinical response rate in terms of
      both B/C findings and mediator-related symptoms.

      30 adult patients will be treated with a continuous regimen of dasatinib at a starting dose
      of 20 mg administered orally (PO) once daily (QD), that can be escalated up to 100 mg QD at
      the end of Week 3. Upon completion of a treatment induction period, subjects will be treated
      with dasatinib at a daily dose of 100 mg PO QD. Patients will remain on dasatinib treatment
      for 12 months unless disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other reasons determine
      treatment discontinuation. Subjects may continue receiving protocol therapy as long as they
      are deriving a clinical benefit.

      Additionally, all subjects will be followed until disease progression, death, or 12 months
      beyond discontinuation from study treatment.

      The total duration of the study is estimated to 36 months.

             baseline not attributable to SM.

          -  Any surgical procedure, excluding central venous catheter placement or other minor
             procedures (e.g. skin biopsy) within 14 days prior to initiation of dasatinib therapy.

             arrhythmia, (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or &quot;Torsade de
             Pointes&quot;), myocardial infarction, uncontrolled angina within 6 months, congestive
             heart failure, or cardiomyopathy.

          -  Abnormal QTcF interval prolonged ( ≥ 450 msec) after electrolytes have been corrected
             on baseline ECG.

          -  Malabsorption syndrome not attributable to SM or uncontrolled (e.g. not corrected by
             antimediator therapy) gastrointestinal toxicities (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) NCI

             hypersplenism establish that the likely causes of the cytopenia(s) is related to SM.

          -  Other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality, serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for this study.

          -  Current therapy with steroids must be tapered off within 14 days prior to the start of
             study medication if it is anticipated that subjects can be tapered off these drugs.
             Otherwise, for steroid-requiring subjects, investigators should attempt to taper to
             the minimal dose possible at the time of initiation of dasatinib therapy.

          -  Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated

          -  Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or
             physical (eg, infectious disease) illness.
