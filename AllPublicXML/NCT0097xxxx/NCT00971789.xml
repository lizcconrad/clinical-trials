  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) hamartomatous
      tumor syndromes (PHTS) have a mutation in one of their genes called PTEN that can lead to
      benign tumors called hamartomas throughout the body. This puts them at increased risk for
      breast, thyroid and endometrial cancer.

      People with a PTEN mutation have increased activity of proteins such as protein kinase B
      (AKT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which may be responsible for tumor growth and
      their increased risk of these cancers.

      Experiments show that a drug called sirolimus, which is used to prevent the immune system
      from rejecting transplanted organs, can inhibit cancer cell growth by blocking the mTOR
      protein.

      Objectives:

      To test the ability of sirolimus to decrease the activity of proteins that are regulated by
      mTOR in both benign and cancerous tumor tissue.

      Eligibility:

      People 18 years of age and older with Cowden syndrome or other PHTS.

      Design:

      Sirolimus treatment. Patients take sirolimus once a day in 28-day treatment cycles. Patients
      who do not have cancer take the drug for a total of two cycles (56 days) unless they develop
      unacceptable side effects. Those who have cancer may continue sirolimus beyond cycle 2 until
      their disease worsens or they develop unacceptable side effects.

      Evaluations. Patients come to the clinic for a history and physical examination on day 1 of
      every treatment cycle, then every month for the first two months off therapy, and then at 6
      and 12 months. In addition, they have the following procedures:

        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) scan and neuropsychological testing before starting
           treatment.

        -  Clinical photography (photographic documentation of skin lesions) before starting
           treatment. Patients who do not have cancer have repeat photography at 2 and 8 weeks and
           then, if the lesions shrink or go away while on therapy, again every month for the first
           2 months off sirolimus, then at 6 months and 1 year. Patients who have cancer and
           continue treatment beyond 8 weeks have repeat photography every 8 weeks while on the
           study.

        -  Digital dermoscopy (skin lesion examination using a high resolution camera). This is
           done at the same intervals as clinical photography.

        -  Multiple biopsies of the skin and lower intestine, and possibly the tumor in patients
           with cancer, before starting treatment, at 2 weeks of treatment and at 8 weeks of
           treatment.

        -  Blood and urine tests every week while on treatment for the first two cycles, then every
           4 weeks for patients who continue treatment beyond two cycles.

        -  Imaging studies, such as computerized tomography (CT), ultrasound or magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) in patients with cancer before starting treatment and again every two
           cycles to monitor the tumor size and location.

      Background:

        -  PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor
           gene whose function is frequently lost through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in
           cancer. Loss of PTEN increases activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
           (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway, which increases cellular proliferation and survival.

        -  Germline mutations in PTEN are associated with a number of hamartomatous syndromes, of
           which Cowden Syndrome (CS) is the prototype. The set of syndromes that are defined by
           germline PTEN mutations has been labeled PTEN Hamartomatous Tumor Syndromes or PHTS.

        -  Patients with PHTS suffer increased morbidity and mortality. Benign tumors such as
           hamartomas occur in virtually every organ, most commonly in the skin and the
           gastrointestinal tract, which prompts frequent monitoring and resection and causes
           psychological and physical stressors on patients with this condition.

        -  Cowden syndrome (CS) patients develop thyroid, breast, and endometrial cancers at an
           earlier age than the general population, and have an overall increased incidence of
           these cancers compared to the general population. These patients have increased
           morbidity from heightened surveillance and diagnostic procedures.

        -  No medical therapies exist for PHTS patients.

        -  Because tumors from PHTS patients show increased activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
           pathway, inhibitors of this pathway might have activity in patients with PHTS.

        -  Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a specific inhibitor of mTOR that is Food and Drug
           Administration (FDA)-approved and is preferentially effective in cells with mutant PTEN.

        -  We hypothesize that sirolimus will have activity in patients with PHTS, as measured by
           biochemical techniques that will assess mTOR inhibition and clinical tests that will
           assess the growth and metabolism of benign and malignant tumors.

      Objectives:

        -  The primary endpoint will be inhibition of the mTOR pathway in tissues obtained before
           and after therapy, as assessed using immunohistochemistry in benign as well as malignant
           tumors.

        -  Secondary endpoints will include inhibition of the mTOR pathway in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as assessed by immunoblotting, changes and duration of change
           in benign or malignant tumor size as assessed by computed tomography (CT), serial
           digital photography, digital dermoscopy, changes in tumor metabolism as assessed by
           positron emission tomography (PET), changes in lymphocyte counts, as well as changes in
           neuropsychological testing.

      Eligibility:

      -Adult subjects with documented germline PTEN mutations who meet diagnostic criteria for
      Cowden Syndrome by international criteria.

      Design:

        -  Subjects will undergo biopsy, imaging, photography, dermoscopy, and neuropsychological
           testing prior to and after a course of therapy with sirolimus to assess the efficacy of
           treatment.

        -  This pilot protocol will test sirolimus at an FDA-approved dose (6 mg by mouth (PO)
           loading dose/ 2mg PO daily) in a group of twenty patients.

        -  Treatment will last for 56 days (plus 2 - 3 days to allow flexibility for scheduling of
           follow-up procedures) for PHTS subjects with benign hamartomatous tumors.

        -  For PHTS subjects with established malignancy, measurement of disease will be performed
           every other cycle and treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

    <description>A biochemical change is defined as a decrease in certain protein levels (e.g. P-AKT (phosphorylated AKT), total S6, P-S6, and P-4E-BP1) important in cell growth. These are measured by collecting tissue samples which stained and protein levels are measured under the microscope. Scoring will be based on distribution and intensity of staining. Distribution will be scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1% to 50%), and 2 (51% to 100%) to indicate the percentage of positive cells of interest in a single core. The intensity of the signal will be scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). The distribution score and intensity score will be summed into a total score (TS).</description>

        <title>Biochemical Changes in Benign and Malignant Tumor Tissues as Assessed by Immunohistochemistry.</title>
        <description>A biochemical change is defined as a decrease in certain protein levels (e.g. P-AKT (phosphorylated AKT), total S6, P-S6, and P-4E-BP1) important in cell growth. These are measured by collecting tissue samples which stained and protein levels are measured under the microscope. Scoring will be based on distribution and intensity of staining. Distribution will be scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1% to 50%), and 2 (51% to 100%) to indicate the percentage of positive cells of interest in a single core. The intensity of the signal will be scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). The distribution score and intensity score will be summed into a total score (TS).</description>
