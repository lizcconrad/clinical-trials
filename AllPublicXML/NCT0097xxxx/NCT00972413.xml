  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the use of cone beam computed tomography
      (CBCT) for breast imaging in the diagnostic setting by providing a compelling body of
      evidence incorporating both non-contrast and contrast enhanced CBCT in the study protocol.
      The goal is to accumulate a body of evidence to provide data to incorporate CBCT into the
      diagnostic work-up of breast lesions.
