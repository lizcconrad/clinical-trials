  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether functional insulinotherapy decreases
      blood glucose variability at 3 months and 6 months, compared to initial values in type 1
      diabetes patients.

      So, this study measures the impact of functional insulinotherapy on several blood glucose
      variability indicators in patients with type 1 diabetes.

      This trial also has a secondary objective: to measure the effect of functional
      insulinotherapy on oxidative stress and inflammation.

      This is a prospective, open, non-controlled study with an individual benefit for the
      participant. This study is designed to assess whether functional insulinotherapy decreases
      blood glucose variability at 3 months and 6 months, compared to initial values in type 1
      diabetes patients.

      All 30 patients with type 1 diabetes attended a 4-day functional insulinotherapy class,
      taught by 2 nurses, 2 dieticians and 2 physicians. The participants were recruited among
      metabolically stable patients who had already been prescribed functional insulinotherapy.

      To assess the impact of functional insulinotherapy on blood glucose variability, HbA1c will
      be measured at 0, 3 months and 6 months along with 4 blood glucose variability indicators:
      MAGE, ADRR, LI and LBGI.

      This trial also has a secondary objective: to measure the effect of functional
      insulinotherapy on oxidative stress. Therefore, a measure of insulin antibodies by ELISA at
      baseline. At baseline and 6 months, LTE4, TXB2, 8-iso-PGF2alpha, anti-transglutaminase and
      anti-endomysium antibodies will also be assessed.

    <description>The functional insulinotherapy class lasts for 4 days. It is taught by 2 nurses, 2 dieticians and 2 physicians to 6 to 10 patients.
On day 1, patients describe their difficulties with diabetes. Fast-acting insulin scales are elaborated from preprandial and postprandial blood glucose levels. At dinner, patients start a 24-hour glucose-fasting period to evaluate their need for basal insulin. Meals contain virtually no carbohydrates. Correcting doses of insulin are administered if preprandial glycemia is over 1.50 g/l or postprandial glycemia is over 2 g/l. Blood glucose levels must stay within normal values during the whole 24-hour period.
Carbohydrate management is taught during meals and every afternoon through workshops about dietetics. Patients also learn how to deal with hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and physical activity.
A one-day follow-up takes place 3 months later.</description>
