      Background:

        -  Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a genetic disorder that results in progressive loss
           of nervous system function by affecting the membranes of nerve cells. There is no known
           cure for NPC.

        -  N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug
           Administration to use either orally or IV for the treatment of acetaminophen (Tylenol)
           poisoning or as an aerosol to reduce the stickiness of mucous in patients with cystic
           fibrosis. In the body, NAC is converted to an amino acid called cysteine, which cells
           can convert to a chemical called glutathione. Glutathione is important in helping cells
           deal with oxidative stress. Based on a number of experiments in cells, mice and patients
           with NPC, we believe that oxidative stress is increased in NPC. If we can increase
           glutathione levels, we may be able to decrease the oxidative stress.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of N-acetyl cysteine to treat Niemann-Pick disease
      (type C).

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 1 year of age who have been diagnosed with NPC.

      Design:

        -  Patients entering this study will be seen at the National Institutes of Health Clinical
           Center four times during the 20 weeks of the study. These admissions will occur at the
           start of the study and at weeks 8, 12, and 20. The first NIH visit will last 2 days, and
           the other visits will last 1 day.

        -  Patients will participate in a two-stage study: a period of 8 weeks receiving NAC and a
           second period of 8 weeks when receiving a placebo (a pill without NAC). Every patient
           participating in this study will receive NAC during one of the two time periods.

        -  The two treatment periods will be separated by a wash-out period, 4 weeks when patients
           will receive neither NAC nor placebo. Patients will also have a 4-week wash-out period
           at the beginning of the study. Most physician-prescribed medications, such as seizure
           medications, will be allowed.

        -  During each visit, examinations, procedures, and tests will be done, including blood and
           urine samples.

    <textblock>
      Niemann-Pick Disease, type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease with
      progressive neurodegeneration. It is characterized by intracellular accumulation of
      cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. The age of onset is variable with cases manifesting from
      infancy to adulthood. Classically, initial neurological symptoms are observed in early to
      late childhood. Symptoms and signs of NPC include prolonged neonatal jaundice, splenomegaly,
      and various neurological manifestations, especially ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria, vertical
      supranuclear gaze palsy and cognitive decline. Currently there are no approved therapies for
      NPC. A recent controlled study and a series of case reports suggest some efficacy for
      miglustat. Miglustat inhibits the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids. The pathophysiological
      processes contributing to neurodegeneration in NPC have been intensively studied in NPC mouse
      models. Potential pathological processes include toxic effects of cholesterol or
      glycosphingolipid accumulation, deficient oxysterol production, peroxisomal dysfunction,
      mitochondrial dysfunction, perturbed intracellular calcium homeostasis, inflammation,
      induction of apoptosis, deficient neurosteroid synthesis, and increased oxidative stress. The
      degree to which each of these pathological processes contributes to the pathology of NPC is
      not known; however, the multiple processes involved suggest that combinatorial therapy
      addressing various aspects of this disorder will be necessary. A major impediment to the
      development of clinical trials for NPC has been the prior lack of outcome measures.
      Identifying biomarkers was a major goal of our NPC natural history trial (06-CH-0186). We now
      have identified multiple biochemical abnormalities in our cohort of patients that may prove
      useful as biomarkers in a therapeutic trial. The next step is to attempt to validate these
      potential biomarkers in a therapeutic trial. Thus in this protocol we plan to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of N-acetylcysteine to improve a group of biomarkers related to increased
      oxidative stress.

      The goals of this protocol are:

        1. To validate the use of biomarkers in a therapeutic trial for NPC.

        2. To evaluate the safety of N-acetylcysteine in NPC patients.

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine to improve biomarkers associated with
           increased oxidative stress in NPC patients.
