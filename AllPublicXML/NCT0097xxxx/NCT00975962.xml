  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a blinded randomized study. Randomization for treatment/not treatment with
      remote perconditioning takes place during transportation to the hospital. This is because the
      investigators' hypothesis states that remote perconditioning is neuro-protective and the
      effect is proportionally larger with early treatment. As the size of the effect is unknown,
      the investigators will use multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to determine the
      size of a potential neuro-protective effect.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. To describe method of remote perconditioning in clinical practice regarding feasibility.
           Pros and cons and potential limitations.

        2. To estimate the size of the effect of remote perconditioning in combination with
           recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPa) treatment within four and a half hours
           of onset of symptoms.

    <description>Remote perconditioning (rIPerC) undertaken in ambulance on rute to hospital in case of suspected stroke.
The rIPerC consists of 4 cycles of 5 minute total occlusion of blood flow to the non-paretic arm separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion. The occlusion is secured by inflating a standard blood pressure cuff to 25 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure. Written instruction on cuff inflation and paramedic's documentation of their procedure were written in a standard report which was turned over to a study nurse upon arrival to the hospital, and filed. The investigators were hence blinded to the prehospital rIPerC.</description>
