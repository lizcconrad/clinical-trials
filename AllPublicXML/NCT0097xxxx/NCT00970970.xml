  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHLD) is an inherited syndrome characterized by vascular
      malformations, kidney cancer, adrenal gland and pancreas tumors. The VHL protein is not
      functional in the different disease associated lesions which results in production of high
      amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Currently there are no clinical,
      radiographic or molecular markers that can predict the natural history of a given lesion.
      With 89Zr-bevacizumab positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, VEGF can be visualized and
      quantified.

      The investigators hypothesize that 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging is a useful tool to predict
      the behaviour of disease associated lesions in patients with VHLD.

      Adult patients with VHLD who have had routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of
      central nervous system (CNS) and abdomen will undergo a 89Zr-bevacizumab PET scan. MRI will
      be repeated within 12 months.

      Blood samples will be taken at day 1 and at the day of the MRI scan for analysis of VEGF
      pathway related biomarkers (such as plasma VEGF, PDGF, placental growth factor (PlGF),
      soluble VEGF receptors) and endothelial activation markers (such as Von Willebrand Factor
      (VWF), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 antigen (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen
      activator antigen (t-PA) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs)). DNA analysis for
      evaluation of polymorphisms in genes involved in angiogenesis is optional. In available
      biopsy or resection specimens, additional molecular staining of VEGF pathway related proteins
      will be performed (such as VEGF, VEGF receptors, HIF).
