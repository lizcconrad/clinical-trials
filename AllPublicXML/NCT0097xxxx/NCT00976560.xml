  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo controlled, exploratory, adaptive
      design study, the antidepressant and plasma cytokine lowering effects of the GW856553 will be
      investigated in adult subjects diagnosed with MDD. Subjects will receive oral doses of
      GW856553 or placebo for six weeks. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics, defined as biomarkers in blood and clinical symptoms, will be assessed.

      The primary endpoint is the change from baseline associated with GW856553 versus placebo at
      Week 6 in the Bech (6-item HAMD-17) score. Interim analyses of the primary endpoint will be
      performed throughout the study to potentially adapt the study design by changing the
      randomization ratio and/ or reducing the total number of subjects to be randomized into the
      study. Exploratory analyses will be performed by associating changes in cytokine levels and
      selected clinical symptoms; PK/PD modelling will also be used to identify the most sensitive
      clinical and biological markers.

    <time_frame>At Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>HAMD-17 has 17 questions. The HAMD-17 Total Score was calculated by summing the individual response scores over the 17 individual components of the interview. The highest possible score was 52, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represented an absence of depression. There were 9 five point questions and 8 three point questions. The responses to the individual questions had values of 0-2 (three points response) or 0-4 (five points response). The BECH scale was extracted from the HAMD-17 and comprises of 6 items out of which 5 are 5 point questions and 1 is 3 point question. The Bech Total Score was calculated by summing the individual response scores and ranged from 0 to 22, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. Week 0 values were considered as Baseline.The change from randomization was analysed using suitable Bayesian mixed-effects model repeated measures (BMMRM) assuming missing at random (MAR).</description>

    <measure>Mean Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Clinician (IDS-C) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Follow-up visit (Day 53)</time_frame>
    <description>The 30 item IDS is available in two versions IDS-C and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated (IDS-SR). To calculate the total score of IDS, 28 out of the 30 items were scored. Either weight loss or weight gain, appetite loss or appetite gain is scored because only one member of each pair is applicable to any given respondent. The standard total score is obtained by summing the ratings of 28 of the 30 items. Each of the 28 items is scored on a 0 to 3 scale (0 - the absence of pathology; 3 - severe pathology). The total scores range from 0 to 84. If more than one response was missing then the score was calculated using the formula Observed Total Score*[1+(Sum of the Maximum Score of the missing values/Sum of the Maximum Score of the non -missing values)].</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization (Week 0) Associated With GW856553 Versus Placebo at Week 6 in the Bech (6-item HAMD-17 [Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]) Score.</title>
        <description>HAMD-17 has 17 questions. The HAMD-17 Total Score was calculated by summing the individual response scores over the 17 individual components of the interview. The highest possible score was 52, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represented an absence of depression. There were 9 five point questions and 8 three point questions. The responses to the individual questions had values of 0-2 (three points response) or 0-4 (five points response). The BECH scale was extracted from the HAMD-17 and comprises of 6 items out of which 5 are 5 point questions and 1 is 3 point question. The Bech Total Score was calculated by summing the individual response scores and ranged from 0 to 22, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. Week 0 values were considered as Baseline.The change from randomization was analysed using suitable Bayesian mixed-effects model repeated measures (BMMRM) assuming missing at random (MAR).</description>

        <description>Suicidility was defined as participants with major depressive disorder who experienced worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior. Number of partcipants who experienced suicidality were reported. On the Suicidal Ideation scale of the Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) participants were scored as “non-suicidal” (00), “wish to be dead” (01), “non-specific active suicidal thoughts” (02), “active suicidal ideation with associated thoughts of methods without intent” (03), “active suicidal ideation with some intent to act on suicidal thoughts without clear plan” (04) and “active suicidal ideation with plan and intent” (05), based on the most severe score (5 being the most severe).Suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 in the C-SSRS was categorized as suicidility here.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomisation Bech Total Score: Bech Score</title>
        <description>HAMD-17 has 17 questions. The BECH scale was extracted from the HAMD-17 and comprises of 6 items out of which 5 are 5 point questions and 1 is 3 point question. The Bech scale was extracted from the HAMD-17 and comprised of 6 items out of which 5 were 5 point questions and 1 was 3 point question. The Bech Total Score was calculated by summing the individual response scores and ranged from 0 to 22, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. Due to the small number of items, missing data was not imputed for the Bech Total Score. If any of the 6 items were missing, the total score was not calculated at that visit. The change from randomization was analysed using suitable Bayesian Mixed-Effects Models for Repeated Measures (BMMRM) assuming missing at random MAR.</description>

        <description>HAMD-17 is Hamilton Depression Rating Scale which has 17 questions. The HAMD-17 Total Score was calculated by summing the individual response scores over the 17 individual components of the interview. The highest possible score was 52, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represented an absence of depression. If not more than 1 response was missing, the total score was caculated as Observed Total Score * [1 + (Sum of the Maximum Score of the missing values/Sum of the Maximum Score of the non -missing values)]. There were 9 five point questions and 8 three point questions. The responses to the individual questions can have values of 0-2 (three points response) or 0-4 (five points response).</description>

        <title>Mean Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Clinician (IDS-C) Total Score</title>
        <description>The 30 item IDS is available in two versions IDS-C and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated (IDS-SR). To calculate the total score of IDS, 28 out of the 30 items were scored. Either weight loss or weight gain, appetite loss or appetite gain is scored because only one member of each pair is applicable to any given respondent. The standard total score is obtained by summing the ratings of 28 of the 30 items. Each of the 28 items is scored on a 0 to 3 scale (0 – the absence of pathology; 3 – severe pathology). The total scores range from 0 to 84. If more than one response was missing then the score was calculated using the formula Observed Total Score*[1+(Sum of the Maximum Score of the missing values/Sum of the Maximum Score of the non -missing values)].</description>

        <description>The 30 item IDS is available in two versions IDS-SR and IDS-C. To calculate the total score of IDS, 28 out of the 30 items were scored. Either weight loss or weight gain, appetite loss or appetite gain is scored because only one member of each pair is applicable to any given respondent. The standard total score is obtained by summing the ratings of 28 of the 30 items. Each of the 28 items is scored on a 0 to 3 scale (0 – the absence of pathology; 3 – severe pathology). The total scores range from 0 to 84. If more than one response was missing then the score was calculated using the formula Observed Total Score*[1+(Sum of the Maximum Score of the missing values/Sum of the Maximum Score of the non -missing values)].</description>

        <title>Mean Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report-16 Item (QIDS-SR16) Total Score Derived From the IDS-SR (Only at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6)</title>
        <description>QIDS-SR assesses symptoms severity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criterion for major depressive disorder. It contains 16 separate items (corresponding to 16 items of the much longer IDS-SR), defining 9 DSM-IV symptom criterion domains. A total score was obtained by summing scores on each domain. The QIDS-SR total score was calculated by summing over the domain scores. The highest possible score was 27, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represented an absence of depression. Due to the small number of items, missing data was not imputed for the QIDS-SR total score.</description>

          <title>Mean Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report-16 Item (QIDS-SR16) Total Score Derived From the IDS-SR (Only at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6)</title>
          <description>QIDS-SR assesses symptoms severity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criterion for major depressive disorder. It contains 16 separate items (corresponding to 16 items of the much longer IDS-SR), defining 9 DSM-IV symptom criterion domains. A total score was obtained by summing scores on each domain. The QIDS-SR total score was calculated by summing over the domain scores. The highest possible score was 27, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represented an absence of depression. Due to the small number of items, missing data was not imputed for the QIDS-SR total score.</description>

        <description>The 30 item IDS is available in two versions IDS-C and IDS-SR. To calculate the total score of IDS, 28 out of the 30 items were scored. Either item 11 or 12 (and 13 or 14) were scored. If 11 and 12 (or 13 and 14) both are scored then the item with the highest score was considered. The total score of the 28 items ranged between 0-84. A responder is a participant who has a ≥50% reduction from randomisation in the total score for IDS-C. The total score was calculated for each participant at each timepoint and the percentage change from randomisation was then calculated as ([Total score at post randomisation visit - Total score at randomisation visit]/ Total score at randomisation visit) * 100%. Responders were those with values of ≤ -50%. The change from randomization was analysed using suitable Bayesian mixed-effects model repeated measures (BMMRM) assuming missing at random (MAR).</description>

        <title>Percentage of QIDS-SR16 Responders (Participants With a Reduction in Total Score of ≥ 50% From Randomization at Week 6/Study Exit).</title>
        <description>QIDS-SR assesses symptoms severity of DSM-IV diagnostic criterion for major depressive disorder. It contains 16 separate items (corresponding to 16 items of the much longer IDS-SR), defining 9 DSM-IV symptom criterion domains. A total score was obtained by summing scores on each domain.The highest possible score was 27, which represented the most severe measure of depression; the lowest possible score was 0, which represented an absence of depression. Due to the small number of items, missing data was not imputed for the QIDS-SR total score. A responder is a participant who has a ≥50% reduction from randomisation in the total score for that given endpoint. The total score was calculated for each participant at each timepoint and the percentage change from randomisation was then calculated as ([Total score at post randomisation visit - Total score at randomisation visit]/ Total score at randomisation visit) * 100%. Responders were those with values of ≤ -50%.</description>

        <title>Assessment of Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) up to 6 Weeks</title>
        <description>CGI-S assesses the severity of the participant's condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill). The number of participants with a CGI-I score of either 1 (“very much improved”) or 2 (much improved”) were grouped together for each timepoint. Participants with no missing CGI-S scores were categorised as having a CGI-S score of ≤ 2 or &gt; 2. The total score was calculated for each participant at each timepoint and percentage was calculated.</description>
