      Subjects were previously vaccinated at 11 to 17 months of age with GSK Biologicals'
      meningococcal vaccine 134612 or with Mencevax™. This extension phase starts 24 months after
      vaccination and the subjects who were vaccinated in the primary study will be enrolled in
      this extension phase. No new studies will be enrolled. The subjects will have 4 blood samples
      taken: at 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after vaccination.
