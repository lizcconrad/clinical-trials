  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron overload impaired growth in Thalassemia patients due to iron deposition in the endocrine
      glands, including the hypophysis and gonads. The issue of iron overload in Sickle Cell Anemia
      is recently studied more extensively and preliminary studies shows that endocrine damage is
      rarer in those patients.

      Growth velocity was not systematically studied in patients with Iron Overload, even in
      thalassemia patients in spite several studies that assess the endocrine function in those
      patients. In Sickle Cell Patients this issue was not studied.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the growth velocity in a cohort of Thalassemia Major
      and Intermedia patients and compare the results to another group of Sickle Cell patients,
      including Sickle cell thalassemia.

      Growth velocity, endocrine function and iron overload status will be studied in the patients
      that are in follow up at the Pediatric Hematology Unit, at the Ha'Emek Medical Center.

      Patients who were lost from follow up or insufficient data about growth in the past will not
      included in the study.

        150 patients suffering from hemoglobinopathies are treated at the Pediatric Hematology
        Unit, Ha'Emek Medical Center. This include Thalassemia Major blood transfused and treated
        by chelators, Thalassemia Intermedia patients ussualy not transfused, some of them treated
        by Hydroxyurea, and two groups of Sickle cell patients, Sickkle cell homozygous and Sickle
        cell thalassemia. Most of the Sickle cell patients are treated with Hydroxyurea.
