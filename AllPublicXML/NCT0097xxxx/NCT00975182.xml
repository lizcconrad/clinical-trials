  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib dose-escalation study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral (PO) GDC-0941 administered in combination
      with PO erlotinib in patients with advanced solid tumors and patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have failed at least one prior
      chemotherapy regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for which standard therapy
             either does not exist or has proven ineffective or intolerable (dose-escalation stage
             only)

          -  Documented locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients who have failed at least
             one prior chemotherapy-based regimen for incurable disease (cohort-expansion stage
             only)

          -  Adequate organ function as assessed by laboratory tests

          -  Evaluable disease or disease measurable per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST)

          -  Agreement to use an effective form of contraception for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any anti-cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or hormonal therapy)
             within a specified timeframe prior to first study treatment

          -  Prior treatment with PI3K pathway-inhibiting agents (cohort-expansion stage only)

          -  History of Grade &gt;= 3 fasting hyperglycemia or diabetes requiring regular medication

          -  Current clinically significant and uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g.,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, or metabolic)

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction

          -  History of malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with enteral
             absorption

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease

          -  Any condition requiring full-dose anticoagulants, such as warfarin, heparin, or
             thrombolytic agents

          -  Active autoimmune disease and/or need for corticosteroid therapy

          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy
