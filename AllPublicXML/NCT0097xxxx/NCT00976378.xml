      This is the first time NOX-A12 will be administered to man. The principal aim of this study
      is to obtain safety and tolerability data when NOX-A12 is administered by single intravenous
      (IV) doses to healthy male and female subjects. This information, together with the
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, will help establish the doses and dosage regimen of
      administration suitable for subsequent studies in the patient population.

             hormone ≥35 mIU/mL and serum estradiol ≤25 pg/mL), non-lactating and have a negative
             pregnancy test. Female subjects 51 years of age or older must be surgically sterile or
             post-menopausal (defined by a value of follicular stimulating hormone ≥35 mIU/mL,
             serum estradiol ≤25 pg/mL or no spontaneous menstruation for at least one year before
             the first dose), non-lactating and have a negative pregnancy test.

             clinically significant hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             hematological or other significant acute or chronic abnormalities which might
             influence either the safety of the subject or the absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion of the active agent under investigation.

          2. History of general malignant diseases.

          3. History of renal calculus.

          4. Hypersensitivity to drugs, atopic eczema, allergic bronchial asthma or any clinically
             significant allergic disease (excluding non-active hayfever).

          5. Intake of vitamin A derivatives or retinoids within 30 days prior to the start of the
             study as stated by the subject at screening.

             artificial light such as ultraviolet (UV) light from sunbeds.

          7. History of thrombosis.

          8. Laboratory test results outside the reference values as laid down by the study center,
             which may be an evidence of disease. Positive result of HIV1/2, HCV antibody or HBs
             antigen testing.

          9. Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risk of participating in the study, such as QTcB interval
             &gt;450 msec (females) and &gt;430 msec (males), 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block,
             complete left bundle branch block, complete right bundle branch block or
             Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, defined as PR&lt;110 msec, confirmed by a repeat ECG.

         10. Subjects who have had a clinically significant illness within 4 weeks of the start of

             chronically alter drug absorption or elimination processes within 30 days prior to
             dose administration as stated by the subject at screening, unless the medication will
             not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety as assessed by an
             investigator.

         17. Single use of any medication (including OTC) that are not expressively permitted
             within two weeks prior to scheduled admission to the study (self-medication or
             prescription) as stated by the subject at screening, unless the medication will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety as assessed by an
             investigator.

         18. Abuse of alcohol (equivalent to more than 18 units per week, where 1 unit is
             equivalent to one beer (about 330 mL) or one wine (about 150 mL) or one drink (about
             40 mL)), caffeine (equivalent to more than 750 mg per day) or tobacco (equivalent to
             more than 10 cigarettes a day).

         19. Alcohol breath test positive at screening.

         20. Drug addiction, positive drug screening in urine.

         21. Participation in a clinical investigation or blood donation of more than 100 mL or a
             comparable blood loss within the past 12 weeks prior to the start of the study.

         22. Subjects who are known or suspected (i) not to comply with the study directives, (ii)
             not to be reliable or trustworthy, (iii) not to be capable of understanding and
             evaluating the information given to them as part of the formal information policy
             (informed consent), in particular regarding the risks and discomfort to which they
             would agree to be exposed, or (iv) to be in such a precarious financial situation that

             unpleasantness they may be involved in.

         23. Subjects with inadequate venous access.

         24. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not participate in the study.
