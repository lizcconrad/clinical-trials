      This study will compare the relative bioavailability (rate and extent of absorption) of 500
      mg Divalproex Sodium (equivalent to 500 mg Valproic Acid) Extended Release Tablets with that
      of Depakote速 ER Tablets following a single oral dose (1 x 500 mg tablet) in healthy adult
      subjects administered under fasting conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects who have completed the screening process within 28 days prior to Period 1
             dosing

          -  Subjects who are healthy adult men and women 18 years of age or older at the time of
             dosing.

          -  Subjects who have a body mass index (BMI) between 19-30 kg/m2, inclusive, and weigh at
             least 110 lbs.

          -  Subjects who are healthy as documented by the medical history, physical examination
             (including bur may not be limited to and evaluation of the cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous systems), vital sign assessments,
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory assessments, and by general
             observations. Any abnormalities/deviations from the normal range that might be
             considered clinically relevant by the study physician and investigator will be
             evaluated for individual cases, documented in study files and agreed upon by both the
             study physician and investigator prior to enrolling the subject in this study and for
             continued enrollment.

          -  Female subjects of postmenopausal (no menses) status for at least 1 year and has a
             serum FSH level greater than or equal to 30 mIU/mL or surgically sterile (bilateral
             tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects who report receiving any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Period
             1 dosing.

          -  Subjects who report any presence or history of a clinically significant disorder
             involving the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic,
             hematologic, endocrine, or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric disease as determined
             by the clinical investigator(s).

          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values outside the accepted reference range
             and when confirmed on re-examination is deemed to be clinically significant.

          -  Subjects who demonstrate a reactive screen for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis
             C antibody, or HIV antibody.

          -  Subjects who report a history or allergic response(s) to divalproex or related drugs.

          -  Subjects who report the use of any systemic prescription medication in the 14 days
             prior to Period 1 dosing.

          -  Subjects who report the use of any drug known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug
             metabolism in the 28 days prior to Period 1 dosing.

          -  Subjects who report a history of clinically significant allergies including drug
             allergies.

          -  Subjects who report a clinically significant illness during the 4 weeks prior to
             Period 1 dosing (as determined by the clinical investigators).

          -  Subjects who report a history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse within the past
             year.

          -  Subjects who demonstrate a positive drug abuse screen for this study prior to Period 1
             administration.
