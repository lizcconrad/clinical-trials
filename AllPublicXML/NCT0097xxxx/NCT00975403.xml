  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a growing cause of death, disability and
      health care costs in Canada. Nevertheless, COPD remains largely under-diagnosed and
      under-treated, particularly in its early stages. Patients with mild COPD have variable
      respiratory symptoms and often go unrecognized by their caregivers. Recent studies indicate
      that even smokers with near normal breathing test results can have extensive small airway
      disease/dysfunction at rest, which becomes more pronounced during the stress of exercise thus
      leading to unpleasant breathing difficulty. This study seeks to better understand the nature
      and causes of breathing discomfort and activity limitation in a group of patients with mild
      COPD. The investigators will compare detailed tests of small airway function and conduct an
      evaluation of several key physiological parameters during the stress of exercise in patients
      with mild COPD and in healthy, age-matched, non-smoking control subjects. The investigators
      will also compare detailed physiological responses to exercise under conditions of chemical
      loading and mechanical unloading of the respiratory system in patients with mild COPD.

      The proposed study will be the first to systematically test the hypothesis that
      pathophysiological abnormalities in ventilatory demand, pulmonary gas exchange, small airway
      function, dynamic ventilatory mechanics and respiratory muscle function contribute
      significantly to exertional dyspnea and activity-limitation in patients with mild COPD. This
      study will be the first to determine if these abnormalities can be manipulated.
