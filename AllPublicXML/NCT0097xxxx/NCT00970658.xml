  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy in reducing signs and symptoms in
      patients with contusions, sprains, muscular injuries and injuries with less than 24 hours
      early or holders of myalgia, pain and tendonitis in regions miofasciais articulated with
      Salonsip compared to Sabiá plaster.

      It is clinical, open, multicenter, randomized, prospective and comparative, with patients
      entering at random.

      Patients will be included in sufficient quantity to achieve the minimum number of 70
      evaluable patients.
