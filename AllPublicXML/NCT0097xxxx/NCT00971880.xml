  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from Thalassemia or another hemoglobinopathies required regular blood
      transfusions. The complications and adverse effects of blood transfusions can be classified
      as immediate and late. Among the immediate effects the most common are allergic reactions and
      fever, besides congestive heart failure in patients with cardiomyopathy. The late effects are
      mostly related to blood transmitted infections like HIV or Hepatitis C infections.

      The purpose of this study is to summarize the data of those complications in a cohort of 100
      patients receiving regular blood transfusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 100 patients aged several months to 50 years are treated in the Pediatric Hematology
      Unit, most of those patients receive blood transfusions monthly. The adverse reactions were
      routinely recorded during each transfusion. All the patients were also screened annually for
      the incidence of blood transmitted infections principally HIV and Hepatitis C. All those
      records will be systematically screened and all the immediate or late adverse reactions and
      complications related to blood transfusions will be summarized.

      A second goal of this study will be to control the staff strictness related to the ministry
      of health protocol dealing to blood transfusions.
