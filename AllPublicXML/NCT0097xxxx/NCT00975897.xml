      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors select the best treatment for patients and predict their
      response to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well tumor tissue testing works
      in selecting treatment for patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary - Feasibility Study

        -  To determine the proportion of consenting patients that can provide a formalin-fixed
           paraffin-embedded block containing tumor.

        -  To determine the feasibility of topoisomerase-1 (topo-1) IHC and K-ras, BRAF mutational
           status determination being completed with 10 working days of initial consent.

        -  To determine reproducibility of results between reference laboratories.

        -  To determine the real costs of molecular testing.

        -  To determine the patients' ability to comprehend the study and their attitude during the
           waiting period for testing.

        -  To assess patients' ability to fully comprehend the trial as explained to them.

      Secondary - Feasibility Study

        -  To further identify the EGFR-responsive subset within the K-ras wildtype population.

      Primary - Definitive Study

        -  Compare the clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal
           cancer and low topo-1-expressing tumors treated with fluorouracil alone versus
           irinotecan hydrochloride, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium (IrMdG).

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients with high topo-1-expressing tumors
           treated with oxaliplatin and IrMdG versus IrMdG alone.

        -  Compare the response rate in patients with K-ras wildtype tumor treated with cetuximab
           and IrMdG versus IrMdG alone.

        -  Compare the response rate in patients with K-ras mutant tumors who are unlikely to
           respond to EGFR inhibition treated with bevacizumab and IrMdG versus IrMdG alone.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, 2-part study.

        -  Part I (feasibility study): Once consent for tissue block release has been obtained and
           patient is registered, the block is requested from the Pathology Department. This begins
           the 10 working-day time line. Treatment commences once the results of the testing are
           known. The following evaluations are performed during this period:

             -  The frequency of EGFR gene amplification on FISH, PI3K gene mutation, PTEN loss by
                IHC, estimation of mRNA for EGFR ligands (amphiregulin and epiregulin), and other
                protein assessments.

             -  An evaluation of the impact on the use or further investigation of these markers in
                the main study.

             -  Patients consenting to trial entry and (if agreeable to data collection) patients
                refusing trial entry complete a questionnaire assessing patients' ability to fully
                comprehend the trial as explained to them.

             -  Patients are interviewed before allocation of treatment about their attitudes about
                the waiting period necessary for tumor testing.

        -  Part II (definitive study): Patients are stratified according to availability of both
           lab tests (K-ras mutation [yes vs no], BRAF mutation [yes vs no], and topoisomerase-1
           [topo-1] expression [low vs high]). Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups
           based on their biomarker test results.

             -  Group 1 (low topo-1 and both K-ras and BRAF wildtype): Patients are randomized to 1
                of 3 treatment arms.

                  -  Arm I (regimen A [IrMdG]): Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over
                     30 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV bolus
                     followed by infusion over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks
                     for at least 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
                     toxicity.

                     disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

                  -  Arm III (regimen D [IrMdG and cetuximab]): Patients receive cetuximab IV over
                     1-2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV
                     over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV bolus followed by infusion over 46 hours on
