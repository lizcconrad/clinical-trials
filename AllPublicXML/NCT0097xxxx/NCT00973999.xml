        1. INTRODUCTION

           1.1 BACKGROUND

           This Randomised Placebo Controlled trial will explore whether Botulinum Toxin injection
           into the salivary glands of tracheostomised patients is effective at reducing oral
           secretions and frequency of tracheal suctioning. The management of excess saliva ranges
           from conservative, such as postural changes and biofeedback to more aggressive such as
           medication, surgical and radiological intervention. Studies have shown that the use of
           medications, such as glycopyrrolate and scopolamine, are effective in reducing drooling,
           but have many adverse side effects, such as excessive dry mouth, constipation, urinary
           retention, decreased sweating and skin flushing 1-3. Recent research has shown that the
           long-term efficacy of intra-oral surgery for the management of sialorrhea to be
           minimally effective and that over two-thirds of patients had recurrence following
           surgery resulting in pharmacological or further surgical intervention 4. In contrast
           studies using radiation therapy in the management of sialorrhea, have shown initial
           satisfactory responses with up to 80% success rate, although there were some reported
           side effects, including oral candidiasis and mild skin reactions amongst participants 5

           Many studies have investigated the management of sialorrhea (drooling or excessive
           salivation) in both Parkinson's disease patients and in children with cerebral palsy,
           using Botulinum Toxin injected into the salivary glands 6-8. Several studies report on
           the use and efficacy of ultra-sound guided injection versus direct 'blind' injection
           into the salivary gland or glands 6 9-11, concluding that blind injections are as
           effective as ultra-sound guided injection, when solely injecting into the parotid gland.
           However, when injecting into both the parotid and submandibular glands use of guided
           injections as well as being a safe and effective technique in the treatment of
           sialorrhea 11 12. However to date there has been no application of Botulinum Toxin in
           patients who have a tracheostomy in-situ and who require regular tracheal suctioning due
           to excessive saliva and / or associated swallowing difficulties. This lack of knowledge
           may be of relevance given airway suctioning is associated with clinically significant
           complications, such as hypoxia microatelectasis (alveolar damage), laryngospasm and
           tracheal wall damage 13. Hooper suggested that the presence of a tracheostomy tube may
           cause irritation, resulting in an increased production of sputum 14.

           Patients have reported sensations of pain, pressure, crushing, choking and gagging,
           whereas in the hands of a skill practitioner, suctioning may not be more than a
           discomfort 15.

           Furthermore a study investigating knowledge and competence in performing tracheal
           suctioning in acute and within high dependency ward areas concluded that many staff
           members were unaware of recommended practice and a number demonstrated potentially
           unsafe practices 16.

           1.2 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY

           If ultra-sound guided Botulinum Toxin injection into the parotid and submandibular
           salivary glands is shown to be effective in reducing the amount of oral saliva and
           subsequently reducing for the need to perform tracheal suctioning, this can ultimately
           make tracheal suctioning unnecessary, reduce the time to extubation and normalise
           airflow through the larynx. This in turn may normalise swallowing physiology, with the
           ultimate outcome of removal of the tracheostomy tube.

           A reduction in salivary secretions may also significantly reduce the likelihood of
           aspiration pneumonia which may have a positive impact on length of stay as well as a
           reduction in healthcare costs.

           Given the wide-range of clinical competencies necessary for the safe and effective
           administration of tracheal suctioning, any pharmacologically induced benefit could
           attenuate the incidence of secondary complications as well as the likelihood of
           associated malpractice litigation.

           The current study will also aid in producing guidelines in the management of saliva in
           this patient population.

        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES

           To determine whether Botulinum Toxin is effective at reducing oral secretions in
           tracheotomised patients.

           To determine whether Botulinum Toxin is effective at reducing the frequency of tracheal
           suctioning in tracheotomised patients.

           To investigate self-perceptions by patients in the management of oral / tracheal
           secretions

           To investigate nursing perceptions on amount oral secretions and frequency of tracheal
           suctioning

        3. STUDY DESIGN

           The design will be a randomised, placebo-controlled single-blinded experimental study.
           Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either active treatment or a
           placebo. Randomisation will be performed by matching consecutive eligible patients to a
           list of random numbers, generated via a computerised programme, allocating to either
           group.

           Each participant will be recruited for durations of six weeks in total. The treatment
           (injections of Botulinum toxin into the salivary glands) will be given one-week post
           after initial baseline measurements have been taken. Each participant will be
           followed-up at one week, two weeks and four weeks post injection. The patient will also
           continue to be reviewed throughout the study by the Speech and Language Therapist.

           3.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES

           Primary Outcome measure

           To determine whether Botulinum Toxin is more effective than placebo at reducing oral
           secretions, as measured in milligrams at one week, two weeks and at four weeks follow up
           visits.

           Secondary Outcome measures

           To determine whether there is a difference in the frequency of tracheal suctioning
           performed, across a 12-hour period, between the treatment and placebo controlled group,
           as measured by the volume of secretions suctioned at one week, two weeks and four weeks
           follow up visits.

           To investigate the self-perceived patient outcomes of amount of oral secretions and
           frequency of tracheal suctioning required, using a self-perception questionnaire, to be
           completed at one week, two weeks and at four weeks follow up visits.

           To investigate nursing perceptions on the amount of oral secretions and frequency
           tracheal suctioning required by individual patients, using a questionnaire, to be
           completed at one week, two weeks and at four weeks follow up visits.

        4. PARTICIPANT ENTRY

           4.1 PRE-RANDOMISATION EVALUATIONS

           All participants will be referred to the speech and language therapy department by their
           primary Consultant, for assessment of their tracheostomy, communication and / or
           swallowing.

           The patient will be assessed by the Speech and Language Therapist, using a Clinical
           Bedside Evaluation (CBE), as to whether they are able to safely swallow their own saliva
           or require tracheal suctioning to assist in clearing secretions that are falling into
           their airway.

           4.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA

           Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrolment
           into the study;

           Male or female participants over the age of 18 years

           Participants who have a tracheostomy tube in-situ

           Participants who are breathing on room air, without the need for any mechanical
           ventilation

           Participants who require tracheal suctioning in order to maintain a clear airway

           4.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA

           Patients presenting with any of the following exclusion criteria will not be included in
           the study;

           Contra-indications to the use of Botulinum Toxin

           Receiving medications that may react with Botulinum Toxin, such as aminoglycosides
           (e.g., gentamicin), anticholinesterase medicines (e.g., neostigmine), lincosamides
           (e.g., clindamycin), magnesium, neuromuscular blockers (e.g., atracurium), polymyxin, or
           quinidine because the risk of toxic effects may be increased

           Receiving anticoagulants medication (e.g., warfarin)

           Expectant mothers

           Previous history of;

           Swallowing disorders Stroke Myocardial Infarction Heart Disease Head or neck surgery
           Acute or progressive neurological disease Structural abnormalities that may affect
           swallowing

           4.4 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA

           Patients will be able to withdraw from the study at any time and will continue to
           receive therapy intervention / treatment as is required. Subjects may be withdrawn from
           the study for any of the following reasons;

           Personal reasons: as stated in the informed consent form, subjects may withdraw from the
           study at any time

           Subject withdraws consent

           Clinical judgement of the Investigator: a subject may be withdrawn from the study, if
           the opinion of the Investigator, it is not in the subject's best interest to continue

           Loss to follow-up

           If the patient withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of
           future information, no further evaluations will be performed and no additional data
           collected. The investigator will retain and continue to use any data collected before
           such withdrawal of consent.

           Withdrawal due to an adverse event should be distinguished from that due to patient
           perceived lack of treatment response or any other reason for withdrawal and recorded on
           the appropriate adverse event Case Report Form.

           If a patient withdraws due to a serious adverse event, the serious adverse event will be
           reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined in Section 7,
           Pharmacovigilence.

        5. RANDOMISATION AND ENROLMENT PROCEDURE

           5.1 RANDOMISATION OR REGISTRATION PRACTICALITIES

           From the 40 participants who will be enrolled within the study, 20 will be randomly
           assigned to the treatment group and the other 20 will be randomly allocated to the
           placebo-control group.

           All participants will be randomised to either the treatment or placebo-controlled group
           using a computerised randomisation generator (www.Randomization.com). This process will
           be co-ordinated by the CTO administrator who will advise the Chief Investigator to which
           group consecutive participants are allocated.

           5.2 UNBLINDING

           All participants and Nursing staff will be blinded to which group each participant has
           been allocated to. In the event where patients become unwell during the study or where
           there is a SAE, where the treatment would affect future management, unblinding will
           occur and all parties involved in the participants care will be informed as to which
           group the participant was allocated, as well as informing the patient and their carers.

        6. TREATMENTS

           Dr. V P Misra, Consultant Neurophysiologist, will be responsible for prescribing the
           study medication, for patients receiving the Botulinum Toxin within the treatment arm of
           the study.

           6.1 TREATMENT ARMS

           The dosage given is as follows:

           Botulinum Toxin type-A (Dysport, Ipsen Ltd, Slough, Berkshire) will be reconstituted
           with 1.0ml of sodium chloride injection B.P. (0.9%) to yield a solution containing 500
           units per ml of Dysport.

           Each parotid salivary gland will be injected with 75MU of Botulinum Toxin type-A
           (Dysport, Ipsen Ltd, Slough, Berkshire), 0.15mls in total, with 0.09mls into the mass of
           the gland and another 0.06mls into the adjacent part above the masseter muscle, as
           described by Pal 17, using a 1ml syringe and a 30 gauge needle.

           Each submandibular salivary gland will be injected with 15MU of Botulinum Toxin A
           (Dysport, Ipsen Ltd, Slough, Berkshire), administering 0.03mls, using a 1ml syringe and
           a 30 gauge needle.

           Each injection will be performed using ultrasound guidance using the Philips iU22
           ultrasound system to landmark the site of each of the glands. The drug will be obtained
           from Ipsen Ltd and funding application for the drug will be made to Ipsen Ltd, as well
           as via The Wellington Hospital.

           Placebo Participants will receive a pin-pick using a 1ml syringe and a 30 gauge needle,
           filled with sodium chloride (0.9%) at the sites of the parotid and submandibular
           salivary glands, using ultrasound guidance to landmark the sites.

           6.2 INTERACTION WITH OTHER DRUGS

           According to the summary of product characteristics produced by Ipsen limited, drugs
           which affect neuromuscular transmission, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, should be
           used with caution. Other medications that may interact with Botulinum Toxin are
           anticholinesterase medicines (e.g., neostigmine), lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin),
           magnesium, neuromuscular blockers (e.g., atracurium), polymyxin, or quinidine because
           the risk of toxic effects may be increased.

           6.3 DISPENSING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

           The shelf-life of Botulinum toxin- type A is 15 months, when stored at a temperature of
           2-8oC. The product can be stored for up to 8 hours, following reconstitution at a
           temperature of 2-8oC. The drug will be stored with the Wellington Hospitals Pharmacy
           department and be prepared by the Consultant Neurophysiologist prior to administration.
           Once used, any remaining Botulinum Toxin will be inactivated with dilute hypochlorite
           solution and thereafter be disposed of using the hospitals' policy on disposal of unused
           drugs; any out-of-date vials of the drug will also be inactivated with dilute
           hypochlorite and disposed using the hospitals practice policy on disposal of medication
           / drugs.

        7. PHARMACOVIGILANCE

           7.1 DEFINITIONS

           Adverse Event (AE):

           Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a
           medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this
           treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an
           abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of
           an investigational medicinal product (IMP), whether or not considered related to the
           IMP.

           Adverse Reaction (AR):

           All untoward and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose administered. All
           AEs judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor as having reasonable
           causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression
           reasonable causal relationship means to convey in general that there is evidence or
           argument to suggest a causal relationship.

           Unexpected Adverse Reaction: an AR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent
           with the applicable product information (e.g. investigator's brochure for an unapproved
           investigational product or summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for an authorised
           product). When the outcome of the adverse reaction is not consistent with the applicable
           product information this adverse reaction should be considered as unexpected. Side
           effects documented in the SmPC which occur in a more severe form than anticipated are
           also considered to be unexpected.

           Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Adverse Reaction:

           Any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose Results in death

           Is life-threatening - refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at
           the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have
           caused death if it were more severe

           Requires hospitalisation, or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation

           Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity

           Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect

           Medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/AR is serious in other
           situations. Important AE/ARs that are not immediately life-threatening or do not result
           in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention
           to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, should also be
           considered serious.

           Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR):

           Any suspected adverse reaction related to an IMP that is both unexpected and serious.

           7.2 CAUSALITY

           Most adverse events and adverse drug reactions that occur in this study, whether they
           are serious or not, will be expected treatment-related toxicities due to the drugs used
           in this study. The assignment of the causality should be made by the investigator
           responsible for the care of the participant using the definitions in the table below.

           If any doubt about the causality exists the local investigator should inform the study
           coordination centre who will notify the Chief Investigators. The pharmaceutical
           companies and/or other clinicians may be asked to advise in some cases.

           In the case of discrepant views on causality between the investigator and others, all
           parties will discuss the case. In the event that no agreement is made, the MHRA will be
           informed of both points of view.

           Relationship Description Unrelated There is no evidence of any causal relationship
           Unlikely There is little evidence to suggest there is a causal relationship (e.g. the
           event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial
           medication). There is another reasonable explanation for the event (e.g. the
           participant's clinical condition, other concomitant treatment).

           Possible There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. because the event
           occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However,
           the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g. the participant's
           clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).

           Probable There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship and the influence of other
           factors is unlikely.

           Definitely There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship and other possible
           contributing factors can be ruled out.

           Not assessable There is insufficient or incomplete evidence to make a clinical judgement
           of the causal relationship.

           7.3 REPORTING PROCEDURES

           All adverse events will be reported. Depending on the nature of the event the reporting
           procedures below should be followed. Any questions concerning adverse event reporting
           should be directed to the study coordination centre in the first instance. A flowchart
           is given below to aid in the reporting procedures.

           7.3.1 Non serious AR / AEs

           All such toxicities, whether expected or not, will be recorded in the toxicity section
           of the relevant case report form and sent to the study coordination centre within one
           month of the form being due.

           7.3.2 Serious AR / AEs

           Fatal or life threatening SAEs and SUSARs will be reported on the day that the local
           site is aware of the event. The SAE form asks for nature of event, date of onset,
           severity, corrective therapies given, outcome and causality (i.e. unrelated, unlikely,
           possible, probably, definitely). The responsible investigator should sign the causality
           of the event. Additional information should be sent within 5 days if the reaction has
           not resolved at the time of reporting.

           SAEs

           An SAE form should be completed and faxed to the study coordination centre for all SAEs
           within 24 hours. Please refer to the product SMPC for details of adverse events, if not
           included within these guidelines then any adverse effects will be reported to the
           Clinical Trials Office

           SUSARs

           In the case of serious, unexpected and related adverse events, the staff at the site
           should:

           Complete the SAE case report form &amp; send it immediately (within 24 hours, preferably by
           fax), signed and dated to the study coordination centre together with relevant treatment
           forms and anonymised copies of all relevant investigations.

           Or

           Contact the study coordination centre by phone and then send the completed SAE form to
           the study coordination centre within the following 24 hours as above.

           The study coordination centre will notify the MHRA and REC of all SUSARs occurring
           during the study according to the following timelines; fatal and life-threatening within
           7 days of notification and non-life threatening within 15 days. All investigators will
           be informed of all SUSARs occurring throughout the study.

           Local investigators should report any SUSARs and /or SAEs as required by their Local
           Research Ethics Committee and/or Research &amp; Development Office.

        8. ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP

           Participants will continue to be followed-up at one week, two week and at four week
           intervals post intervention and thereafter as long as they have their tracheostomy tube
           in-place and continue to benefit from ongoing intervention from Speech and Language
           Therapy for swallowing and / or communication difficulties. Assessment will focus on
           weaning from the tracheostomy tube, ability to safely swallow and recordings of tracheal
           suctioning and amount of oral saliva. Assessments will also be made of the patients /
           carers perceptions of saliva management.

           8.1 LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP

           Patients who may be lost to follow-up will not have their data included and will be
           followed-up locally by their local services.

           8.2 TRIAL CLOSURE

           Participants will continue to receive Speech and Language Therapy intervention and
           ongoing assessment, whilst they remain an inpatient at the hospital. They will be
           removed from the trial if and when they are swallowing and managing their own saliva,
           without any need for any tracheal suctioning and if the tracheostomy tube is removed.
           The end of trial date will be six weeks from inclusion date.

        9. STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS

           A power calculation has been performed to determine the sample size, which has been
           based on previous studies using Botulinum Toxin type A and treatment of drooling /
           excessive saliva management.

           Once entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) the data will be
           examined for extreme values and transcription errors. Data analysis will commence
           following data base lock, which will occur four to six weeks following the last patient
           data collection and resolution of all outstanding data queries. Data will be analysed
           using Multiple Regression.

           Data and all appropriate documentation will be stored for a minimum of 5 years after the
           completion of the study, including the follow-up period.

       10. MONITORING

           10.1 RISK ASSESSMENT

           This study is considered low risk as this drug dosage has been shown to be a safe and
           effective treatment for Parkinson's disease patients with excess saliva (sialorrhea).

           10.2 MONITORING AT STUDY COORDINATION CENTRE

           During study conduct, HCA's CTO will conduct periodic monitoring visits to the
           investigator site to ensure that the protocol and GCP are being followed. The monitors
           may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on the CRF is accurate.
           The investigator and institution will allow HCA' CTO and appropriate regulatory
           authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.

           The study site may be subject to quality assurance audits performed by HCA's CTO.

           It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available
           during the monitoring visits and audits or inspections and that sufficient time is
           devoted to the process.
