      In Ghana, low micronutrient intakes among pregnant women are a major problem. The standard
      nutritional intervention during pregnancy is iron-folic acid tablets, but adherence is low.
      The investigators have pioneered the use of multiple micronutrient-fortified semi-solid
      pastes called Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements (LNS) (made using vegetable oil, groundnut,
      milk, sugar, and micronutrients), and the investigators' previous studies show that the
      approach could have great potential for use by pregnant and lactating women.

      This study aims to evaluate the effects of LNS-P&amp;L designed for pregnant and lactating women
      and LNS-20gM designed for infants. Pregnant women (n=864) randomly selected from ante-natal
      clinics in Yilo and Manya Krobo districts of Ghana will be randomized to receive daily (a)
      Group 1: Iron/ Folic Acid tablets during pregnancy, and a tablet containing calcium (Ca) only
      (akin to a placebo) during lactation (6 mo), (b) Group 2: Multiple Micronutrient tablets
      during pregnancy and the first six months of lactation, or (c) Group 3: LNS-P&amp;L during
      pregnancy and lactation, whilst their infants receive LNS-20gM daily from 6 to 18 months.
      There are two primary outcomes namely:

        1. Maternal primary outcome: Birth length

        2. Child primary outcome: Child length-for-age z-score at 18 mo.

      The investigators hypothesize that a) mean birth length and length-for-age at 18 mo will be
      greater in children whose mothers are in Group 2 than those whose mothers are in Group 1, and
      b) children whose mothers are in Group 3 will have greater birth length and length-for-age at
      18 mo than the children in either of the other two groups.

      Introduction:

      Inadequate nutrient intakes during pregnancy remain a major problem worldwide. The standard
      nutritional intervention during pregnancy is iron-folic acid tablets, but adherence is
      generally quite low. We have pioneered the use of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS),
      which are multiple micronutrient-fortified semi-solid pastes made using vegetable oil,
      groundnut paste, milk, sugar, and micronutrients, for home fortification of complementary
      foods for infants. Given results of previous studies with Nutributter in Ghana (1, 2) and
      similar LNS in Malawi (3, 4) we believe that the food-based approach using LNS has the
      potential to improve the nutritional status of these women, and thereby also enhance their
      children's growth and micronutrient status.

      Our consortium has formulated LNS-P&amp;L for pregnant and lactating women, and modified the
      Nutributter for children, which has been called LNS-20gM in this trial. The LNS-20gM provides
      generally the Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNI) for 18 vitamins and minerals for infants
      from 6 to 18 mo of age. The LNS-P&amp;L is modeled on the UNICEF/WHO/UNU international multiple
      micronutrient preparation (UNIMMAP) for pregnant and lactating women and similar products
      used in Guinea Bissau (5). Each supplement (20 g/day) will provide 118 kcal/day. Both LNS
      products (LNS-P&amp;L and LNS-20gM) will, in addition to the multiple micronutrients provided in
      the MMN, supply energy (118 kcal/d), fat (11 g/d), protein (2.6 g/d), the essential fatty
      acids linoleic acid (=1.29 g/d) and a-linolenic acid (0.29 to &gt;0.6 g/d), as well as calcium,
      phosphorus, potassium and magnesium.

      Objectives

      The study has two objectives, which are:

        1. To evaluate the effect of LNS-P&amp;L on the nutritional status of Ghanaian pregnant and
           lactating women.

        2. To assess the effect of LNS-P&amp;L given to pregnant and lactating women and LNS-20gM
           provided to children from 6 to 18 mo of age on child growth and micronutrient status.

      Procedures

        1. Recruitment:

           This study will be a community-based, randomized controlled trial with three
           intervention groups. Potential subjects will be Ghanaian pregnant women attending usual
           ante-natal clinics at the Government Hospitals at Atua and Akuse, and the St Martins de
           Porres Catholic Hospital at Agormanya (Manya Krobo District of Ghana), and the Somanya
           Polyclinic at Somanya (Yilo Krobo District of Ghana).

           Enrolment into the study will be done in two steps. First, pregnant women who meet an
           initial set of criteria will be asked their consent (sign a Screening Consent Form) to
           participate in a pre-enrolment screening using a Screening Questionnaire. During this
           screening, which will be conducted at the clinics, results of the routine ante-natal
           examination already entered in the Ante-natal Cards will be inspected. The screening
           questionnaire will also collect additional information, such as description of place of
           residence, not recorded in the Ante-natal cards.

           Second, women who pass the screening will be contacted in their homes, where we will
           provide them with additional details of the study and seek their consent for
           recruitment. If they agree, they will sign a recruitment consent form, and enrolment
           will be said to be completed. Immediately, we will collect background demographic and
           socioeconomic information in the home using a Baseline Questionnaire, and schedule the
           women to come to the laboratory to complete a baseline anthropometric and laboratory
           assessment (blood and urine sampling, hemoglobin, blood pressure and Ultrasound for
           gestational age).

           Pregnant women (n = 864) who have completed the baseline assessments and remain eligible
           for the study will be randomly assigned (using opaque envelopes with group designations)
           to one of three groups: (1) Group 1: Iron and Folic Acid, (2) Group 2: Multiple
           Micronutrient (MMN), and (3) Group 3: Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements (LNS).

        2. Follow up:

           Pregnant women will be followed-up through delivery, up to 6 mo postpartum (i.e.
           remaining part of pregnancy from time of recruitment + 6 mo of lactation), the infants
           born to the women will be followed-up from birth to 18 mo of age. Field Workers will
           visit subjects in their homes biweekly during pregnancy and weekly from birth to 18 mo
           to provide supplements and collect data on morbidity and adherence. In the case of
           multiple births by a woman, (e.g. twins or triplets), one baby will be randomly selected
           immediately after delivery to be the index child from whom infant data and blood samples
           will be collected. Anthropometric data will be collected from the unselected twin or
           triplets, and those in Group 3 will receive LNS-20gM (because of the cultural belief
           that twins and triplets, etc., must be treated the same), but blood samples will not be
           collected from the unselected child. In case of loss of child/children during or after
           delivery, the mother will be followed-up until 6 mo postpartum. In case of loss of
           mother during or after delivery, the baby will be followed-up until 18 mo of age.

           If any woman in the study is recommended to take additional vitamins and/ or minerals by
           her physician, we will work with the physician to ensure that any supplement given does
           not lead to excess intakes.

        3. Outcome measures:

      The study will have two primary outcomes namely:

        1. Maternal primary outcome: Birth length, and

        2. Child primary outcome: Child length-for-age z-score at 18 mo.

           First Post-intervention Follow-up Study: Detailed description

           Introduction:

           Previous research has suggested that nutrition during pregnancy and early childhood can
           have long term effects on growth, health, and cognition. Only a few studies conducted
           back in the 1970's, including those in Guatemala (7) and Colombia (8, 9), have followed
           a cohort that was provided nutrition supplementation during both pregnancy and early
           childhood. The International Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements (iLiNS)-DYAD Trial in
           Ghana examined the effects of a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) provided to women
           during pregnancy and the first 6 months postpartum, and to their infants from 6 until 18
           months of age. Re-assessing the children from that trial at 4-6 years of age is
           important because this is a critical time for certain longer-term outcomes, such as
           cognitive development (e.g. school readiness) and body composition prior to puberty.

           Main objective The main objective of this first follow-up study is to evaluate the
           impact of the iLiNS DYAD-Ghana intervention among participants (women and their
           children) and their families at 2-4 years post-intervention.

           Primary objectives

           To determine the effects of LNS-P&amp;L given to women during pregnancy and the first 6 mo
           post-partum, and LNS-20gM given to their children from 6 to 18 months of age on the
           following outcomes at 4-6 years of age:

             1. Child growth

             2. Child neurobehavioral development

                Secondary objectives:

                To determine the effects of LNS-P&amp;L given to women during pregnancy and the first 6
                mo post-partum, and LNS-20gM given to their children from 6 to 18 months of age on
                the following outcomes at 4-6 years of age:

           a) Health status and stress response of the children b) Sweet taste preferences and food
           and drink preferences of the children. c) Mental and physical health status of the women
           after receiving LNS-P&amp;L. d) Caregiver investments in the index child and close siblings.
           e) Growth of the next younger sibling of the index child. f) Epigenetic DNA
           modifications of the index child g) Child activity levels

           Study design The study is designed as a follow-up study of a randomized controlled
           trial. Eligible women and mothers or caregivers of eligible children who took part in
           the iLiNS DYAD-Ghana intervention trial from 2009 to 2014 will be contacted for
           enrollment. Fathers and/or younger siblings of eligible children, if available, will
           also be enrolled.Ethical approval for the study will be obtained from the institutional
           review boards of the University of California in Davis, the University of Ghana College
           of Basic and Applied Sciences, and the Ghana Health Service.

           Inclusion criteria

             1. Mothers and children: Participated in the iLiNS DYAD-Ghana trial.

             2. Fathers: Both child and wife (child's mother) participated in the iLiNS DYAD-Ghana
                trial.

                Exclusion criteria

                Potential participants will be excluded if any of the following is present:

             1. Severe illness or injury which may interfere with data collection, eg. malignancy,
                etc.

             2. Unwillingness to participate in or cooperate with the study procedures.

                Procedures a. Recruitment Eligible mothers and fathers will be contacted in their
                homes, whereupon their informed consent will be sought for their own participation
                in the study, and the participation of their children. Where an eligible child
                lives in the care of a caregiver (instead of a parent or parents), informed consent
                for the child's participation will be sought from the caregiver and at least one
                parent, if possible.

           b. Data collection

           Data will be collected at the following contact points:

           i. Four (4) visits by study workers to the homes of participants:

             -  Home visit #1: This will occur at or shortly after enrolment. Field workers will
                collect background socio-economic and demographic information. Enrollment and
                anthropometric measurement of fathers, as well as anthropometric measurements of
                younger siblings, may occur at this or any of the subsequent home visits.

             -  Home visit #2: Will normally occur within the 7 days after Home visit #1. Study
                workers will collect children's morbidity data, and arrange with mothers/caregivers
                to complete the first visit to the central data collection location.

             -  Home visit #3: Normally, this will occur within 2 weeks after the Home visit #1.
                Study worker will: (a) collect mothers'/caregivers' report of their children's
                taste preference; (b) collect information on the mother's perception of the iLiNS
                intervention (c) collect saliva samples (sub-set of mothers/index children) to
                determine cortisol; and, (d) arrange with women (sub-set) to have their children
                complete the second visit to the central data collection location.

             -  Home visit #4: Normally, this will occur within 5 weeks after enrolment. Study
                workers will administer questionnaires (motor and neurocognitive development
                questionnaires) and arrange for mother and child to visit the hospital laboratory
                for more data/sample collection.

           ii. Two (2) visits by mothers and/or children to a central data collection location:

             -  Data collection location visit #1: Normally, this will occur between the first and
                the second week after enrolment. Tasks will include: (a) Anthropometric
                measurements; (b) Developmental assessments; (c) Deuterium dosing and saliva
                samples collection for assessment of children's body composition; and (d)
                Distribution of accelerometers to a sub-sample of children for assessment of
                physical activity.

             -  Data collection location visit #2: Will occur for a sub-set of children normally
                after 2 weeks following enrollment. These children will complete a sweet taste
                preference test and a photo game to examine food and drink preference.

           iii. Visit by mothers and children to the Hospital laboratory: Data/sample collection
           will include: (a) saliva samples (second time for cortisol analysis); (b) mothers'
           reproductive history; (c) children's clinical examination (Otoscope data); (d) blood
           pressure; (e) cheek swab; (f) hair sample collection; and (g) blood hemoglobin
           measurements.

           c. Outcome measures

           Outcome measures will include the following 8 major domains:

      1) Growth and body composition of the index child 2) Neurobehavioral development of the index
      child 3) Health status and stress response of the index child 4) Sweet taste and food/drink
      preferences of the index child 5) Maternal mental health and stress response 6) Retrospective
      perceptions of the LNS intervention, and investments&quot; in the index child and close siblings
      7) Growth status of the next younger sibling of the index child 8) Activity level of index
      child 9) Epigenetic effects of the intervention on the index child

The LNS products (LNS-P&amp;L and LNS-20gM) will be consumed by being added to prepared food (usually mixed with complementary foods, for the child). Mothers will consume the full sachet of LNS (20 g/day) at one meal each day. Dosage and directions for use of the LNS product for children will be as follows: 20 g (~4 teaspoons) per day divided into 2 portions and consumed at two different times of the day (2 x 2 teaspoons). Mix the portion of the supplement to be consumed with 2-3 tablespoons of the already prepared food (as done previously in our study in Ghana (1)), and eat the mixture before eating the rest of the food.
