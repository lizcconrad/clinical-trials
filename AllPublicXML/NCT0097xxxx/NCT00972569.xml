      The purpose of the study is to determine if low doses of BNP can improve renal function in
      people with chronic heart failure with renal dysfunction, also to determine whether
      Sildenafil assists with improvement. This study will enroll only hospitalized patients with
      heart failure.

    <textblock>
      The broad objective of this protocol is to advance our understanding of the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of human Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS) with a specific emphasis
      upon the biological interaction between diuretic therapy, the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) and cyclic 3'-5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
      pathway.

      Chronic heart failure (CHF) as a result of left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a
      clinical syndrome with high mortality and morbidity. Renal dysfunction is a common and
      progressive complication of CHF and despite growing recognition of the frequent presentation
      of combined cardiac and renal dysfunction, or &quot;Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)&quot;, its underlying
      pathophysiology is not well understood, with a lack of consensus as to its appropriate
      management.

      The main objective of this study is to extend the findings of the applicant's studies in both
      human and experimental CHF and determine if low dose intravenous (IV) (0.005/Kg/min)
      administration of BNP in hospitalized decompensated CHF patients with renal dysfunction would
      improve the renal function. Furthermore, based on our preliminary data, we also sought to
      assess if PDE V inhibition potentiated these renal enhancing actions.

      Hypothesis: Low dose IV infusion of BNP in hospitalized decompensated CHF patients with CRS
      will enhance renal and humoral functions as compared to standard therapy, which will be
      further potentiated by PDEV inhibition as evident by:

      Increased sodium excretion, Increased creatinine clearance Decreased plasma creatinine and
      blood urea nitrogen Suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, Increased renal
      cGMP generation
