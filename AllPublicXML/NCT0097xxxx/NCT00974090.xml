      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MP-513 (Teneligliptin) in
      combination with Sulfonylurea in patients with type 2 Diabetes for 12 weeks administration
      and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MP-513 in combination with Sulfonylurea with an
      extension treatment for up to 52 weeks.

    <description>The change from Baseline in HbA1c (the concentration of glucose bound to hemoglobin as a percent of the absolute maximum that can be bound) collected at Week 12. Least squares means were derived from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect and baseline HbA1c as a covariate.</description>
