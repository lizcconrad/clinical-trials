  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      biweekly docetaxel and bevacizumab in the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer by
      using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST criteria) and NCI Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTC-AE) version 3. In addition several
      biochemical makers are tested as possible predictive factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with histologically or cytologically proven measurable or nonmeasurable metastatic
      breast cancer are treated with a combination of biweekly docetaxel and bevacizumab as the
      first line treatment in multicenter phase II trial. The outcome measures would be PFS,
      Response rate (RECIST), duration of response, safety (NCI CTC-AE version 3) and survival. In
      addition several biochemical makers are tested as possible predictive factors. Treatment
      would be continued until PD, patient's refusal or treatment discontinuation due to
      side-effects or patients death. In responding patients bevacizumab would be continued either
      alone or in hormone receptor positive patients combined with hormone treatment until
      progression.
