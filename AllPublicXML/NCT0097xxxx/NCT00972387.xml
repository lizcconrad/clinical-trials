  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the greater performance benefits from
      ingesting carbohydrate-protein supplements during endurance running, in comparison to the
      traditionally used carbohydrate supplement, is attributed to the extra calories contained in
      the carbohydrate-protein supplement or the presence of protein.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the performance benefits from consuming a
      carbohydrate-protein (CHO-P) supplement, such as Accelerade, during endurance exercise, as
      opposed to the traditionally used carbohydrate (CHO) supplement, such as Gatorade, are
      attributed to the extra calories in the CHO-P supplement or the presence of protein alone in
      comparison to CHO supplements. Numerous studies comparing CHO and CHO-P supplements on
      endurance performance have found contradicting results in terms of CHO-P supplementation and
      performance benefits. While physiological mechanisms have been proposed as to why the CHO-P
      supplements elicit greater performance, research has yet to determine why some studies have
      found this, especially while other studies have found no performance benefits from CHO-P
      supplementation. This inconsistency in research may be due to the caloric difference between
      supplements tested; due to the addition of protein, the CHO-P supplement contains more
      calories per serving than the CHO supplement. As a result, this study will be comparing 4
      different supplements during endurance exercise, a CHO-P supplement, CHO supplement, a double
      carbohydrate supplement (CHO-CHO), and a placebo (PLA). The CHO and CHO-P supplement will be
      matched for CHO content, whereas the CHO-P and CHO-CHO supplements will be matched for total
      caloric content. Participants will be asked to run four 12-mile runs on 4 separate occasions,
      approximately 7-10 days apart, and will be blinded to supplement content and order of
      supplement administration among trials. The 12-mile run will elicit an exercise bout greater
      than 60 minutes, which is relevant when supplementing exercise with CHO or CHO-P. Performance
      will be assessed via time it takes to complete both the 12-mile run and the 1.6 mile maximal
      effort at the end of the run.
