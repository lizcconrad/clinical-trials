  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of Vitamin D replacement and the effects of an approved
      medication for hypertension, aliskiren (Tekturna), in patients with high blood pressure who
      have low levels of vitamin D in their blood. The study will compare the effects of vitamin D
      or aliskiren alone and in combination on 24-hour blood pressure and biochemical parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether aliskiren will lower clinic blood pressure and 24-hour blood
      pressure in patients with hypertension and vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, this study
      will further explore the potential additional effects of adding vitamin D to aliskiren in
      this patient population.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Study was never completed due to early termination of the trial by sponsor. Data were never analyzed because group assignment was never un-blinded and data lacked any scientific utility.</limitations_and_caveats>
