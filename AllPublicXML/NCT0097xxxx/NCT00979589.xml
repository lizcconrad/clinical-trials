    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of a 3-month regimen of clopidogrel
      initiated with a loading dose (LD) of 300 mg followed by 75 mg/day during the first 21days
      versus a 3-month regimen of ASA 75 mg/day alone on reducing the 3-month risk of any stroke
      (both ischemic and hemorrhagic, primary outcome) when initiated within 24 hours of symptom
      onset in high-risk patients with TIA or minor stroke.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Adult subjects (male or female ≥ 40 years)

        2. Acute non-disabling ischemic stroke (NIHSS≤3 at the time of randomization) that can be
           treated with study drug within 24 hours of symptoms onset. Symptom onset is defined by
           the &quot;last see normal&quot; principle.

        3. TIA (Neurological deficit attributed to focal brain ischemia, with resolution of the
           deficit within 24 hours of symptom onset), that can be treated with study drug within 24
           hours of symptoms onset and with moderate-to-high risk of stroke recurrence (ABCD2 score
           ≥ 4 at the time of randomization). Symptom onset is defined by the &quot;last see normal&quot;
           principle.

        4. Informed consent signed

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

      Percentage of patients with the 3-month new vascular events, defined as any event of the
      following:Any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhage).
