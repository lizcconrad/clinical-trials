      The purpose of this study is to investigate the activity of panitumumab in combination with
      standard preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer, followed by complete
      surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The main hypothesis of the study is that the association of EGFR-targeting agent and
      radiation therapy could be as effective or even improve the rate of pathological complete
      tumoral response with fewer toxicities in comparison to the standard of care using
      chemoradiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies have radiosensitizing properties. In particular, cetuximab in
      combination with curative-intent radiotherapy has been reported to increase median overall
      survival over radiation therapy alone in locally advanced head and neck carcinoma.

      Similar benefit in rectal cancer is expected. However, preliminary studies revealed that the
      combination of chemoradiation and cetuximab did not seem to improve the pathological tumor
      response. However, in the past studies, the selection of patients' population was not optimal
      since KRAS mutational status was not considered during recruitments.

      Therefore, new trials to investigate EGFR-targeting therapies in combination with
      radiotherapy in wild-type KRAS patients are required.

      Adjuvant chemotherapy has also shown to decrease the risk of local relapse in patients who
      did not receive chemotherapy during radiotherapy. In our study, since there will be no
      chemotherapy given during the preoperative setting, the administration of adjuvant
      chemotherapy postoperatively is highly recommended.
