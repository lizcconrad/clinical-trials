  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extract from the mushroom Agaricus blazei Murill har been shown to have strong
      immunomodulating properties both in cell cultures, animal models and in humans. Furthermore
      antitumor properties have been shown in animal models, among them in mice with multiple
      myeloma. The investigators now want to investigate the effect of Agaricus as supplementary
      treatment in addition to chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are scheduled to undergo high dose chemotherapy for multiple myeloma will
      receive in addition in a double blinded manner 60 ml of agaricus extract or placebo once
      daily from the start of stem cell mobilizing therapy until one week after the end of aplasia
      after high dose melphalan.

      Primary endpoints will be cytokine levels of degree of activation of tumor supressor genes
      before and after start of the investigational product.

      Secondary endpoints will be treatment response and quality of life.
