      This clinical trial studies dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast enhanced magnetic
      resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) after administration of ferumoxytol and dynamic contrast-enhanced
      MRI (DCE-MRI) after administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) in viewing the
      vessels of the brain in younger patients with brain tumors. Ferumoxytol is an experimental
      form of very small iron particles that are taken by the blood stream to cells adjacent and
      inside the tumor. These iron particles may make it easier to see the areas of the brain that
      are affected by tumor. Ferumoxytol may work better than standard GBCA in viewing the vessels
      of the brain and brain tumor on MRI. Using ferumoxytol and GBCA in the same MRI session may
      provide more information about tumor blood supply and the extent of the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the vascular properties of pediatric brain tumors using ferumoxytol for
      DSC-MRI and GBCA for DCE-MRI in pediatric brain tumor (proven or presumptive) patients in a
      single MRI session.

      II. To describe evolving imaging characteristics of tumor vasculature using DSC-MRI with
      ferumoxytol and DCE-MRI with GBCA in pediatric brain tumor patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare and evaluate magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) with ferumoxytol between different
      time points.

      II. To describe number and size of tumors imaged. III. To assess histology and electron
      microscopy (EM) on tissue samples. IV. To demonstrate differences in patients with prior
      therapy versus (vs.) no prior therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol and gadolinium intravenously (IV) and then undergo DSC-MRI and
      DCE-MRI. An optional MRI without injection of a contrast agent may be obtained after 20-24
      hours at the discretion of the clinician. Patients may receive up to 3 more scans at least 3
      weeks apart over up to 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 4-6 weeks.

          <title>Vascular Properties of Pediatric Brain Tumors Using Dynamic Susceptibility-weighted Contrast Enhanced MRI (DSC-MRI) After Administration of Ferumoxytol</title>
          <description>Signal intensity, relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was measured. Relative CBV measurements were calculated from regions of interest (ROI) that were placed in regions of highest perfusion seen on the rCBV color overlay parametric maps.The mean of 3 regions of contralateral white matter was used as the internal reference standard. The size of the ROIs was kept constant (radius 1.5 mm). Parametric color overlay maps were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).</description>

        <description>Volume transfer coefficient reflecting vascular permeability of pediatric brain tumors using Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) was measured. Subjects undergo MRI with ferumoxytol (study drug) and gadolinium (standard contrast agent) in the same imaging session. Ferumoxytol is given first and DSC images obtained, followed by gadolinium, and DCE images are obtained.</description>
