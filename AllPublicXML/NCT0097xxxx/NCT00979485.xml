  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide data correlating levels of microparticles that
      circulate in the blood and disease activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD). The hypothesis is that circulating microparticles will be higher in children with
      active IBD, show inflammatory activity, and will be low in patients in remission as well as
      in healthy controls.

    <textblock>
      Once the response of microparticles to inflammation is defined in this patient population,
      the microparticles can be used as biomarkers of disease activity and could potentially use
      microparticles as targets of therapeutic agents.

      This cross sectional study will enroll 15 Crohn's patients (5 inactive, 5 mild, 5
      moderate-severe disease based on the pediatric Crohn's disease activity index), 15 Ulcerative
      Colitis patients (5 inactive, 5 mild, 5 moderate-severe disease based on the pediatric
      ulcerative colitis activity index), and 10 healthy controls.
