  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of bicalutamide
      50 mg tablets (test) versus Casodex® (reference) administered as 1 x 50 mg tablet under fed
      conditions.

      This will be a single center, bioequivalence, open-label, randomized 1-way parallel study.

      According to the BA/BE guidances, a parallel study is acceptable for drugs with a long
      half-life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be males, non-smokers, 18 years of age and older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects to whom any of the following applies will be excluded from the study:

          -  Clinically significant illnesses within 4 weeks of the administration of study
             medication.

          -  Clinically significant surgery within 4 weeks prior to the administration of the study
             medication.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality found during medical screening.

          -  Any reason which, in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, would prevent the
             subject from participating in the study.

          -  Abnormal laboratory tests judged clinically significant.

          -  Positive urine drug screen at screening.

          -  Positive testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV at screening.

          -  ECG abnormalities (clinically significant) or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood
             pressure lower than 90 or over 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure lower than 50 or
             over 90; or heart rate less than 50 bpm) at screening.

          -  Subjects with BMI ≥30.0.

          -  History of significant alcohol abuse within six months of the screening visit or any
             indication of the regular use of more than two units of alcohol per day (1 Unit = 150
             mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or 45 mL of alcohol 40%).

          -  History of drug abuse or use of illegal drugs: use of soft drugs (such as marijuana)
             within 3 months of the screening visit or hard drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine
             (PCP) and crack) within 1 year of the screening visit.

          -  Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that, in the opinion of the
             medical subinvestigator, contraindicates the subject's participation in this study.

          -  History of allergic reactions to bicalutamide or other related drugs.

          -  Use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (examples of
             inducers: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, glucocorticoids, rifampin/rifabutin;
             examples of inhibitors: antidepressants, cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin,
             ketoconazole, MAO inhibitors, neuroleptics, verapamil, quinidine) within 30 days prior
             to the administration of the study medication.

          -  Use of an investigational drug or participation in an investigation study within 30
             days prior to the administration of the study medication.

          -  Clinically significant history or presence of any clinically significant
             gastrointestinal pathology (e.g. chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases),
             unresolved gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting), liver or kidney
             disease, or other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism or excretion of the drug.

          -  Any clinically significant history or presence of clinically significant neurological,
             endocrinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, immunologic, psychiatric or
             metabolic disease.

          -  Use of prescription medication within 14 days prior to administration of study
             medication or over-the-counter products (including natural food supplements, vitamins,
             garlic as a supplement) within 7 days prior to administration of study medication,
             except for topical products without systemic absorption.

          -  Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that could, in the opinion
             of the medical subinvestigator, contraindicate the subjects participation in this
             study.

          -  A depot injection or an implant of any drug within 3 months prior to administration of
             study medication.

          -  Donation of plasma (500 mL) within 7 days. Donation or loss of whole blood prior to
             administration of the study medication as follows:

          -  Less than 300 mL of whole blood within 30 days or

          -  300 mL to 500 mL of whole blood within 45 days or

          -  more than 500 mL of whole blood within 56 days.

          -  Positive alcohol breath test at screening.

          -  Subjects who have used tobacco in any form within the 90 days preceding study drug
             administration.
