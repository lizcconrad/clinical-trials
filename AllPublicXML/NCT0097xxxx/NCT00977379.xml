  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, parallel arm study will evaluate the effect of capecitabine
      administered concurrently with WBRT and as maintenance therapy in participants with breast
      cancer and newly diagnosed brain metastases. Participants will be randomized to receive
      either capecitabine with 10 days standard WBRT, or WBRT alone. Maintenance therapy will
      follow with capecitabine or another systemic therapy in the WBRT only group.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to end of Treatment (up to 10.6 months overall)</time_frame>
    <description>MMS was an 11-question measure that tested five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. Four items were scored on a scale of 0 to 1; 1 item was scored on a scale of 0 to 2; 3 items were scored on a scale of 0 to 3; and 3 items were scored on a scale of 0 to 5. MMS total score was obtained by adding the scores of all individual items and ranged from 0 to 30, where higher scores indicate better cognitive state.</description>

MMS total score was obtained by adding the scores of all individual items and ranged from 0 to 30, where higher scores indicate better cognitive state.</description>
