      Lyrica is the trade name for pregabalin, which was first approved by the FDA in June 2005 and
      has been available through prescription since fall 2005, and is marketed by Pfizer. Lyrica is
      known to have clinical efficacy treating pain disorders including irritable bowel
      syndrome-related conditions such as fibromyalgia.

    <time_frame>weeks 9-12</time_frame>
    <description>The Bowel Symptom Scale (BSS) consists of 5 questions, each with a 100 mm long Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The questions are regarding pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and overall severity of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The VAS does not have any pre-set marks between the extremes of 0 for not present and 100 mm for very severe symptoms. The investigator measures the mark made by the participant in mm and records this for the value.</description>

        <description>The Bowel Symptom Scale (BSS) consists of 5 questions, each with a 100 mm long Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The questions are regarding pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and overall severity of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The VAS does not have any pre-set marks between the extremes of 0 for not present and 100 mm for very severe symptoms. The investigator measures the mark made by the participant in mm and records this for the value.</description>

        <description>The Bowel Symptom Scale (BSS) consists of 5 questions, each with a 100 mm long Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The questions are regarding pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and overall severity of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The VAS does not have any pre-set marks between the extremes of 0 for not present and 100 mm for very severe symptoms. The investigator measures the mark made by the participant in mm and records this for the value.</description>

        <title>Mean Constipation BSS Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The Bowel Symptom Scale (BSS) consists of 5 questions, each with a 100 mm long Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The questions are regarding pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and overall severity of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The VAS does not have any pre-set marks between the extremes of 0 for not present and 100 mm for very severe symptoms. The investigator measures the mark made by the participant in mm and records this for the value.</description>
