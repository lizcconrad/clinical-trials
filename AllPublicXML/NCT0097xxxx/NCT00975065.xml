      -  The progressive nature of T2DM will require the use of combination therapy in many
           patients over time to achieve and maintain glycemic control. Early combination, compared
           with maximal dose of monotherapy, could be more effective in lowering glycemia with
           better tolerability.

        -  Vildagliptin is a new oral antidiabetic drug acting as a potent and selective inhibitor
           of dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4), the enzyme responsible for the rapid degradation of
           circulating glucagon-like peptide-1. Vildagliptin improves islet function by a mechanism
           of increasing plasma levels of the active forms of the incretin hormones, GLP-1 and GIP.

        -  Metformin improves hyperglycemia primarily through its suppression of hepatic
           gluconeogenesis as well as enhancement of peripheral glucose update. Metformin is the
           most commonly prescribed first-line antidiabetic drug worldwide, but due to the
           progressive worsening of blood glucose control during the natural history of type 2
           diabetes, combination therapy usually becomes necessary.

        -  Thus their combination therapy with complimentary action mechanism could be as effective
           as up titration of monotherapy.
