  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of oral Cyclosporine A (CsA)
      in patients with advanced stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of the
      study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CsA as a therapy for the adaptive immune
      response in advanced stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

      Subjects between 45 and 80 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of advanced stage COPD,
      not responsive to conventional inhaler therapy, who meet all the study requirements, will be
      enrolled in this study. A total of 30 subjects of either sex will be enrolled in this study.
