    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Boron neutron capture therapy and radiation therapy use high-energy x-rays and
      other types of radiation to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving boron neutron capture therapy followed by
      radiation therapy and temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving boron neutron capture
      therapy together with radiation therapy and temozolomide in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
           treated with boron neutron capture therapy, radiotherapy, and concurrent and adjuvant
           temozolomide.

        -  Evaluate tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the adverse effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo boron neutron capture therapy followed by radiotherapy and concurrent and
      adjuvant oral temozolomide.
