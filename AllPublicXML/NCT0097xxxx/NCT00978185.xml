      RATIONALE: Acupressure wristbands may prevent or reduce nausea caused by chemotherapy. It is
      not yet known whether acupressure wristbands are more effective than standard care in
      controlling acute and delayed nausea.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying acupressure wristbands to see how well
      they work compared with standard care in controlling nausea caused by chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the clinical effectiveness of self-acupressure using wristbands in addition to
           standard care in the management of chemotherapy-induced (acute and delayed) nausea
           compared to patients receiving standard care with sham-acupressure wristbands and
           standard care alone.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the cost effectiveness and extent of use of usual care in patients using
           acupressure wristbands in addition to standard care for the management of
           chemotherapy-induced nausea compared to patients receiving standard care with
           sham-acupressure wristbands and standard care alone.

        -  To assess the level of quality of life in patients using acupressure and standard care
           alone.

        -  To assess the clinical effectiveness of self-acupressure using wristbands in addition to
           standard care in the management of chemotherapy-induced (acute and delayed) vomiting
           compared to patients receiving standard care with sham-acupressure wristbands and
           standard care alone.

        -  To ascertain for which emetogenic level of chemotherapy regimens (i.e., high, moderate,
           or low emetogenic chemotherapy) self-acupressure using wristbands in addition to
           standard care is more or less effective in terms of nausea compared to patients
           receiving standard care with sham-acupressure wristbands and standard care alone.

        -  To ascertain whether any improvement in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting from
           using acupressure wristbands is different in males and females.

        -  To ascertain whether there is an age effect from the use of acupressure wristbands in
           relation to chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to gender, age in years (16 to 24 vs &gt;24 to 50 vs
      &gt; 50), and level of emetogenic chemotherapy (high vs moderate vs low). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 intervention arms:

        -  Arm I (acupressure group): Patients receive standard antiemetics comprising an oral
           5-HT3 receptor antagonist (i.e., Zofran) and oral or IV dexamethasone before and for 3
           days post-chemotherapy (for highly emetic chemotherapy); an oral 5-HT3 receptor
           antagonist (i.e., Zofran) and dexamethasone IV before chemotherapy and a 5-HT3 receptor
           antagonist or dexamethasone for 2 days post-chemotherapy (for moderately emetogenic
           chemotherapy); or oral dexamethasone before chemotherapy (for low-emetogenic
           chemotherapy). Beginning on the morning before chemotherapy, patients wear a pair of
           SeaBand™ elastic wristbands on each arm for 7 days. Each wristband has a 1-cm protruding
           round plastic button (stud) pressing the P6 acupoint, located on the anterior surface of
           the forearm, approximately three-finger width up from the crease of the wrist between
           the tendons of the Palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis.

        -  Arm II (sham acupressure group): Patients receive standard antiemetics as in arm I.
           Beginning on the morning before chemotherapy, patients wear a pair of elastic wristbands
           on each arm for 7 days. Each wristband has a flat button pressing the P6 acupoint,
           located on the anterior surface of the forearm, approximately three-finger width up from
           the crease of the wrist between the tendons of the Palmaris longus and flexor carpi
           radialis.

        -  Arm III (control group): Patients receive standard antiemetics as in arm I. Patients are
           assessed periodically by questionnaires.
