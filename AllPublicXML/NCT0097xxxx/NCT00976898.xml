  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will be studying the effects of proton beam radiation
      therapy. This is a very accurate kind of treatment that has been shown to affect less normal
      tissue than a photon radiation beam. The accuracy allows the investigators to more safely
      increase the amount of radiation delivered to eliminate cancer. This accuracy will
      potentially reduce side effects that participants would normally experience using photon
      radiation therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine if radiation using proton beam
      therapy will kill the cancer cells in the participants liver.

      -  Participants will receive treatment as an outpatient in the Francis H. Burr Proton
           Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the MD Anderson Proton Therapy Center or
           the Roberts Proton Therapy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.

        -  Not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same dose of
           radiation. The dose received will be determined by the location of the tumor(s) within
           the liver.

        -  Proton Beam radiation therapy to the liver will be given once a day, 5 days a week
           (Monday-Friday), for 2 weeks.

        -  The following procedures will be performed once a week during treatment on days 1, 8 and
           15, as well as on the last day of radiation: physical examination and blood tests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven unresectable or locally recurrent hepatocellular cancer or intrahepatic
             cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with a single lesion must be 12cm or less in greatest
             dimension. For patients with two lesions, no lesion may be greater than 10cm in
             greatest dimension. For patients with three lesions, no lesion may be greater than 6cm
             in greatest dimension. Patients may have single or multinodular tumors (up to 3).
             There must be no evidence of extrahepatic tumor. Portal vein involvement or thrombosis
             is allowed.

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             20mm or greater with conventional techniques or as 10mm or greater with spiral CT
             scan.

          -  Patients may have had prior chemotherapy, targeted biological therapy, surgery,
             transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation, or cryosurgery for
             their disease as long as it is greater than 4 weeks from first protocol radiation
             treatment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Patients may not have had prior
             radiation to the affected area.

             etc.

          -  Prior liver directed radiation treatment

          -  Patients may have no serious medical illness, which may limit survival to less than 3

          <title>Child-Turcotte-Pugh Class</title>
          <description>Child-Turcotte-Pugh Class is used to evaluate the prognosis of chronic liver disease (primarily cirrhosis). Classes are determined using 5 clinical measures of liver disease with 1 to 3 points given for each measure, with more points given for less favorable clinical criteria. The 5 measures are total bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (INR), Ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy grade. The classes are A (5-6 points), B (7-9 points), and C (10-15 points) with 'A' having the best survival outcomes and C having the worst.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse event information was collected from the start of treatment until 30 days after the last study visit. Radiation was delivered in 15 fractions Monday through Friday over a period of three weeks. Follow-up visits occurred at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 months post treatment. Median follow-up was 19.5 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>Adverse events were assessed with the use of regularly scheduled visits which involved physical exams, CT and/or MRI scans, laboratory tests, and patient self reporting. If an adverse event did not match any of the existing CTCAE 3 terms, it was noted as being 'other'. Adverse events noted as being 'other' were only grouped together by organ system due to incomplete data about what specific adverse event was being recorded as 'other'.</desc>
