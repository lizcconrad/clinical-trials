      RATIONALE: A computer-based system for assessing symptoms may be effective for patients with
      metastatic or advanced cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well computerized questionnaires work in
      assessing symptoms, pain, depression, and physical function in patients with metastatic
      and/or advanced local/regional cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the feasibility of applying a computer-based system for symptom assessment and
           classification in palliative cancer care in patients with metastatic and/or advanced
           cancer.

        -  Examine hypothesized differences across groups related to acceptance of computers (i.e.,
           age, culture, stage of disease, cognitive and physical function, etc.).

        -  Examine the general user-friendliness of the tool.

        -  Test and validate the performance of selected domains and items for classification and
           assessment of pain and cachexia.

        -  Explore the validity of domains and items for depression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      All patients undergo computer-based assessments of general symptoms by the Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment System (ESAS) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
      Core Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ C30) questionnaires and assessment of physical function,
      appetite/weight loss, and depression by the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PRIME-MD
      PHQ9). Patients who score â‰¥ 1 (on a 0-10 numerical rating score) on the pain screening
      question with or without occurrence of breakthrough pain (BTP), undergo the Alberta BTP
      Assessment tool assessing precipitating factors for pain, time to pain relief after intake of
      medication, and satisfaction with medication. Patients complete questions regarding
      user-friendliness and feasibility of using the computer at the end of their session.
