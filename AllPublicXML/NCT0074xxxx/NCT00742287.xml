  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking has been identified as a key risk factor for the development of cardiovascular
      diseases (CVD). It was found that a persistent increase in levels of oxidative stress and
      prolonged inflammation play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of smoking associated CVD.
      Oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs) are widely known for their anti-oxidant and
      anti-inflammatory effects, in vitro and in vivo. However, there are hardly any studies
      available that systematically investigated their acute and long-term effects on vascular
      function as well as on established biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in an &quot;at
      risk&quot; population such as smokers.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of an eight-week
      supplementation with OPCs on vascular function as well as biomarkers of oxidative stress and
      inflammation in blood of smokers.
