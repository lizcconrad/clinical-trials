  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to understand whether it is possible to reduce medical
      risk factors in adults with bipolar disorder and, in doing so, to improve psychiatric and
      functional outcomes. We will examine the role of behavioral risk factors and presumed
      behavioral mediators and moderators of health risk in individuals suffering from bipolar I
      disorder. The investigators will employ an innovative behavioral intervention with guideline
      based psychiatric care ( Integrated Risk Reduction Intervention - IRRI) in order to target
      modifiable medical risk factors.

      IRRI is aimed at improving sleep/wake and social rhythm disturbance and achieving modest
      weight reduction by increasing physical activity and improving nutrition and dietary habits,
      while at the same time providing optimal psychiatric care and medical monitoring. This will
      allow us to investigate the role that improvements in sleep/wake and social rhythm
      regularity, diet, and physical activity have in improving psychiatric and functional
      outcomes. In order to examine another set or possible pathways (i.e., that it is the
      amelioration or psychiatric symptoms that leads to the improvements in physical health), we
      will contrast outcomes of subjects receiving IRRI with those of subjects receiving
      psychiatric care with medical monitoring (PCMM), which incorporates the same optimal
      psychiatric care plus monitoring of medical conditions. These aims will be achieved in a
      24-month randomized treatment trial of 144 adult subjects with bipolar I disorder.

    <description>The integrated risk reduction intervention (IRRI) consists of three components:
psychiatric treatment by a study psychiatrist
assessment, referral, monitoring, and coordination by a certified registered nurse practitioner (CRNP) of medical treatment provided by the subject's own primary care physician
a healthy lifestyle behaviors program delivered by a lifestyle coach. The treating psychiatrist will work in collaboration with a CRNP and a lifestyle coach. The CRNP will assess and monitor the subject's medical needs and refer the subject to their primary care physician for care and will follow-up on adherence to the medical treatment recommendations. The CRNP will be responsible for coordinating the psychopharmacological care provided by the psychiatrist, the healthy lifestyle behaviors program that will be delivered by the lifestyle coach, and the medical care provided by the subject's PCP.</description>

    <description>Psychiatric Care with Medical Monitoring (PCMM)
The psychiatric care with medical monitoring condition (PCMM) consists of two components:
psychiatric treatment by a study psychiatrist
assessment and referral by a psychiatric research nurse for medical treatment provided by the subject's own primary care physician.
The treating psychiatrist will be assisted by a psychiatric nurse clinician who will assess and monitor the subject's medical needs and refer the subject to their primary care physician for care.</description>
