  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypoglycemia, low blood sugar
      levels, in patients with diabetes. It primarily functions as a counter-regulatory hormone by
      opposing the actions of insulin to maintain blood glucose levels. A major problem for
      diabetic patients with hypoglycemia is the development of defective counter regulatory
      responses including reduced or absent glucagon responses to hypoglycemia. Mayne Glucagon for
      Injection has been developed as an alternative to currently marketed products.

      Administration of exogenous glucagon i.e., not produced in the body, has been shown to be
      effective in the treatment of low blood sugar in patients with diabetes. Mayne has developed
      a product, Glucagon for Injection, which is an alternative to currently marketed products.
      The only difference is the source of the active ingredient. The formulation, routes of
      administration, dosage regimen and indications of Mayne Glucagon for Injection are identical
      to those currently registered for the marketed product.

      A total of 28 healthy volunteers will be recruited into this study at one investigational
      site.

          -  Subject must agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the study and for
             12 weeks after the last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP). Adequate
             methods of contraception for subject or partner include condoms with spermicide gel,
             diaphragm with spermicide gel, coil (intrauterine device), surgical sterilisation,
             subdermal implant, vasectomy, oral contraceptive pill, depot progesterone injections
             and abstinence. If a volunteer is usually not sexually active but becomes active
             he/she or their partner must use one of the contraceptive methods listed . Male
             subjects whose partner is of child bearing potential must ensure that they or their
             partner use effective contraception for the course of the study and 12 weeks
             thereafter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant findings that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude inclusion in the study

          -  History or presence of clinical significant gastrointestinal pathology or symptoms,
             liver or kidney disease or any other condition that might interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug.

          -  Any clinically significant laboratory findings

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) results

          -  Positive pregnancy test or lactation

          -  Participation in any other clinical study using an investigational product or device
             within the previous 12 weeks

          -  Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B or C test

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the past two years or alcohol consumption
             greater than 21 units per week for males and greater than 14 units per week for
             females

          -  Blood donation of ≥ 500 mL in the previous 12 weeks

          -  Hypersensitivity to Glucagon and/or any excipients

          -  Use of prescription medicines or St John's Wort in the previous 2 weeks. The use of
             over-the-counter medicines within 5 days of dosing except those deemed by the
             investigator not to interfere with the outcome of the study. Vitamins, minerals and
             nutritional supplements may be taken at the discretion of the investigator. Hormonal
             contraceptives will be permitted.
