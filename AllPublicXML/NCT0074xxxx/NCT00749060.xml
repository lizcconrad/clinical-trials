  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare three treatments in recent (less than 6 week duration)
      non-traumatic ( usually osteoporotic) vertebral fractures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The three treatments are the following: 1/Conventional medical treatment including rest and
      pain medications2/Vertebroplasty consisting in the percutaneous injection into the fractured
      vertebra of polymethylmetacrylate cement (the cement used to fix prosthesis in joint
      replacement) through a posterior route through the vertebral pedicles under radiological
      guidance.3/Balloon Kyphoplasty which consists of placing through a percutaneous posterior
      approach under radiological guidance, into the fractured vertebra a balloon which is inflated
      with fluid and creates a cavity. This may restore part of the vertebral height loss due to
      the fracture. In addition, after balloon deflation, polymethylmetacrylate cement may be
      injected with low pressure into the created cavity. The study will indicate if balloon
      kyphoplasty is able to restore vertebral height of the fractured vertebra better than medical
      treatment and vertebroplasty.
