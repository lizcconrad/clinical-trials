      The purpose of this study is to compare two different methods of treating pain after a hip
      fracture.

      This project examines the efficacy and effects of 2 regional anesthesia techniques, femoral
      nerve blocks (FNB) and fascia iliaca blocks (FIB), on the treatment of peri-operative acute
      hip (femoral neck, intertrochanteric) fracture pain. Patients age 60 years and over
      presenting to two New York City emergency departments with hip fracture will be randomized to
      receive the intervention or usual care. The intervention includes single injection FNB in the
      ED followed by insertion of a continuous FIB catheter within 24 hours of the single injection
      FNB plus &quot;as needed&quot; non-opioid/opioid analgesia. Usual care patients will receive
      conventional therapy with regularly scheduled intravenous or oral opioids plus &quot;as needed&quot;
      non/opioids/opioids. We will examine the impact of the intervention on patients' self
      reported pain intensity; systemic opioid requirements; post-operative function; incidence of
      delirium, treatment related side effects; and hospital length of stay and participation in
      physical therapy.

    <description>Patients assigned to the intervention group will have a femoral nerve block administered by the attending emergency department physician. Twenty-four hours after the femoral nerve block or at the time of surgery, an anesthesiologist will insert a continuous fascia iliaca block. Both procedures (femoral nerve block and fascia iliaca blocks) are standard anesthetic techniques that are used in orthopedic procedures but their efficacy as compared to standard opioid therapy has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials in hip fracture. The medications that will be used in each procedure are as follows: 1) femoral nerve block: 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:300,000 epinephrine; 2) fascia iliaca block: 0.2% ropivacaine will be infused at 5ml/hr.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adult patients 60 years of age and over that present to the MSMC ED from 8:00 to
             20:00 with a radiographically confirmed hip fracture (femoral neck, intertrochanteric,
             or peri-capsular) will be screened for study eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of advanced dementia

          -  Presence of multiple trauma, pathological fractures, bilateral hip fractures, or
             previous fracture or surgery at the currently fractured site

          -  Patients transferred from another hospital

          -  Patients with cirrhosis or liver failure.

          -  The investigators exclude patients with advanced dementia because the investigators
             will require patients to self-report their pain intensity.

          -  The investigators exclude these categories of hip fracture because they represent
             patients with atypical or often problematic clinical circumstances.

          -  The investigators exclude patients under age 60 because our focus is on treatment of
             pain in older adults. Younger adults (less than age 60) typically present with
             fractures of different cause (severe and multiple trauma), are less sensitive to the
             side effects and complications of opioid therapy, are less likely to have delayed or
             prolonged functional recovery, and are less sensitive to the adverse and sometimes
             permanent effects of prolonged bed rest (i.e., from pain) on function.

          -  The investigators exclude patients with hepatic dysfunction because the intervention
             protocol includes administration of acetaminophen which can provoke liver failure in
             patients with advanced liver disease.
