      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind study is to evaluate the utility, safety, and
      cost of transitioning benzodiazepine sedation to dexmedetomidine in medical or surgical
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring sedation when tracheal extubation is nearing.
      Fifty medical or surgical ICU patients requiring sedation with existing benzodiazepine
      therapy and qualifying for daily awakenings will be randomized in a double-blind manner to
      receive additional midazolam or dexmedetomidine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is unique because midazolam or dexmedetomidine will be added, in a blinded
      fashion, to existing sedation and analgesia in an effort to decrease or possibly discontinue
      these therapies.

      Objectives:

      The objectives of this study are to determine if transitioning conventional sedation to
      dexmedetomidine safely facilitates tracheal extubation after study initiation; alters the
      amounts of sedative and analgesic agents required after study initiation; influences the
      levels of sedation and analgesia; alters the adverse event profile (neurologic, hemodynamic,
      or gastrointestinal) during and after discontinuing sedation; and impacts the total cost of
      sedation during and after discontinuing sedation.

      Hypothesis 1: Transitioning conventional sedation to dexmedetomidine expedites tracheal
      extubation to shorten ventilator time.

      Specific Aim 1: Comparatively determine the time from study initiation to tracheal extubation
      with midazolam and dexmedetomidine when the practice of daily awakenings is used.

      Hypothesis 2: Transitioning conventional sedation to dexmedetomidine reduces the doses of
      conventional sedatives and analgesics while maintaining equivalent levels of sedation and
      analgesia and not incurring adverse events.

      Specific Aim 2a: Comparatively determine the hourly, daily, and cumulative doses of
      conventional sedatives and analgesics from study initiation to sedation discontinuation with
      midazolam and dexmedetomidine when the practice of daily awakenings is used.

      Specific Aim 2b: Comparatively evaluate the quality of sedation and analgesia of midazolam
      and dexmedetomidine by determining the proportion of Riker sedation scores at 3 - 4 (desired
      level of sedation) and ≤ 2 or ≥ 5 (undesired levels of sedation) and the proportion of Pain
      Assessment Behavioral Scores (PABS) ≤ 3 (comfortable) and ≥ 4 (pain).

      Specific Aim 2c: Comparatively evaluate sedation-related adverse effects (neurologic,
      hemodynamic, or gastrointestinal) of midazolam and dexmedetomidine when the practice of daily
      awakenings is used.

      Hypothesis 3: Transitioning conventional sedation to dexmedetomidine increases the cost of
      administering sedation but minimizes the incidental costs associated with sedation to
      counterbalance and possibly reduce the total cost of sedation (sum of administration costs
      and incidental costs).

      Specific Aim 3a: Comparatively determine the hourly, daily, and cumulative administration
      costs of midazolam and dexmedetomidine when the practice of daily awakenings is used.

      Specific Aim 3b: Comparatively determine the hourly, daily, and cumulative incidental costs
      of conventional sedatives and dexmedetomidine; including neurologic dysfunction,
      antipsychotic requirements, cardiovascular dysfunction, constipation or ileus, differences in
      times to ventilator discontinuation, personnel time, and patient transfer from the ICU after
      sedation discontinuation.

    <time_frame>Duration of ICU stay, for up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Riker sedation-agitation score (range 1-7) and PABS (range 0-10) are assessed hourly by the bedside nurse. Riker scores assess restlessness and cooperation. Riker scores of 5 - 7 indicate agitation, 3 - 4 represent adequate sedation and 1 - 2 represent excessive sedation. PABS assessments include domains of restlessness, muscle tone, vocalization, consolability, and facial expressions. PABS assessments of 0 represent no pain, 1 - 3 represent mild pain, 4 - 6 represent moderate pain, and ≥ 7 represent severe pain.</description>

    <measure>ICU Experiences by Administering ICU Stressful Experiences Questionnaire (ICU-SEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of hospital stay, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ICU-SEQ assesses patient recall of their ICU experience. The ICU-SEQ assesses both psychological (e.g. fearfulness, anxiety) and physical (e.g. pain, difficulty breathing) perceptions of ICU patients who have received mechanical ventilation. It consists of 29 potentially stressful experiences with seven items specifically addressing the endotracheal tube. The extent that patients are bothered by each item is scored on a five point scale: 0 = &quot;not at all,&quot; 1 = &quot;a little bit,&quot; 2 = &quot;moderately,&quot; 3 = &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and 4 = &quot;extremely.&quot; The cumulative score is an integer interpreted as interval data with higher scores indicating greater stressful experiences associated with the ICU. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score possible is 116.</description>

    <time_frame>Duration of hospital stay, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IES-R evaluates subjective distress caused by traumatic events and assesses manifestations of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or acute stress disorder. It is not diagnostic but possesses excellent reliability and validity for manifestations of PTSD. The IES-R has three subscales (eight items on intrusion, eight items on avoidance, and six items on hyperarousal). Each item is scored on a four point scale: 0 = &quot;not at all,&quot; 1 = &quot;a little bit,&quot; 2 = &quot;moderately often,&quot; 3 = &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and 4 = &quot;extremely often.&quot; The total score of each subscale may be averaged and a cumulative score of 30 is indicative of the presence of PTSD. The maximum score for each subscale is 32 for intrusion, 32 for avoidance, and 24 for hyperarousal. The minimum cumulative score is 0 and the maximum cumulative score possible is 88.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of hospital stay, up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS consists of 14 questions, seven for anxiety and seven for depression. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with a cut-off cumulative score of 11 for both subscales indicative of anxiety or depression. This scoring tool has been used for 30 years, possesses excellent reliability and validity, and avoids reliance conditions that are also common somatic symptoms of illness such fatigue, insomnia, and hypersomnia. The maximum score for each subscale is 21 with a maximum possible cumulative score of 42. The minimum score for each subscale is 0. The minimum cumulative score is 0</description>

          <title>Acute Physiologic And Chronic Health Evaluation III Score</title>
          <description>APACHE III measures the severity of disease for adult patients admitted to intensive care units. The point score is calculated as a summation from scores assigned to a patient's age, primary comorbidity, preexisting comorbidities, location prior to ICU admission, Glasgow Coma Scale, and 20 routine physiological measurements. APACHE III scores range from 0 to 299. This provides an initial risk classification of severely ill hospitalized patients in defined groups with higher scores indicating greater disease severity and correlated to higher mortality risk.</description>

        <title>The Quality of Sedation (Assessed by the Riker Sedation-Agitation Score) and Analgesia (Assessed by the Pain Assessment Behavioral Score)</title>
        <description>The Riker sedation-agitation score (range 1-7) and PABS (range 0-10) are assessed hourly by the bedside nurse. Riker scores assess restlessness and cooperation. Riker scores of 5 – 7 indicate agitation, 3 - 4 represent adequate sedation and 1 - 2 represent excessive sedation. PABS assessments include domains of restlessness, muscle tone, vocalization, consolability, and facial expressions. PABS assessments of 0 represent no pain, 1 - 3 represent mild pain, 4 - 6 represent moderate pain, and ≥ 7 represent severe pain.</description>

        <title>ICU Experiences by Administering ICU Stressful Experiences Questionnaire (ICU-SEQ)</title>
        <description>The ICU-SEQ assesses patient recall of their ICU experience. The ICU-SEQ assesses both psychological (e.g. fearfulness, anxiety) and physical (e.g. pain, difficulty breathing) perceptions of ICU patients who have received mechanical ventilation. It consists of 29 potentially stressful experiences with seven items specifically addressing the endotracheal tube. The extent that patients are bothered by each item is scored on a five point scale: 0 = “not at all,” 1 = “a little bit,” 2 = “moderately,” 3 = “quite a bit,” and 4 = “extremely.” The cumulative score is an integer interpreted as interval data with higher scores indicating greater stressful experiences associated with the ICU. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score possible is 116.</description>

        <population>Only subjects capable of performing the ICU-SEQ were provided the assessment. Seven subjects were excluded.</population>

        <title>Manifestations of Acute Stress Disorder by Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R)</title>
        <description>The IES-R evaluates subjective distress caused by traumatic events and assesses manifestations of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or acute stress disorder. It is not diagnostic but possesses excellent reliability and validity for manifestations of PTSD. The IES-R has three subscales (eight items on intrusion, eight items on avoidance, and six items on hyperarousal). Each item is scored on a four point scale: 0 = “not at all,” 1 = “a little bit,” 2 = “moderately often,” 3 = “quite a bit,” and 4 = “extremely often.” The total score of each subscale may be averaged and a cumulative score of 30 is indicative of the presence of PTSD. The maximum score for each subscale is 32 for intrusion, 32 for avoidance, and 24 for hyperarousal. The minimum cumulative score is 0 and the maximum cumulative score possible is 88.</description>
