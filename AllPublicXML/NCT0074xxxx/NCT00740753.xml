  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fewer than 15% of hepatoma patients are suitable candidates for surgical removal of their
      cancer. The purpose of this protocol is to provide supervised access at Oregon Health and
      Science University to Y-90 treatment to provide these patients access to an alternate
      therapy. The radioactive beads are placed directly near or into the liver tumor with the
      intention of destroying the tumor cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive Y-90 (yttrium) glass microspheres via percutaneous hepatic arterial
      infusion. Patients amy be retreated between 30-90 days after initial infusion. After
      completion of therapy, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
