      The study consists of two phases: The first portion of the study is a Phase 1 dose escalation
      study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the dose limiting toxicities of SB1518 when
      given as a single agent orally once daily in subjects with Chronic Idiopathic Myelofibrosis
      (CIMF) regardless of their JAK2 mutational status. The second portion of the study is a Phase
      2 study to define the efficacy and safety profile of single agent SB1518 at the recommended
      dose in subjects with CIMF.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Men of reproductive potential who can agree to practice effective contraception during
             the entire study period and for one month after the last study treatment

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days
             prior to the first dose of study drug and can agree to practice effective
             contraception during the entire study period and for one month after the last study
             treatment, unless documentation of infertility exists

          -  Subjects who are able to understand and willing to sign the informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria

             ongoing active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements as judged by treating physician. Subjects
             receiving antibiotics for infections that are under control may be included in the
             study unless the antibiotic is a CYP3A4 inducer/inhibitor
