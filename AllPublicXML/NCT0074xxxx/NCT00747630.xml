      Evaluating the efficacy of a video about FAS to determine whether it has an impact on
      knowledge about FAS and their likelihood to participate in risk taking behavior.

    <textblock>
      Teenage mothers are asked to participate in the study and then randomized into an
      intervention or control group. Both groups take a multiple choice survey and then are
      randomized to either watch a video about FAS or not. After the video (or not for the
      controls) they then take a post video short answer survey. The survey results are then scored
      and statistical analysis performed to determine whether the video intervention increased
      their knowledge about FAS and their likelihood to drink alcohol during pregnancy.
