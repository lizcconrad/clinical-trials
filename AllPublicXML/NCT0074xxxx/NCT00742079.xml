  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether pretreatment with D-cycloserine before cognitive behavioral
      therapy can reduce impairments still present in people with stable cases of schizophrenia as
      well as determine which traits make schizophrenics most likely to respond to D-cycloserine
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a debilitating chronic condition that affects approximately 1 % of
      Americans, who experience symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorders of
      thought and movement. These symptoms are described as positive symptoms, because they are
      experienced in addition to what healthy individuals experience. Negative symptoms, which are
      reductions in normal functioning, and cognitive deficits, which are problems in thinking,
      also plague people with schizophrenia. The negative symptoms and cognitive deficits
      associated with schizophrenia are produced in otherwise healthy people by neurotransmitters
      inhibiting the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA receptors in the brain. This
      inhibition of NMDA receptors also causes intensification of psychotic symptoms in otherwise
      stabilized schizophrenic patients. The drug D-cycloserine partially excites NMDA receptors,
      and it has been used to help patients with anxiety disorders to overcome phobias while they
      are receiving cognitive behavioral therapy. This study will examine whether D-cycloserine can
      increase the cognitive flexibility of someone undergoing CBT and thereby enhance the
      therapy's ability to reduce a patient's belief in paranoid delusions, preoccupation with
      delusions, and related distress.

      All participants will be screened to ensure proper diagnosis of schizophrenia without other
      conditions. Those who pass will be randomly assigned to receive either D-cycloserine first or
      a placebo pill first. One week after the screening, participants in the D-cycloserine group
      will be given the drug before a 1-hour session of simulated CBT treatment. Those in the
      placebo condition will receive a placebo pill before an identical session. Two weeks after
      the screening, both groups will be called back for another session of CBT, but the pills they
      receive will be switched. Those who received D-cycloserine the first week will receive
      placebo, and those who received placebo will receive D-cycloserine. The CBT sessions will
      attempt to increase cognitive flexibility in patients by asking them to provide alternate
      explanations for common situations. At screening, at the start of visits on the first and
      second weeks, and at a follow-up visit on the third week, participants will undergo a series
      of assessments, including interviews, computerized tests, and self-report measures. Belief
      in, preoccupation with, and distress caused by delusions, as well as degree of cognitive
      flexibility, will be assessed.

    <measure>Change in Alternative Beliefs Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Number of alternative beliefs generated on the Alternative Beliefs Assessment. This assessment used nine vignettes describing social interactions: three of neutral content, three negatively-valanced, and three tailored to the patient's specific delusions. Participants were asked to generate as many explanations (alternative beliefs) as they could for each scenario, and the number of explanations produced in response to each item was recorded. Scores could range from 0 to as many explanations a person could produce (no maximum value). The total score was calculated by adding all alternative beliefs generated from each vignette. A higher number of alternative beliefs generated reflects a greater degree of cognitive flexibility.</description>

    <measure>Change in Psychotic Rating Scales (PSYRATS) Delusion Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Delusions subscale is a 6 item clinician administered scale, with Likert items 0-4 and range is 0-24. Higher scores represent worse outcomes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The BCIS is a 15-item self-report scale with Likert items 0-3. It consists of a composite score, where higher scores represent better outcomes, and there are 2 subscales: 1) Self-Reflectiveness (higher scores represent better outcomes) and 2) Self-Certainty (higher scores represent worse outcomes). The total score for each scale is the sum of the item scores that comprise it (see below). The BCIS composite index is calculated as self-reflectiveness minus self-certainty.
Step 1. Score every item on the BCIS from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;3&quot; according to the following rule:
&quot;Do Not Agree at All&quot; = 0, &quot;Agree Slightly&quot; = 1, &quot;Agree a Lot&quot; = 2, &quot;Agree Completely&quot; = 3 Step 2. Calculate self-reflectiveness subscale: sum items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 15.
Step 3. Calculate self-certainty subscale: sum items 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 13. Step 4. Calculate BCIS composite index: self-reflectiveness minus self-certainty.</description>

    <measure>Change in Bead Task Score Measuring Probabilistic Reasoning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The Bead task is a reasoning task, where the number of beads guessed is the numeric value represented in the data. The lower end range is 1, and there is no upper range limit. Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Maudsley Assessment of Delusions Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is a one-question item added on to the Bead Task. The one item asks for a certainty rating, from 1-3. Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change in Alternative Beliefs Assessment</title>
        <description>Number of alternative beliefs generated on the Alternative Beliefs Assessment. This assessment used nine vignettes describing social interactions: three of neutral content, three negatively-valanced, and three tailored to the patient's specific delusions. Participants were asked to generate as many explanations (alternative beliefs) as they could for each scenario, and the number of explanations produced in response to each item was recorded. Scores could range from 0 to as many explanations a person could produce (no maximum value). The total score was calculated by adding all alternative beliefs generated from each vignette. A higher number of alternative beliefs generated reflects a greater degree of cognitive flexibility.</description>

        <title>Change in Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS)</title>
        <description>The BCIS is a 15-item self-report scale with Likert items 0-3. It consists of a composite score, where higher scores represent better outcomes, and there are 2 subscales: 1) Self-Reflectiveness (higher scores represent better outcomes) and 2) Self-Certainty (higher scores represent worse outcomes). The total score for each scale is the sum of the item scores that comprise it (see below). The BCIS composite index is calculated as self-reflectiveness minus self-certainty.
Step 1. Score every item on the BCIS from “0” to “3” according to the following rule:
“Do Not Agree at All” = 0, “Agree Slightly” = 1, “Agree a Lot” = 2, “Agree Completely” = 3 Step 2. Calculate self-reflectiveness subscale: sum items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, and 15.
Step 3. Calculate self-certainty subscale: sum items 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 13. Step 4. Calculate BCIS composite index: self-reflectiveness minus self-certainty.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The cross-over design of this study produced results that are difficult to interpret due to a significant order effect. Larger and longer trials are needed to assess whether this treatment may benefit patients with medication resistant delusions.</limitations_and_caveats>
