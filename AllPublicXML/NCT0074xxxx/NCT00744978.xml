    <textblock>
      1. Assess the efficacy of varenicline, relative to placebo, on a performance based measure
           of cognition in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease

        2. Evaluate the effects of varenicline on clinically relevant measures including attention
           and executive function, behavior, and clinician rated global change.

        3. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of varenicline, relative to placebo, in patients
           with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease

        4. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of varenicline in patients with mild to moderate
           Alzheimer's disease.
