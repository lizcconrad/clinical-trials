  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) training has been shown to be beneficial to the cardiopulmonary
      function of the subject, TCC might have a beneficial effect on the pulmonary function,
      autonomic nervous modulation, lipid profile, and cytokines production in the aged subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) is a traditional Oriental conditioning exercise or calisthenics that is
      believed by many people around the world to be good for the health. The frequently claimed
      reason for this merit of TCC is that it can improve the cardiopulmonary function and immunity
      of the subject who practice it continuously. TCC has been shown to delay the decline of
      aerobic power, improve the cardiopulmonary function, balance and strength of the subjects.
      One study has demonstrated that TCC could reduce tension, anxiety, and mood disturbance.
      However, few studies have examined the effect of TCC on the blood lipid profile and immunity
      of the TCC practitioners. Another study reported that 12-week programme of regular TCC
      exercise enhanced functional mobility, personal health expectations, and regulatory T cell
      function. It has also been shown that an appropriate combination of TCC exercise program with
      diabetic medication might improve both glucose metabolism and immunity in type 2 diabetic
      patients. Since TCC training has been shown to be beneficial to the cardiopulmonary function
      of the subject, TCC may also have an effect on the blood lipid profile and immunity of the
      subjects. We hypothesize that TCC might have a beneficial effect on the pulmonary function,
      autonomic nervous modulation, lipid profile, and cytokines production in the aged subjects.
      Thus, the aim of this study was to examine whether or not TCC have these effects in the aged
      subjects.

      Blood sample obtained from each subject was withdrawn for the quantitative measurements of
      total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein--cholesterol (HDL-C), high-density
      lipoprotein--cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and uric acid
      (UA). The immunoenzymometric assays for the quantitative measurement of tumor necrosis
      factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in the serum were also performed on the blood
      sample from each subject.
