  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study is to evaluate dose response relationship, efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of target doses of GSK1838262 compared to placebo in the prophylactic treatment
      of migraine headache. Once subjects complete the baseline and meet the randomization
      criteria, they will complete a 5-wk flexible titration period and then enter the 12 week
      maintenance period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPX111381 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      flexible-dose evaluation of GSK1838262 1200 mg/day, 1800 mg/day, 2400 mg/day and 3000 mg/day
      compared with placebo in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache.

      Subjects 18 years of age must have experienced at least three migraine headache attacks (with
      or without aura according to 2004 International Headache Society [IHS] criteria 1.1 and
      1.2.1) per month during the 3 months prior to screening and at least four migraine headache
      days but less than 15 total headache days (migraine or non-migraine) per month during the 3
      months prior to screening and must maintain this requirement throughout the last 4 weeks of
      the baseline period. Approximately 528 subjects from approximately 53 centers in North
      America will be randomized in a 2:1:2:2:1 ratio to the following treatment groups: placebo,
      GSK1838262 1200 mg/day, 1800 mg/day, 2400 mg/day and 3000 mg/day. Investigational product
      will be administered twice daily (morning and evening) with food (e.g., meal or snack).

      The study will consist of six study periods for a total study duration of up to 30 weeks:
      Screening (2 weeks), baseline (including randomization, 6 weeks), flexible titration (5
      weeks), maintenance (12 weeks), taper (3 weeks) and post-treatment (2 weeks). The flexible
      titration administration of investigational product is designed to allow subjects to reach
      the target dose for maintenance treatment or, if unable to reach this target dose, to achieve
      a maximum tolerated dose for maintenance treatment. Subjects will have the opportunity to
      undergo a single dose (600 mg/day) downward adjustment during the flexible titration period
      if intolerability at the current dose occurs. Subsequently, if a single dose downward
      adjustment has occurred, no further dose adjustments in the study (upward or downward) will
      be permitted.

    <description>Productivity, as measured by LTE, is a metric used to assess productivity loss in migraine. It is a composite measure of presenteeism (continued to work while under the influence of migraine symptoms) and absenteeism (time missed from work due to migraine), and can be applied to productivity for work and non-work activities. Productivity data were collected via an e-diary, and productivity measures were summarized for each study phase by averaging each measure across migraine attacks for each participant.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in the Number of Migraine Headache Days (MHD) During the Last 4 Weeks of Treatment Prior to Taper</title>
        <description>A migraine headache day is defined as a calendar day with any occurrence of migraine headache pain of at least 30 minutes in duration. Change from baseline was calculated as the mean number of MHD over the last 4 weeks of treatment prior to taper minus the number at baseline using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). The last 4-week treatment phase is based on the last 4 weeks prior to taper for each participant.</description>

        <description>The MSQ is a 14-item health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire. Participants provide responses using a 6-point Likert scale (1=None of the time, 2= A little bit of the time, 3=Some of the time, 4=A good bit of the time, 5=Most of the time, 6=All of the time) that are then recoded with a final item value where 1=6, 2=5, 3=4, 4=3, 5=2, and 6=1. The scale measures 3 independently scored dimensions (Role Function Restrictive, Role Function, Preventive, and Emotional Function) of HRQOL that are affected by migraine. For each dimension, a higher score indicates a better health status.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) Total Scores at Week 17</title>
          <description>The HIT is a 6-item, self-administered HRQOL questionnaire used to measure six areas that impact headaches have on participants' ability to function on the job, at school, at home, and in social situations. Participants provide responses to questions using a 5-point Likert-type scale. All item values range from 6 to13.The total scores range from 36 to 78, where higher scores indicate greater impact on a participant's life.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Productivity as Measured by Lost Time Equivalents (LTE) - (Work Activities, Non-work Activities, and Combination of Work and Non-work Activities)</title>
        <description>Productivity, as measured by LTE, is a metric used to assess productivity loss in migraine. It is a composite measure of presenteeism (continued to work while under the influence of migraine symptoms) and absenteeism (time missed from work due to migraine), and can be applied to productivity for work and non-work activities. Productivity data were collected via an e-diary, and productivity measures were summarized for each study phase by averaging each measure across migraine attacks for each participant.</description>
