  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation can reduce patient pain and
      abdominal discomfort during and after colonoscopy. Its safety and efficacy during colonoscopy
      even under sedation has been already assessed in some earlier trials. Air insufflation is
      still the standard method, however, because of a lack of suitable equipment and continued
      technical improvement in colonoscopy.

      In laparoscopic surgery, CO2 insufflation is widely applied and safely used with the patient
      under general anesthesia. CO2 insufflation is also applied for CT colonography for reduction
      of discomfort during or after procedure.2 During endoscopic procedure for colorectal
      neoplasia resection, however, long procedural time may increase not only the degree of
      discomfort during and after the procedure but also the risk of perforation. In addition to
      laparoscopic surgery, CO2 insufflation has also been applied to other endoscopic procedures.
      Saito et al reported the application of CO2 insufflation in Endoscopic submucosal dissection
      (ESD) of colorectal neoplasia in a prospective study in which their average procedural time
      using CO2 insufflation was 90 minutes under conscious sedation with average of 5.6 mg of
      midazolam. When compared with control group using room air, statistically negligible
      difference of pCO2 was observed with significant difference in abdominal discomfort.6
      Screening colonoscopy, which can be completed within 15 minutes if no lesion being detected,
      requires high screenee satisfaction so as to improve patient compliance. In the setting of
      colonoscopy after positive FOBT, the attendance rate for secondary colonoscopy was around 60
      to 70 % according to the data demonstrated in previous RCT and population-based studies. With
      application of CO2 insufflation, further improvement of patient compliance can be
      anticipated.

      This study aims to investigate whether use of CO2 insufflations can reduce examinee
      discomfort in comparison with air.

      -  Setting: Screening colonoscopy or secondary colonoscopy after positive FOBT performed in
           endoscopic unit of a single university hospital

        -  Study design: Single blinded randomized trial

        -  Randomization process: sealed envelope

        -  Study subjects:

      Inclusion criteria: Subjects who receive Screening colonoscopy or secondary colonoscopy
      Exclusion criteria: subjects who have COPD or cardiovascular diseases

        -  Study duration: June 2008 to November 2012

        -  Post-colonoscopy discomfort will be measured and obtained from the screenee at several
           time points using visual analogue pain scoring system:

             -  Immediately after colonoscopy for non-sedated patients, immediately after awaken
                from sedation for sedated patients

             -  2 hrs after colonoscopy

             -  8-12 hours after colonoscopy

        -  Statistical analysis:

             -  Sample size estimation: according to our previous unpublished data using air
                insufflations at colonoscopy, mean pain score was 3 and standard deviation was
                2.38. Assuming 15% difference of discomfort, sample size up to 171 are required for
                each group (CO2 vs. air, sedated and non-sedated) in this study. (2 sided test,
                Î±=0.05, power=80%)

             -  Student t-test for pain score comparison

             -  Ancillary analysis: pCO2, sedation drug dosage, and procedural time in both groups.
                For TCCO2 comparison, ANOVA for repeated measurement will be used. For variables
                not normally distributed, Wilcoxon rank sum test wall be used as a supplementary
                analysis.

             -  SAS statistical program, version 9.0 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC) will be used
                for all statistical analysis
