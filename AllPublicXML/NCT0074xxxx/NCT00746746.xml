  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of giving subjects with advanced,
      recurrent or refractory melanoma the HyperAcute® Melanoma vaccine with a variant of a drug,
      called Interferon (PEG-Intron®) that is specially formulated to be given on a weekly basis
      (instead of daily). The study vaccine (HyperAcute®-Melanoma) is made from three types of
      human melanoma cell lines (grown in the laboratory) in which the genes have been slightly
      changed. This clinical study will try to discover the safety of the study vaccine combined
      with PEG-Intron®, its side effects and the potential benefits, if any.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the anti-tumor vaccine effect, side effects and toxicity of the
      HyperAcute® Vaccine with PEG-Intron®. It is hoped that the immune system's response to these
      genetically engineered melanoma cells and PEG-Intron® will cause a reaction that will make it
      react to and attack and kill the melanoma cells and keep it from growing, possibly causing
      the tumors to shrink.

      Patients that are eligible are 19 years or older and have been diagnosed with advanced,
      treatment resistant or recurrent melanoma, an aggressive usually pigmented form of skin
      cancer.
