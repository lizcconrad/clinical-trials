      To investigate long-term treatment outcomes of patients receiving botulinum toxin A therapy
      for infantile and acquired esotropia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: 164 patients with infantile esotropia and 89 patients with acquired esotropia.

      Methods: Patients were injected with botulinum toxin into two medial rectus muscles and
      followed from 1992 to 2005. Patients were evaluated at 1 week, 2, 6 and 12 months, and then
      yearly post-injection.

      Main Outcome Measures: Degree of motor alignment, recurrence rate, incidence of stereopsis,
      and dissociated vertical deviation along with complications.
