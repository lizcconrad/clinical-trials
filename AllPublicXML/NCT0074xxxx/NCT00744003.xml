  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma continues to be the major killer of young Americans, mainly due to hemorrhage or brain
      injury. In trauma centers, up to a quarter of these severely injured patients arrive with a
      coagulopathy and thereby experience an increased risk of death, despite the current standard
      of medical and surgical management. The PI for this grant proposal is a fellowship-trained
      trauma surgeon who works full-time at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH), the only Level I Trauma
      Center in Atlanta. It is only one of four Level 1 trauma centers for the entire state of
      Georgia. This research is a direct extension of the retrospective research the PI has
      previously published. Her retrospective research discovered a previously undescribed form of
      coagulopathy, early trauma induced coagulopathy (ETIC), which cannot be explained by present
      paradigms. Two civilian trauma articles as well as military data from the Iraq war have
      substantiated the occurrence of ETIC, but no prospective literature has defined it or its
      kinetics. More importantly, the results from these studies represent a new paradigm shift, in
      which ETIC appears to be a primary dysfunction which is independently associated with death.
      Therefore, its early identification and correction is crucial for our mechanistic
      understanding, and ultimately, our choice of interventions and improved survival. GMH is a
      high-volume trauma center that sees patients with a variety of injury mechanisms, and,
      therefore, is the perfect setting to confirm ETIC. First, the project will confirm the
      prevalence of ETIC with an observational prospective cohort of injured patients. Data on the
      coagulation system and risk factors, both known and suspected, of all patients will be
      collected upon patient arrival as well as patient outcome with all identifying information
      protected. This is the first prospective research project that will allow simultaneous
      control of confounders associated with outcome and thereby scientifically validate the
      occurrence of ETIC. One unique component of our data collection is a focus on the timing of
      events as they relate to the development and consequences of coagulopathy, to account for the
      dynamic process. At the completion of data collection, a matched cohort of ETIC and non-ETIC
      blood samples will be tested for coagulation factors to provide insight into ETIC's
      pathophysiology. In the short term, our conclusions will assist us in our approach to
      resuscitation of the bleeding trauma patient as some trauma centers have already started to
      change protocols based on our present incomplete understanding of trauma-induced
      coagulopathy. In addition, the coagulation system data collected in this study will lead to
      pathophysiological answers and to more refined hypotheses for future research at a
      coagulation system level. Ultimately an understanding of ETIC will lead to a more effective,
      tailored treatment. Our main study hypothesis is that post-trauma coagulopathy is a primary
      dysfunction that occurs early after a traumatic event in up to 25% of all trauma patients
      triaged to Trauma Center care.

        Trauma patients arriving at a Level I trauma center who activated the Trauma Team criteria

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt; 17 years of age

          2. GMH Emergency Care Center (ECC) admission with trauma team activation - referred to by
             GMH nomenclature as a &quot;STAT-pack.&quot; Trauma team activation criteria were developed from
             standard criteria published by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma
             and published in Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient manual 2006 edition
             and modified for GMH use. A trauma patient is declared a STAT-pack if they meet one of
             the following criteria:

               -  Ejection from a motor vehicle or motorcycle

               -  Extremes of age: pediatric &lt; 6 years of age or an adult &gt; 65 yrs of age

               -  One of the following: HR &gt; 120; RR &gt; 30; Systolic BP &lt; 100; GCS &lt; 13; Basal
                  temperature &lt; 35 degrees C

               -  Penetrating trauma to head/neck/thorax/abdomen including flank and
                  back/antecubital fossa/groins/popliteal space

               -  Suspected neurological injury i.e. spinal cord injury

               -  Traumatic amputation above the wrist or ankle

               -  Mangled or crush to an extremity

               -  History of trauma in a patient who is combative, has deteriorating vital signs or
                  is hemorrhaging from an open wound

               -  Physician or EMS discretion

          3. Patients admitted to GMH ECC directly from the site of injury

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. &lt; 18 years of age

          2. Any patient who is pronounced dead by health care personnel prior to any blood
             sampling

          3. Any patient who arrives undergoing CPR and is pronounced dead without resumption of
             vital signs

          4. Transfers from other health care facilities

          6. Any patient with a known predisposing history of a coagulation or platelet defect
