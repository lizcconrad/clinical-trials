      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide, together
      with antithymocyte globulin before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of
      cancer and abnormal cells. Giving chemotherapy before or after transplant also stops the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer and abnormal cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate
      mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well stem cell transplant works in treating
      patients with hematological cancer or other disorders.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the incidence of graft acceptance in patients with hematological disorders
           treated with combined immunosuppression before and after HLA-haploidentical
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -6 to
           -1, busulfan IV on days -6 to -5, and anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -4 to -1.

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo transplantation of donor hematopoietic stem cells on
           day 0. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 3 and filgrastim (G-CSF)
           beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Immunosuppression: Patients receive cyclosporine IV beginning on day -2 and continuing
           for 6 months and mycophenolate mofetil 4 times a day on days 4-84.
