  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single dose study for patients 18 years of age or older with confirmed
      metastatic melanoma. Up to 12 patients will be enrolled and all will receive an injection of
      approximately 4.0 to 6.0 mCi (148-222 MBq) of 131-I-MIP-1145 administered via IV injection.
      The study will consist of a single dosing day followed by a 7-day assessment period and
      21-day follow-up period. The total duration of the study from screening to final follow-up
      visit is approximately 60 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent and be willing to comply with all protocol

          3. Female patients must meet 1 of the following criteria:

               -  not be of childbearing potential as documented by medical history (e.g., tubal
                  ligation or hysterectomy), or be post menopausal with a minimum 1 year without
                  menses

               -  Have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (BHCG) pregnancy test
                  within 48 hours prior to receiving the test article and agree to use a medically
                  acceptable form of birth control, defined as abstinence or use of an intrauterine
                  device (IUD), oral contraceptive, barrier and spermicide, or hormonal implant
                  throughout the 28 day study period.

          4. Male patients of childbearing potential must agree to use at least one of the
             following medically acceptable forms of birth control throughout the 28 day study
             period; abstinence, barrier or other acceptable, effective contraceptive method.

          5. Historical diagnosis (surgical or histological) of primary melanoma with metastatic
             melanoma confirmed by histology and/or radiologically via MRI/CT.

          6. CT/MRI representing current measurable metastatic lesion (within 6 to 12 weeks of
             entry; at least one lesion &gt; 2cm in the longest dimension)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 18 years of age

          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding

          3. Inadequate venous access (defined as contralateral antecubital or equivalent venous
             access sites which are required for study drug injection and PK blood sampling,
             respectively)

          4. Uncontrolled glaucoma or retinopathy (e.g. macular degeneration) treated in the past
             year

          5. Cataracts or other lens opacities

          6. Any ophthalmologic intervention within the last 30 days (e.g., cataract extraction,
             laser procedure or equivalent, anti-VEGF treatment for macular degeneration. Topical
             treatments including antibiotics for conjunctivitis are allowed.)

          7. Patient received external beam therapy or chemotherapy within the last 30 days

          8. Any history of head and neck radiotherapy

          9. Karnofsky performance status is less than 60 (ECOG status &gt; 2)

             metastatic liver disease are eligible if transaminase elevation is &gt; 5 times the upper
             limit of normal)

         13. Received an investigational compound and/or medical device within 30 days before
             admission into this study

         14. Administered a 99mTc-labeled radioisotope &lt; 3 days prior to imaging or &lt; 7days prior
             to imaging for other diagnostic radioisotopes with half lives greater than 24 hours

         15. Any known allergy or sensitivity to iodine. Iodinated X-ray contrast hypersensitivity
             is not an exclusion.
