  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was intended to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin
      sensitivity and pancreatic islet beta-cell function. Our hypothesis was that vitamin D
      supplementation to normal levels in patients with impaired fasting glucose will result in
      improved insulin sensitivity and improved beta cell function.

      A modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance (mFSIGT) test was used. On day 0,
      baseline 22 time point mFSIGT was performed. Subjects were then treated with cholecalciferol
      (vitamin D3) supplementation - 10,000 IU/day - for 28 consecutive days. mFSIGT was then
      repeated measuring glucose, insulin and c-peptide at all time points. 25-OH vitamin D, PTH,
      and calcium were also measured at time point 0 pre and post vitamin D supplementation. Data
      was analyzed using the Bergman/Boston minimal model for insulin homeostasis with MinMod
      Millennium software.
