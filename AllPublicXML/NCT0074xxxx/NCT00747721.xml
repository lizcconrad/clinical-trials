    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the patient's legal representative according to
             local regulations before starting any study procedures other than pre-screening

          -  Patients sedated and ventilated in ICU for whom sedation is expected to be clinically
             required for at least 24 hours, as determined by the responsible physician

          -  Prescribed light to moderate sedation (target RASS = 0 to -3)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute severe intracranial or spinal neurological disorder due to vascular causes,
             infection, intracranial expansion or injury

          -  Uncompensated acute circulatory failure at screening (severe hypotension with mean
             arterial pressure(MAP) &lt; 55 mmHg despite vasopressor and inotrope therapy)

          -  Heart rate (HR) &lt; 50 beats/min for longer than 5 min between screening and starting
             study treatment

          -  Atrioventricular (AV)-conduction block II-III (unless pacemaker installed)

          -  Severe hepatic impairment (e.g. bilirubin &gt; 101 μmol/L)

          -  Need for continuous muscle relaxation

          -  Any condition which would significantly interfere with the collection of study data

          -  Burn injuries or other conditions requiring regular anesthesia or surgery

          -  Use of centrally acting alpha-2 agonists or antagonists within 24 hours prior to
             starting the study (e.g. dexmedetomidine, clonidine, tizanidine, apraclonidine and
             brimonidine)

          -  Known allergy to dexmedetomidine or any excipients of the study treatment

          -  Patients who have or are expected to have treatment withdrawn or withheld due to poor
             prognosis

          -  Patients receiving sedation for therapeutic indications rather than to tolerate the
             ventilator (e.g. epilepsy)

          -  Patients unlikely to require continuous sedation during mechanical ventilation (e.g.
             Guillain-Barré syndrome)

          -  Patients who are unlikely to be weaned from mechanical ventilation; e.g.
             diseases/injuries primarily affecting the neuromuscular function of the respiratory
             apparatus such as clearly irreversible disease requiring prolonged ventilatory support
             (e.g. high spinal cord injury or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)
