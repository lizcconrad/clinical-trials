      Study purpose: To examine the safety of myocardial regeneration by direct epicardial shock
      wave therapy in combination with coronary artery bypass grafting.

    <textblock>
      Direct epicardial shock wave therapy: DESWT will be performed in adjunct to a standard CABG
      procedure. Prior to aortic cross clamping, DESWT will be performed using a CardioGold® CG050
      (CRT Cardiac Regeneration Technologies, Woodstock, USA / manufactured by MTS-Europe GmbH,
      Konstanz, Germany) shock wave therapy device and a specially designed handheld applicator
      under sterile conditions. Depending on the localisation of the myocardial infarct scar,
      290-310 impulses will be applied to the anterior, lateral, or posterior wall. Shock waves
      will be generated at 1 or 2 Hz in a non ECG triggered fashion, should DESWT result in
      significant ventricular arrhythmias, ECG gating will be initiated. After completion of DESWT,
      CABG will be continued in a regular fashion.
