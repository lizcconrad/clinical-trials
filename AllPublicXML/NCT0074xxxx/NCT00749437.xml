      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Placing gold
      markers in the area where the tumor was removed may help doctors better direct radiation
      therapy and help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well radiation therapy using gold markers works
      in treating women with early-stage breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if the delivery of external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation
           (APBI) based on gold fiducial markers is more accurate when compared to the delivery of
           radiotherapy based on bony anatomy in women with early-stage, node-negative breast
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the migration of fiducial markers during a course of APBI.

        -  To quantify the change in the volume of the seroma (lumpectomy) cavity during a course
           of APBI.

        -  To compare overall operative time for suturing fiducial markers into place vs current
           standard method of placing surgical clips.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo planned lumpectomy with gold fiducial marker placement (if
      procedure not already performed). Patients who meet the post lumpectomy criteria for continue
      treatment in this study proceed to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). Between
      15-80 days after surgery, patients undergo 3-dimensional APBI (may be intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy) using CT-guided planning (with gold fiducial markers placed at lumpectomy) once
      daily, 5 days a week, for 15 days.

      Patients undergo fluoroscopy weekly to determine real-time movement of bony anatomy and
      fiducial markers and cone-beam CT weekly to determine any change in volume of seroma cavity.

        Inclusion criteria:

             meeting all of the following criteria:

               -  AJCC stage 0, I, or II (Tis, T1N0, or T2N0) disease with a lesion ≤ 3 cm treated
                  with lumpectomy and either sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection (if
                  invasive carcinoma is present)

               -  Unifocal breast cancer (i.e., single focus that can be encompassed by one
                  lumpectomy)

          -  Underwent or plan to undergo lumpectomy with placement of gold fiducial markers
             (markers placed concurrently with the surgery or on a later date)

                    -  Must be enrolled between 14-60 days from date of last surgery, and radiation
                       must start within 15-80 days of date of last surgery

                    -  Four to six gold fiducial markers placed in the tumor bed, delineating the
