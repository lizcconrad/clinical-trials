  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is performed to investigate the subcutaneous (s.c.) versus intravenous (i.v.)
      administration of Berinert P in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) to establish a
      second administration mode in cases where i.v. access is not suitable.

      The study is planned as a single centre, randomized, open-label, cross-over pharmacokinetic
      study.

      Subjects will either start with s.c. or i.v. pasteurised C1-Inhibitor concentrate (Berinert
      P) and than switch to the treatment not administered before.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), suffer from recurring and mostly unforeseeable
      attacks of acute oedema of subcutaneous tissues of various organs. The pathophysiological
      correlate of this disease is a deficiency in functionally active C1-Esterase Inhibitor
      (C1-INH). Today, two main types of HAE are described. In HAE type I, an impaired synthesis
      and an elevated turnover of a normal and functional active C1-INH molecule takes place,
      causing reduced amounts in functionally active C1-INH. In HAE type II, normal levels of a
      functionally impaired C1-INH molecule are synthesized. Both defects are inherited as an
      autosomal dominant trait. HAE type III is limited to females and not associated with C1-INH
      deficiency; the pathophysiology of this type remains to be determined. Corticosteroids,
      antihistamines or epinephrine usually do not exert any positive effect in acute attacks
      caused by HAE. This is of particular importance as these types of medication are often used
      in case of oedema in general. In case of acute oedema in patients suffering from HAE, the
      intravenous administration of C1-INH concentrate (e.g., Berinert P) is the treatment of
      choice. The study is performed to investigate the s.c. versus i.v. administration of Berinert
      P in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) to establish a second administration mode in
      cases where i.v. access is not suitable.
