    <textblock>
      Adverse drug events (ADEs) after hospital discharge are common. The purpose of this research
      study is see if we can design an electronic tool given to your primary care provider (PCP)
      that will reduce adverse drug events, hospital readmissions, and emergency department visits
      after you are discharged from the hospital.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to reduce the incidence of post-discharge medication
      discrepancies, preventable and ameliorable ADEs, hospital readmissions, and ED visits through
      the use of HIT. The proposed tool will prompt primary care physicians to perform medication
      reconciliation at the first post-discharge outpatient visit, clearly display and organize
      preadmission and discharge medication regimens, and facilitate the creation of the new
      post-discharge medication list with just a few keystrokes. Using methodologies from prior
      studies at BWH, we will evaluate the intervention in a two-site RCT. The study will be
      conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, taking
      advantage of our rich experience with designing and testing new informatics applications,
      including one for inpatient medication reconciliation.

    <description>The post-discharge medication reconciliation module has the following features:
Presents the (preadmission) ambulatory medication list and the hospital discharge medication list side-by-side, sorted by class, with all identical medications lined up next to each other and all differences in the two regimens highlighted.
Allows users to update the ambulatory medication list with a few keystrokes (i.e., to accept individual changes made during the hospitalization).
Allows reconciliation to be performed in full (e.g., for PCPs who are responsible for the entire medication list) or in part (e.g., for specialists).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients admitted to BWH or MGH who plan to follow up with a PCP in one of 12 primary
             care practices affiliated with BWH or MGH.

          -  Patients will need to meet the following criteria:

               -  1) be 55 years or older,

               -  2) be admitted to the participating delivery system's hospital during the study
                  period for a non-psychiatric condition,

               -  3) have no plans to enter hospice,

               -  4) be discharged back to the community,

               -  5) be prescribed 5 or more medications at discharge, including at least one of
                  the following:

                    -  antibiotics,

                    -  insulin,

                    -  antihypertensives,

                    -  anti-rejection,

                    -  antiarrhythmics,

                    -  inhalers,

                    -  antiepileptics,

                    -  antianginals,

                    -  pain medications,

                    -  oral hypoglycemics,

                    -  steroids,

                    -  anticoagulants.

               -  These drugs were selected because they require close monitoring, increase risk
                  for drug-drug interactions, have a narrow therapeutic window, or are known to
                  increase risk for ADEs in the older adult population

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Unable to provide informed consent and has no proxy who administers patient's medications
        and can provide informed consent
