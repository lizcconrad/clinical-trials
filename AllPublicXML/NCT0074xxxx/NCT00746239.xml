  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost 80% of panic disorder patients report difficulty sleeping. Sleep disturbances in turn
      may exacerbate underlying anxiety/panic attacks. Moreover, individuals with insomnia (sleep
      disturbance) are at higher risk of developing a new anxiety disorder. Therefore it is
      expected that improving sleep quality with medications along with other medications to treat
      anxiety component of panic disorder might be helpful. However, there is lack of
      pharmacological studies examining the effects of improving sleep disturbances with
      medications in panic disorder patients, which is a critical problem for providing optimal
      care to these patients. The objective of this proposal is to determine the effects of
      ramelteon (FDA approved for insomnia) on sleep disturbances in Panic disorder patients who
      are on escitalopram for underlying anxiety.
