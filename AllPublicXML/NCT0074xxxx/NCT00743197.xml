  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard medical therapy versus
      usual care in women with chest pain, coronary endothelial dysfunction and unblocked coronary
      arteries.

      Coronary endothelial dysfunction (CED) is a condition in which the layers of cells around the
      heart do not function properly and is believed to be key factor in the development of
      atherosclerosis (fat deposits in arteries). In addition, CED is associated with an increased
      risk for future cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke.

      A coronary angiogram allows physicians to see if any of the arteries in the heart are
      blocked, usually by fatty plaque. In many instances, angiograms in women experiencing chest
      pain do not show evidence of coronary disease (free of significant plaque build-up).
      Currently, there is no standard of care treatment plan for patients with normal coronary
      arteries, despite symptoms of chest pain, and as a result these patients may not receive
      medical treatment. However, these women often return to their physicians more than once with
      chest pain and go through a similar battery of tests.

    <textblock>
      Endothelial function testing will be performed on women without significant coronary disease
      in order to help identify women who may be likely to develop coronary artery disease (CAD)
      and who would benefit from aggressive lifestyle (dietary counseling, exercise) or medical
      (treatment with aspirin and cholesterol and blood pressure lowering medications)
      interventions.

    <description>no analyses were conducted due to the PI's departure from the institution; all work including analyses ceased upon departure- the study was not transferred with the PI. In addition, the study end points were based on changes between groups (treatment vs. usual care group) at 12 month follow up for both groups - none of the enrolled subjects made it to the final (month 12) visit.</description>

        <title>Effectiveness of Therapy Compared to Usual Care, in Those Women With Chest Pain (CP), Reversible Ischemia by Stress Testing and Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) by Angiography Who Are Found to Have Coronary Endothelial Dysfunction (CED).</title>
        <description>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard medical therapy versus usual care in women with chest pain (CP), coronary endothelial dysfunction (CED) and unblocked coronary arteries. CED is a condition in which the layers of cells around the heart do not function properly and is believed to be a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis (fat deposits in arteries). In addition, CED is associated with an increased risk for suture cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke.</description>

        <population>no analyses were conducted due to PI's departure from institution;all work including analyses ceased upon departure-the study was not transferred with the PI. In addition, study end points were based on changes between groups (treatment vs. usual care)at 12-mo follow up for both groups- none of the enrolled subjects completed the month 12 visit.</population>
