  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, biological activity, and pharmacokinetics of PTH
      delivered by subcutaneous injection compared with an infusion pump. We anticipate pump
      delivery of PTH will be more physiologic because it mimics normal parathyroid gland secretion
      of PTH. We expect that pump delivery will simultaneously normalize blood and urine calcium,
      phosphorus and magnesium levels with minimal or no fluctuations throughout the day. Pump
      therapy will require lower PTH doses and should normalize markers of bone turnover. We expect
      the improved metabolic control during pump therapy will be especially evident in patients
      with more severe forms of hypoparathyrodism where there is an unmet need for improved
      therapy.

      Prior studies (92-CH-0011) have been important in establishing synthetic human parathyroid
      hormone 1-34 (PTH) as a beneficial treatment for hypoparathyroidism, superior to conventional
      therapy with calcium and calcitriol. We are conducting a randomized crossover study comparing
      twice-daily subcutaneous injections vs. PTH pump therapy. We hypothesize that pump delivery
      of PTH 1-34, compared to twice-daily administration, will provide smoother metabolic control
      of serum mineral levels and normalization of urine mineral excretion. The two arms will be
      divided into an inpatient and an outpatient phase. There will be three inpatient admissions,
      baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Subjects will be randomized to either pump therapy or to
      twice daily injections at the beginning of the study and will cross over to the alternate PTH
      delivery system (injections vs. pump) at the conclusion of the initial 3-month treatment
      period.

      Patients between 10 and 70 years of age who have had chronic hypoparathyroidism for at least
      1 year may be eligible for this study. Participants have two 10- 12-day hospital admissions
      and one 5-day admission. The first two inpatient admissions are separated by 3-month
      outpatient periods. Outpatient monitoring will require weekly blood tests and monthly urine
      tests to monitor mineral levels. After third hospital admission, patients will be placed on
      conventional therapy.
