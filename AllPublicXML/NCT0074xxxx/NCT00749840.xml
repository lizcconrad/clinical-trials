  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through a prospective observational cohort study enrolling patients newly diagnosed with
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV):

      Aim 1: Assess attitudes and beliefs about HIV disease and care over time and relate those
      attitudes and beliefs to success in following the Steps of HIV Care.

      Aim 2: Validate a simple visual analogue scale for assessing adherence to highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients newly starting HAART in routine care.

      Aim 3: Implement latent growth curve analysis for modeling changes in attitudes and beliefs
      over time, and for assessing the impact of the components of the Steps of HIV Care model on
      health outcomes.

      The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) dramatically improved the
      survival of patients with HIV in the US. The effectiveness of HAART in routine care is
      determined by the success with which patients are able to follow certain crucial Steps of HIV
      Care. This 'Steps of HIV Care' framework is based on the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention's (CDC's) &quot;Serostatus Approach to Fighting the HIV Epidemic,&quot; which has been
      overlaid with patient and process of care factors. It includes 1) access outpatient care, 2)
      utilize care and treatment services, and 3) adhere to care, including medications and
      appointments.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A new diagnosis of HIV infection, defined as diagnosed with HIV less than 3 months
             before the current diagnosis AND not yet having completed a regularly scheduled
             outpatient primary medical care visit for HIV.

          -  Ability to speak English or Spanish. Ability to provide informed consent (or have a
             representative able to do so). Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Adherence Sub-Study. Persons in the Steps of HIV Care Cohort Study and prescribed
             HAART at either Thomas Street Health Center, the Northwest Health Center, or the
             Michael E. DeBakey VA HIV Clinic. Using or planning on using the Thomas Street Health
             Center, Northwest Health Center or the Michael E. DeBakey VA pharmacy to fill their
             prescriptions for HAART. On HAART for less than 6 months at the time of enrollment
             into the sub-study.

          -  Qualitative Sub-Study Persons in Steps of HIV Care Cohort. Willing and cognitively
             able to complete the interview, in the eyes of the investigator or the research team.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons diagnosed with HIV more than 3 months before the current diagnosis will be
             excluded, as will persons diagnosed with HIV less than 3 months before the current
             diagnosis who have seen an outpatient provider for HIV care at a regularly scheduled
             visit.

          -  Patients with dementia, active psychosis, or other conditions that will not allow them
             to accurately complete the interview will be followed separately from the main cohort,
             provided informed consent can be obtained from their representative.

          -  Since the instruments are interviewer-administered, illiterate patients will not be
             excluded; in that circumstance, the research staff will read the informed consent
             documents to the potential participant.

          -  Patients who speak neither English nor Spanish will be excluded, since the informed
             consent and survey instruments will be available in only those languages. Pregnant
             women will not be excluded, as the study poses no risk to the fetus.

          -  Adherence Sub-Study. As for the Steps of HIV Care Cohort Study. In addition: Patients
             will be excluded if they are not willing to forego use of a pill organizer for the
             medication to be monitored with the computerized caps. Pill organizers for the
             unmonitored medications will be allowed. Patients will be excluded if they are not
             themselves responsible for taking their own medication, i.e., if they are
             institutionalized or incarcerated (though neither Thomas Street Health Center,
             Northwest Health Center, nor the VA HIV Clinic cares for incarcerated person).

          -  Or, if a person other than the patient takes primary responsibility for ensuring
             medication is taken by the patient. We will also exclude patients who cannot agree to
             not pocket doses on a routine basis, that is, remove extra pills from the bottle for
             later ingestion. This behavior will likely be infrequently practiced, since almost all
             HAART regimens currently are once or twice daily rather than thrice daily.
