    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II clinical study. Recurrence after radiotherapy patients who are
      failure of radiotherapy in recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were
      treated by cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil with Sorafenib as first-line treatment. The objective
      response(complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)), Disease Control Rate , safety
      profile, tolerability will be evaluated according to World Health Organization (WHO)
      criteria.
