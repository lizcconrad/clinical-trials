  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The venous thromboembolism is one of the first causes of maternal mortality. Until 2003, only
      a few recommendations were available on the optimal use of antithrombotic therapy as a
      preventive measure against thromboembolism in pregnant women. In this study, we propose :

        1. To gather the experts who took part in the French consensus conference and the local
           experts to create a score in accordance with the national and international consensus
           and to give some precise therapeutic strategies.

        2. To evaluate the discriminant, feasible and useful character of this new score by a
           prospective multicentric study including 2000 pregnant women with a risk of
           thromboembolism or placental vascular pathology who will benefit from therapeutic
           strategies defined by the new score.

      Purpose : To create a score inspired by our first experience i.e. simple, standardized and
      quickly usable in day-to-day practice to individualize antithrombotics prescription to women
      at risk.
