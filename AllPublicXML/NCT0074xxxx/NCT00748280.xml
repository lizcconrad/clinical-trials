  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of pulpotomy treatment (with new
      endodontic bio-materials) as a new treatment with one-visit root canal therapy as reference
      treatment in pain relief and clinical and radiographic success, for irreversible pulpitis of
      human permanent molar teeth.

      In one visit RCT (Arm 1): The teeth were anesthetized, isolated and endodontic access and
      instrumentation of all canals was done. Canal preparation was conducted using a step-back
      technique. The working lengths were determined and confirmed by radiography. Sterile normal
      saline solution was used for intra-canal irrigation. Root canals were obturated with
      gutta-percha and sealer using lateral condensation technique. After placing a cotton pellet
      in the pulp chamber, the access cavity was closed with Cavit.

      In pulpotomy treatment with CEM/MTA (Arm 2): The teeth were anesthetized. Pulpotomy procedure
      of removing inflamed pulp tissue to the stump level was done. Homeostasis was achieved by
      irrigating the cavity with sterile normal saline and application of small pieces of sterile
      cotton pellets. The pulpal wound was covered with an approximately 2-mm-thick layer of
      MTA/CEM cement. Pulp chambers were then covered with a wet cotton pellet and sealed with
      Cavit.

    <description>Teeth were isolated, caries was removed and access cavities were prepared. Canal preparation was conducted using step-back technique. The working lengths were determined and confirmed by radiographs. The minimum size file for preparing the working length was size ISO #25 K-file to within 0.5-2 mm of the radiographic apex of the root. During hand instrumentation, canals were frequently irrigated with adequate amount of sterile normal saline solution. The root canals were filled with multiple gutta-percha cones and sealer using lateral condensation technique. Placing a cotton pellet in the pulp chamber, the access cavity was temporarily filled. The treatments of all samples were performed one-visit.</description>

    <description>Pulpotomy was performed with a large round bur in a high-speed handpiece with copious irrigation; removing inflamed pulp tissue to stump level. Hemostasis was achieved by irrigation of the cavity with sterile normal saline and application of small pieces of sterile cotton pellets. The blood clot-free pulpal wound was covered with approximately 2 mm layer of endodontic bio-materials, a sterile wet cotton pellet was then placed over the MTA/CEM cement and the cavity sealed with Cavit.</description>
