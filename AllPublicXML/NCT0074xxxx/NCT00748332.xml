      Cardiac cachexia, the main feature of undernutrition in chronic heart failure, usually
      defined as a weight loss over 6% over 6 months, is a proven factor of morbidity and mortality
      in this disease. Its pathophysiology is complex, but proinflammatory cytokines seem to play a
      major role. Omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids, present in fish oil, have proven beneficial
      in patients with coronary heart disease, due in part to their effects on membranes but also
      due to their anti-inflammatory effects, with inhibition of TNF-α and interleukins 1 and 6.

      The aim of this phase III randomized controlled double-blinded study is to assess the effects
      of 8 weeks of a omega-3-enriched protein-energy supplement versus an iso-energetic
      iso-nitrogenous supplement free of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiac cachexia. Thirty patients
      will be included in each group. The main judgment criterion will be maximum aerobic capacity
      (VO2 max), which best reflects aerobic capacity that correlates with muscle mass.
      Anthropometric, biological (nutritional, inflammatory and involved in food intake control),
      cardiac (functional) and quality of life will also be studied. All analyses will be performed
      in intention to treat.

      The investigators expect a significantly higher improvement of VO2 max in the omega-3 group.

      This study could lead to therapeutic advances in a frequent and severe disease.

    <textblock>
      Undernutrition is frequent in chronic heart failure (approximately 40%). Cardiac cachexia,
      main feature of this undernutrition, usually defined as a weight loss over 6% over 6 months,
      is a proven factor of morbidity and mortality in this disease. Its pathophysiology is
      complex, but proinflammatory cytokines seem to play a major role, thus appearing close to
      cancer cachexia. A number of treatments have proven to be effective in preventing
      undernutrition in chronic heart failure patients (ß-blockers, ACE inhibitors, diuretics and
      physical training). Omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids, present in fish oil, haven proven
      beneficial in patients with coronary heart disease, due in part to their effects on membranes
      but also due to their anti-inflammatory effects, with inhibition of TNF-α and interleukins 1
      and 6. However, no study to this day has been conducted in human cardiac cachexia.

      The aim of this phase III randomized controlled double-blinded study is to assess the effects
      of 8 weeks of a omega-3-enriched protein-energy supplement versus an iso-energetic
      iso-nitrogenous supplement free of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiac cachexia. Thirty patients
      will be included in each group. The main judgment criterion will be maximum aerobic capacity
      (VO2 max), which best reflects aerobic capacity that correlates with muscle mass.
      Anthropometric, biological (nutritional, inflammatory and involved in food intake control),
      cardiac (functional) and quality of life will also be studied. All analyses will be performed
      in intention to treat.

      We expect a significantly higher improvement of VO2 max in the omega-3 group. This study
      could lead to therapeutic advances in a frequent and severe disease.
