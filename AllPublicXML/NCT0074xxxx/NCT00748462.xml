      -  The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and side effects of a
           fractional CO2 laser for treatment of acne scar in Asians.

        -  Study hypothesis

             1. Reduction in acne scars based on blinded evaluation of before photos and the one
                and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with low
                density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant
                (5%).

             2. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in acne scars based on before
                photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is
                statistically significant (5%)

             3. Reduction in fine lines based on blinded evaluation of before photos and the one
                and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with low
                density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant
                (5%).

             4. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in fine lines based on before
                photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is
                statistically significant (5%).

             5. Reduction in pigmented disorders based on blinded evaluation of before photos and
                the one and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse Juvia with
                low density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically significant
                (5%).

             6. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in pigmented disorders based on
                before photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is
                statistically significant (5%).

             7. Improvements in skin texture and pore size based on blinded evaluation of before
                photos and the one and three month follow-up photos after four full face Ellipse
                Juvia with low density treatments with a fluency of 90-105 mJ/MTZ is statistically
                significant (5%).

             8. The direct clinical blinded evaluated reduction in skin texture and pore size based
                on before photos and the patient in life, by the one and three month follow-up is
                statistically significant (5%).
