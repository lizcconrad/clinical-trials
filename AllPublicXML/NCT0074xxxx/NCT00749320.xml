  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool to track
      tumor growth for renal cell carcinoma while the participant is receiving clinical treatment
      therapy with sunitinib or pazopanib. An MRI is a sophisticated type of scan that uses
      powerful magnets to make clearer images or to focus on detailed medical information in the
      participants abdomen and pelvis. This imaging done for this study will use the ASL MRI
      technique that allows us to see blood flow changes which possibly may indicated tumor growth.

      -  MRI's will be performed at specific time points during the participants treatment for
           renal cell carcinoma with the drug sunitinib or pazopanib. These ASL MRI's will be
           performed at baseline, 2 weeks upon initiation of therapy with sunitinib/pazopanib,
           after cycle 2 and/or cycle 4 of therapy, and at the end of therapy.

        -  The MRI tests for all participants will be done at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
