  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
      MED-EL Electric-Acoustic System (EAS), a medical device that combines the use of a cochlear
      implant with an external electric-acoustic processor designed to provide benefit in speech
      perception and sound quality to individuals with a sensorineural hearing loss with minimal
      changes in residual hearing. The acoustic component of the processor will aid residual
      acoustic hearing in low frequency ranges, while the cochlear implant and electric component
      of the processor will be used to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve across a wide
      range of frequencies necessary for speech perception.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Audiologic tests suggest a moderate sloping to severe/profound sensorineural hearing
             loss in the ear to be implanted. The non-implanted ear may fall outside of these
             criteria; however, threshold levels cannot be better than the indication criteria (for
             example, the non-implanted ear must be 60 dB or poorer at 1000 Hz, 70 dB or poorer at
             2000-8000 Hz).

          -  Pure-tone air-conduction threshold levels for the ear to be implanted shall fall at or
             within the following levels:

             250 Hz - 500 Hz hearing loss less than or equal to 65 dB HL 750 Hz hearing loss less
             than or equal to 75 dB HL 1000-1500 Hz hearing loss less than or equal to 60 dBHL (ie.
             60-110+ dB HL) 2000 Hz - 8000 Hz hearing loss less than or equal to 70 dB HL

          -  Pure-tone air-conduction threshold levels shall fall at or within the levels listed in
             the following chart Frequency (Hz): 250 500 750 1000 1500 2000 4000 8000 Lower Limit:
             10 10 10 60 60 70 70 70 Upper Limit: 65 65 75 *110+ *110+ *110+ *110+ *90+

          -  Pure-tone air-conduction thresholds for both ears are within 20 dB of each other at
             250, 500 and 1000 Hz.

          -  Air-bone gap at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz should be &lt;10 dB at two or more of these
             frequencies.

          -  Minimal benefit from optimally fit hearing aid/s, preferably bilateral, with
             monosyllabic word scores in quiet of ≤50% in the best-aided condition.

          -  Normal middle ear anatomy and function (based on clinical assessment of tympanometry
             and acoustic reflex results). No prior middle ear surgery or history of
             postadolescent, chronic middle ear infections or inner ear disorders (i.e. vertigo or
             Meniere's syndrome).

          -  No evidence that hearing loss origin is retrocochlear.

          -  Current user of bilateral acoustic hearing aids for at least 3 months. Note: If the
             subject has not been a successful hearing aid user (i.e. improper fit, feedback and/or
             discomfort from high frequency amplification), he/she must complete a hearing aid
             trial in the ear to be implanted for at least 1 month. If the ear to be implanted is
             poorer than the contralateral ear, then the subject must complete a hearing aid trial
             in both ears for at least 1 month to ensure that he/she is tested in the best-aided
             condition.

          -  Adults 18-70 years of age at time of implantation.

          -  Persons who currently exhibit sufficient understanding and communicative skills to
             comprehend general conversation in an &quot;oral/aural mode&quot; through normal conversation
             channels.

          -  English as primary language.

          -  Appropriate motivation and expectation levels.

        Expanded Criteria:

        Study Arm 2 candidates are those who meet the inclusion criteria listed above with the
        exception that:

        In the ear to be implanted, the pure-tone air conduction threshold(s) at 250, 500, and/or
        750 Hz will be greater than or equal to 0 dB HL and less than 10 dB HL, and/or In the ear
        to be implanted, the pure-tone air conduction threshold(s) at 1000 and/or 1500 Hz will be
        greater than or equal to 0 dB HL and less than 60 dB HL and/or In their best-aided
        condition, they score 51-60% on monosyllabic word scores.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Conductive, retrocochlear or central auditory disorders.

          -  Hearing loss in the ear to be implanted that has demonstrated a recent fluctuation at
             two or more frequencies of 15 dB in either direction in the last 2 years as
             demonstrated by serial audiograms. Note: In cases where 2-year documentation is
             missing, documentation of at least 18 months is necessary along with patient report of
             no fluctuation in the past 2 years. If 18-month data is unavailable, the patient must
             be monitored until 18-month data is available.

          -  Any physical, psychological, or emotional disorder that would interfere with surgery
             or the ability to perform on test and rehabilitation procedures.

          -  Developmental delays or organic brain dysfunction.

          -  Physical or geographic limitations that may interfere with the completion of scheduled
             follow-up evaluations.

          -  Skin or scalp conditions that could preclude magnetic attachment of the speech
             processor or use of the acoustic hearing aid.

          <description>Originally the study was designed to have two ARMs, but the second study ARM did not fully enroll. At the time of submission, the data for both ARMs was collapsed and data analysis was completed on all subjects as one group. The below inclusion criteria represents both ARMs as one group.
Inclusion Criteria:
Pure-tone air-conduction threshold levels shall fall at or within the levels listed in the following chart.
Frequency (Hz): 250 500 750 1000 1500 2000 4000 8000 Lower Limit: 0 0 0 0 0 70 70 70 Upper Limit: 65 65 75 *110+*110+ *110+ *110+ *90+
Minimal benefit from optimally fit hearing aid/s, preferably bilateral, with monosyllabic word scores in quiet of ≤60% in the best-aided condition.

The percent correct for preoperative hearing aid use was subtracted from the percent correct for CI Alone at 12 months giving an improvement on speech perception for CI Alone compared to preoperative hearing aids.</description>
