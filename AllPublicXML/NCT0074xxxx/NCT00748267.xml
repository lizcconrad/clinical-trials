      RATIONALE: Hypnosis may be effective in reducing pain and other side effects in women
      undergoing surgery for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well hypnosis works in reducing pain and other
      side effects in women undergoing surgery for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To test the feasibility of hypnosis as a pre-operative intervention for the reduction of
           surgical- and anesthesia-related symptoms in women undergoing lumpectomy with sentinel
           node biopsy, mastectomy, or mastectomy with lymph node dissection for locally recurrent
           breast cancer.

        -  To identify the physical symptoms (i.e., pain, nausea, and vomiting) and psychological
           symptoms (i.e., anxiety and distress) of patients undergoing hypnosis.

        -  To determine the length of stay in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit of patients undergoing
           adjunct hypnosis.

        -  To describe patient satisfaction with the hypnosis experience.

        -  To determine the effect size and calculate the sample needed for a randomized clinical
           trial using the results of this study.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a scripted hypnotic intervention over 15 minutes within 1 hour
      prior to their planned surgical procedure. Upon completion of the intervention, patients
      proceed to the Preoperative Holding Area of the Surgery and Post Anesthesia Care Unit where
      they receive the standard of care for lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy, mastectomy, or
      mastectomy with lymph node dissection.

      Patients undergo collection of demographic information (i.e., age; gender; ethnicity;
      marital/partnered status; spiritual practice; family members in the home; stress management
      history; experience with the continuum of imagery/hypnosis practices; perceptions of
      concentration abilities; and favorite aromas, colors, and scenes from nature) at the time of
      consent using the Demographic Survey Questionnaire. They also undergo assessment of physical
      and psychological symptoms (i.e., pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and generalized distress)
      at baseline (immediately prior to hypnotic induction) and after the intervention (prior to
      discharge from the Post Anesthesia Care Unit).
