  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Cobra Cobalt Super Alloy Balloon-Expandable
      Coronary Stent System for the treatment of de novo and restenotic (previously unstented)
      lesions in native coronary arteries in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) having a
      reference vessel diameter (RVD) between 2.5 - 4.0 mm and a lesion length ≤ 26 mm amenable to
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a single stent in subjects with symptomatic
      ischemic heart disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safety and Efficacy will be demonstrated by the rate of Target vessel failure (TVF), defined
      as cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (MI) [Q wave or non-Q wave], or
      clinically driven target vessel revascularization (TVR) by percutaneous or surgical methods
      within 270 days of the post-stent placement procedure.

      Additionally, Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)at 30, 180 and 270 days defined as a
      composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI) (Q wave and non-Q wave), emergent
      bypass surgery, or clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) [percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)]will be documented.
