  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-month, multi-center, prospective, open-label, safety evaluation in PAH subjects
      following transition from a stable dose of inhaled iloprost (Ventavis).

      Subjects are to be evaluated for safety throughout the course of the study while secondary
      assessments will be conducted at Baseline, Week 6, Week 12, and Months 6, 12, 18 and 24
      following initiation of treprostinil sodium.

    <measure>Number of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall safety of transitioning from inhaled iloprost to inhaled treprostinil was assessed by type and frequency of adverse events.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six-minute Walk Distance (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 12. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) was conducted at Baseline (10-30 minutes following the last dose of inhaled iloprost) and at Week 12 (10-60 minutes following the dose of inhaled treprostinil). The change in distance (meters) between Baseline and Week 12 is reported below.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment: Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in CAMPHOR Scores from Baseline to Week 12. The CAMPHOR is a health related quality of life instrument validated for pulmonary hypertension that assesses impairment (symptoms), disability (activities) and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections; Symptoms (Scores 0-25; high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 0-30; low score indicates good functioning)and Quality of Life (0-25; high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (0-80). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire of Medication (TSQM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in TSQM score from Baseline to Week 12. The TSQM is a validated instrument (Health and Quality of Life Outcomes 2004, 2:12) that measures major dimensions of patient satisfaction with medications. The questionnaire is comprised of 15 questions which fall into one of four categories; Effectiveness, Side-Effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. Responses are scaled on a seven point bipolar scale from 'Extremely Satisfied' to 'Extremely Dissatisfied' where higher scores indicate improvements (total scores from 0-100). The questionnaire was completed at Baseline and Week 12. The Baseline questionnaire focused on the subject's satisfaction with inhaled iloprost treatment, while the questionnaire completed at Week 12 focused on the subject's satisfaction with inhaled treprostinil.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient impression of change (PIC) was three single therapy-related questions related to the subjects overall impression of the transition from inhaled iloprost to inhaled treprostinil. Subjects were surveyed related to their overall impression of the transition from inhaled iloprost to inhaled treprostinil at Week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>N-terminal Prohormone of Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in NTpro-BNP from Baseline to Week 12. Blood samples were collected for plasma NTpro-BNP analysis during the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Class</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in WHO Functional Class (FC) from Baseline to Week 12. Data presented as percent of subjects who either improved FC, worsened FC, or had no change in FC from Baseline to Week 12.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Administration Activities Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in tasks from Baseline to Week 12. At Baseline and Week 12, subjects provided information related to the daily administration and time requirements of inhaled iloprost (Baseline) and inhaled treprostinil (Week 12).</description>

        <description>Change in CAMPHOR Scores from Baseline to Week 12. The CAMPHOR is a health related quality of life instrument validated for pulmonary hypertension that assesses impairment (symptoms), disability (activities) and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections; Symptoms (Scores 0-25; high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 0-30; low score indicates good functioning)and Quality of Life (0-25; high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (0-80). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>

The CAMPHOR is a health related quality of life instrument validated for pulmonary hypertension that assesses impairment (symptoms), disability (activities) and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections; Symptoms (Scores 0-25; high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 0-30; low score indicates good functioning)and Quality of Life (0-25; high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (0-80). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>
          <population>Subjects who were still enrolled and completed the questionnaire at Baseline and Week 12. Total analysis population was less for the activity score and total score (N = 67).</population>

        <description>Change in TSQM score from Baseline to Week 12. The TSQM is a validated instrument (Health and Quality of Life Outcomes 2004, 2:12) that measures major dimensions of patient satisfaction with medications. The questionnaire is comprised of 15 questions which fall into one of four categories; Effectiveness, Side-Effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction. Responses are scaled on a seven point bipolar scale from 'Extremely Satisfied' to 'Extremely Dissatisfied' where higher scores indicate improvements (total scores from 0-100). The questionnaire was completed at Baseline and Week 12. The Baseline questionnaire focused on the subject’s satisfaction with inhaled iloprost treatment, while the questionnaire completed at Week 12 focused on the subject’s satisfaction with inhaled treprostinil.</description>
