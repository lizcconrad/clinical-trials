      An important step during a gastric bypass operation for the treatment of morbid obesity is
      the measuring of the small bowel length. At several reoperations we found a length increase
      of the lowest part of the small intestine of up to 80% compared to the measured length at the
      initial operation. On the one hand, this reflects a normal technical error of small bowel
      measuring due to the variable state of contraction of the bowel, but on the other hand, it
      could also be due to a compensatory increase in intestinal length after the operation. New
      protocols allow measuring of the small bowel length by MRI. Comparing the preoperative and
      later on several postoperative measurements by MRI with the initial intraoperative length
      measuring should allow to validate the new MRI protocol and in the same time quantify the
      eventual small bowel length increase. We plan to include 20 patients in this study.

      Background:

      An important step during a gastric bypass operation for the treatment of morbid obesity is
      the measuring of the small bowel length in order to define the lengths of the alimentary,
      biliopancreatic and common channel. The measuring itself is technically simple but has always
      an error due to the variable state of contraction of the small bowel. In distal gastric
      bypass a common channel length of 100 to 150 cm is chosen which induces an iatrogenic short
      bowel syndrome. At several reoperations we found a length increase of the common channel of
      up to 80% compared to the measured length at the initial operation. Former studies seem to
      indicate that an adaptation of small bowel length may occur in animals with short bowel
      syndrome or after intestinal bypass surgery. Longterm results of gastric bypass surgery often
      show weight regain after 3 to 5 years which could be due to the afore mentioned compensatory
      mechanism.

      Newer MRI protocols allow for non-invasive measurement of the small bowel length. Comparing
      the preoperative and later on several postoperative measurements by MRI with the initial
      intraoperative length measuring should allow to validate the new MRI protocol and in the same
      time quantify the eventual small bowel length increase.

      Objective:

      In-vivo verification of small bowel length measurements made by MRI, quantification of a
      possible increase of the common channel length in the long run after distal gastric bypass.

      Methods:

      The preoperative small bowel length measurement by MRI is compared to the length measured
      intraoperatively. MRIs before discharge postoperatively as well as after 6 and 12 months are
      used to detect an eventual increase of the common channel length.
