  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the quality of life of people living with bladder
      cancer. We are interested in learning about how the treatments for bladder cancer affect
      people. We plan to use the findings from this study to help doctors provide better care and
      information to patients with bladder cancer.
