  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nattokinase, first found by Dr. Hiroyuki Sumi in 1980, is a potent fibrinolytic enzyme
      extracted from Natto, a popular soybean fermented food in Japan. It was confirmed that oral
      administration of nattokinase (or natto) produced a mild and frequent enhancement of the
      fibrinolytic activity in the plasma as indicated by the fibrinolytic parameters and the
      production of tissue plasminogen activator. Other studies also showed a reduction in lipid
      peroxidation and improvement of lipid metabolism. Short-term effect (less then 10 days) of
      oral administration of nattokinase on both animal and human subjects has been studied and
      reported. However, whether nattokinase possesses a beneficial effect to dyslipidemic patients
      remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the long-term effect (six month) of
      the mono and multiple formulae of nattokinase, change of BP, lipid and fibrinolytic factors
      from baseline and 6 months on dyslipidemic patients.

      This study will employ a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design.
      Adult men and women who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and gave consent to participate
      were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: Group A: nattokinase-mono formula (18
      subjects); Group B: nattokinase compound (multiple formulae) (18 subjects); Group C: placebo
      (10 subjects).

      Laboratory tests, including TG, total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, fibrinogen, D-Dimer, uric
      acid, vital signs and body weight will be evaluated at screening visit, 1 month, 3 months, 6
      months visits after the initiation of treatment. Vital signs and body weight will be measured
      at every visits.

      Patient self-evaluation of tolerance and physical improvement will be assessed by a Patient
      Questionnaire at each visit. Each patient will be carefully monitored for the development of
      any adverse events (AE).

      The change of all lab tests and vital signs will be plotted and compared against time.
      Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test will be performed to compare the baseline and 6 months after the
      initiation of administration. Change from baseline for all lab and vital evaluations will be
      compared among three groups by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by LSD multiple
      comparison.
