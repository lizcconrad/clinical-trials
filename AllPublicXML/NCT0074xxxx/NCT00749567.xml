  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of combination of
      erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer, who progressed after first line treatment. Pretreatment with one
      of the two agents would not excluded patients from the study, in order to evaluate whether
      the combination of the two biologic agents could reverse tumor resistance.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial of erlotinib versus placebo, demonstrated
      that therapy with this tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) prolongs survival after first or
      second line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Moreover, the addition of bevacizumab, a
      monoclonal antibody against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor bevacizumab (VEGF), to
      systemic chemotherapy, improved both the response rates and the time to tumor progression in
      two trials. Early data from phase I/II trials examining the combination of these two
      biological agents in pre-treated patients with non-squamous NSCLC, showed no major
      pharmacokinetic interactions and promising clinical activity.
