      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine, once daily
      (QD), in adults with Generalized Anxiety Disorders.

    <textblock>
      The drug that was tested in this study is called Vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested
      to treat anxiety in adults who have general anxiety disorder (GAD). This study looked at GAD
      relief in people who took vortioxetine.

      The study enrolled 301 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which remained undisclosed to the patient
      and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 5 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a capsule that looked like the study drug but
           had no active ingredient.

      All participants were asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in Europe. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 13 weeks. Participants made 7 visits to the clinic, and were contacted by
      telephone 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Total Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A is an anxiety rating scale consisting of 14 items that assess anxious mood, tension, fear, insomnia, intellectual (cognitive) symptoms, depressed mood, behavior at interview, somatic (sensory), cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, autonomic and somatic (muscular) symptoms. Each symptom is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (maximum severity). Total scores range from 0 to 56 where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe. Total scores above 30 are rare, but indicate very severe anxiety. Least Squares (LS) means were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Anxiety sub-scale consists of 7 items that are assessed on a scale from 0 (no anxiety) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety).

The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities. The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment. LS means were from a MMRM with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>

The HAM-A is an anxiety rating scale consisting of 14 items that assess anxious mood, tension, fear, insomnia, intellectual (cognitive) symptoms, depressed mood, behavior at interview, somatic (sensory), cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, autonomic and somatic (muscular) symptoms. Each symptom is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (maximum severity). Total scores range from 0 (symptoms absent) to 56 (maximum severity).</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 is a participant self-rated questionnaire that is a general measure of perceived health status comprising 36 questions, which yields an 8-scale health profile. The social functioning subscale assesses limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems. The sub-score scale ranges from 0 (best) - 100 (worst). LS means were from a MMRM with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>

        <description>The HAM-A is an anxiety rating scale consisting of 14 items that assess anxious mood, tension, fear, insomnia, intellectual (cognitive) symptoms, depressed mood, behavior at interview, somatic (sensory), cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, autonomic and somatic (muscular) symptoms. Each symptom is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (maximum severity). Total scores range from 0 to 56 where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18–24 mild to moderate severity and 25–30 moderate to severe. Total scores above 30 are rare, but indicate very severe anxiety. LS means were from a MMRM with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Other Weeks Assessed</title>
        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities. The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment. LS means were from a MMRM with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>

          <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities. The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity of Illness at Each Week Assessed</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. LS means were from a MMRM with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Depression Subscale at Each Week Assessed</title>
        <description>The HAD-Depression subscale is completed by the participant and measures depression, focusing on the state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response. The subscale is made up of 7 items that are assessed on a scale from 0 (no depression) to 3 (severe feeling of depression). Participants are required to indicate the response which most accurately reflects the way they have felt over the last few days. The item scores are summed and the total subscore ranges from 0 to 21 (maximal severity). LS means were from a MMRM with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Role-Physical Subscore at Each Week Assessed</title>
        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 is a participant self-rated questionnaire that is a general measure of perceived health status comprising 36 questions, which yields an 8-scale health profile. The role-physical subscale assesses limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems. The sub-score scale ranges from 0 (best) - 100 (worst). LS means were from a MMRM with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 is a participant self-rated questionnaire that is a general measure of perceived health status comprising 36 questions, which yields an 8-scale health profile. The role-emotional subscale assesses limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems. The sub-score scale ranges from 0 (best) - 100 (worst). LS means were from a MMRM with Baseline-by-week, center, week and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</description>
