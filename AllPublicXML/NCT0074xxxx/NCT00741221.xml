      This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed and bevacizumab combination in
      patients with pretreated, advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pemetrexed is and an effective and well tolerated cytotoxic agent in the 2nd line treatment
      of advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, a phase III study of
      1st line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed that the addition of
      bevacizumab to a platinum-based regimen provided a survival benefit. There are patients with
      NSCLC who have not received bevacizumab and have relapsed after 1st and/or 2nd line therapy.
      The evaluation of bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in such patients is justified. This study
      will evaluate the combination of pemetrexed and bevacizumab as 2nd or 3rd line treatment of
      NSCLC.
