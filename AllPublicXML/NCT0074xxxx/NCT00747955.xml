  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate new assessment tools and equipment and new ways of using existing
      tools and equipment in the NIH Clinical Center s Rehabilitation Medicine Department in order
      to maximize patients function. The Department assesses and treats NIH patients with chronic
      pain, problems in walking or getting around, activities of daily living, performing tasks
      needed for jobs or hobbies, communicating and chewing and swallowing.

      Children and adults of all ages with disabilities and healthy normal volunteers may be
      eligible for this study.

      The following kinds of assessments are evaluated in this study:

      Assessments of Impairments

      Impairments are problems such as loss of movement, weakness or loss of sensation. Assessments
      may include measurements of range of motion, strength, sensation, pain, joint stability or
      mobility, joint angles, limb and girth, gait, exercise tolerance, stamina, or ultrasound
      imaging of muscle and swallowing function.

      Assessments of Function and Performance

      Functional and performance assessments look at how well subjects perform actions, such as
      walking or getting around, dressing, or preparing meals. They may include evaluations of
      activities of daily living, leisure activities, fatigue, vocational activity, school
      activity, coping skills, and quality of life. The assessments may be done by questionnaires
      or interviews and by watching subjects perform the activities.

      Assessments of Treatment Techniques

      Treatment techniques are assessed by evaluating methods and equipment used to treat patients
      with impairments or problems with function. They may evaluate, for example, the use of heat,
      cold, strengthening exercises, fitness exercises, TENS units, splinting and orthotics, or
      shoe modifications.

      Objective

      The objective of the protocol is to provide framework in which clinicians in the Department
      of Rehabilitation Medicine (RMD) can serve the clinical needs of patients and the intramural
      clinical research needs of NIH investigators by maintaining state of the art expertise in the
      functional assessment of persons with disabilities and investigating new equipment,
      methodologies and/or techniques for functional assessment.

      Study Population

      We intend to study a total of 500 healthy volunteers and 500 subjects with disabilities,
      including those enrolled in NIH intramural research protocols.

      Design

      The study will consist of individual projects designed designed by RMD staff including one or
      more of the associate investigators. The individual projects will be relatively small and
      designed to test the reliability, reproducibility, efficiency, feasibility, sensitivity,
      specificity, tolerability, validity and/or precision of physical medicine and rehabilitation
      assessment equipment, devices and clinical evaluations of impairment, disability, and/or
      function.

      Outcome Measures

      The specific outcome measure(s) will be chosen to meet the goals of the individual project
      and will generally include one or more of the following:

      i. Subjective assessment by the participant of the test, device, or evaluation based on
      written evaluation tools.

      ii. Comparisons to established evaluations or equipment designed to assess similar areas of
      function, including concurrent validity analyses.

      iii. Subjective assessment by clinicians using the test, device or evaluation, based on
      written evaluation tools.

      iv. Feasibility assessments, including the time required for participants to perform tests,
      time for clinicians to evaluate the results of the tests, and/or prepare reports of the
      results of tests.

      v. Assessments of reliability and/or stability of the technique used, including statistical
      tests of coefficients of variability.

      vi. Assessments of tolerance of tests, including measures such as vital signs or elements of
      a physical examination.

        To participate in projects in this study, subjects with disabilities must:

          -  have a disability appropriate to the measure being assessed

          -  be clinically stable and medically able to tolerate the measure to be evaluated in a
             specific project in which they are to be enrolled

          -  be an adult able to give informed consent or, if a minor, have a parent/guardian able
