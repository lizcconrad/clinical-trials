  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flunarizine is a calcium channel blocker traditionally used for the treatment of vertigo and
      migraine. It also has the mechanism of action associated with antipsychotic activity (D2
      receptor blockade), but has never been tested as such. The investigators hypothesis is that
      flunarizine can be an atypical antipsychotic.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main advantage of flunarizine over other D2 receptor blockers is its long half-life, so
      that it may be administered weekly or may delay relapse if medication is interrupted.
