    <textblock>
      This is a four-part dose-escalation and confirmation study in participants with advanced
      solid tumors. Part A is for dose escalation and determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MK-4827. Part B is a prostate/ovarian cancer cohort
      expansion. Part C is for a cohort of participants with relapsed or refractory T-cell
      prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Part D will be for a
      cohort of participants with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC),
      persistent or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, locally advanced or metastatic triple negative
      or highly proliferative estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, or partially
      platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer. The study is also designed to find out whether
      MK-4827 causes at least 50% inhibition of poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP)
      enzyme activity.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  For Part A, participants must have a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed
             metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor for which standard therapy does not exist
             or the participants have refused standard therapy.

          -  For Part B, participants must have a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed
             locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer for which standard therapy does not
             exist or the participants have refused standard therapy or sporadic (not known to have
             BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations) recurrent platinum resistant high grade serous ovarian,
             primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Participants who progressed while
             receiving a platinum-containing regimen are not eligible. Participants with ovarian
             cancer must have at least one measurable lesion (at least 15 mm in one dimension) or a
             cancer antigen (CA)-125 value twice the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  For Part B, participants must have archival tumor tissue available.

          -  For Part C, participants must have a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed
             diagnosis of T-PLL or B-cell CLL. Participants with T- PLL must have progressed after
             receiving alemtuzumab. Participants with CLL must have been refractory to or
             progressed within 12 months following a fludarabine-containing regimen or have
             received at least 2 prior therapies (before or after the fludarabine containing
             regimen).

          -  For Part D, participants must have:

          -  a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed metastatic or locally advanced
             adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum (mCRC) and evidence of phosphate and tensin
             homolog (PTEN) deficiency. Participants must have received at least 1 prior
             5-fluoruracil (5-FU)-based combination chemotherapy regimen for mCRC, containing
             oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Participants must have measurable disease.

          -  a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed persistent or recurrent endometrial
             carcinoma and measurable disease. Participants may not have had more than 1 prior
             chemotherapy regimen.

          -  a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed metastatic or locally advanced sporadic
             (not known to have a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) partially platinum-sensitive
             recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal
             cancer. Participants who cannot receive platinum due to allergy or toxicity are
             eligible. Participants with ovarian cancer may have received non-platinum containing
             chemotherapy between their last platinum-containing regimen and enrolling in this
             study. Participants must have measurable disease or an elevated CA-125 (at least 2
             times the institutional upper limit of normal).

          -  a cytologically- or histologically-confirmed metastatic or locally advanced carcinoma
             of the breast that either lacks expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
             receptor (PR) and HER2 (triple negative [TN]) or is ER and/or PR+ . Participants with
             locally advanced disease must have recurrent or progressive disease that is not
             suitable for treatment with curative intent. Participants with ER positive disease
             must have been treated with at least one line of hormonal therapy for
             recurrent/progressive disease or have been on hormonal therapy at the time of
             recurrence/progression. Participants with either ER+ or TN tumors may not have had
             more than 1 line of chemotherapy for treatment of recurrent disease. If participants
             received adjuvant chemotherapy they must have had a disease-free interval of at least
             6 months from the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Participants must have
             measurable disease.
