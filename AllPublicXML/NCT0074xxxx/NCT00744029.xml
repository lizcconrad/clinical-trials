      In patients with acute stroke, systemic thrombolysis needs to be administered within three
      hours of symptom onset. The aim of the present study was to reduce prehospital delays in a
      population-based intervention.The intervention consisted of an educational letter indicating
      stroke symptoms and emphasizing the importance of calling the emergency medical services
      (EMS). The investigators additionally included a bookmark and sticker with the EMS telephone
      number. A total of 75,720 inhabitants received the intervention. Between 2004 and 2005, 741
      patients with cerebrovascular events were admitted from the control areas (n=24) and 647 from
      the intervention areas (n=24).

      Background and Purpose:

      In patients with acute stroke, systemic thrombolysis needs to be administered within three
      hours of symptom onset. The aim of the present study was to reduce prehospital delays in a
      population-based intervention.

      Methods:

      We performed a cluster-randomized trial with 48 zip code areas as cluster units in the
      catchment area of three inner-city hospitals in Berlin. The primary endpoint was time between
      symptom onset and hospital admission. The intervention consisted of an educational letter
      indicating stroke symptoms and emphasizing the importance of calling the emergency medical
      services (EMS). We additionally included a bookmark and sticker with the EMS telephone
      number. We fitted a lognormal survival regression model (time-to-admission) with frailty
      terms shared by inhabitants of the same zip code area.
