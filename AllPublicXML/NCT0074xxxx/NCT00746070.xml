  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism (PA), characterized by an inappropriate production of aldosterone, is
      far more common than is usually perceived. The overall prevalence of PA is 11.2% of the newly
      diagnosed hypertensive patients and 4.8% was curable aldosterone producing adenoma (APA), and
      adrenalectomy is considered the treatment of choice for APA. The potential curability and
      prevention of excess cardiovascular damage and events also underscores the need to develop
      accurate strategies for the timely diagnosis of APA.This study aimed to determine the effects
      of endothelium function change ( PWV, progenitor cell,..) before and post-adrenalectomy or
      taking spironolactone in patients with aldosteronism. Autonomous elevated aldosterone will
      increase the glomerular filtration rate and renal damage in patients with primary
      aldosteronism (PA). But clinical evidence of the role of endothelium function on
      post-adrenalectomy or taking spirolactone is still limited.

      Aldosterone has rapid nongenomic effects in the human vasculature. Aldosterone has been
      claimed to lead to endothelial dysfunction, a condition related to development of
      cardiovascular disorders and to poor prognosis. However, studies of aldosterone effects on
      endothelial function led to discrepant findings, which may be related, at least in part, to
      inhomogeneity of the populations studied. Thus, studies in healthy subjects showed no
      detrimental effects of aldosterone on endothelial function and no positive effect of
      aldosterone inhibition, whereas populations with established cardiovascular diseases showed
      negative effects of aldosterone and positive effects of spironolactone therapy. Still, other
      factors may be of importance as effects of aldosterone on endothelial function are not
      homogenous even in a healthy population. Dosages of aldosterone, concomitant drug use, as
      well as the vascular bed investigated may influence the effects observed.

      Furthermore, little is known about chronic endothelial effects of aldosterone that could
      indicate a primary and direct role of aldosterone in development of cardiovascular diseases.
      In patients with hyperaldosteronism diminished flow-mediated dilation was found, indicating
      impaired endothelial function compared with hypertensive patients without elevated
      aldosterone. However, it is not known whether these results represent endothelial dysfunction
      as the result of a direct aldosterone effect on the vasculature or a secondary effect
      attributable to more substantial hypertension.

        aldosteronism Patients enrolled from initial screening test and recorded in the Taiwan
        Primary Aldosteornism Investigation (TAIPAI) database. The database was constructed for
        quality assurance since 2003 in one medical center (National Taiwan University Hospital,
        Taipei, Taiwan) and its three branch hospitals in different cities (National Taiwan
        University Hospital Yun-Lin branch, Yun-Lin, southern Taiwan; Far-Eastern Memorial
        Hospital, Taipei; Tao-Yuan General Hospital, Tao-Yuan, middle Taiwan). All patients with
        intention to confirm and requiring suppression test or adrenal venous sampling were
        recruited and data were prospectively collected.
