        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient at least 18 years of age with stage II or III multiple myeloma

          -  One or more lytic bone lesions

          -  If currently receiving bisphosphonate therapy, have been on a stable dose for ≥ 2
             months before dosing day 1 or must not have received bisphosphonates within 2 months
             of dosing day 1

          -  If patient has undergone previous autologous or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation (HSCT), they must be stable (in the opinion of the investigator) and
             be a minimum of 6 months since HSCT

          -  Has planned HSCT for the duration of the study

          -  Has moles or lesions that are currently undiagnosed, but are suspect for malignancy

          -  Has an underlying condition that may result in abnormal bone metabolism other than
             cancer related bone lesions, such as a history of hyperparathyroidism,
             hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, rheumatoid arthritis, myeloproliferative disorder,
             gout, Paget's disease of the bone, or osteomalacia; patients with a diagnosis of
             osteoporosis prior to multiple myeloma diagnosis are eligible to participate.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known underlying condition that may result in abnormal bone metabolism other than
             cancer related bone lesions

          -  History of polyneuropathy ≥ grade 3

          -  Patients with plasma cell leukemia

          -  Planned stem cell transplant (HSCT) or radiation for the duration of the study

          -  Skeletal related event within 2 weeks of study enrollment

          -  Has received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) within the last 21 days or is
             planned to receive ESAs during the course of the study

          -  Has received anti-myeloma therapy within the last 21 days

          -  Is scheduled to receive local radiation to bone during the course of the study

          -  Has taken estrogen, androgen, anabolic steroids, calcitonin or other bone-active drugs
             within 4 months of study enrollment

          -  Woman of childbearing potential (not undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months)
