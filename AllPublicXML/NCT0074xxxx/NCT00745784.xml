  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to learn more about the experience of grief in young bereaved
      spouses/partners. Recent research has shown that young bereaved spouses/partners experience
      grief uniquely from other age groups, but it is still unclear how certain factors affect the
      experience of grief. The investigators research team is interested in studying how the
      psychological factors of trauma, personality, and meaning of the loss affect grief reactions
      in young spouses/partners after the loss of a spouse to cancer.
