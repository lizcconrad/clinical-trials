  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a retrospective (beginning January 2006) and prospective patient registry
      program sponsored by Ipsen (formerly Tercica, Inc.). In collaboration with participating
      health care practitioners, the patient registry program is an observational study monitoring
      the long-term safety of patients treated with Increlex® (mecasermin [rDNA origin] injection).
      The IGFD (Increlex® Growth Forum Database) Registry is intended primarily to monitor the
      safety and efficacy of Increlex replacement therapy in children with growth failure.

      The data collected for a patient will be those that exist in the patient's medical record as
      part of standard medical care. No additional patient procedures or activities are mandated by
      this study. The specific data to be collected at each visit and the schedule of data
      collection are listed in a schedule of assessments.

      The collection of safety events is considered essential to the Registry. The website will
      provide the opportunity to report the occurrence of targeted adverse events (AEs), other
      important events considered to be related to Increlex administration and serious adverse
      events (SAEs).
