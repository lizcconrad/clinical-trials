      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the Uniglide™ Mobile Bearing Unicondylar
      Knee System (investigational device)is not inferior when compared to the Uniglide™ Fixed
      Bearing Unicondylar Knee System (control device currently cleared) as measured by the
      Composite Clinical Success (CCS) endpoint.

      Arthritic knees are the most common cause of long-term disability resulting in decreased
      mobility and increased pain. After other treatments for pain relief and return to activities
      of daily living fail, knee joint replacement is often the best option and unicompartmental
      knee arthroplasty was introduced as an appropriate treatment for management of osteoarthritis
      when disease effects only a portion of the knee joint. This study is a prospective,
      comparative, randomized, double blind (patient and post-operative evaluator), multi-center
      clinical study under a common protocol to determine the safety and effectiveness of the
      Uniglide Unicondylar Mobile Bearing knee implant system.

    <description>Uniglide Mobile Bearing Knee System includes a femoral component made of cobalt chromium molybdenum (CoCrMo)that articulates with a mobile bearing tibial construct comprised of a cobalt chromium molybdenum (CoCrMo)tibial base plate and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) meniscal insert. The femoral component has been cleared as part of the fixed bearing version in K050764. The investigational portion of this device is the mobile bearing tibial construct (tibial tray and meniscal insert).</description>
