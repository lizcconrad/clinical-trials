    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of
      different doses of intravenous and oral Forodesine in children with relapsed or refractory
      T-cell or B-cell precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia or T-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
      Preliminary efficacy will also be assessed.

      A multi-centre, multi-national, open label trial of Forodesine in children with relapsed or
      refractory T-cell or B-cell precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia or T-cell Non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of six different dose schedules of Forodesine. Secondary objectives are to
      evaluate safety and to collect preliminary efficacy data. All patients will receive active
      drug. The Initial Treatment Phase will last 37 days with a final response assessment on Day
      37. Patients who achieve a response may be eligible to receive extended treatment with
      Forodesine for up to 6 months.

             study medication, be non-lactating, and be willing to use adequate and highly
             effective method of contraception throughout the study and for one month after the
             last dose of study medication, if sexually active.

          -  Sexually active male subjects must be willing and able to use a barrier form of
             contraception (i.e. condoms) or sexual abstinence throughout the study and for one
             month after the last dose of study medication

          -  Unequivocal histological diagnosis of T-ALL, BCP-ALL or T-NHL (World Health
             Organisation [WHO] classification) at initial diagnosis

          -  Relapse (³25% marrow blasts) or failure to respond after at least one standard regimen
             for their disease for subjects with a T-cell malignancy who are ineligible for other
             therapy of greater curative potential, or failure to respond after at least two
             standard regimens for subjects with a B-cell precursor malignancy

          -  KPS or LPS (as appropriate for subject's age) scores ³60

          -  Anticipated life expectancy of at least 6 weeks

          -  Adequate kidney (creatinine levels ≤ 2.0 times upper limit of normal) and liver
             function tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and/or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]
             ≤3 times upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤5 times upper limit of normal)

          -  Signed ICF and assent if appropriate according to local laws and regulations prior to
             start of any study specific procedures.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of HIV and/or HTLV-1

          -  Subjects with known active HBV, HCV, CMV and/or EBV infection

          -  Subjects with clinical evidence of active symptomatic CNS disease

          -  Subjects with active serious infection

          -  Prior treatment with any antileukemic agent, chemotherapy or leukophoresis treatment
             within 7 days (within 4-5 days for 6-mercaptopurine (MP) and within 2 days for
             low-dose methotrexate) prior to study entry

          -  Lack of full recovery from adverse drug reactions due to prior therapy, independent of
             when that therapy was given

          -  Concurrent treatment with other anticancer agents (CNS prophylaxis e.g. intrathecal
             methotrexate and corticosteroid use will not be excluded)

          -  Subjects who have chronic gastrointestinal disease or conditions that may hamper
             compliance and/or absorption of the product; however, study drug administration via

          -  Any history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to any component of the study
             medication.

          -  Subjects who have received an investigational medicinal product within 30 days of
