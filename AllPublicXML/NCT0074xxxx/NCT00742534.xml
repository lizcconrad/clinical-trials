  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants are at risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). L-citrulline
      may decrease that risk, but we do not know the safety or dose of this drug for use in
      premature babies. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and optimal dose of
      intravenous L-citrulline in premature infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase I study of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and optimal dose of
      intravenously administered L-citrulline in premature infants born at 24 to 29 weeks estimated
      gestational age (EGA) and who are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This is a
      classic dose escalation using initial doses of 10 mg/kg of intravenous citrulline and
      advancing the dose by 10 mg/kg every 3 patients for a target peak plasma citrulline
      concentration of 100 umol/L. These infants will undergo intense hemodynamic monitoring and
      have intermittent blood sampling to determine levels of amino acids and nitric oxide
      metabolites. From this, we will determine citrulline pharmacokinetics including half life,
      clearance, and volume of distribution. Intravenous L-citrulline will be provided by Asklepion
      Pharmaceuticals and mixed by the Investigational Drug Service of the Vanderbilt Hospital
      Clinical Pharmacy. The study will be monitored closely by a data safety monitoring board
      (DSMB) consisting of clinicians not involved with this study.

    <description>This is a classic dose escalation using initial doses of 10 mg/kg of intravenous citrulline and advancing the dose by 10 mg/kg every 3 patients for a target peak plasma citrulline concentration of 100 umol/L. This regimen will be adjusted with pharmacokinetic data as it becomes available so that it may be adjusted to maintain appropriate serum levels of the urea cycle precursors and NO metabolites of interest.</description>
