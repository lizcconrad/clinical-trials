      Double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, 2-period crossover study which assessed the
      efficacy and safety of gabapentin enacarbil (GEn; GSK1838262; XP13512) extended release
      tablets in adults with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)-associated sleep disturbance. One hundred
      thirty-six (136) adult subjects with RLS-associated sleep disturbance and periodic limb
      movements (PLM) were randomized from 23 centers in the United States. Subjects who met all
      eligibility criteria were randomized to receive a treatment sequence of GEn:placebo or
      placebo:GEn. Investigational product was taken with food at approximately 5pm.
      Investigational product was dosed as 600mg/day x3 days followed by 1200mg/day x25 days for
      each 4-week treatment period. There was a 1-week taper at 600mg after each treatment period
      followed by a 1-week washout between treatments. Polysomnography (PSG) was used to
      objectively evaluate changes in sleep and PLMs.

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Wake Time During Sleep (WTDS) at Week 4/10 Measured by Polysomnography (PSG) (Sleep Study) Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4/10 (representing the last week of each intervention period, i.e. Weeks 4 and 10)</time_frame>
    <description>PSG is a comprehensive recording of the bio-physiological changes that occur during sleep. It is also known as a &quot;sleep study&quot; that monitors participants as they sleep or try to sleep. WTDS, defined as the total amount of time spent awake after falling asleep until the last awakening, was measured by PSG. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in the International Restless Legs Rating Scale (IRLS) Total Score at Week 4/10 Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4/10 (representing the last week of each intervention period, i.e. Weeks 4 and 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The IRLS is a measure of RLS disease severity. Ten items (individually scored from 0 to 4) are included that assess the impact of symptoms on participants' mood, daily life, and activities. The total scale score is a sum of all of the individual item scores and ranges from 0-40 points, with 40 being the most severe. The scale assesses symptoms over the week prior to measurement. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in the Item 4 (Sleep Disturbance) Scores of the IRLS Rating Scale at Week 4/10 Using LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4/10 (representing the last week of each intervention period, i.e. Weeks 4 and 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The IRLS is a measure of RLS disease severity. Item 4 of the IRLS evaluates RLS-related sleep impairment. It asks: &quot;In the past week, how severe was your sleep disturbance due to your RLS symptoms?&quot;. The item is participant rated using a 5-point scale, where 0 is the absence of any sleep disturbance and 4 is very severe disturbance. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

    <description>Stage N1 is considered &quot;light sleep,&quot; during which participants drift in and out of sleep and can be awakened easily. In this stage, the eyes move slowly and muscle activity slows. This stage is sometimes referred to as &quot;somnolence&quot; or &quot;drowsy sleep.&quot; Sudden twitches and hypnic jerks may be associated with the onset of sleep during N1. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Wake Time During Sleep (WTDS) at Week 4/10 Measured by Polysomnography (PSG) (Sleep Study) Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>PSG is a comprehensive recording of the bio-physiological changes that occur during sleep. It is also known as a &quot;sleep study&quot; that monitors participants as they sleep or try to sleep. WTDS, defined as the total amount of time spent awake after falling asleep until the last awakening, was measured by PSG. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in the International Restless Legs Rating Scale (IRLS) Total Score at Week 4/10 Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The IRLS is a measure of RLS disease severity. Ten items (individually scored from 0 to 4) are included that assess the impact of symptoms on participants’ mood, daily life, and activities. The total scale score is a sum of all of the individual item scores and ranges from 0-40 points, with 40 being the most severe. The scale assesses symptoms over the week prior to measurement. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in the Item 4 (Sleep Disturbance) Scores of the IRLS Rating Scale at Week 4/10 Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The IRLS is a measure of RLS disease severity. Item 4 of the IRLS evaluates RLS-related sleep impairment. It asks: &quot;In the past week, how severe was your sleep disturbance due to your RLS symptoms?&quot;. The item is participant rated using a 5-point scale, where 0 is the absence of any sleep disturbance and 4 is very severe disturbance. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Time Spent in N1 Sleep as Measured by Polysomnography at Week 4/10 Using LOCF</title>
        <description>Stage N1 is considered “light sleep,” during which participants drift in and out of sleep and can be awakened easily. In this stage, the eyes move slowly and muscle activity slows. This stage is sometimes referred to as “somnolence” or “drowsy sleep.” Sudden twitches and hypnic jerks may be associated with the onset of sleep during N1. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Sleep Quality at Week 4/10 as Measured by the Subjective Post Sleep Diary (SPSD) Using LOCF</title>
        <description>Each day upon awakening, participants rated their overall sleep quality for the previous night on an 11-point scale (0=poor to 10=excellent) using the SPSD. Response to sleep quality was calculated for each visit by averaging the last 7 available diary days. Only participants with at least 4 days of diary data available (not in consecutive order) at any visit were included in the analysis. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

          <description>Each day upon awakening, participants rated their overall sleep quality for the previous night on an 11-point scale (0=poor to 10=excellent) using the SPSD. Response to sleep quality was calculated for each visit by averaging the last 7 available diary days. Only participants with at least 4 days of diary data available (not in consecutive order) at any visit were included in the analysis. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

          <description>Sleep efficiency is a percentage that is calculated by dividing total sleep time by the amount of time the participant was in bed during the PSG. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effect.</description>
          <population>ITT Population: Of the 131 ITT participants, 2 and 6 participants did not take Placebo and GEn 1200 mg, respectively, in the second period. In addition, 6 placebo and 4 GEn 1200 participants did not have PSG data during the second intervention period and were therefore not included in this analysis.</population>

        <description>The CGI-S scale allows the investigator to rate the severity of participants’ illness considering their total clinical experience with the participant population being studied and based on all information available at the time of rating. The scale is rated from 1-7 (1=Normal, not at all ill; 7=Among the most extremely ill patients). Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 4 and Week 10 values minus the baseline value. Mean change from baseline was adjusted for treatment, pooled center, and period effects.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Were Defined as Clinical Global Impression of Illness (CGI-I) Scale &quot;Responders&quot; at Week 4/10 Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The CGI-I scale allows the investigator to rate the participant’s global improvement or worsening compared with the condition at baseline (i.e., Day 1), and whether or not the change is thought to be due to treatment with study medication. The scale is rated from 1-7 (1=Very much improved to 7=Very much worse). Participants with a score of 1 (“Very much improved”) or 2 (“Much improved”) are considered to be responders.</description>
