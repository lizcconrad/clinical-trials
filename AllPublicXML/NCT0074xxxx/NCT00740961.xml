      RATIONALE: Learning about changes over time in older patients' ability to function after
      receiving chemotherapy for breast or colon cancer may help doctors learn about the long-term
      effects of treatment and plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying older patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer or
      colon cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the correlation between the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) and the battery
           of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment tools among breast and colon cancer patients, 65
           years and older, in an outpatient setting.

        -  Assess and compare the abilities of the VES-13 and the battery of Comprehensive
           Geriatric Assessment tools to predict chemotherapy adherence among these patients.

        -  Examine the validity of the VES-13 screening tool to identify increased risk of death
           from all causes at one year after initial VES-13 screening in these patients.

        -  Examine the validity of the VES-13 screening tool to identify increased risk of
           functional decline at one year after initial VES-13 screening in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) and a Comprehensive
      Geriatric Assessment at baseline and 12 months later. Variables collected include
      sociodemographics; cognitive, nutritional, psychosocial, and emotional status; tumor
      characteristics; therapy; and mortality.

      Patients are followed for 1 year for chemotherapy adherence and survival.

    <description>Patients â‰¥ 65 years with new stage I-III breast or colon cancer seeking care. Patients will be matched on baseline scores, age and sex. Patients will be age and sex matched due to the known relation between inflammatory markers and demographic characteristics39,40, and will be matched on baseline VES scores to ensure similar baseline VES-13 scores between groups and which will then allow us to then assess effect of cancer treatment on outcomes.</description>
