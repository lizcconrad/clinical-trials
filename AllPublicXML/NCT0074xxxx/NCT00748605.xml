      1. To evaluate the weight loss effect of 1600 mg/day S-2367 administered orally once daily
           with the morning meal after a 6-week low calorie diet (LCD) of 950 kcal/day with or
           without S-2367 followed by 54 weeks while on a 800 kcal deficit reduced calorie diet
           (RCD) compared with placebo in medically stable and otherwise healthy obese male and
           female subjects

        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 1600 mg/day S-2367 administered orally once
           daily with the morning meal after a 6-week LCD with or without S-2367 followed by 54
           weeks on a RCD compared with placebo in medically stable and otherwise healthy obese
           male and female subjects

        3. To evaluate the steady-state/trough pharmacokinetics of 1600 mg/day S-2367 administered
           orally once daily with the morning meal after a 6-week LCD with or without S-2367
           followed by 54 weeks on a RCD in obese male and female subjects

        4. To evaluate the weight loss effect of 1600 mg/day S-2367 administered orally once daily
           with the morning meal during an initial 6-week LCD compared with placebo in medically
           stable and otherwise healthy obese male and female subjects
