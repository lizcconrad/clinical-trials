        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

          -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods per
             protocol for an appropriate period of time prior to the start of dosing to
             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree
             to use contraception until the follow-up visit.

          -  Body weight &gt;50 kg and BMI within the range 19 - 30 kg/m2 (inclusive).

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication

          -  Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice within 7 days prior to first dose of
             study medication.

          -  History of drug abuse.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  History of anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid (resembling anaphylaxis) reactions or severe
             allergic responses.

          -  History of cholecystectomy or biliary tract disease, or a history of liver disease
             with elevated liver function tests of known or unknown etiology.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (if heparin is
             to be used for flushing a cannula).

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Use of oral, injected and implanted hormonal methods of contraception for female
             subjects.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at screening or prior to
