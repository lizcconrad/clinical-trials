      The primary objective is to compare the incremental costs (direct and indirect) and benefits
      (healing outcomes, quality of life) of using foam silver dressing (Mepilex® Ag) to a Silver
      sulfadiazine 1% cream (Silvadene®) from the perspective of the health care provider.

      The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety, the tolerance and the performance on
      burn status including pain.

      In- and/or out-patients at ten centers in the United States were included in this
      investigation. Subjects included were 5 years of age and older who suffered from partial
      thickness burns. Every patient was followed for 3 weeks.

    <description>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is calculated as the difference in total costs in each group divided by the difference in rate of full re-epithelialization (taken from the survival curve) at 20 days in each group (Δcosts/ Δeffects). Total costs were calculated based on the costs of primary and secondary dressings, silver sulphadiazine cream and estimated application, labor, supplies and pain medications. These costs were estimated from a representative sample of each population, across study facilities, using activity-based costing methods.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is interpreted as the price of additional health benefits. The ratio is supposed to be used by decision makers, in order for them to compare their willingness-to-pay for an additional health benefit with the pr</description>

    <description>Mepilex® Ag consists of a Safetac® soft silicone wound contact layer, a grey absorbent polyurethane foam pad containing a silver compound, activated carbon, and a vapour permeable waterproof film. Mepilex® Ag is an antimicrobial soft silicone foam dressing that absorbs exudate and maintains a moist wound environment.
Mepilex® Ag contains silver sulphate that releases silver ions to inactivate a wide range of wound related pathogens (bacteria and fungi), shown in vitro. By reducing the number of microorganisms, Mepilex® Ag may also reduce odour.</description>

        <description>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is calculated as the difference in total costs in each group divided by the difference in rate of full re-epithelialization (taken from the survival curve) at 20 days in each group (Δcosts/ Δeffects). Total costs were calculated based on the costs of primary and secondary dressings, silver sulphadiazine cream and estimated application, labor, supplies and pain medications. These costs were estimated from a representative sample of each population, across study facilities, using activity-based costing methods.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is interpreted as the price of additional health benefits. The ratio is supposed to be used by decision makers, in order for them to compare their willingness-to-pay for an additional health benefit with the pr</description>
