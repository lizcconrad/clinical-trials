          -  Not pregnant or nursing

          -  Normal renal and hepatic function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence in the subject medical history or in the medical examination of any
             clinically significant hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             hematological or other significant acute or chronic abnormalities which might
             influence either the safety of the subject or the absorption, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion of the active agent under investigation

          -  Hypersensitivity to subject drug, atopic eczema or allergic bronchial asthma

          -  Planned vaccination during the time course of the study

          -  Adherence to a diet (i.e, vegetarian) or life style (incl. extreme sports) that might
             interfere with the investigation

          -  Laboratory test results outside the tolerance values as laid down by the study centre,
             which may be an evidence of disease. Positive result of HIV1/2, HCV antibody or HBs
             antigen testing

          -  Regular use of any medication within four weeks prior to commencement of the study

          -  Drug addiction

          -  Participation in a clinical investigation or blood donation of more than 250 ml within
             the past eight weeks or blood donation of less than 250 ml within the past 4 week

          -  Subjects who are known or suspected

               -  to be in such a precarious financial situation that they no longer weigh up the
                  possible risks of their participation and the unpleasantness they may be involved
                  in.
