    <textblock>
      The objectives are to determine the effect of different ritonavir doses on darunavir (DRV)
      oral exposure following once-daily oral dosing of DRV/rtv for 7 days, in order to establish
      an optimal ritonavir boosting dose for DRV and to evaluate short-term safety and
      tolerability.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized (study drug assigned by chance), 3-way crossover
      trial in healthy volunteers to assess the pharmacokinetics of darunavir (DRV),
      co-administered with different doses of ritonavir. The trial population will consist of 18
      healthy adult volunteers. During 3 subsequent sessions, each volunteer will receive in a
      randomized way: Treatments A, B and C. In Treatment A, 800 mg DRV once-daily and 100 mg
      ritonavir once-daily will be administered. In Treatment B, 800 mg DRV once-daily and 50 mg
      ritonavir once-daily will be administered. In Treatment C, 800 mg DRV once-daily and 20 mg
      ritonavir once-daily will be administered. All treatments will be administered for 7 days and
      intake of DRV and ritonavir will be under fed conditions. DRV will be formulated as a 400 mg
      tablet; ritonavir will be formulated as an oral solution containing 80mg/mL ritonavir. In
      each treatment session, full pharmacokinetic profiles of DRV and ritonavir will be determined
      up to 24 hours after administration on Day 1 and up to 72 hours after administration on Day
      7. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between subsequent treatments. Safety
      and tolerability will be evaluated continuously throughout the trial. During 3 subsequent
      sessions, each volunteer will receive in a randomized way Treatments A, B and C. In Treatment
      A, 800/100 mg DRV/rtv once-daily will be administered. In Treatment B, 800/50 mg DRV/rtv
      once-daily will be administered. In Treatment C, 800/20 mg DRV/rtv once-daily will be
      administered. All treatments will be administered for 7 days. DRV will be formulated as a 400
      mg tablet; ritonavir will be formulated as an oral solution containing 80mg/mL ritonavir.
