    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ustekinumab in the
      treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in South Korea and Taiwan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, parallel study of
      subcutaneous injection of placebo and ustekinumab 45mg in Taiwanese and Korean patients with
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Ustekinumab is an experimental medicine that is being
      tested to see if it may be useful in treating moderate to severe psoriasis. The patients will
      receive either ustekinumab or placebo at week 0 or week 4, and will be followed up through
      week 36. Patients who randomized (study drug assigned by chance) to placebo will cross over
      to ustekinumab 45mg group at week 12 and week 16 .The effectiveness of ustekinumab will be
      compared with placebo treated patients at week 12. Safety information will be collected
      through week 36. Patients randomized to ustekinumab will receive placebo at week 12 to
      maintain the blind and additional dose of 45mg at week 16. This study will be conducted in
      approximately 13 sites in South Korea and Taiwan and will include approximately 120 patients
      with approximately 60 patients in each country. This study is &quot;blinded.&quot; This means that
      neither you nor your study doctor will know in which group you are placed. However, in case
      of medical emergency, your study doctor can quickly find out which treatment group you are
      in. You may get either ustekinumab or placebo (which looks like the medicine being studied
      but has no active ingredients) at the start of the study. All patients in the study will
      eventually receive Ustekinumab after week 12. Patients assigned to the ustekinumab will
      receive 45 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 4 and 16; and placebo at week 12. Patiens assigned
      to placebo will receive subcutaneous injections of placebo at weeks 0 and 4; then crossover
      to 45 mg of ustekinumab at weeks 12 and 16. Duration of study participation up to 36 weeks.
