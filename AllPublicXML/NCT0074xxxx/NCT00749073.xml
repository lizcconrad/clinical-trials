    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open label, prospective clinical study to assess the clinical
      application and functional outcomes of symptomatic patients undergoing the Minimally Invasive
      Lumbar Decompression (MILD™) treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis. In this study,
      patient-reported outcomes over a 3 month period following treatment will be collected by the
      investigator. Periodic surveys for each study subject's pain, functional status, quality of
      life and physical examination will track outcomes following MILD™ treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Vertos MILD™ devices are used for image-guided Minimally Invasive Lumbar Decompression,
      referred to as the MILD™ procedure. This percutaneous procedure is performed under
      fluoroscopic image guidance through a dorsal approach to the spine. Lumbar decompression is
      performed through the removal of tissue and bone, where indicated. All procedures are
      conducted in accordance with the product labeling and indications for use. A minimum of ten
      up to a maximum of twenty-five adult patients will be enrolled and followed for a period of
      up to 6 months. Patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis who meet the study
      enrollment criteria will be offered the MILD™ procedure as an alternative to surgery or
      continued standard non-surgical medical management.

    <measure>Changes in Back Pain as Measured by a 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical relevance established by change of two points or more on a ten point scale where zero represents no pain and ten represents worst pain imaginable. Mean change from baseline to Month 6 was reported with a positive number representing the baseline value minus the 6 month value.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Function as Measured Subjectively by the Oswestry Disability Index Patient Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is used to measure permanent functional disability through a series of questions which characterize the disturbance of activities of daily living resulting from chronic back pain. The questionnaire is divided into 10 topics including pain intensity , personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, social life, traveling and employment/homemaking. Each topic is rated 0 (no pain or no limitation) to 5 (high pain or very limited physically). The worst possible score is 50 (100% disability) and best would be zero (0% disability), thus a higher ODI score indicates greater disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life as Measured by the PCS Subscale of the Short-form 12 Question (SF-12) Survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Six months</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-question SF-12v2 Health Survey is a validated generic measure of health status &amp; outcomes, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. The Physical Component Summary (PCS)takes into account the correlations among the Physical Functioning (PF), Role Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), and Vitality (VT)SF-12v2 Health Survey scales to show the broad impact on PCS. Norm-based scoring is used so each scale has the same mean (50 points) and the same standard deviation (10 points) as the general US population in 1998. Scores below 50 indicate a decline in health status, with lower scores representing worse health status. Minimally Important Difference (MID) is a measure of true clinical relevance of a difference, with suggested MID for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) being 2 to 3 points. Change from baseline to 6 months is presented, where a positive value represents the 6 month value minus the baseline value.</description>

        <title>Function as Measured Subjectively by the Oswestry Disability Index Patient Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is used to measure permanent functional disability through a series of questions which characterize the disturbance of activities of daily living resulting from chronic back pain. The questionnaire is divided into 10 topics including pain intensity , personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, social life, traveling and employment/homemaking. Each topic is rated 0 (no pain or no limitation) to 5 (high pain or very limited physically). The worst possible score is 50 (100% disability) and best would be zero (0% disability), thus a higher ODI score indicates greater disability.</description>

            <description>The single group in this pilot study included ten patients treated for lumbar spinal stenosis of the central canal using the mild device kit to perform minimally invasive percutaneous decompression. The mean change and standard deviation between baseline (pretreatment) and Month 6 are reported, where a positive value represents the baseline value minus the 6 month value.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life as Measured by the PCS Subscale of the Short-form 12 Question (SF-12) Survey.</title>
        <description>The 12-question SF-12v2 Health Survey is a validated generic measure of health status &amp; outcomes, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group. The Physical Component Summary (PCS)takes into account the correlations among the Physical Functioning (PF), Role Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), and Vitality (VT)SF-12v2 Health Survey scales to show the broad impact on PCS. Norm-based scoring is used so each scale has the same mean (50 points) and the same standard deviation (10 points) as the general US population in 1998. Scores below 50 indicate a decline in health status, with lower scores representing worse health status. Minimally Important Difference (MID) is a measure of true clinical relevance of a difference, with suggested MID for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) being 2 to 3 points. Change from baseline to 6 months is presented, where a positive value represents the 6 month value minus the baseline value.</description>
