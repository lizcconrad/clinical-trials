  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum NGAL has been described as a biomarker of neutrophil activation and an inflammatory
      marker which correlates to obesity and its metabolic complications. Since neutrophil
      activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease, the
      investigators hypothesized that serum NGAL levels would be higher in patients with CAD and
      that serum concentration would correlate with the extent of CAD as documented by coronary
      angiography, serving as a potential biomarker of the severity of CAD.

    <textblock>
      Inflammation is considered to play a major role in coronary artery disease (CAD) which
      accounts for high morbidity and mortality rates in the western world. Several lines of
      evidence support a role for neutrophils in the development of atherosclerosis and its
      progression.

      Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), also known as Lipocalin-2, is a 25-kDa
      secretory glycoprotein that was originally identified in mouse kidney cells and human
      neutrophil granules. This protein has been used as a marker of neutrophil activation in
      several studies, while recently it was found to be an inflammatory marker closely related to
      obesity and its metabolic complications.

      Recently, lactoferrin, a protein which co-localizes with NGAL in the specific granules of
      human neutrophils has been proposed as a more dynamic marker of neutrophil activation
      compared to the widely used myeloperoxidase in patients with CAD.

      In line with the accumulating evidence, this study is designed to investigate the
      relationship between serum NGAL concentration and the presence or the severity of coronary
      artery disease according to coronary angiography.
