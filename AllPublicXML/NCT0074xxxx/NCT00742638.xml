  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomised, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and safety of
      quetiapine and valproate used as monotherapy in the treatment of mania in patients
      hospitalised for an acute manic episode. After given of informed consent and undergoing
      screening procedures, the patients will be randomised into quetiapine or valproate group on
      Day 1. The efficacy of study treatment on symptoms of mania will be assessed at Day 28.
      Patients will not permitted to use any psychoactive or antipsychotic medications throughout
      the study period other than those expressly permitted by the protocol.

      At each centre, the same individual will administer a specific psychiatric assessment for a
      patient at all study visits in order to reduce variability in rating scale scoring. Before
      the initiation of the study, a consistency assessment will be done among the investigators
      who conduct the scale assessment in each centre.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for using the quetiapine to treat patients with acute mania is multifold. A
      potential major advantage for quetiapine is its demonstrated tolerability. Because of the low
      incidence of EPS, quetiapine should be better tolerated than other antipsychotic medications
      in this sensitive patient population. The limited potential for weight gain and prolactin
      elevation may promote long-term treatment compliance.

      The effect of quetiapine alone or adjunctive with mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute
      mania in patients with bipolar disorder has been confirmed through 4 phase III clinical
      trials (8,9). Based on the results of these clinical trials, the use of Seroquel in the acute
      mania of bipolar disorder has been approved in US, UK and other major markets in Europe.
      Quetiapine is also been recommended as alternative therapy for acute mania treatment in the
      practice guideline (10). The present study is to assess the effectiveness of quetiapine and
      valproate in the treatment of Chinese patients with acute mania over a treatment period of 4
      weeks. Primary objective The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness
      of quetiapine fumarate used as monotherapy in the treatment of symptoms of acute mania in
      patients with bipolar disorder, by evaluation of the change from baseline in YMRS total score
      at Day 28 (LOCF).

      Secondary objectives

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the following:

        -  The effectiveness of quetiapine used as monotherapy to treat symptoms in patients with
           acute mania by evaluation of YMRS/CGI response rate at Day 28 (LOCF)

        -  The effectiveness of quetiapine used as monotherapy to improve clinical status in
           patients with acute mania by evaluation of change from baseline in CGI-S score at Day 28
           (LOCF)

        -  The effectiveness of quetiapine used as monotherapy to treat depressive symptoms in
           patients with acute mania by evaluation of change from baseline in MADRS total score at
           Day 28 (LOCF)

        -  The effectiveness of quetiapine used as monotherapy to treat psychotic symptoms in
           patients with acute mania by evaluation of change from baseline in PANSS total score at
           Day 28 (LOCF)

        -  The safety and tolerability of quetiapine used as monotherapy to treat symptoms in
           patients with acute mania
