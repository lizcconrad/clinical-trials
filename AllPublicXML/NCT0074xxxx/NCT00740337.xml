    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth most common cause of death in the
      United States. There is no cure and the disease gets worse over time. Although it usually
      occurs in people who smoke cigarettes, researchers do not know exactly how smoking leads to
      COPD. This study will compare blood and tissue samples from smokers and nonsmokers with and
      without COPD to determine why some COPD symptoms occur in some people and not others.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a chronic lung disease in which the lungs' airways and balloon-like air sacs, called
      alveoli, are damaged, lose their shape, and become floppy. As a result, they cannot fully
      inflate to allow the maximum amount of air through. COPD is usually the result of many years
      of cigarette smoking. Breathing in other kinds of lung irritants, such as pollution, dust, or
      chemicals, over a long period of time may also cause or contribute to COPD. Some people with
      COPD have an excess of mucus in their lungs, possibly caused by an overactive immune
      response, which can lead to coughing and shortness of breath. Although cigarette smoking
      seems to make this symptom worse, researchers are not sure why it occurs in some people and
      not others. This study will examine and compare blood and lung tissue samples from smokers
      and nonsmokers with and without COPD to determine what physiological differences,
      environmental factors, genes, and biomarkers contribute to the development of and symptoms
      associated with COPD.

      Before their scheduled lung resection surgery, participants in this study will attend one
      study visit. It will last approximately 1 to 2 hours and will consist of answering questions
      about medical history, filling out health questionnaires, and providing a blood sample. After
      the surgery, study researchers will take the lung tissue that was removed and examine it in a
      laboratory. Participants will be contacted by study staff if, when examining the lung tissue,
      researchers discover that a participant has a medical disorder that current treatment can
      stop or improve. Also, participants will be contacted at the end of the study to answer brief
      questions about their health.
