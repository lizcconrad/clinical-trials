  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of VPM is the development of a recombinant urease C-deficient listeriolysin expressing
      BCG vaccine strain (VPM1002) as a safe, well tolerated and efficacious vaccine against TB for
      residents in endemic areas and persons at risk in non-endemic areas. The new live vaccine
      VPM1002 should be at least as potent as the currently used BCG vaccine and should cause fewer
      side effects (Kaufmann, 2007; Grode et al., 2005). It is formulated as lyophilised bacteria
      to be resuspended before intradermal injection. First application of VPM1002 in human male
      volunteers will evaluate its safety, local and systemic tolerability as well as its
      immunogenicity. The study has a dose-escalating sequential design with comparison to
      commercially available BCG. 80 volunteers in Germany will randomly be allocated to 4 groups
      each with 20 volunteers stratified for their history of BCG-vaccination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male volunteers 18 to 55 years of age.
