  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center clinical trial that will assess the
      safety and effectiveness of investigational models of the Promote™ RF CRT-D and Current™ RF
      ICD devices. These new ICD and CRT-D devices have new features that allow the device to
      periodically check how much energy is needed to pace a patient's heart and to automatically
      adjust the amount of energy used to pace the heart.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled in the study will have their device tested to determine if the device
      can automatically measure how much energy is needed to pace the patient's heart. If the test
      is successful, the patient's device will be programmed to turn that feature on. 3 months
      after enrollment, the patient will return to the clinic to have their device re-tested using
      an automatic test method to measure the amount of energy needed to make the patient's heart
      beat. A manual test method will also be used to measure the amount of energy needed to make
      the patient's heart beat. The intent of the study is to show the automatic method works just
      as well as the manual method.

    <measure>Atrial AutoCapture (ACap) Confirm Effectiveness Endpoint - Absolute Difference Between the Automatic and Manual Capture Threshold Test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post implant</time_frame>
    <description>Atrial AutoCapture Confirm is an automatic test that the device performs without any interaction by the physician and is one of the features being evaluated in the study. The test temporarily decreases the atrial pacing voltage until it determines that the device is no longer capturing the atria. That value is reported to the physician when the device is read by the programmer. This endpoint looks at the absolute difference between this automated test and a manual test in which the physician decreases the atrial pulse voltage and determines the atrial threshold by viewing the EKG.</description>

    <description>Ventricular AutoCapture is an automatic test that the device performs without any interaction by the physician and is one of the features being evaluated in the study. The test temporarily decreases the ventricular pacing voltage until it determines that the device is no longer capturing the ventricles. That value is reported to the physician when the device is read by the programmer. This endpoint looks at the absolute difference between this automated test and a manual test in which the physician decreases the ventricular pulse voltage and determines the ventricular threshold by viewing the EKG.</description>

        <title>Atrial AutoCapture (ACap) Confirm Effectiveness Endpoint - Absolute Difference Between the Automatic and Manual Capture Threshold Test</title>
        <description>Atrial AutoCapture Confirm is an automatic test that the device performs without any interaction by the physician and is one of the features being evaluated in the study. The test temporarily decreases the atrial pacing voltage until it determines that the device is no longer capturing the atria. That value is reported to the physician when the device is read by the programmer. This endpoint looks at the absolute difference between this automated test and a manual test in which the physician decreases the atrial pulse voltage and determines the atrial threshold by viewing the EKG.</description>
