  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is caused by unresolved thromboemboli
      in the pulmonary arteries, which lead to pulmonary hypertension and, left untreated, right
      heart failure. This disease can be potentially cured by performing a pulmonary
      thromboendarterectomy (PTE) to remove the blood clots. The surgery is not without risk and
      the most worrisome complication is the development of a form of acute lung injury called
      reperfusion lung injury, which occurs in about 40 percent of patients.

      The landmark publication of the ARDSNET study demonstrated that a low tidal volume strategy
      of mechanical ventilation, decreased morbidity and mortality in patients who had acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since then there have been some studies examining the
      role of a low tidal volume strategy in all patients who are mechanically ventilated. Some
      studies have demonstrated a decreased incidence of acute lung injury while others have failed
      to do the same. In patients at high risk for developing acute lung injury, such as patients
      undergoing PTE, there may be a benefit to using low tidal volumes to reduce the incidence of
      reperfusion lung injury.

      To assess the efficacy of a low tidal volume ventilation strategy in patients undergoing PTE,
      134 patients will be randomized at the time of surgery to either low tidal volumes (6ml/kg of
      ideal body weight), or standard tidal volumes (10ml/kg of ideal body weight). Patients will
      be followed clinically to assess for the development of reperfusion lung injury. This will be
      defined as the development of hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 300) and chest infiltrates
      in the area of reperfused lung with no other identifiable etiology within the first 72 hours
      of surgery. Patients will also be assessed for other factors known to contribute to acute
      lung injury including: plateau pressures, peak inspiratory pressures, fluid balance, and
      number of transfusions received. Secondary endpoints of the study will be: time to successful
      spontaneous breathing trial, ventilator free days, ICU free days, hospital free days, and
      mortality.
