      The purpose of the study is to gather clinical information on the safety and efficacy of the
      resurfacing devices in the young, active patient with advanced hip disease. Study enrollment
      has been temporarily suspended due to a change in the surgical technique.

      Safety will be evaluated based on the frequency and incidence of any device related adverse
      events or unanticipated adverse device events. The efficacy will be measured by comparing the
      overall functional performance based on the Harris Hip Score, implant survivorship, and
      radiographic parameters, including radiolucencies, osteolysis, stem subsidence, cup
      migration, and change in cup angle and a change in the femoral shaft angle.
