  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the additional
      administration of scopolamine butylbromide, glucagon or NPO-11 following a single
      intragastric dose of NPO-11 during endoscopy in healthy adult men. The safety will be
      evaluated based on adverse events and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed with NPO-11 +
      scopolamine butylbromide or glucagon, and following additional administration of NPO-11. The
      efficacy will be evaluated based on changes in the frequency of gastric peristalsis
      classification after the initial dose and the additional dose, and on the presence or absence
      of gastric peristalsis at each evaluation point.

             glucagon in the investigator's or subinvestigator's opinion based on health interview

          6. Volunteers who have been exposed to NPO-11

          7. Volunteers who have received other investigational drugs within four months before
             consent or who are participating in other clinical studies

          8. Volunteers otherwise ineligible for participation in the study in the investigator's
