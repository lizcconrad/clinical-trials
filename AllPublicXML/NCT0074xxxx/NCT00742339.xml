  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From 1999, several studies have showed that the use of vasoconstrictors in association with
      albumin are effective in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The rationale of the
      use of vasoconstrictors together with albumin in the treatment of this severe complication of
      portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis is to correct the reduction of the effective
      circulating volume due to the splanchnic arterial vasodilatation.In most of these studies
      terlipressin, a derivate of vasopressin, has been used as vasoconstrictor as intravenous
      boluses moving from an initial dose of 0.5-1 mg/4 hr. In some studies midodrine, an
      alpha-adrenergic agonist, given by mouth has been used as vasoconstrictor at a dose ranging
      from 2.5 up to 12.5 tid together with octreotide, an inhibitor of the release of glucagon,
      given subcutaneously at a dose ranging from 10 µg upt to 200 µg tid. To the day, there isn't
      a study comparing terlipressin + albumin versus midodrine + octreotide + albumin in the
      treatment of HRS in patients with cirrhosis.Thus, the aim of the study is to compare
      terlipressin + albumin vs midodrine + octreotide + albumin in the treatment of the HRS in
      patients with cirrhosis.

    <intervention_name>Terlipressin plus albumin</intervention_name>
    <description>The terlipressin will be give at the initial dose of 3 mg/24 hours by intravenous continuous infusion. If during the following 48 hours the serum value of creatinine will not change or will go down less than 25%, the dose of terlipressin will be increased to 6 mg/24 hours. If no response will ensue, the dose of terlipressin will be increased to the maximal dose of 12 mg/24 hours. Twenty percent human albumin solution will be administrate together with terlipressin at the dosage of 1 g/Kg of body weight, on first day, and then, to the dosage of 20-40 g/Kg in order to maintain the central venous pressure (CVP) between 10 and 15 cm H2O.The treatment with terlipressin and albumin will be maintained for 24 hours after complete or incomplete resolution. The length of the study in patients with complete and incomplete resolution will reach a maximum of 15 days. In the patients without response the treatment with the high dosage of terlipressin will go on for a maximum of 7 days.</description>

If during the following 96 hours the serum value of creatinine will not change or will go down less than 25%, the dose of midodrine will be increased to 12.5 mg tid Twenty percent human albumin solution will be administrate together with midodrine and octreotide at the dosage of 1 g/Kg of body weight, on first day, and then, to the dosage of 20-40 g/Kg in order to maintain the central venous pressure (CVP) between 10 and 15 cm H2O.The treatment with terlipressin and albumin will be maintained for 24 hours after complete or incomplete resolution.
