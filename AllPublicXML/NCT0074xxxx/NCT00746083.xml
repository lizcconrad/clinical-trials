      The purpose of Challenge! is to determine if adolescents enrolled in a health promotion/
      obesity prevention program will have a healthier BMI-for-age z-score and body composition
      (body fat %), will consume a healthier diet, and engage in higher levels of physical activity
      compared to those that did not receive the intervention over time.

    <textblock>
      Pediatric overweight is a major public health problem in the US, with the prevalence of
      overweight among children of all ages increasing dramatically over the past several decades.
      Interventions aimed at reducing the increased weight gain during adolescence have produced
      mixed results.

      Challenge! is a randomized controlled trial for health promotion/ obesity prevention
      targeting low-income, urban, African American adolescents. Healthy adolescents were recruited
      from an urban medical center and from local middle schools. Weight status was not part of the
      inclusion criteria.

      The intervention was home- and community-based and delivered one-on-one to each adolescent by
      a college-age &quot;personal trainer&quot;. The intervention focused on goal-setting, consuming a
      healthy diet (increase fruits, vegetables, and water, and decrease high-fat snack and
      convenience foods), and increasing physical activity. We hypothesized that the teens enrolled
      in the intervention would have a healthier BMI-for-age z-score and a healthier body
      composition (body fat %) compared to those that did not receive the intervention over time.
      Additionally, we hypothesized that those enrolled in the intervention would consume healthier
      diets and have higher levels of physical activity compared to those that did not receive the
      intervention over time.

    <description>Each adolescent in the intervention group received 12 lessons administered in adolescent's home or community by a &quot;personal trainer&quot; (a college-aged mentor). The lessons focused on behavior change relating to diet and physical activity and was based on social cognitive theory. At the end of each lesson the adolescent set a behavior change goal for themselves. The adolescents were taught how to track their goals and they discussed thir ability/inability to meet their goals at each meeting with their personal trainer.</description>
