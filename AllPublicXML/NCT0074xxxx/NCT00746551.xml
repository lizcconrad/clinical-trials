  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of body iron storage replenishment
      between low dose intravenous iron and oral iron in late pregnancy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite routine antenatal oral iron supplementation, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia
      (IDA) in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy in developing countries remains high. Apparently,
      intravenous iron sucrose appears to be safe and efficient in treating within a short period.
      From literature review, no study of intravenous iron for IDA treatment has been carried out
      in the third trimester of pregnancy. This research aims to compare the efficacy of body iron
      storage replenishment at 3 weeks as labor may take place at this point in some women. In this
      study,500 mg intravenous iron has been given weekly instead of every other day for the sake
      of patient's convenience in the hope that parenteral iron may become another alternative for
      treatment of pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia who have difficulties or failures
      with oral iron.

            <description>Patients in the study group (ISC-group) were given 500 mg of ISC (Venofer®, Vifor International AG, St. Gallen, Switzerland) in three divided doses. The administration was given weekly with the maximum dose of 200 mg from GA 33 to 35 weeks. Thereafter, no other iron supplementation was given to this group until delivery. In preparation, 200 mg of ISC was diluted into 100 ml of 0.9% saline solution. Test dose was performed by slow infusion of 5 ml solution within 5 minutes. This was only required on the first ISC treatment.
If no adverse reactions were observed in 15 minutes, the remaining solution was infused to the patient within 30 minutes. Subsequent infusions were administered in 40 minutes. Careful post infusion observation was conducted in every case for at least 30 minutes to ensure patient safety.
Patients in the ISC-group who failed to complete the 3-week treatment course were withdrawn from the trial.</description>

Patients in the OFF-group who took less than 80% of the allocated medication were withdrawn from the trial.</description>
