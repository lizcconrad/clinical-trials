    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, pharmacokinetic study investigating the bioavailability of flavonoids
      and phenolic acids from cranberry juice cocktail and their breakdown products (in vivo
      metabolites) in healthy, older adults. Our hypothesis is that the compounds will be poorly
      but rapidly absorbed from the intestines and found in plasma and urine in extensively
      metabolized forms. These compounds will be rapidly cleared from plasma. Substantial amounts
      of unabsorbed compounds will be found in the stools.

      Cranberries are a particularly rich source of phenolic acids and polyphenols, particularly
      flavonoids. Among the 20 most commonly consumed fruits in the American diet, cranberries have
      the highest total phenol content. Health benefits attributed to cranberries include the
      prevention of urinary tract infections and stomach ulcers as well as improved oral hygiene.
      These benefits appear to be due principally to the ability of cranberries to interfere with
      the adhesion of some bacteria to select cell types and surfaces.

      Cranberries and cranberry constituents, including several phenolic and polyphenolic
      compounds, have also been shown to possess antibacterial, antiviral, anti-mutagenic,
      anti-carcinogenic, anti-tumorigenic, anti-angiogenic, and antioxidant activities. Most of
      this evidence is derived from in vitro studies and animal models. The limited number of human
      studies available indicate these phytochemicals are bioavailable and bioactive. However, more
      information is required on the bioavailability and metabolism of cranberry polyphenols, as
      well as on the relationship between cranberry dose and duration of use, to better understand
      their impact on risk factors for chronic diseases.
