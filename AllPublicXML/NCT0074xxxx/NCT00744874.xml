      This trial was a non-randomized, multi-center, prospective study of subjects with
      symptomatic, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). The purpose of this study was to
      investigate and confirm the safety, efficacy and efficiency of the Medtronic Ablation
      Frontiers® Cardiac Ablation System when used for the treatment of paroxysmal AF. The trial
      was conducted over a 2 year period with enrollment occurring between 4 October 2007 and 1
      December 2008.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Successful Pulmonary Vein Isolation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acute effectiveness was defined as successful isolation of all pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein isolation was documented by the absence of pulmonary vein potentials when assessed by electrogram tracings in sinus rhythm using the PVAC catheter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint for chronic effectiveness was the evaluation of the proportion of subjects with treatment success computed at the 6 month visit. In order to be classified as a chronic success, all subjects were required to meet the following criteria: Absence of clinically significant AF (greater than 60 seconds) or left atrial tachycardia recorded on a 7-day Holter, absence of symptomatic AF after a 3 month blanking period, off all Class I and III AADs at 6 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Acute Safety Endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that were procedure- and/or device-related within 7 days after the ablation procedure. The relatedness of each event was assessed by the investigator at each site.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>7 day post procedure to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Chronic Safety Endpoint was the proportion of subjects with serious procedure- and/or device-related events in the 7 day to 6 month follow-up period post-ablation. The relatedness of each event was assessed by the investigator at each site.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Atrial Fibrillation Symptom Severity Scores From Baseline to 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated the severity of their AF-related symptoms at baseline and at each follow-up visit for the study. Symptoms that were assessed at each visit included the presence of palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness, and/or lack of energy upon exertion or exercise. Each symptom was rated on a scale from 1 (no symptoms) to 5 (most severe). Total scores were obtained by adding up the rating for each symptom to obtain a range of results between 5 (asymptomatic) to 25 (severely symptomatic).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Short Form 36 Question (SF-36) Health Survey Quality of Life Survey at 6 Months Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a short-form health survey of 36 questions that yields an 8-scale health profile as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures. In order to assess improvement in self-perceived quality of life, subjects were asked to complete SF-36 questionnaires at baseline and at each follow-up visit. The results of the Physical Component and Mental Component scores from the two summary measures that aggregate sub-scales were then compared.The SF-36 subscales range from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest). The subscales are averaged together for a total score between 0 to 100. A higher score represents a better outcome when compared to a lower score.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of the Cumulative RF Time for Pulmonary Vein(PV)Isolation of All Accessible Pulmonary Veins</measure>

        <description>Subjects rated the severity of their AF-related symptoms at baseline and at each follow-up visit for the study. Symptoms that were assessed at each visit included the presence of palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or dizziness, and/or lack of energy upon exertion or exercise. Each symptom was rated on a scale from 1 (no symptoms) to 5 (most severe). Total scores were obtained by adding up the rating for each symptom to obtain a range of results between 5 (asymptomatic) to 25 (severely symptomatic).</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a short-form health survey of 36 questions that yields an 8-scale health profile as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures. In order to assess improvement in self-perceived quality of life, subjects were asked to complete SF-36 questionnaires at baseline and at each follow-up visit. The results of the Physical Component and Mental Component scores from the two summary measures that aggregate sub-scales were then compared.The SF-36 subscales range from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest). The subscales are averaged together for a total score between 0 to 100. A higher score represents a better outcome when compared to a lower score.</description>
