    <textblock>
      This an open-label study designed to evaluate the anti-tumour activity and safety of Prolarix
      in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Prolarix is a chemotherapy comprised of tretazicar as prodrug and caricotamide as
      co-substrate for the endogenous enzyme, NQO2.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumour effects of treatment with
      Prolarix in subjects with advanced HCC (Child-Pugh A and B only).

      All subjects will receive an IV infusion of Prolarix once every 21 days until disease
      progression is observed.

      Subjects will have CT scans for tumour measurements before starting treatment with Prolarix
      and every 6 weeks until disease progression.

      Subjects will undergo evaluation for safety (adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory
      measurements, weight, ECG) every 21 days until disease progression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject must have a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of HCC and be considered
             unsuitable for resection or other potentially curative options (eg, liver transplant,
             curative radiofrequency ablation).

          -  Subject must have a measurable lesion by RECIST on CT scan in at least one site which
             has not received radiation or any other local therapy [eg, transcatheter arterial
             chemoembolisation (TACE), radiofrequency ablation, local injection]. (Note: Subjects
             who have received local therapies will be allowed to participate, provided that they
             have a target lesion which has not been subjected to local therapy. Subjects who have
             received TACE must have a target lesion outside of the vascular territory subjected to
             chemoembolisation.)

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Subject has had no other active malignancy within the past three years [other than non
             melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the breast, bladder, or uterine
             cervix. Subjects with Ta (non-invasive papillary carcinoma) or Tis (sessile carcinoma
             in situ) bladder cancer are allowed].

          -  Subject has a minimum life expectancy of at least three months as determined by the
             investigator.

          -  Subject has adequate bone marrow function (ie, haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL, granulocytes
             ≥1500/mm3, platelets ≥75,000/mm3).

          -  Prothrombin time (PT)-international normalised ratio (INR) ≤2.3 or PT ≤6 seconds above
             control. (Note: Subjects who are being therapeutically anticoagulated with an agent
             such as warfarin or heparin will be allowed to participate provided that their INR is
             between 2.0 and 3.0.

          -  Subject has adequate renal function (ie, serum creatinine is normal or calculated
             creatinine clearance is ≥60 mL/min).

          -  Subject has adequate hepatic function (ie, bilirubin ≤2x upper limit of normal (ULN);
             AST ALT, and alkaline phosphatase ≤5xULN). (Also see exclusion for Child-Pugh class C
             below).

          -  Male subjects and females of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception from the time of initiation of treatment through study
             participation and for 3 months after release from the study.

          -  Subject is able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior or current systemic pharmacotherapy for HCC (cytotoxic, targeted or
             biologic). (Note: TACE is not considered to be systemic pharmacotherapy for the
             purpose of this study).

          -  Subject has an absolute contraindication to receiving CT contrast media. (Note:
             Subjects with a history of minor contrast reactions may be pre-medicated prior to
             contrast administration in accordance with local or institutional practice).

          -  Subject has Child-Pugh Class C hepatic impairment.

          -  Subject has received an investigational drug within 30 days of enrolment in the study.

          -  Females of childbearing potential unless using adequate contraception.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Major variceal bleeding in the last 30 days.

          -  Subjects with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
