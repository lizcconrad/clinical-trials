  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group active
      extension of LAQ/5062 study (NCT2004-003943-28), assessing the tolerability, safety and
      efficacy of two doses (0.3 mg and 0.6 mg) of laquinimod, orally administered, in subjects
      with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), followed by an open-label phase of
      laquinimod 0.6 mg daily.

      Study LAQ/5063 consists of two periods:

        -  The first period of the extension study is an active, double-blind period. Participants
           from the active treatment arms in LAQ/5062 continue their assigned treatment in blinded
           fashion. Participants who were assigned to placebo treatment in LAQ/5062 are equally
           randomized in blinded-fashion to laquinimod 0.6 mg or laquinimod 0.3 mg

        -  Once Termination visit of LAQ/5063 active double-blind phase (completion of the full 36
           weeks or as requested by the Sponsor) is performed, all participants continue on
           laquinimod 0.6 mg daily as an open-label intervention. The open-label period continues
           as long as the Sponsor continues the development of laquinimod 0.6 mg for RRMS or early
           discontinuation.
