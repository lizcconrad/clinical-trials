      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of the investigational drug, SB-509 on
      progression of the disease in subjects with ALS

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SB-509 contains the gene (DNAâ€”a kind of biological &quot;blueprint&quot;) for a protein. When a study
      doctor injects SB-509 into the muscles of your neck, arms and/or legs, the drug enters the
      muscle and nerve cells around the injection sites and causes these cells to make a protein.
      This protein causes your cells to increase production of one of your own protein called
      vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF-A), which may improve the structure and function of
      nerves and muscles. In addition, there are changes in the levels of 28 additional proteins in
      your cells. These proteins function to promote the growth of cells, are structures in cells,
      help synthesize products, and affect immune cells, and some have unknown functions. This
      increase in your own VEGF proteins may protect and repair the damaged nerves and muscles
      caused by ALS.

          -  Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &gt; 60% of predicted

          -  Less than 3 years of ALS since the onset of the first symptom with clinical evidence
             of limb muscle atrophy and weakness.

          -  Dependent upon invasive or non-invasive artificial ventilation

          -  Patients with bulbar onset ALS or with other active neuromuscular/ neurodegenerative
             diseases.

          -  Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.

          -  Evidence of chronic or active heart, liver, kidney, or lung diseases, or Age-related
