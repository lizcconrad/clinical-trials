      The purpose of this study is to determine if women who have chiropractic care, according to
      the Logan Basic Protocol for adjusting, during pregnancy have an easier, shorter labor and
      delivery as compared to women who haven't had chiropractic care during pregnancy.

      This study will be designed to test if the Logan Basic Technique system of adjusting pregnant
      women can reduce labor time and increase the ease of labor and delivery as compared to the
      labor times reported by Kilpatrick and Laros in the obstetric literature. It is proposed that
      women who have regular chiropractic care throughout pregnancy or at least for the third
      trimester will have an easier labor and delivery as well as a shorter labor time than is
      reported in the literature.
