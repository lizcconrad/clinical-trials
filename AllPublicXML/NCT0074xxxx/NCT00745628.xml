      More than 40 hospitals of 16 provinces will enroll patients for this study. The study will
      include patients with diagnosed coronary heart disease. Investigators and all the physicians
      who will involve in daily care of CHD patients will have a brief training on guideline of
      secondary prevention in CHD and take a test on that. Questionnaires are used to evaluate
      patient's cognition of their diseases and knowledge on coronary heart disease. Patient
      education will be carried out during a 2 years follow up of all the patient enrolled before
      they are required to fill out another questionnaire. Physicians will also take a second test
      on secondary prevention of CHD at that time. Patients will take blood lipids and glucose test
      according to their physician's requirement.The effect of physician training and patient
      education will be evaluated by comparing the results of questionnaires and tests at the
      beginning of the study and in the end of the 2 years follow up.
