      Study CNI-1493-CD06 is an open, single-arm extension studies to CD03 and CD05. CDAI is the
      only efficacy measure assessed in this study. The safety of multiple courses of semapimod is
      to be determined by the incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study was open to patients who had satisfactorily completed either study CNI-1493-CD-03
        or CNI-1493-CD-05. Initial entry criteria were:

          1. Patients who satisfactorily completed either study CNI-1493-CD-03 or CD-05 were
             eligible for participation in this study. Satisfactory completion was defined as
             follows:

               1. The patient completed 5 treatment courses in the previous trial.

               2. The patient had responded to treatment, as defined by a decrease in CDAI of at
                  least 70 points from original baseline (prior to treatment on study CD-02 or
                  CD-04) at the last assessment for study CD-03 or CD-05, respectively. The
                  decrease had to be attributable to semapimod treatment. Thus, patients whose
                  response was attributable to other anti-Crohn's disease therapy are not to be
                  included.

               3. The patient had no adverse event &gt;grade 2 felt to be probably or definitely
                  related to study medication.

               4. The patient did not meet any discontinuation criterion in previous trial.

          2. Patients had to sign informed consent specifically for this study, in addition to the
             consents for the previous studies, CNI-1493-CD-02 or CD-03, and CNI-1493-CD-04 or
             CD-05.

          3. Patients could not take any other investigational therapies during the course of this
             study.

          4. Men and women of childbearing potential had to be using a barrier method (diaphragm or
             condom) of contraception and continue doing so for at least 3 months after last study
             medication. It was strongly recommended that two forms be used.

          5. Patients had to be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and/or protocol
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Could not have met any of the exclusion criteria for the CD02, 03, 04 or 05 studies.
