  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is aimed at exploring the application of novel tracking technique for the study
      of spatial activity among dementia patients and its implication on their families. The study
      sample will be composed of three groups of volunteers, each including100 participants aged
      over 60 years. The first group will include MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) patients. The
      second group will include patients that suffer from mild dementia. The third group will
      include age matched healthy participants. The tracking equipment will be a GPS apparatus of
      450 gms that will be carried by the participants for 24 hours along 2-4 weeks. The GPS data
      will be transferred via the cellular network to operator center at the Hebrew university at
      Jerusalem, and will be documented in assigned data files. This monitoring procedure will be
      held every year and along a period of five years. The impact of the patient behavior on the
      care giver will be studied by means of five interviews along the tracking period.

    <description>The participant will take the GPS kit with him/her everywhere during the whole day for a period of 4 weeks. The GPS tracking kit consists of a GPS receiver with a GSM modem, an RF transmitter contained in a wrist-watch and a monitoring unit located in the home that enables researchers to know whenever the tracked person leaves home. The waterproof RF transmitter will allow researchers to know whether or not research subjects leave home with the GPS device and if they are carrying the device or not at a given moment.</description>
