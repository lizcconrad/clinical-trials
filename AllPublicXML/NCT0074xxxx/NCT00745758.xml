      Extensive research has shown that the big event that leads to the initiation of vasospasm is
      the release of oxyhemoglobin (blood breakdown product).Depletion of NO synthase (19,20,21)
      was also noted after SAH.CSF is produced from choroid plexus in the ventricle. If the SAH is
      too dense, the blood in the subarachnoid space will not easy to be washed out.

      Cerebral vasospasm remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in patients with
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) after an aneurysmal rupture. Despite being a significant source
      of morbidity and mortality, death and disability from vasospasm have declined from
      approximately 35% in the early 1970's, to between 15% and 20% in the 1980's to &lt;10% in the
      1990's(1,2,3,4).Extensive research has shown that the big event that leads to the initiation
      of vasospasm is the release of oxyhemoglobin (blood breakdown product)(1,12,13). This
      mechanism appears to be a multifactorial process that involves the generation of free
      radicals, lipid peroxidation and activation of protein kinase C as well as phospholipase C
      and A2 with resultant accumulation of diacylglycerol and the release of
      endothelin-1(14,15,16,17,18). On the other hand, depletion of NO synthase (19,20,21) was also
      noted after SAH. Previous reports showed that shunting of CSF through a lumbar drain after an
      SAH markedly reduces the risk of clinically evident vasospasm and its sequelae, shortens
      hospital stay, and improves outcome. Its beneficial effects are probably mediated through the
      removal of spasmogens that exist in the CSF(22). In our preliminary data, we have
      demonstrated a case with severe vasospasm, CSF was collected both from EVD and lumbar drain.
      The ADMA level and amount of Nitrate was well correlate with vasospasm and the level was much
      higher in lumbar drain then EVD. So, we will compared the CSF from EVD and lumbar puncture to
      see which factor is correlate with vasospasm.
