  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinically widely used X-ray computed tomography examination has a low-grade radiation
      effect and recently has attracted much attention concerning the possible adverse effects of
      radiation on human body [ref. 1-5]. The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells
      mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we
      can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography
      examination and the blood ROS level. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to clarify if
      the routinely applied abdominal X-ray computed tomography examination may induce a higher
      level of ROS in the peripheral blood.

      Study subjects will be patients who are admitted to our hospital because of abdominal
      diseases that need to receive abdominal X-ray computed tomography examination for diagnosis.
      In total, sixty cases will be enrolled for the study. The formal consent will be delivered
      and explained to the patients and families several hours before the performance of abdominal
      X-ray computed tomography. The formal consent will be retrieved and then the peripheral blood
      will be sampled just before the performance of computed tomography.ROS level in the sampled
      peripheral blood, before and after the performance of abdominal X-ray computed tomography,
      will be measured, compared, and analyzed. Totally 120 blood samples, including 60 samples
      just before and 60 samples 2 hours after the performance of computed tomography, will be
      collected from 60 study subjects within 5 months (August 10 ~ December 30, 2008). Reactive
      oxygen species（ROS）levels will be measured by a chemiluminescence (CL) analysing system
      (CLD-110, Tohoku Electronic Industrial, Sendai, Japan).
