    <textblock>
      The INDICOR study is a controlled, prospective, multicenter, randomized, two arm phase-II
      real world study assessing the acute, 6 months, and 12 months and 3 year outcome of
      cobalt-chromium stent (Coroflex Blue) deployment followed by Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon
      dilatation (SeQuent Please) and of Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon dilatation (SeQuent
      Please) followed by cobalt-chromium stent (Coroflex Blue) deployment for the treatment of
      de-novo and restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries. The study will be conducted in
      India.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cobalt-chromium stent
      (Coroflex Blue) deployment followed by Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon dilatation (SeQuent
      Please) and of Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon dilatation (SeQuent Please) followed by
      cobalt-chromium stent (Coroflex Blue) deployment in a real world scenario including up to two
      de-novo or restenotic lesions ( no in-stent restenoses) in two different native coronary
      arteries (reference diameter: 2.5mm and 4.0mm, length of stenosis 10mm and 25mm) for
      procedural success and preservation of vessel patency up to 3 years

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with stable angina pectoris (CCS class 1-3) or with unstable angina pectoris
             (Braunwald class 1-2, A-C) or documented ischemia or with documented silent ischemia

          -  Patients eligible for coronary revascularization by means of PCI

          -  Patients suitable for coronary revascularization of any sort (balloon angioplasty,
             device-assisted balloon-angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting)

          -  Patients must be older then 18 years of age

          -  Women of childbearing potential may not be pregnant nor have the desire to becoming
             pregnant during the first year following the study procedure. Hence, patients will be

             follow-up.

          -  Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the study
             and to show sufficient compliance in following the study protocol
