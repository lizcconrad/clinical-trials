      This observational study will explore the Swedish national population of patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on infliximab maintenance therapy in order to identify patients who
      may be eligible for a dose reduction study. Patients will be asked a variety of questions
      regarding their treatment dosing and disease activity, and then asked whether or not they
      would consider participating in a dose reduction study. Patients in this study will be
      described in terms of demographic and disease characteristics.

      Already known Subjects (RA and on at least 12 months ongoing Remicade treatment) from the
      clinic could participate if they are eligible.
