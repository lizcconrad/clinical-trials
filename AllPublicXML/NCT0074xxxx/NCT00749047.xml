    <textblock>
      Pioglitazone is an insulin sensitising drug used in the treatment of patients with type 2
      diabetes. In addition to its blood sugar lowering effect, pioglitazone also has a number of
      other beneficial effects, one of which is to reduce the loss of protein in the urine. The
      mechanism of this protein &quot;sparing effect&quot; of pioglitazone is not fully understood. The
      proposed study will investigate whether pioglitazone has beneficial effects on the filtration
      characteristics of filters in the kidney that are responsible for retaining protein in the
      body. The effect of pioglitazone on the size of the pores in the filters and also the
      electrostatic charge barriers that surround these pores will be investigated. The clinical
      study will involve 12 patients with type 2 diabetes with minimal urine protein loss, taking
      low dose pioglitazone for 3 months. Blood and urine samples will be collected at the
      beginning, mid point and end of the study and used to measure the concentration of specific
      proteins of different size and electrostatic charge. This data will be used to identify and
      characterise changes in the filtration properties of the kidney filters during the study.

      In addition to their insulin sensitising action, thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have beneficial
      effects on vascular function. These include a decrease in proteinuria and amelioration of
      diabetic nephropathy. Although the anti-proteinuric effect of TZDs is well established the
      mechanism(s) underlying these changes has yet to be determined. Possible mechanisms include
      altered renal haemodynamics, maintenance of anionic electrostatic filtration barriers in the
      glomerular basement membrane and pleiotropic effects.

      The target of TZDs, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), directly
      modulate vessel wall function. The kidney differentially expresses all PPAR isoforms and
      there is evidence that TZDs have pleiotropic effects in the kidney over and above their
      metabolic and haemodynamic actions. These effects include a direct action on cultured
      mesangial cells, inhibition of in vivo mesangial expansion, reduction in podocyte injury, and
      decreased production of type IV collagen and urinary endothelin-1 levels in early stage
      diabetic nephropathy.

      Glomerular ultrafiltration of plasma proteins is governed by the size of the filtration pores
      and the extent of anionic sites in the basement membrane and podocyte slit pore junction. It
      is possible that the anti-proteinuric effect of TZDs is attributable to an increase in size
      and/or charge selectivity in the glomerular filtration barrier. A Medline search showed there
      have been no studies on the effect of TZDs on protein ultrafiltration. The aim of the
      proposed study is to measure urinary protein size and charge selectivity in patients with
      early stage diabetic nephropathy before and after treatment with the TZD, pioglitazone.
