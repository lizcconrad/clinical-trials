  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study of MNRP1685A
      administered by IV infusion every 3 weeks in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      solid tumors for whom standard therapy either does not exist or has proven to be ineffective
      or intolerable. This study will be conducted at up to three study centers in the United
      States.
