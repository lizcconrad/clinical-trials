      The overall objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of NRT (Nicoderm patches)
      plus counselling treatment in women in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking during pregnancy is a major public health issue, causing miscarriages, prematurity,
      intrauterine growth retardation, stillbirth, and the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). It
      is estimated that 25-40% of pregnant smokers try to stop smoking on their own upon learning
      that they are pregnant. While pregnancy is often a strong motivator for smoking cessation,
      many nicotine-dependent women cannot quit smoking. The most important factor underlying the
      inability to quit smoking is strong dependence on a certain level nicotine, which is unique
      in every individual.

      Several publications have shown that the use of the nicotine patch during the second and
      third trimesters is not associated with maternal or fetal compromise. More importantly,
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) during pregnancy exposes the fetus to lower levels of
      nicotine than smoking cigarettes does and, moreover, eliminates exposure to numerous other
      toxic substances.

      Presently, counselling is the standard mode of treatment for the pregnant patients willing to
      quit smoking. Since pharmacologic smoking cessation therapies have been shown to increase
      significantly up to doubling a successful quitting rate when used in adjunction to brief
      physician counselling, the use of an appropriate dose of such agents is essential.
