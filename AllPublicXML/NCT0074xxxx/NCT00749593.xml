  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is one of the commonest inherited diseases, affecting
      1:14,200 live births. It is the result of a genetic defect in one of the enzymes (in most
      cases 21-hydroxylase) required for cortisol biosynthesis, leading to reduced levels of
      cortisol and aldosterone, increased ACTH concentrations and consequently increased adrenal
      androgen production. Patients suffer from problems with growth and development and as adults
      patients may have problems with fertility, virilisation in women, testicular masses in men
      and both men and women have an impaired quality of life. Patients have to take life-long
      therapy. Despite its frequency knowledge surrounding the management of adults with CAH
      remains fairly limited. There has been a lot of work describing the management of children
      with CAH but to date there is no consensus on how to manage adults. To address this issue a
      number of adult endocrinologists in the UK under the auspices of the Society for
      Endocrinology have established a country wide study (CaHASE) to undertake research in order
      to set standards of care for adult patients with CAH.

      In CAH the severity of the symptoms experienced by affected individuals varies depending on
      the mutation and the genetic background of the individual. The ability to tailor CAH therapy
      on an individual basis, as determined by the severity of the underlying defect and an
      understanding of the likely natural history of the disease, is a key goal in clinical
      management. Correlation of phenotype (clinical status) and genotype (the underlying 21
      hydroxylase gene mutation) will facilitate stratification of severity and provide an
      important contribution to the debate on potential mechanisms of individualised therapy. For
      instance it may become clear that certain CAH genotypes are associated with specific long
      term outcomes. In time, this could lead to suggesting different treatment strategies in
      certain groups. Moreover, genotype data are important if we are to address the relative
      contribution of environment (e.g. treatment) vs. genetics on long term outcomes.

      This multi-centre study aims to:

        1. - Investigate the medical health of adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

        2. - Investigate the relationship between the genotype of the patient and the phenotype.

        3. - Investigate the quality of life of adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
