      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      formulation, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together with sunitinib may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
      nanoparticle formulation together with sunitinib works as first-line therapy in treating
      patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the tumor response rate in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and sunitinib
           malate as first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to objective tumor response and duration of response in responding
           patients.

        -  To determine the time to treatment failure and overall survival of these patients.

        -  To characterize the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients also receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.
