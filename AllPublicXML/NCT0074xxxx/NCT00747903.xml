      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a
      certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. This may be an
      effective treatment against skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of photodynamic therapy using
      aminolevulinic acid and to see how well it works in treating patients with skin cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the safety and efficacy of intralesional photodynamic therapy using
           aminolevulinic acid and non-coherent blue light in patients with nodular basal cell
           carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo photodynamic therapy comprising intralesional injection of
      aminolevulinic acid followed by non-coherent blue light therapy over approximately 17
      minutes. Patients may undergo re-treatment with photodynamic therapy 8 weeks later.

      Patients undergo photographic assessment of their skin lesions at baseline, 8 weeks, 16
      weeks, and then at 1 and 2 years to evaluate healing time, clinical improvement, and side
      effects.

      Patients undergo biopsies of their skin lesions at 16 weeks and then at 1 and 2 years to
      confirm histological clearance.
