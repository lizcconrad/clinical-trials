  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening pulmonary illness.
      It is a complication of sickle cell disease and is the leading cause of death from this
      disease in adults. Several pathologic processes are recognized causes of ACS, including
      infectious diseases, hypoventilation secondary to chest pain, in situ thrombosis and
      pulmonary fat embolism. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been shown to be a pulmonary
      vasodilatator with minimal systemic effects and has also been shown to improve gas exchange
      in both animal and human acute lung injury (ALI).

      The combined effects of iNO gas of improving pulmonary ventilation to perfusion matching,
      reducing alveolar and systemic inflammation, modulate the course of acute chest syndrome,
      which combine the physiopathology of vaso-occlusive crisis and acute lung injury.

      We hypothesise inhaled NO will improve oxygenation and clinical outcome of sickle cell
      disease patients with acute chest syndrome.

      Objectives: To compare the outcome and duration of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in patients
      with sickle cell disease (SCD) treated with iNO to that of similar episodes experienced by
      patients which receive a placebo.

      Study design: Bi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial

        -  Enrollment: 24 months

        -  Patients will be treated for 72 hours

        -  Patients will be followed for 15 days or until discharged home

      Sample size:

        -  The study will accrue a maximum of 240 patients

        -  Progress of the trial will be reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring
           committee to determine if randomization should stop for safety reasons.
