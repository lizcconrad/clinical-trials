  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      immunogenicity of Protexia, an experimental drug being developed to protect soldiers against
      the effects of nerve agents.

      Volunteers will be entered into one of five groups. Four of the groups will receive a single
      intramuscular dose of Protexia or saline placebo on Study Day 1 and will participate in the
      study for approximately 71 days. One of the groups will receive two intramuscular doses of
      Protexia or saline placebo - one dose on Study Day 1 and the second dose on Study Day 72.
      This group will participate in the study for approximately 142 days.

      All volunteers will remain at the study site as an inpatient for three days after they are
      dosed and will be monitored closely by the study doctors and staff. After that, volunteers
      will return to the study site as outpatients at predetermined intervals. Groups 1, 2, 4, 5
      will have a total of 6 follow-up visits and Group 3 will have a total of 12 follow-up visits.

      It is expected that this study will provide important information on the safety and
      tolerabiity of Protexia at one and two doses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protexia is a pegylated form of recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (PEG-rBChE).
      Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a naturally-occurring enzyme found in minute quantities in
      the blood. PharmAthene produces PEG-rBChE from the milk of transgenic goats. The enzyme is
      purified from the goat milk, formulated and pegylated to create Protexia.

      This is a dose escalation study of five dose levels of Protexia. Safety data through 14 days
      post-dosing will be evaluated by an independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior to
      escalating to a higher dose. The safety and tolerability of Protexia will be assessed using
      the DMID Adult Toxicity Table, May 2001 (Appendix D).

      If a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is identified in any dosing group, dosing will be suspended
      until the AE(s) is/are assessed. The SMC will determine if the study can continue or if the
      previous dose will be declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It is possible that an
      additional dosing group at a dose midway between the previous dosing group and the dose level
      that exceeded the MTD may be enrolled after consultation and agreement of the SMC.
