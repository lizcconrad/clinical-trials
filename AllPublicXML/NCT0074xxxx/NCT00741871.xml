      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with histologically documented diagnosis of a lymphoid malignancy as defined
             in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme except for those listed
             in Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subject must have received at least 2 prior regimens for their lymphoid malignancy,
             one of which was an anthracycline-containing combination regimen and have shown
             disease relapse or did not respond to the prior regimen

          -  Subjects with classic HL or diffuse large B cell lymphoma must have failed, refused or
             are ineligible to receive stem cell transplant

          -  Subjects must have measurable lesions (at least one target lesion measuring 2cm in
             diameter) by computerized tomography (CT) scan

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          -  All men of reproductive potential and women of child-bearing potential must agree to
             practice effective contraception during the entire study period and for one month
             after the last study treatment unless documentation of infertility exists.
             Additionally, women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             within 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign the informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD), Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like
             lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, multiple myeloma, or HIV-associated
             lymphoma

          -  History of or active Central Nervous System (CNS) malignancy

          -  Have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant and were treated with immunosuppressing
             agent within the past 6 months

          -  Active Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements as judged by treating physician. Subjects receiving antibiotics for
             infections that are under control may be included in the study

          -  Concurrent malignancy, except those subjects with early stage squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
             are eligible for the study

          -  Known HIV-positive (such subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with potentially marrow-suppressive therapy)

          -  Known active Hepatitis A, B or C

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating
