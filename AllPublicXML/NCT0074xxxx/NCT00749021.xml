          -  Ability to understand the informed consent and willingness to sign the consent.

          -  Presence of a submacular vascularized or fibrovascular PED. Central foveal involvement
             by the PED or the CNV due to age related macular degeneration.

          -  PED less than or equal to 12 disc area in size

             letters (20/400 to 20/40)

          -  Central 1-mm foveal thickness of greater than or equal to 250 microns on OCT.

          -  Greatest linear diameter of the submacular hemorrhage needs to be less than 50% of the
             entire PED.

          -  Submacular fibrosis needs to be less than 50% of the entire PED.

          -  Sufficiently clear media (cornea, anterior chamber, lens, vitreous) for OCT, FA, and
             FP.

          -  Intraocular pressure of 25 mm or less in the study eye, with or without use of ocular

          -  Presence of any substantial ocular disease (other than CNV and PED) that may
             compromise vision in the study eye and/or confound interpretation of the date; e.g.
             substantial cataracts, concomitant diabetic retinopathy affecting the macula, advanced
             glaucoma, optic neuritis, optic neuropathy or atrophy, marked macular atrophy, ocular
             vascular occlusion, history of retinal detachment, uveitis, viral or other forms of
             chorioretinitis, etc.

          -  Presence of ocular disease other than AMD affecting study eye, i.e. presumed ocular
             histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent of
