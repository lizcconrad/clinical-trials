          <description>In the 8-week Primary Evaluation Period (including the 2-week Run-in Period [from Week 0 as Baseline]), participants received an initial dose of an immediate-release (IR) formulation of carvedilol (CRV) as a 1.25 milligram (mg) tablet twice daily (BID) (2.5 mg/day) at Week 0, followed by an increased dose of CRV-IR 2.5 mg tablet BID (5 mg/day) at Week 1. The dose was then increased to 5 mg BID (10 mg/day) at Week 4, and finally to 10 mg BID (20 mg/day) at Week 6. The participants on CRV-IR were switched to the marketed CRV-IR in Week 1 of the Follow-up Period; the investigator or subinvestigator determined the dose of the marketed CRV-IR based on the last dose administered during the Primary Evaluation Period after confirming the safety and tolerability of the dose.</description>

          <description>In the 8-week Primary Evaluation Period (including the 2-week Run-in Period [from Week 0 as Baseline]), participants received a CRV-IR 1.25 mg and 2.5 mg tablet BID at Weeks 0 and 1, respectively. They then received a 10 mg extended-release capsule of carvedilol (SK&amp;F-105517-D) once daily (OD) at Week 2; the dose was then increased to 20 mg OD and finally to 40 mg OD at 2-week intervals. The dose was increased from 40 mg to 60 mg and finally to 80 mg at 2-week intervals in the 4-week Exploratory Evaluation Period after confirming that each dose was well tolerated without safety concern and that the participant met all of the dose-escalation criteria. During the 2-week Dose-tapering Period set up to prepare for switch to the marketed CRV-IR, the dose of SK&amp;F-105517-D was reduced to 60 mg OD and then to 40 mg OD at weekly intervals; SK&amp;F-105517-D was then switched to the marketed CRV-IR 10 mg tablet BID in the 1-week Follow-up Period.</description>

        <description>Time of maximal plasma concentration (tmax) of S-carvedilol, R-carvedilol, and M4 active metabolite (SB-203231) was measured. Participants in each treatment group were divided into 3 groups by pharmacokinetic sampling timing: Groups A, B, and C in the SK&amp;F-105517-D group and Groups D, E, and F in the CRV-IR group. Carvedilol is a racemic mixture. Non-selective β-blocking activity is shown by S-carvedilol, while α1-blocking activity is shown by both S-carvedilol and R-carvedilol.</description>

They then received a 10 mg extended-release capsule of carvedilol (SK&amp;F-105517-D) once daily (OD) at Week 2; the dose was then increased to 20 mg OD and finally to 40 mg OD at 2-week intervals. The dose was increased from 40 mg to 60 mg and finally to 80 mg at 2-week intervals in the 4-week Exploratory Evaluation Period after confirming that each dose was well tolerated without safety concern and that the participant met all of the dose-escalation criteria. During the 2-week Dose-tapering Period set up to prepare for switch to the marketed CRV-IR, the dose of SK&amp;F-105517-D was reduced to 60 mg OD and then to 40 mg OD at weekly intervals; SK&amp;F-105517-D was then switched to the marketed CRV-IR 10 mg tablet BID in the 1-week Follow-up Period.</description>

The dose was then increased to 5 mg BID (10 mg/day) at Week 4, and finally to 10 mg BID (20 mg/day) at Week 6. The participants on CRV-IR were switched to the marketed CRV-IR in Week 1 of the Follow-up Period; the investigator or subinvestigator determined the dose of the marketed CRV-IR based on the last dose administered during the Primary Evaluation Period after confirming the safety and tolerability of the dose.</description>

            <description>In the 8-week Primary Evaluation Period (including the 2-week Run-in Period [from Week 0 as Baseline]), participants received an initial dose of an immediate-release (IR) formulation of carvedilol (CRV) as a 1.25 milligram (mg) tablet twice daily (BID) (2.5 mg/day) at Week 0, followed by an increased dose of CRV-IR 2.5 mg tablet BID (5 mg/day) at Week 1. The dose was then increased to 5 mg BID (10 mg/day) at Week 4, and finally to 10 mg BID (20 mg/day) at Week 6. The participants on CRV-IR were switched to the marketed CRV-IR in Week 1 of the Follow-up Period; the investigator or subinvestigator determined the dose of the marketed CRV-IR based on the last dose administered during the Primary Evaluation Period after confirming the safety and tolerability of the dose.</description>

PDmax/PDmim was calculated as the ratio of the PDmax to PDmin, and it showed the degree of change during the 0-24 h interval. The mean was adjusted for Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment points were 24 hours (h) (from time of first reading to time of last reading), morning (6 am-12 pm), afternoon (12-6 pm), night (6 pm-6 am on following day), waking (8 am-9 pm), sleeping (0-5 am), PDmax (maximal value obtained with each participant during the 0-24 h interval), PDmin (minimal value obtained with each participant during the 0-24 h interval), and PDmax/PDmin. PDmax/PDmim was calculated as the ratio of the PDmax to PDmin, and it showed the degree of change during the 0-24 h interval. The mean was adjusted for Baseline value.</description>

            <description>In the 8-week Primary Evaluation Period (including the 2-week Run-in Period [from Week 0 as Baseline]), participants received an initial dose of an immediate-release (IR) formulation of carvedilol (CRV) as a 1.25 milligram (mg) tablet twice daily (BID) (2.5 mg/day) at Week 0, followed by an increased dose of CRV-IR 2.5 mg tablet BID (5 mg/day) at Week 1. The dose was then increased to 5 mg BID (10 mg/day) at Week 4, and finally to 10 mg BID (20 mg/day) at Week 6. The participants on CRV-IR were switched to the marketed CRV-IR in Week 1 of the Follow-up Period; the investigator or subinvestigator determined the dose of the marketed CRV-IR based on the last dose administered during the Primary Evaluation Period after confirming the safety and tolerability of the dose.</description>

They then received a 10 mg extended-release capsule of carvedilol (SK&amp;F-105517-D) once daily (OD) at Week 2; the dose was then increased to 20 mg OD and finally to 40 mg OD at 2-week intervals. The dose was increased from 40 mg to 60 mg and finally to 80 mg at 2-week intervals in the 4-week Exploratory Evaluation Period after confirming that each dose was well tolerated without safety concern and that the participant met all of the dose-escalation criteria. During the 2-week Dose-tapering Period set up to prepare for switch to the marketed CRV-IR, the dose of SK&amp;F-105517-D was reduced to 60 mg OD and then to 40 mg OD at weekly intervals; SK&amp;F-105517-D was then switched to the marketed CRV-IR 10 mg tablet BID in the 1-week Follow-up Period.</description>

          <description>Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment points were 24 hours (h) (from time of first reading to time of last reading), morning (6 am-12 pm), afternoon (12-6 pm), night (6 pm-6 am on following day), waking (8 am-9 pm), sleeping (0-5 am), PDmax (maximal value obtained with each participant during the 0-24 h interval), PDmin (minimal value obtained with each participant during the 0-24 h interval), and PDmax/PDmin. PDmax/PDmim was calculated as the ratio of the PDmax to PDmin, and it showed the degree of change during the 0-24 h interval. The mean was adjusted for Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From Baseline New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class at Week 8</title>
        <description>The NYHA classification assesses the severity of symptoms of heart failure as judged by the investigator and is comprised of. 4 classes: I, no resulting limitations on physical activity (PA); II, slight limitations on PA; III, marked limitations on PA; IV, inability to carry out any PA without discomfort. The number of participants with any change from Baseline in the NYHA Functional Class at Week 8 was calculated. Improved=class at the visit is decreased compared to baseline class, Unchanged=class at the visit is stable, Worsened=class at the visit is increased compared to baseline class.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
        <population>Efficacy Population: all participants measurable at the efficacy endpoints (20 participants at baseline and 11 participants at Week 8 in the CRV-IR group; 19 participants at baseline and 8 participants at Week 8 in the SK&amp;F-105517-D group. Some participants in each treatment arm withdrew prematurely.</population>

            <description>In the 8-week Primary Evaluation Period (including the 2-week Run-in Period [from Week 0 as Baseline]), participants received an initial dose of an immediate-release (IR) formulation of carvedilol (CRV) as a 1.25 milligram (mg) tablet twice daily (BID) (2.5 mg/day) at Week 0, followed by an increased dose of CRV-IR 2.5 mg tablet BID (5 mg/day) at Week 1. The dose was then increased to 5 mg BID (10 mg/day) at Week 4, and finally to 10 mg BID (20 mg/day) at Week 6. The participants on CRV-IR were switched to the marketed CRV-IR in Week 1 of the Follow-up Period; the investigator or subinvestigator determined the dose of the marketed CRV-IR based on the last dose administered during the Primary Evaluation Period after confirming the safety and tolerability of the dose.</description>

They then received a 10 mg extended-release capsule of carvedilol (SK&amp;F-105517-D) once daily (OD) at Week 2; the dose was then increased to 20 mg OD and finally to 40 mg OD at 2-week intervals. The dose was increased from 40 mg to 60 mg and finally to 80 mg at 2-week intervals in the 4-week Exploratory Evaluation Period after confirming that each dose was well tolerated without safety concern and that the participant met all of the dose-escalation criteria. During the 2-week Dose-tapering Period set up to prepare for switch to the marketed CRV-IR, the dose of SK&amp;F-105517-D was reduced to 60 mg OD and then to 40 mg OD at weekly intervals; SK&amp;F-105517-D was then switched to the marketed CRV-IR 10 mg tablet BID in the 1-week Follow-up Period.</description>

          <description>The NYHA classification assesses the severity of symptoms of heart failure as judged by the investigator and is comprised of. 4 classes: I, no resulting limitations on physical activity (PA); II, slight limitations on PA; III, marked limitations on PA; IV, inability to carry out any PA without discomfort. The number of participants with any change from Baseline in the NYHA Functional Class at Week 8 was calculated. Improved=class at the visit is decreased compared to baseline class, Unchanged=class at the visit is stable, Worsened=class at the visit is increased compared to baseline class.</description>
          <population>Efficacy Population: all participants measurable at the efficacy endpoints (20 participants at baseline and 11 participants at Week 8 in the CRV-IR group; 19 participants at baseline and 8 participants at Week 8 in the SK&amp;F-105517-D group. Some participants in each treatment arm withdrew prematurely.</population>
