      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and toleration of oral sildenafil
      administered as required by women with Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) who successfully
      complete one of the following Pfizer-sponsored, 12-week, double-blinded clinical trials:
      A1481082 or A1481123. Addition of this 52-week open-label extension will increase the total
      duration of sildenafil exposure to 64 weeks. Sustained efficacy will also be evaluated after
      3 and 6 months of open-label therapy.
