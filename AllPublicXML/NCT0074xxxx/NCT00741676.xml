  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among surgical methods for gastric cancer, incision about 15 ~20 cm length is prepared for
      open gastric cancer surgery while 0.5 ~ 1.2 cm is for laparoscopy gastric cancer surgery.
      Complications such as pain, abdominal adhesion, and problems associated with delayed recovery
      are common in open surgery because of large incision; however, those complications are less
      common in laparoscopy surgery because small sized incision is prepared. Range of surgery for
      curative dissection depends on the level of progress of a cancer, i.e., depends on whether
      gastric wall invasion, lymph node metastasis, or invasion to adjacent organs presented. Since
      recurrence in the lymph nodes after the operation is very common, the most important step in
      the gastric surgery is to dissect lymph node completely. According to the gastric cancer
      surgery manual published by Japan Gastric Cancer Association, more than D2 lymph node
      dissection is essential for improving survival rate in advanced gastric cancer. More than D2
      lymph node dissection is relatively safely conducted by open surgery, whereas it is
      controversial in laparoscopy surgery because it is very hard to maintain surgical field under
      laparoscopic condition. Recently, widened rage of lymph node dissection by using laparoscopy
      is possible as laparoscopic surgical techniques are accumulated and new surgical devices are
      introduced. According to the case reports, D2 lymph node dissection by laparoscopy surgery
      shows similar results to the one by open surgery in aspects of recurrence rate and the number
      of dissected lymph node. Also, according to Hur and el., in case of upper gastric cancer,
      laparoscopy surgery is more useful to dissect #10 and #11 lymph node.In our prospective case
      study, the investigators would like to compare effectiveness, complications, patterns of
      recurrence, and survival rate between the two surgical approaches, laparoscopy distal
      gastrectomy and open distal gastrectomy. The investigators randomly operate the advanced
      gastric cancer patients, who need distal gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection. Surgical
      methods are selected randomly whether open surgery or laparoscopy surgery. Finally, the
      investigators wish our case report to contribute to the establishment of the safety and the
      effectiveness of laparoscopy surgery conducted for advanced gastric cancers. Consequently,
      our case report will contribute to establish the ideal surgical method for the advanced
      gastric cancer patients.

      In both arms,subtotal gastrectomy (dissect more than 2/3 of stomach and total omentectomy)
      and D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of
      splenic artery (4d, 4sb), hepatoduodenal ligament, superior mesenteric vein) wiil be
      performed basically. As a general rule, Billroth II method will be used for gastric
      reconstruction for all cases.Billroth II gastrectomy is to link the gastric pouch to the
      jejunum 10~15 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. An antecolic or retrocolic
      gastrojejunostomy connects the jejunum to the stomach in one continuous segment. For
      anastomosis, absorbable suture is used. Anastomotic diameter is 5~6 cm length. Drainage tube
      is inserted through the right flank area and additional drainage tubes can be inserted as
      needed.

Another two 5 mm trocar are inserted into the both midline of subcostal line. The devices for operation are inserted through the trocars. Subtotal gastrectomy (dissect more than 2/3 of stomach and total omentectomy) and D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of splenic artery, hepatoduodenal ligament, superior mesenteric vein) will be performed basically.
