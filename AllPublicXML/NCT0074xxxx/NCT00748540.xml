  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to collect feasibility data to assess the safety and
      efficacy of the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB), a medical device designed to provide benefit in
      aided hearing thresholds, speech perception and sound quality to certain individuals with
      hearing loss with minimal changes in residual hearing. The VSB is currently indicated for
      adults with moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss. Under the present investigation,
      adults with conductive and mixed hearing losses who are not successful users of traditional
      amplification will be assessed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, 18 years of age or older at time of implantation

          -  English as the primary language

          -  Appropriate motivation and expectation levels

          -  Geographically and physically able to return to the investigational center for
             scheduled evaluations and follow-up appointments.

          -  At least a 28-day unsuccessful hearing aid trial (within the past 24 months prior to
             enrolment).

          -  Persons who after being informed that a different hearing aid than the one they
             currently have may provide improved hearing, still request an implant.

          -  Ability to undergo general anesthesia

          -  Audiological tests suggest either a conductive or mixed hearing loss. The
             non-implanted ear may fall outside these criteria; however, threshold levels may not
             be worse than severe sloping to profound.

          -  Conductive Hearing Loss

          -  Pure-tone bone-conduction threshold levels in the ear to be implanted shall fall at or
             within the levels stated below. There should be an air-bone gap of 15 dB HL or more at
             three or more of the frequencies 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz. Pure-tone
             air-conduction levels should indicate the presence of at least a moderate hearing loss
             of at least 41 dB HL. Air conduction levels are not limited on the upper end.

          -  Upper Limits of Bone Conduction Thresholds for Conductive Hearing Loss Frequency (kHz)
             0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0 4.0 Bone Conduction upper limit (dBHL) &lt;25 &lt;25 &lt;25 &lt;25 &lt;25 &lt;25

          -  Mixed Hearing Loss

          -  Pure-tone bone conduction threshold levels in the ear to be implanted shall fall at or
             within the levels stated below. There should be an air-bone gap of 15 dB HL or more at
             three or more of the frequencies 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz. Bone
             conduction thresholds at least three of the frequencies should be 26 dB or greater.
             Pure-tone air-conduction thresholds should be, on average, at least moderately
             impaired of 41 dB or greater. Air-conduction levels are not limited on the upper end.

          -  Lower and Upper Limits of Bone Conduction Thresholds for Mixed Hearing Loss Frequency
             (kHz) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 3.0 4.0 Bone Conduction lower limit (dBHL) 0 0 0 0 0 0 Bone
             Conduction upper limit (dBHL) 45 50 55 65 65 65

          -  Good potential for aided speech recognition as indicated by a pre-operative
             monosyllabic word score of &gt; 30% in the ear to be implanted as measured under
             headphones at 40 dB SL or at MCL

          -  Hearing aid trial with appropriately fitted hearing aids of at least 28 days duration
             within the past 24 months, unless the subject is unable to wear hearing aids for
             medical reasons

          -  Most recent audiometric data, if available, judged to be of good test-retest
             reliability.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hearing loss of purely sensorineural origin

          -  Retrocochlear or central auditory disorders

          -  Active middle ear infection

          -  Tympanic membrane perforation, ears with previously reconstructed tympanic membranes
             may be included

          -  Bone-conduction thresholds in the ear to be implanted that have demonstrated a recent
             fluctuation at two or more frequencies of 15 dB in either direction in the last 6
             months, as demonstrated by serial audiograms.

          -  History of post-adolescent, inner-ear disorders, such as vertigo or labyrinthitis

          -  Chronic or non-revisable vestibular or balance disorders

          -  Middle ear infections not responsive to medical treatment

          -  Skin or scalp conditions that may preclude attachment of the Audio Processor or that
             may interfere with the use of the Audio Processor

          -  Chronic pain in or around the head

          -  Current or previous use of an active hearing implant in either ear.

          -  Any known physical, psychological, or emotional disorder that may interfere with the
             completion of scheduled follow-up evaluations

          -  Developmental delays or organic brain dysfunction
