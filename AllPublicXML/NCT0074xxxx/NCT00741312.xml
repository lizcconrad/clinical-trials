    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a common maternal disease that complicates 5% to 10% of pregnancies and
      remains as the major cause of maternal and neonatal mortality, especially in developing
      countries. Cost-effective interventions aimed to prevent the development of preeclampsia are
      urgently needed. Ethiopathogenesis of preeclampsia involves multiple mechanisms as oxidative
      stress, endothelial dysfunction, infections, maternal constitutional factors, and others.
      Regular aerobic exercise recovers endothelial function, decreases oxidative stress and
      improves maternal constitutional factors.

      The purpose of this Controlled Clinical Trial is to determine the effect of regular aerobic
      exercise on endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation. Furthermore, the
      effect of exercise on biomarkers on vascular function and perinatal outcomes will be
      evaluated.

    <description>Walking (10 minutes), aerobic exercise (30 minutes), stretching (10 minutes) and relaxation exercise (10 minutes). Exercise will be performed at three sessions per week. All sessions will be supervised by a physical therapist and a physical educator.
The exercise-program follows the ACOG and ACSM exercise prescription. Aerobic activities will be performed at moderate intensity (60-70% of maximal heart rate) measured by the 6-20 Borg's rating scale. Each session starts with a 5 minutes of warm up, followed by 30 minutes of aerobic activity, including 5 minutes cool down. This is followed by 15 minutes of circuit strength training of the upper limbs, lower limbs, and deep abdominal stabilization muscles. The last 5 minutes consists of stretching and relaxation exercises.</description>
