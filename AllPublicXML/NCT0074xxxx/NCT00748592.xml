    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with a 4-way
      crossover design. Elderly subjects with primary insomnia who meet screening requirements will
      initially be randomized into the study and receive the first of 4 treatments (PD 0200390 5
      mg, 15 mg and 30 mg or placebo) daily 30 minutes before bed time for 2 consecutive days in a
      polysomnography (PSG) lab.
