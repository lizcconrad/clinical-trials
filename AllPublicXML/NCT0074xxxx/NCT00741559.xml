  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first aim of this study are to evaluate the lobar concordance of FDG-PET and MEG with
      intracranial electrographic study in children with intractable partial epilepsy. The second
      aim is to determine if the combined role of FDG-PET and MEG improve detection of
      epileptogenic zone as defined by invasive intracranial recordings.

    <textblock>
      Children with poorly controlled epilepsy are extensively investigated with various tools
      including MR brain, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) or position
      emission tomography (PET) scans. When MR brain does not show an abnormality, the patient is
      said to have nonlesional epilepsy. In these cases, it is even more crucial to be able to
      identify the epileptogenic zone, depending on availability of investigative tool.

      Recognizing that individual modalities have limitations, the aim of this study is to
      determine if combining non-invasive investigations with MEG and PET, which respectively
      evaluate the electrical and metabolic activity of the brain, could improve the children with
      intractable nonlesional epilepsy with MEG and PET and compared this with invasive
      intracranial monitoring. The endpoint of the study being agreement on localizations of
      epileptogenic zone using PET and MEG individually and in combination and comparing this with
      invasive intracranial monitoring.
