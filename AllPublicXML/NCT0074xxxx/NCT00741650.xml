    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial comparing a new approach to musculoskeletal pain consisting of
      education and peer involvement to treatment as usual. All local government employees in 1-3
      Norwegian municipalities will be invited to participate.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the study is to systematically test a new treatment method for musculoskeletal
      pain in Norway. The intervention focuses on attempting to treat musculoskeletal pain outside
      the traditional medical system as much as possible, to avoid the establishment of a patient
      identity and passive patient behavior. In addition, participants are given reasons to stay
      active, and not advice to stay active.

      Ibedrift is a randomized controlled trial with the aim of studying the effect of a new
      treatment regime for musculoskeletal pain, focusing on didactic information about low back
      pain with peer support. Those participants not in the control group will have the option of
      contacting a peer advisor, a non health professional trained by the iBedrift crew to give
      information about back pain and reasons to stay active. For those who have not recovered
      within a short period of time, and who are randomized to full treatment, the peer advisor can
      send them directly to health personnel for a brief intervention consisting of a medical
      examination with screening for conditions that need treatment, counseling and education.

      The intervention was done in 2 Norwegian municipalities for all local government employees.
      Randomization was done at the level of working units (schools, offices etc) which allows for
      more message containment.
