    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) is a collective noun for various chronic lung diseases,
      including sarcoidosis and idiopathic lung fibrosis (IPF). Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic
      disease that includes damage to the lungs in 90% of the patients. Generally, the disease can
      be described as a systemic, granulomatous and antigen-driven disorder. IPF is a disease of
      only the lungs, in which an unknown cause induces a strong inflammation reaction leading to
      acute lung damage that ultimately results in the formation of scar tissue and stiffness of
      the lungs.

      Unfortunately, the exact cause of ILD is still unknown. It is suggested that environmental
      and work-related exposure to various triggers can exert an effect on the course of the
      diseases. Examples of such triggers include bacteria, organic agents such as pollen and
      cotton dust and inorganic agents like metals and talc. Due to this unknown cause, it is
      difficult to treat ILD. Consequently, the current guideline is no medication or
      anti-inflammatory agents in severe cases. Unfortunately, this therapy is not completely
      effective.

      Triggers that are suggested to cause ILD can exert their effects via various mechanisms. On
      the one hand, they can induce an inflammatory reaction as we recently demonstrated for
      various triggers including instillation material and sicila. During such an inflammatory
      reaction, cytokines are released that can induce oxidative stress, i.e. an imbalance between
      the formation of and the protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand,
      ILD-inducing triggers may directly cause an increased ROS production that subsequently can
      evoke an inflammatory reaction.

      The objective of the current study is to investigate the individual sensitivity for the
      development of ILD after exposure to various triggers. Main focus will be the differences in
      the formation of and the protection against ROS as well as the occurring inflammatory
      reaction after exposure to such triggers.

      Furthermore, a simple blood test will be developed to study and eventually even predict the
      individual reaction of subjects to various triggers.

      Finally, to fully characterize the development of ILD after exposure to various triggers, the
      exhaled air of patients will be studied in order to identify specific markers of oxidative
      stress and damage.

        Participants in this study include both men and women, who are 18 years of age or older and
        diagnosed with ILD using lung biopsy, X ray or BALF (broncho-alveolar lavage fluid)
        analysis and are either treated for this with anti-inflammatory agents or not. There's no
        maximum age set for this study since ILD can occur at all ages. Additional criteria are non
        smoking, no pregnancy or lactation and no use of vitamins or nutritional supplements.

        The inclusion of both treated and untreated patients enables us to study the effectiveness
        of anti-inflammatory agents on a larger scale.
