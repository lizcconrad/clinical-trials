      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adult bone marrow derived stem/progenitor
      cells improve cardiac function and symptoms in patients with heart failure and to establish
      the optimal method of delivery of these cells.

      Study hypotheses:

        -  Administration of G-CSF to patients with heart failure secondary to ischaemic heart
           disease will lead to an increase in circulating progenitor cells as measured by
           peripheral CD34+ positive cell counts

        -  Cardiac function and symptoms will improve in patients in whom the peripheral CD34+
           counts increase in response to G-CSF administration

        -  Direct coronary injection of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells will confer an
           additional improvement in cardiac function and symptoms above that derived from G-CSF
           infusion alone

        -  Direct intramyocardial injection of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells will lead
           to an improvement in cardiac function and symptoms above that derived from G-CSF
           infusion alone

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves three arms that compare the method of autologous bone marrow cel
      administration in patients with chronic heart failure. Each arm has a comparative group that
      contains either saline injection (peripheral arm that injects GCSF alone) or serum (the two
      interventional arms-intracoronary and intramyocardial injection).

      The protocol (on the advice of the ethics committee) is divided into a 58 patients pilot
      study followed by recruitment into the intramyocardial arm (30 patients randomised 1:1 cells
      in serum vs serum alone) and then recruitment into the intracoronary and peripheral arms (30
      patients randomised 1:1 cells in serum vs serum alone in each arm).

      The study has been powered around the use of advanced imaging to measure within group changes
      in ejection fraction at 12 months as the primary end point.
