  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess potential risk for NSF in subjects with renal impairment (moderate) post magnevist
      injection. Subjects will be screened within 48 hours of previously scheduled MRI, those
      meeting the enrollment criteria will be enrolled prior to MRI and followed for 2 years post
      MRI with visits occuring at 1yr and 2 yr timepoints, in addition follow-up phone calls
      conducted at 1, 3, 6 and 18 months to assess for skin changes suggestive of NSF.

    <description>Either clinical or histopathology score had to be at least 2 and the other at least 3 for diagnosis of NSF. Clinical score 2, 3 or 4 was derived from more than one minor criterion finding, one major criterion finding or more than one major criterion finding respectively. Major Criteria include patterned plaques, joint contractures, cobblestoning and marked induration/Peau d'orange (upper extremity or above knee); minor Criteria include puckering/linear banding, superficial (plaque/patch), dermal papules and scleral plaques (subject aged &lt;45 years). Pathology score 2, 3 or 4 was derived from 2, 3 or at least 4 histological criteria findings respectively. Histological Criteria include increased cellularity (spindled and/or epithelioid) with few other inflammatory cells, CD34+ spindle or epithelioid cells in a reticular or parallel arrangement with &quot;tram-tracking,&quot; presence of both fine collagen and ropey collagen surrounded by clefts, elastic fibers preserved and septal involvement.</description>

        <description>Either clinical or histopathology score had to be at least 2 and the other at least 3 for diagnosis of NSF. Clinical score 2, 3 or 4 was derived from more than one minor criterion finding, one major criterion finding or more than one major criterion finding respectively. Major Criteria include patterned plaques, joint contractures, cobblestoning and marked induration/Peau d’orange (upper extremity or above knee); minor Criteria include puckering/linear banding, superficial (plaque/patch), dermal papules and scleral plaques (subject aged &lt;45 years). Pathology score 2, 3 or 4 was derived from 2, 3 or at least 4 histological criteria findings respectively. Histological Criteria include increased cellularity (spindled and/or epithelioid) with few other inflammatory cells, CD34+ spindle or epithelioid cells in a reticular or parallel arrangement with “tram-tracking,&quot; presence of both fine collagen and ropey collagen surrounded by clefts, elastic fibers preserved and septal involvement.</description>

          <description>Either clinical or histopathology score had to be at least 2 and the other at least 3 for diagnosis of NSF. Clinical score 2, 3 or 4 was derived from more than one minor criterion finding, one major criterion finding or more than one major criterion finding respectively. Major Criteria include patterned plaques, joint contractures, cobblestoning and marked induration/Peau d’orange (upper extremity or above knee); minor Criteria include puckering/linear banding, superficial (plaque/patch), dermal papules and scleral plaques (subject aged &lt;45 years). Pathology score 2, 3 or 4 was derived from 2, 3 or at least 4 histological criteria findings respectively. Histological Criteria include increased cellularity (spindled and/or epithelioid) with few other inflammatory cells, CD34+ spindle or epithelioid cells in a reticular or parallel arrangement with “tram-tracking,&quot; presence of both fine collagen and ropey collagen surrounded by clefts, elastic fibers preserved and septal involvement.</description>
