               2. Advanced congestive heart failure;

               3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);

               4. Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis);

               5. Acute or progressive hepatic disease;

             vaccine (e.g., to ovalbumin, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza viral
             protein, kanamycin and neomycin sulphate);

          -  They have a known or suspected (or have a high risk of developing)
             impairment/alteration of immune function (excluding that normally associated with
             advanced age) resulting, for example, from:

          -  receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (any parenteral or oral corticosteroid or cancer
             chemotherapy/radiotherapy) within the past 60 days and for the full length of the
             study;

          -  receipt of immunostimulants;

          -  receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin preparation, blood products and/or plasma
             derivates within the past 3 months and for the full length of the study;

          -  They have a bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time
             that in the investigator's opinion would interfere with the safety of the subject;

          -  received more than one injection of influenza vaccine

          -  Within the past 6 months, they have:

          -  had laboratory confirmed influenza disease;

          -  received influenza vaccine;

          -  Within the past 4 weeks they have received:

          -  another vaccine;

          -  any investigational agent;

          -  They have any acute or chronic infection requiring systemic antibiotic treatment or
             antiviral therapy within the last 7 days; 1 - They have experienced an acute
