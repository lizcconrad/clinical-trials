      RATIONALE: Calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal (CASAD) may help treat and prevent diarrhea
      caused by irinotecan. It is not yet known whether CASAD is more effective than a placebo in
      treating and preventing diarrhea in patients receiving irinotecan.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying CASAD to see how well it works compared
      with a placebo in treating and preventing diarrhea in patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer receiving irinotecan.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare the efficacy of calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal (CASAD) versus placebo
           in reducing the incidence of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea in patients with metastatic
           colorectal cancer receiving an irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To compare stools per day in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  To compare chemotherapy dose reductions and delays due to diarrhea in patients treated
           with these drugs.

        -  To compare quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.

        -  To compare the safety of these drugs in these patients.

        -  To compare the incidence of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea in patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to chemotherapy
      regimen (irinotecan hydrochloride in combination with fluorouracil and/or biologic therapy vs
      irinotecan hydrochloride alone). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral calcium aluminosilicate anti-diarrheal (CASAD) 4 times
           daily for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Patients who develop grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and are removed from the study may receive
           CASAD for an additional 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily for 6 weeks in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop grade 3 or 4 diarrhea
           and are removed from the study may then receive CASAD for 6 weeks.

      Patients undergo quality-of-life assessment at baseline and at weeks 3, 5, and 6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.
