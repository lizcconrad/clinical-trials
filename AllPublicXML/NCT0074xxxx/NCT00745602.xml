  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will investigate whether the irregular effects of atrial fibrillation
      on the body's circulation directly impacts the regulation of cerebral blood flow. To further
      delineate this finding, investigation of these potential effects will include differences in
      postural positioning. This data will be used to further understand the overall hemodynamic
      effects of atrial fibrillation on extra-cardiac organs of the body.

      This is a prospective study evaluating 10 subjects referred for elective direct current
      cardioversion (DCCV) of atrial fibrillation. Subjects will be seen at Parkland Health and
      Hospital System.

      After full consent is obtained and explanation of the research, each subject will undergo a
      series of entirely non-invasive tests including Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), manual
      cuff blood pressure (BP), beat to beat BP monitoring by a Portapress monitor, and respiratory
      tidal CO2. These measurements will be taken after laying the patient in a supine position for
      10 minutes and subsequently after standing for 10 minutes. Measurements will also be taken
      after full body squat -stand repetition at 20 second intervals (0.05 Hz) x 5 minutes.
      Patients who are unable to squat may rise from a seated position on a chair. This protocol
      has been easy to follow even for debilitated patients with Alzheimers Disease in Dr. Zhang
      and Dr. Levine's laboratory. The subject will then undergo elective DCCV as planned for
      standard of care. The above measurements and with respective body positions will then be
      repeated 30 minutes later if the patient has been successfully converted to normal sinus
      rhythm by DCCV.

      The experimental testing will take approximately 1 Â½ to 2 hours to complete.
