  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      as second-line treatment in metastatic prostate cancer, the present study will investigate
      the efficacy of sunitinib (SUTENT) given orally at a dose of 37.5 mg continuously, for 6
      cycles of 6 consecutive weeks .Patients who are still responders after 6 cycles will be
      treated until disease progression, pain progression, unacceptable toxicity or death due to
      any cause.

      Dose increase or reduction of 12.5 mg increments and change of schedule is recommended based
      on individual safety and tolerability.

      Follow-up for up to 1 year from the last dose of sunitinib.

      -  Antitumor efficacy of sunitinib will be assessed as follows:

             -  PSA response rate and PSA progression according Working Group Criteria,

             -  Variation of PSA doubling time (PSADT) before and after initiation of the
                treatment,

             -  Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST criteria,

             -  Clinical benefit,

             -  Overall survival (OS).

        -  Pharmacokinetic endpoints will include sunitinib and its metabolite, SU012662, plasma
           levels and estimation of the population pharmacokinetic parameters as well as the
           inter-individual variability of these parameters, for a subgroup of 30 patients.

        -  The biological effects of sunitinib in patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma will
           be evaluated by measurements of the different biological markers that could be modulated
           by this antiangiogenic therapeutic, and could then predict and monitor disease
           progression and response to treatment:

             -  Bone tumor markers: bone resorption markers (uCTX, uCTX, ICTP, CTX-MMP and
                TRACP-5b), bone formation markers (OC, PINP and BALP), osteoclastogenesis markers
                (OPG and RANKL) and parameters as calcium, phosphate, creatinine, albumin, PTH and
                25(OH)D.

             -  Angiogenesis markers: bFGF, SDF-1, VEGF-A, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, CECs and CEPs,
                endothelial and platelet microparticles.
