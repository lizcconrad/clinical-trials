  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy adversely affects quality of life in cancer patients. Both stress management
      training and exercise training have been shown to improve quality of life. These two types of
      training have not been directly compared for chemotherapy patients.

      This study seeks to evaluate the separate and combined effects of stress management training
      and exercise training on quality of life during chemotherapy treatment. Participants receive
      either a home-based, self-administered program in 1 of 3 types (stress management, exercise,
      or stress management + exercise) or usual care (reading materials). It is hypothesized that
      the combined program (stress management + exercise) will be significantly associated with
      better quality of life than the usual care group, the exercise only group, and the stress
      management only group. All participants are assessed at 3 timepoints: before they begin
      chemotherapy, 6 weeks after their first chemotherapy infusion, and 12 weeks after their first
      infusion.
