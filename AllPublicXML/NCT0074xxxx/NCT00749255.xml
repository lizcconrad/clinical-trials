      The purpose of this case collection effort is software design by R2 Technologies, Inc., The
      information received from Women's Imaging will be provided to the Case Collection, Data
      Management and Algorithm/software design and development teams who are responsible for the
      receipt of patient data and management of such data; and creation, testing and validation of
      R2 Technologies, Inc., for Computer Aided Detection (CAD) and new digital image archiving
      software design.

      The information is necessary for Sponsor development efforts and will be utilized as a
      viewing tool with supporting written documentation of the findings on each image itself. The
      information will be used to develop algorithms that will foster development of CAD software.
      The information in each image and/or accompanying written clinical case documentation will
      not be analyzed in any way for clinical events
