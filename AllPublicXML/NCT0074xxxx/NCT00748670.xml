  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term survival rate of individual
      implants and prostheses when treating edentulous upper jaws of poor bone quality with Fixture
      MicroThread™ (Micro-Macro).

      Clinical study recruitment was stopped in year 2000 due to a decision to modify the product
      under study. This was a result of feedback regarding the subjective feeling during the
      installation procedure. There were no safety concerns w/r to the study products. Patients
      already included and treated in the study were monitored for the full duration of the study
      in accordance with the clinical study protocol.
