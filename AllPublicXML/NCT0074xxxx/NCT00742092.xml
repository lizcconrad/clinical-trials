          -  Male or female Non-pregnant women who are to remain non-pregnant for 3 months after
             the end of the study. Women of childbearing potential must use a reliable method of
             contraception. Reliable methods of contraception for female patients include the
             following:

               -  barrier type devices (e.g., female condom, diaphragm and contraceptive sponge)
                  used ONLY in combination with a spermicide

               -  intrauterine devices

               -  oral contraceptive agent

               -  Depo-Provera™ (medroxyprogesterone acetate)

               -  levonorgestrel implants Abstention, the rhythm method or contraception by the
                  partner alone are NOT reliable methods of contraception. A woman is considered to
                  have child-bearing potential unless she meets at least one of the following
                  criteria:

               -  6 weeks post-surgical bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or hysterectomy

               -  Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynecologist

               -  Age &gt; 50 years and not treated with any kind of HRT for at least 2 years prior to
                  screening, and with amenorrhea for at least 24 consecutive months prior to
                  screening and a serum FSH level of &gt; 40 IU/L at screening.

               -  Age &gt; 55 years and treated with HRT prior to screening with an appropriate
                  medical documentation of spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 24 months. For
                  female patients in the pediatric age range, a reliable method of contraception
                  must be considered, if appropriate.

                    -  Male patients accepting for the duration of the study and for 3 months
                       thereafter to use a condom and not to procreate a child (not in case of
                       azoospermia)

                    -  Cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the F508del mutation as confirmed by
                       genetic test

                    -  Signed informed consent prior to any study-mandated procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition prohibiting the correct measurement of the NPD such as upper respiratory
             tract infection

          -  Acute upper respiratory tract or pulmonary exacerbation requiring antibiotic
             intervention within 2 weeks of screening

          -  Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min as per Cockroft and Gault)

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential who will not undergo a pregnancy test prior
             to enrollment into the study

          -  History of significant lactose intolerance

          -  History of neuropathy

          -  Presence of clinically significant diarrhea (&gt; 3 liquid stools per day for &gt; 7 days)
             without definable cause within 1 month prior to screening

          -  Any known factor or disease that might interfere with treatment compliance, study
             conduct or interpretation of the results such as drug or alcohol dependence or
             psychiatric disease

          -  FEV1 &lt; 25% of predicted normal

          -  Oxygen saturation at rest &lt; 88%

          -  Active or passive smoking as measured using the Smokelyzer®

          -  Hypersensitivity to miglustat or any excipients

          -  Planned treatment or treatment with another investigationaldrug or therapy (e.g., gene
             therapy) within 1 month prior to randomization

          -  Breast-feeding, pregnant women or women who plan to become pregnant during the course
             of the study.
