      The aim of this study was to verify the frequency of the forward head posture in subjects
      with temporomandibular disorder and to compare them with control group

      Postural habit is defined as &quot;the attitude of the body&quot; being characterized as good when the
      parts of the body muscles and bones are lined up and work together in a harmonious form
      protecting the body of injury or gradual deformity and independently the attitude. The bad
      posture is a bad habit, but it can be which results in the disagreement of some parts of the
      body. These are at risk of injury or pain due to and increased tension that the disagreement
      imposes to the support structures. Several study confirm this occurrence relating that this
      the attitude can alter itself principally if a discomfort occurs. When it occurs there will
      be the installation of alterations, limitation of movements or even deformity, leading it to
      the development of an abnormal of posture of the body which will be able to reduce the
      functional capacity of various structures and organs of the human body.

      The forward head posture is a common abnormality in cervical spine that can contribute to
      perpetuation the trigger points in muscles of the head as well as some kinds of
      temporomandibular disorder. It was suggested its influence in the treatment of patients with
      orofacial pain and TMD the FHP may occur a result of an acute trauma or if develop itself
      gradually because of an inadequate position.

    <description>The investigation of the cervical position consisted of locating the individual in side view with the parallel feet in erect position and tracing an imprisoned plumb wire to the ceiling and tangent to the kyphosis curve of the thoracic column. With a ruler it was verified at a distance of this line until the point deepest of the cervical lordosis curve.</description>
