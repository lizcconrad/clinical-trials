  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to establish a model of neutrophil airway
      inflammation for future testing of anti-inflammatory substances in an early stage of clinical
      development. Moreover, the suitability of an electronic nose for early detection and
      diagnosis of airway inflammation will be determined.

    <textblock>
      Experimental ozone exposure of human subjects is known to induce transient neutrophilic
      airway inflammation with sputum neutrophilia and elevated concentrations of inflammatory
      mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum supernatants. In this study, ozone at a
      concentration of 250 ppb will be inhaled for three hours in an ozone challenge chamber.

      In a recent study, ozone challenge has been discussed as a model for pulmonary diseases
      dominated by neutrophilic inflammation such as COPD, providing the possibility to test new
      anti-inflammatory substances in early stages of clinical development.

               -  Of childbearing potential and using a highly effective method of contraception
                  during the entire study (vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence - the lifestyle
                  of the female should be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse
                  from two weeks prior to the study until at least 72 hours after the end of the
                  study -, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs)

          -  Subjects must be able to produce adequate sputum

          -  Subjects must be responsive to ozone in a screening challenge (250 ppb, 3h) defined by
