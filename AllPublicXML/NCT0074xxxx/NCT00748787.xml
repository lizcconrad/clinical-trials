  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome represents a constellation of risk factors associated to the abdominal
      obesity that includes insulin resistance, lipids alterations, high blood pressure etc.
      Several studies support the hypothesis that the intake of soluble fiber might have a positive
      effect in the improvement of such of these risk factors.

      So that, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Ispaghula husk in the remission
      of metabolic syndrome in children between 10 to 16 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is increasing in the last decade as well in adult
      people as in children and adolescents. The early diagnosis and treatment measures could be
      very important in order to reduce the cardiovascular risk in such populations.

      Ispaghula husk could be efficacious to reach the remission of the syndrome due to its effects
      in several important lipidic parameters.

      The study will consist in the treatment with Ispaghula husk during 4 months in patients with
      metabolic syndrome. The main variable is the remission of the metabolic syndrome following
      the IDF(International Diabetes Federation) criteria specifics for children.
