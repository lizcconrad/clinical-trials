  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess neurocognitive and associated neural regions/circuitry
      disruptions relevant to impulsive relapse in cocaine-addicted subjects, and the relationship
      of the cognitive and neural mechanisms of impulsivity/decision-making to relapse style.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore putative differences in impulsive behaviors and decision
      making in cocaine-addicted and healthy control subjects using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), and neurocognitive tasks. We
      predict that cocaine-addicted subjects will demonstrate neurocognitive and neural alterations
      in measures of impulsivity and decision-making when compared to healthy controls. That is,
      cocaine-addicted subjects will show both decreased activation and decreased resting measures
      of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the brain structures associated with impulsivity
      and decision-making. Furthermore, neurocognitive and neural deficits associated with
      impulsivity and decision-making will be associated with each other and with measures
      indicative of an impulsive relapse and altered decision making.
