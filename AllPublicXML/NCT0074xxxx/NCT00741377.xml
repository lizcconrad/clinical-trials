  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two portions, a phase I portion and a phase II portion. The purpose of the
      phase I portion is to assess the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and to characterize dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) of escalating doses of BHQ880 (up to a maximum dose of 20 mg/kg) in
      combination with standard chemotherapy and zoledronic acid in relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma patients.

      The phase II portion of the study will also be conducted in relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma patients. Patients will be treated with various doses of BHQ880 or placebo in
      combination standard chemotherapy. In the phase II portion of the study zoledronic acid will
      be added after the first 28 days of therapy with BHQ880 or placebo and standard chemotherapy.
      This will allow any BHQ880-related changes in bone biomarkers to be detected in a zoledronic
      acid-free environment. The purpose of the phase II portion of the study, is to determine one
      or more doses of BHQ880 for further development based on dose-efficacy modeling. Efficacy is
      defined as time to first skeletal-related event and change in bone markers for bone
      resorption and formation relative to placebo. A skeletal-related event is defined as:

        -  Pathologic fracture

        -  Spinal cord compression

        -  Requirement for either radiation or surgery to bone due to:

             -  Pain

             -  Prevention of imminent fracture

             -  Stabilization of a fracture Biomarker and imaging endpoints will be assessed in
                both phases of the study. The pharmacodynamic effects of BHQ880 will be assessed by
                measuring biochemical markers of bone formation, resorption, and metabolism in
                serum and urine. Charges in serum DKK1 levels will be characterized. The size and
                number of lytic bone lesions as measured by bone survey (X-ray) or MRI will be
                assessed. In addition, bone mineral density (BMD) will be measured by DEXA scan and
                at selected sites with QCT scans.
