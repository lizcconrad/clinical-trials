  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are commonly deficient in vitamin D, with low
      levels of both calcidiol (25 hydroxy vitamin D) and calcitriol (1,25-hydroxy vitamin D).
      Patients with CKD are also known to have abnormalities in their immune cells, increased
      susceptibility to infection and increased prevalence of malignancies. In patients without
      kidney disease, repletion of vitamin D appears to help some immune mediated diseases. Thus it
      is logical that patients with CKD who are vitamin D deficient may benefit from repletion of
      vitamin D, in either its native form (cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol) or in the form of
      calcitriol or its analogues. However, no interventional data demonstrates that repletion
      positively impacts immune status in CKD patients. To test this hypothesis, a large
      interventional study will be required. However, prior to conducting this study, several
      important steps are needed. The present proposal aims to generate the necessary data to
      appropriately plan and conduct a future multi center interventional study. Specifically, we
      will examine the following specific aims in a population of CKD stage 3 and 4 subjects from
      Indiana University Affiliated Nephrology Clinics and determine

        1. if abnormalities in immune cells and immune blood tests are related to abnormalities in
           vitamin D.

        2. how reproducible these changes are on repeat testing and

        3. if repletion of vitamin D changes these cells and immune blood tests in a small pilot
           study.
