      The purpose of this study is to determine the long term effects of early intervention
      (placement into foster care) on physical, cognitive, social and brain development and
      psychiatric symptomatology in previously institutionalized children.

      The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP) was a randomized controlled trial of foster
      care as an intervention for children abandoned at or around the time of birth and placed in
      one of six institutions for young children in Bucharest, Romania (Zeanah et al., 2003). The
      PI (Nelson) and Co-PIs (Zeanah and Fox) conducted this study from a feasibility phase in the
      fall of 2000, through baseline assessments and implementation of the intervention in the
      spring of 2001.

      The BEIP began with comprehensive assessments of 136 institutionalized children and their
      caregiving environments prior to randomization. Half the children were randomly assigned to
      high-quality foster care and the other half to remain in institutional care. The average age
      at foster care placement was 22 months (range=6-31 months). All children were initially seen
      prior to randomization and again for follow-up assessments at 30 months, 42 months 54 months,
      8 years and 12 years of age. The development of children in foster care was compared to the
      development of children in institutions and to a group of never institutionalized children
      (community controls). These children are currently being assessed at age 15-16 years.

    <description>A group of children living in institutions for children in Bucharest, Romania was randomly assigned to placement in foster care. Foster parents were recruited, consented to background checks, and received training in Romanian. Prior to placement, foster parents visited their children to begin developing a relationship with the child. Once hired, foster parents were supported and monitored by project social workers. Foster parents in the BEIP network received frequent visits from the social workers, with visits occuring weekly for several months after initial placement of the child, then biweekly and later monthly. Foster parents also had the opportunity to participate in a support group organized by project social workers. Project social workers received weekly consultation from US staff experienced in dealing with young children in foster care.</description>
