    <textblock>
      Background: The treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is based mainly on 3
      compounds: 1- 5 aminosalysilates . 2- immunomodulators (Azathioprines). 3- Biologic therapies
      (Infliximab, Adalimumab) . There are no established data in the literature whether these
      therapies effects sperm quality. Given that a large number of the patients are young men in
      the reproductive stage of their lives , It of importance to investigate these effect.

      Aim: To investigate the effect of chronic treatment of any of the three therapy mentioned
      above, on sperm quality .
