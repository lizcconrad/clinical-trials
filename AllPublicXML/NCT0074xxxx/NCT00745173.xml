    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution,
      breakdown and elimination in the body) of a single dose of bazedoxifene (BZA) 20 mg tablet
      when administered together with multiple doses of Premarin (conjugated estrogens or CE) to
      healthy postmenopausal women.

      Information will also be obtained regarding the safety and tolerability of this combination
      in healthy, postmenopausal women.

          -  Blood hormone levels must be consistent with a postmenopausal state (for specified
             subjects).

          -  They can either be a non-smoker or smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day, and be able
             to abstain from smoking during clinic confinements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject will be excluded from participation if they :

          -  Have participated in a clinical drug study within 30 days prior to study medication
             administration;

          -  Have a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year or consume more than 2 standard
             units per day of alcohol (a standard unit equals 12 ounces of beer, 1 Â½ ounces of
             80-proof alcohol or 6 ounces of wine);

          -  Donate any other plasma or blood during the total study.
