      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a daily supplement of 30 grams of walnut is
      effective in the treatment of metabolic syndrome (MetS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a constellation of metabolic abnormalities including central
      obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure and hyperglycemia, is associated with the
      development of type 2 diabetes and CVD. It has become one of the major public health
      challenges in China due to rapidly nutrition transition and the nature of obesity epidemic.
      Treatment of MetS in China is very important for the prevention of the epidemic of its
      consequences (such as CVD and type 2 diabetes).

      Compelling evidence from recent human studies has demonstrated that diet and lifestyle
      modifications are effective means in MetS management. Walnut is a complex food source
      containing high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), as well as plant protein,
      Vitamin E and other substances that may have an impact on health. Therefore, the aim of this
      study is to investigate the effect of walnut supplementation on the management of MetS in
      adult Chinese men and women in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. A total of 200
      participants with MetS (defined by NCEP-ATPⅢ criteria) will be randomly assigned to a
      walnut-supplemented diet (30 grams/day) or an isocaloric control diet for 12 weeks. Effects
      of walnut supplementation will be evaluated by measuring metabolic profile (BMI, blood
      pressure, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C and HDL-C, fasting glucose and insulin,
      HbA1C), inflammatory markers (CRP and IL-6), markers of endothelial function (E-selectin,
      ICAM-1 and VCAM-1), and fatty acid profile.
