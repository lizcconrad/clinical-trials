  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Now it is commonly accepted that MSC produce an immune-tolerant environment in different
      settings. It has been shown (mainly for BM-MSC) that MSC can down-regulate T cells
      activation. This characteristic of BM derived MSC already has clinical implications and shows
      their potent effectiveness both in prophylaxis and treatment of resistant GvHD. Ongoing
      clinical trials of use bone marrow MSC for treatment of steroid resistant GvHD are
      successfully run on and some bone marrow donor registries included BM-MSC as a material for
      donation. According to our preclinical studies MSC from cells from marrow, placenta,
      umbilical cord vessels demonstrate similar pronounced immunosuppressive effect both with
      autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes. Our preliminary clinical experience shows that BM-MSC
      is an effective tool for treatment of steroid resistant GVHD. Present study aimed to
      demonstrate if human UC-MSC has in vivo immunosuppressive effect and can be used for GVHD
      treatment

        Inclusion criteria:

        1. Informed consent. 2. Any patient that has undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation
        with steroid refractory grades II-IV acute GvHD either occurring post transplant, or
        induced by donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) or T-cell add back. A positive biopsy for GvHD
        is not required if clinical signs and symptoms are characteristic for GvHD and other
        etiologies are excluded.

        3. Patient received best known therapy for GvHD including: i. Patients must receive
        cyclosporine A (trough level 150-300 ng/ml) or tacrolimus (trough level 5-15 ng/ml).

        ii. In addition, steroids must have been given, for instance prednisolone â‰¥2 mg/kg/day (or
        equivalent doses of methylprednisolone, etc.) for at least 72h in case of progressive acute
        GvHD, 5 days non progressive acute GvHD.

        iii. Despite this treatment, the patient has unresponsive GvHD after 5 days or progressive
        acute GvHD after 72 hours. If single organ acute GvHD grade II from gut or liver, either
        progression from single organ or addition of one or two more organs; e.g., if the patient
        has grade II acute GvHD of the skin, GvHD is more intense and more widespread, or GvHD also
        includes liver and/or gut.

        iv. Patients with steroid refractory GvHD fulfilling the requirements mentioned in a) - c)
        may be treated with second line therapy, e.g., MMF, serotherapy, ECP, change of CsA for
        tacrolimus or vice versa, etc. Failure to respond to additional treatment similar to what
        is described for steroids in c) is necessary before enrolment in this study.

        v. Termination of all GvHD medications other than cyclosporine/tacrolimus/MMF and
        prednisolone is strongly encouraged.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Patients with poor performance, not expected to survive 5 days.

          2. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to penicillin and/or gentamycine

          3. Poor compliance.

        Donor inclusion criteria:

          1. MSC donor must be HIV, HB-s antigen, anti HBc and anti HCV negative.

          2. First choice original HSC donor HLA-identical sibling donor.

          3. Second choice mismatched related or unrelated donor (for instance MSC frozen and left
             over from another patient).

          4. Third choice or emergency pre-expanded third party umbilical cord/placenta derived
             MSC.

        Donor exclusion criteria:

          1. Donor more than 65 years of age, or unhealthy.

          2. Donor who is positive for HIV, hepatitis Bs antigen, HB-s, anti-HBc and anti HCV
             negative.
