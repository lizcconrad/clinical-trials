  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research is to demonstrate (or measure) the intestinal
      availability of lipase, amylase, and protease (enzymes the body has a shortage of) from
      PANCRECARB® when administered with a meal.

      Eligible patients for this placebo-controlled study had confirmed exocrine pancreatic
      insufficiency with a stool pancreatic elastase of &lt;75 mcg/g. Patients who satisfied all
      inclusion criteria are prepared for endoscopic placement of three Liguory nasal biliary
      aspiration catheters: one 8.5 fr. catheter in the distal duodenum for aspiration, one 7.0 fr.
      catheter in the first portion of the duodenum for infusion of a PEG marker (4 mL/min) and one
      7.0 fr. in the stomach for aspiration. Baseline samples are obtained from the gastric and
      distal duodenal ports and placed on ice. Subjects are then asked to swallow 5 capsules of a
      placebo (Phase I) or the test drug (PANCRECARB® (pancrelipase) - Phase II) with a
      standardized Lundh meal. Gastric samples are collected once an hour and duodenal samples are
      collected every 15 minutes for each phase (4 hours each). All collected samples were tested
      for the following parameters to demonstrate bioavailability of enzymes originating from
      PANCRECARB® (pancrelipase): lipase, amylase and protease activities, pH (bicarbonate), and
      protein fingerprinting by SDS-PAGE analysis.
