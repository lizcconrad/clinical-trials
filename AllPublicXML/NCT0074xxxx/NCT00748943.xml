    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown the oxidizing properties and microbiological efficacies of
      chlorine dioxide (ClO2). However, no clinical studies have investigated its microbiological
      efficacies on periodontal and malodorous bacteria. The aim of this study was to assess the
      inhibitory effects of a mouthwash containing ClO2 on morning oral malodor and on salivary
      periodontal and malodorous bacteria using for 7 days.

      Background: Previous research has shown the oxidizing properties and microbiological
      efficacies of chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Its clinical efficacies on oral malodor have been
      evaluated and reported, however, no clinical studies have investigated its microbiological
      efficacies on periodontal and malodorous bacteria. The aim of this study was to assess the
      inhibitory effects of a mouthwash containing ClO2 on morning oral malodor and on salivary
      periodontal and malodorous bacteria using for 7 days.

      Methods: A randomized, double blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial was
      conducted among 15 healthy male volunteers, who were divided into 2 groups. In the first test
      phase, the group 1 subjects (N = 8) were instructed to rinse with the experimental mouthwash
      containing ClO2 twice per day for 7 days, and those in group 2 (N = 7) to rinse with the
      control (placebo) mouthwash without ClO2. In the second test, phase after a one week washout
      period, each group had used the opposite mouthwash for 7 days. At baseline and after 7 days,
      oral malodor was evaluated with OM, and concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl
      mercaptan (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S), the main VSCs of human oral malodor, were
      evaluated with GC. Clinical outcome variables included plaque and gingival indices, and the
      Winkel Tongue Coating Index(WTCI). The samples of saliva were microbiologically investigated.

      Outcome variables were compared by t-test and Mann-Whitney test.
