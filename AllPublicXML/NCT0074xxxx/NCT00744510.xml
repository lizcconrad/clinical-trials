  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is very common, affecting approximately 5% of women of
      reproductive age, and impacts not only on quality of life, but also has long-term health
      consequences for many sufferers, such as increased risks of developing Type II diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease and cancer of the womb. The symptoms that may occur such as irregular
      periods; lots of body hair; thinning hair on scalp, obesity and infertility, can also lead to
      poor self-esteem. Whilst treatments can help fertility, other treatments to correct the other
      symptoms are less successful. Alternative methods to regulate periods would be helpful,
      especially ones which avoid the long-term use of steroids in patients who may already be
      overweight. Reflexology is poorly represented in scientific papers, with nothing published
      regarding reflexology and its effect upon PCOS. However patients who use reflexology report
      more regular periods, thicker hair on scalp and greater wellbeing. Therefore we aim to
      investigate the effect of reflexology on:

        1. The menstruation cycle (normal being every 21-35 days).

        2. Imbalances in hormone, insulin and blood sugar levels associated with PCOS.

        3. Other problems associated with PCOS such as thinning hair on scalp, excessive body hair,
           and obesity.

        4. Quality of life. Government and NHS agendas agree that if there's evidence of an
           effective complimentary therapy the NHS should provide it. Therefore the results may
           have an influence on the care pathways of patients with PCOS towards a more holistic,
           patient centred and empowered approach. It is also non invasive and liable to result in
           higher patient satisfaction regarding their treatment. This research may also inform
           policy makers so that complementary medicine provision is provided on a wider basis
           within the NHS, which at the moment is dictated by the individual Trust's budget
           allocation. However this research could save money overall as in America, the yearly
           cost of treating PCOS is $4.36 billion.
