  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with diabetes mellitus have to measure their blood glucose levels quite often,
      in order to maintain a proper glycemic control. Current methods of self-monitoring of blood
      glucose are invasive, painful, uncomfortable, and only allow occasional, from time-to-time,
      measurements. Real-time continuous monitoring would provide a helpful tool for improvement of
      glycemic control, thus decreasing the incidence of hypoglycemia and improving glucose
      control. The Mellitor sensor is a new concept of continue glucose monitoring device. The
      Mellitor device is an implantable continuous glucose monitoring sensor that is intended for
      detection episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in diabetic patients, and facilitates
      both acute and long-term therapy adjustments. This study was design in order to evaluate
      glucose measurement capabilities by the Mellitor sensor that is being developed. Transudate
      liquid samples, withdrawn in a clinical procedure and normally immediately disposed, will be
      used for glucose measurement by the Mellitor sensor.

      Study Design

      This study is an ex-vivo comparative study. 20 patients will be recruited for the study,
      according to patients' inflow and meeting eligibility criteria.

      Study Goal

      Study objective is to evaluate the feasibility of the Mellitor Sensor technology for glucose
      level measurement.

      Study Endpoint

      Mellitor technology feasibility will be established by comparing Mellitor glucose
      measurements results, based on transudate/exudates liquid withdrawal for other medical
      reasons, to &quot;gold standard, Yellow Springs&quot; glucose analyzer, or a comparable, calibrated and
      approved device using the same transudate/exudates liquid. Interdevice variability should be
      within 10%.
