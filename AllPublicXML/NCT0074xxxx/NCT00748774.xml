      The goal of this study is to compare patient ratings of how severe their own symptoms may be,
      with their caregivers' ratings of how severe they think the patients' symptoms may be. This
      will be compared using a questionnaire that is given to patients with brain tumors and their
      caregivers.

      Researchers will also study any effects that these patients' neurocognitive function may have
      on these patients' and their caregivers' ratings of how severe the brain cancer symptoms may
      be.

      Study Visit:

      If you and your caregiver agree to take part in this study, you will both complete 2
      questionnaires. You will be in separate rooms when you complete the questionnaires.

      The first questionnaire is a demographic questionnaire that asks basic questions such as your
      age and employment status.

      Your second questionnaire asks about any brain cancer symptoms that you may be experiencing,
      and asks you to rate how severe they may be.

      Your caregiver's second questionnaire asks the same questions as yours. It asks the caregiver
      to rate how severe he or she believes your symptoms may be.

      In total, the questionnaires should take about 10 minutes to complete.

      Symptom Review:

      The study staff will review the questionnaire responses right away. If you rate any symptom
      as severe as 7 or higher, the study staff will tell you to contact your doctor who is
      treating the cancer. The study staff will also contact your doctor who is treating the
      cancer. Otherwise, your questionnaire responses will only be used for research and there are
      no plans to contact your doctor.

      Length of Study Participation:

      After you and your caregiver complete the questionnaires this one time, your and your
      caregivers' active participation in this study will be over.

      The study chair will also collect information from your medical record. This information will
      include your medical history and the results of the neurocognitive testing (routine tests of
      &quot;thinking&quot; skills such as your memory and concentration).

      This is an investigational study. Up to 120 patients and 120 caregivers will take part in
      this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
