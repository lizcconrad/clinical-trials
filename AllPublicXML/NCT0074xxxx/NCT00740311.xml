  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a dental extraction, the osseous alveoli fill naturally of a blood clot which is
      transformed some month later into osseous tissues. Even if the alveolar walls remain intact
      at the end of the intervention, the healing always comes along with a physiological reduction
      at the level of the site. The reduction of the alveolar crests is a continuous, cumulative
      and inexorable phenomenon This reduction entails in the long term aesthetic and functional
      damages which complicate the prosthetic rehabilitation of the dental articulate. That the
      prosthetic rehabilitation is removable or fixed, implanto-carried or not, it is made more
      difficult and less comfortable for the patient. In oral surgery, certain pathologies require
      for their treatment the use of materials of filling generating an activity of reduction /
      osseous replacement ending in the formation of a physiological calcified neo-tissue. Numerous
      products of osseous replacement were already used to realize alveolar fillings to avoid this
      inevitable and strongly harmful osseous loss.The purpose of the present study is to quantify
      the physiological osseous loss due to the dental extraction with or without filling by a
      randomized study and with calibrated criteria of evaluation. The current standard of care is
      no filling (healing from the blood clot) and we know the consecutive osseous loss during the
      aging. The technique by filling with an osseous substitute is more and more used in Europe
      and in Asia because of the decrease of the osseous loss. At first, these substitutes were
      constituted by bone grafts (autografts, allografts, xenografts) that tend to be replaced by
      synthetic materials. To realize these fillings according to countries, various materials are
      used (bovine bone, coral, bio glasses, phosphates of calcium). The most used synthetic
      materials are calcium ortho phosphates, the composition of which is close to mineral phases
      of calcified tissues. Ceramic of phosphate of calcium and more particularly the Biphasic
      Phosphate Calcium (BCP) was already used in numerous clinical applications.We chose as this
      study MBCP gel â„¢, same product beforehand used in 2 clinical studies for which the Nantes
      University Hospital was the sponsor.The perspectives of this study are to be able to propose
      the systematization of the alveolar filling to be able to decrease the osseous reduction
      after an extraction and to be able to propose more functional prosthetic rehabilitation
      (improvement of the masticatory power), more aesthetic and comfortable. When we know the
      effect of the under nutrition due to masticator difficulties notably at the aged persons, we
      measure all the importance of this major problem of Public health.
