      1. Purpose

             1. Provide a culturally sensitive and supportive treatment environment for children,
                youth and families in the aboriginal community experiencing stress, anxiety and
                depression.

             2. Gain insight into understanding of the role of Traditional Healing options provided
                by Aboriginal Healers and Helpers in the management of stress, anxiety and
                depression.

             3. Encourage Aboriginal and First Nation clients to seek treatment earlier from a
                culturally supportive system.

        2. Hypothesis

      This will be a descriptive hypothesis generating research project, however it is anticipated
      that members of the Aboriginal community experiencing stress, anxiety and depression may
      experience improved care and outcomes if their treatment includes traditional healing
      methods. A number of measures of subject and treatment characteristics, stress, anxiety and
      depression will provide the foundation for triangulation of outcomes in order to describe the
      impact of the various treatment options (standard care, Traditional Healing, combined
      standard care and Traditional Healing).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aboriginal clients, including first nation youth, may not be confident or comfortable with
      the standard treatments offered by the current Mental Health environment. Incorporating
      traditional aboriginal healing methods such as dream work, energy healing, healing circles,
      pipe ceremonies, self care, smudging, sweat lodge and traditional learning into standard
      practice will provide a culturally sensitive and supportive environment for children, youth
      and families experiencing stress, anxiety and depression.

      It is believed that Aboriginal and First Nation clients that access treatment options
      consistent with cultural beliefs will be encouraged to seek treatment earlier and will
      experience improved care and outcomes.

      In addition, the improved understanding of the role of traditional healing methods provided
      by Aboriginal Healers and Helpers in the management of these disorders will help clinicians
      incorporate these practices in the management of anxiety and depression
