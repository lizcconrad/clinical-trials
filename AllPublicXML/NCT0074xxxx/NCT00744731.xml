  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain long-term safety and tolerability information on
      carisbamate as add-on therapy for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with
      epilepsy. Seizure counts will be obtained to measure the rate of seizures for each patient
      during the study.

      CARISEPY3014 is the open-label extension study that follows the double-blind study
      CARISEPY3013 (NCT00740623). In an open label study such as CARISEPY3014, both the physician
      and the patient know the name of the assigned study medication. In a double blind study such
      as CARISEPY-3013, neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned study
      medication. Patients who complete the 14-week double-blind treatment phase of study
      CARISEPY3013 will be eligible to enter the open-label extension study during which patients
      will transition through a 1-week blinded period to open-label carisbamate. There will be a 1
      week blinded transition during which patients will take blinded study medication; after this,
      patients will then take unblinded, open-label study medication. Safety assessments include
      the monitoring of the frequency, severity, and timing of adverse events, clinical laboratory
      test results, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, vital signs measurements, physical
      and neurologic examinations, the Physician Withdrawal Checklist for symptoms of withdrawal
      for those patients who taper and/or discontinue study drug, and pregnancy tests for females
      of childbearing potential. Seizure counts will be obtained at every visit. The Quality of
      Life in Epilepsy-31 Patient Inventory questionnaire will be administered once during the
      study. A Medical Resource utilization questionnaire will be used to obtain cost-effectiveness
      information on carisbamate and will be administered twice during the study. There is no
      statistical testing hypothesis for this study. Carisbamate tablets taken twice daily in 2
      equally divided doses, with or without food, and taken with noncarbonated water. During the
      first week on study, patients will take blinded transition study medication and thereafter
      will take a target dosage of 800 mg/day of unblinded, open-label study medication. The dosage
      of study medication will range from 400 to 1,200 mg/day. Patients will receive treatment for
      1 year with the potential to receive treatment longer.
