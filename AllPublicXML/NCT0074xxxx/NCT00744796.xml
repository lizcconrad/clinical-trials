      The purpose of this study is to report the early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing
      Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK) for corneal edema secondary
      to corneal endothelial cell dysfunction, and to correlate this clinical data with the latest
      generation of imaging modalities available for the anterior segment.

      A concurrent study in which a retrospective as well as a prospective cases of patients
      undergoing DSAEK procedures for indication of corneal endothelial cell dysfunction. For the
      retrospective study, all cases of DSAEK procedures performed at UT-Southwestern for corneal
      edema secondary to endothelial cell dysfunction will be considered. The clinical outcomes of
      these surgeries will be analyzed and correlated with the anterior segment imaging from each
      case. Statistical analysis will then be performed on the data collected. And for the
      prospective arm of this trial, we propose to recruit up to 200 current patient cases of
      corneal edema second corneal endothelial cell dysfunction. These patients will undergo ocular
      imaging studies in addition to routine ocular exams performed before surgery and at the
      discretion of the investigational physician at 6-month and 12-month after surgical treatment.
      Various imaging modalities would include corneal topography, pentacam, anterior segment OCT,
      wavefront measurement and Tandem Scanning Confocal Microscopy (TSCM). The patients who have
      already had the DSAEK procedure done in the past will undergo ocular examination as well as
      various imaging studies at their post op follow up visits. All these modalities are routinely
      used as standard of care practice and are non-invasive. The data from the ocular examination
      and various imaging techniques will be pooled and analyzed at the end of the study in order
      to identify the factors that influence the visual outcome. We believe this will help us learn
      more about this interesting and innovative technique while at the same time help us improve
      the method further in order to obtain better results in future patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18 and up, where any age over 89 will be recorded as 'greater than 89',
             who have reviewed and understood the study consent form will be invited to participate
             in this study.

          -  They will be recruited based on diagnosis of corneal edema secondary to endothelial
             cell dysfunction undergoing DSAEK either alone or in conjunction with
             phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation at the University of Texas
             Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients younger than 18 years will not be considered for this trial.

          -  The study will include all patients (no exclusion criteria) who have undergone and
             will undergo DSAEK implantation for corneal edema secondary to corneal endothelial
             dystrophy with an effort to determine its success.
