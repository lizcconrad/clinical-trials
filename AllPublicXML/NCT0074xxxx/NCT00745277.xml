      1. Briefly describe the purpose of this protocol:

             -  The purpose of this study is to see how low dose vs. high dose of the study drug,
                carbidopa, effect movement in subjects with Parkinson's disease. The low dose of
                the study drug is 75 mg and the high dose is 450mg.

        2. Briefly describe the procedures subjects will undergo:

             -  Subjects will take part in 2 screening visits one week apart to determine
                eligibility. Subjects will be randomly chosen to start either high or low dose
                carbidopa and take it for 4 weeks. Subjects will be called 2, 4, and 6 or 7 days
                after this visit to ask how they are doing after starting this dose of study drug.
                The investigators will leave subjects a message if the investigators cannot reach
                them. If there are any problems, the investigators will schedule them to come to
                the clinic within the next 2 days.

             -  Subjects will have an outpatient visit 2 weeks after screening and a hospital
                admission 2 weeks after that. At the hospital, subjects will stay for 3 days. They
                will have blood drawn and their Parkinson's disease assessed by a finger tapping
                exercise, timing their walking, and looking at their uncontrolled movements.

             -  The subject will then receive the opposite dose of carbidopa for 4 weeks. Subjects
                will be called 2, 4, and 6 or 7 days after this visit to ask how they are doing
                after starting this dose of study drug. The investigators will leave them a message
                if we cannot reach them. If there are any problems, the investigators will schedule
                them to come to the clinic within the next 2 days.

             -  The outpatient visit and hospital admission will repeat again. At the end of the
                second hospital admission, treatment on the study is over and subjects will go back
                to their original Parkinson's disease medications. The study will end with a follow
                up phone call or clinic visit 2 - 4 weeks after the final hospital admission.

        3. If applicable, briefly describe survey/interview instruments used.

             -  Subjects will fill out a daily diary that asks about their movement throughout the
                day for 3 days before they come to the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research
                Institute.

        4. Briefly describe how the data will be analyzed to address the purpose of the protocol.

             -  Finger tapping rates will be compared between high and low dose study drug use to
                see if one group has slower rates than the other.
