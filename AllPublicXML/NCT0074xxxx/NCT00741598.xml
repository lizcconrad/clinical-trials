    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether extended release galantamine, a drug approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration to reduce cognitive impairments in people with Alzheimer's disease, can
      perform the same function in stable people with bipolar disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 2.6% of Americans age 18 and older, or 5.7 million people, suffer from bipolar
      disorder. The manic and depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder prevent normal
      functioning in individuals with the disorder, but functional impairment can occur even when
      bipolar disorder is in remission. Previous research indicates that this impairment in stable
      individuals with bipolar disorder is linked to neurocognitive deficits, such as problems with
      memory and attention. The drug extended release galantamine increases the level of
      acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter important for memory, available in the brain. This drug has
      already been approved by the FDA to treat neurocognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease
      patients. This study will examine whether administering the drug to individuals with bipolar
      disorder who are in remission can also reduce their neurocognitive deficits and improve the
      quality of their life. The study will also examine the safety of the drug for use in the
      obsessive-compulsive disorder population.

      Participation in this study will last about 18 weeks and will involve six study visits. Each
      of the first two visits will include 2 hours of clinical, physical, and self-report tests,
      the first for screening and the second to establish physical and mental health baseline
      measurements. Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either galantamine or
      placebo daily for 16 weeks, and they will be provided with enough of the assigned pill to
      last until the next visit. Half hour visits on Weeks 4, 8, and 12 will consist of
      psychological self-report tests and interviews, clinical assessment of side effects from the
      drug, and the determination by the examining doctor and participant whether to increase,
      decrease, or maintain the same level of the drug. Participants will also be given enough of
      the drug to last until the next visit. The final visit, on Week 16, will last 2 hours and
      will consist of the same tests administered at the baseline visit in addition to the
      neuropsychological tests administered at the screening visit. The full range of tests will
      measure physical health, verbal memory, mental flexibility, attention, life impairment, and
      life satisfaction.

    <measure>Scores on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) at Screening and Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at screening and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>CVLT is a test measuring verbal learning and verbal memory. Subjects are expected to remember a list of words. They are asked to repeat the words remembered 5 times (5 trials). Each of the words correctly remembered, in each trial, is marked as 1 point. The outcome measures presented are:
CVLT Total Trials 1-5, Baseline = Number of total words remembered, sum of trials 1-5, at baseline CVLT Total Trials 1-5, Week 16 = Number of total words remembered, sum of trials 1-5, at week 16.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Scores on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) at Screening and Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at screening and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>WCST (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) is a neuropsychological test measuring the ability to display flexibility in the face of changing schedules of reinforcement. Subjects are presented with cards and requested to match them. Unbeknownst to the subject, the matching rules change while the test is delivered. The test measures subjects' ability to understand the new rules.
The outcome measures presented are Total correct baseline = total correct card choices at baseline Total errors baseline = total erroneous card choices at baseline Total correct week 16 = total correct card choices at week 16 Total errors baseline = total erroneous card choices at week 16</description>

    <measure>The Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) at Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at screening; baseline; and Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Conner's CPT (Conner's Continuous Performance Task) is a neuropsychological test that measures a person's sustained and selective attention. Subjects are instructed to click the space bar when they are presented with any letter except the letter &quot;X&quot;. The person must refrain from clicking if they see the letter &quot;X&quot; presented. Clicking to the letter &quot;X&quot; is a commission error, not clicking to other letters are omission errors.
The outcome measures presented are Total number of errors = Total number of omission + commission errors This outcome measure is presented at each study visit (baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 16)</description>

    <measure>The Range of Impaired Functioning Tool (LIFE-RIFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The LIFE-RIFT is a brief measure of functional impairment. The total scale score is a sum of four items with range of scale from 0 to 26 (from no impairment to severe impairment).</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) is a self-report instrument designed to measure the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning. There are 16 areas of functioning, each scored from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The range of scores is 16-80, with lower scores representing lower functioning and satisfaction.
The outcome measures presented are Q-LES-Q Total score = Sum of all scores from all 16 areas of functioning</description>

        <description>CVLT is a test measuring verbal learning and verbal memory. Subjects are expected to remember a list of words. They are asked to repeat the words remembered 5 times (5 trials). Each of the words correctly remembered, in each trial, is marked as 1 point. The outcome measures presented are:
CVLT Total Trials 1-5, Baseline = Number of total words remembered, sum of trials 1-5, at baseline CVLT Total Trials 1-5, Week 16 = Number of total words remembered, sum of trials 1-5, at week 16.</description>

        <title>Scores on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) at Screening and Week 16</title>
        <description>WCST (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) is a neuropsychological test measuring the ability to display flexibility in the face of changing schedules of reinforcement. Subjects are presented with cards and requested to match them. Unbeknownst to the subject, the matching rules change while the test is delivered. The test measures subjects' ability to understand the new rules.
The outcome measures presented are Total correct baseline = total correct card choices at baseline Total errors baseline = total erroneous card choices at baseline Total correct week 16 = total correct card choices at week 16 Total errors baseline = total erroneous card choices at week 16</description>

        <description>Conner’s CPT (Conner’s Continuous Performance Task) is a neuropsychological test that measures a person's sustained and selective attention. Subjects are instructed to click the space bar when they are presented with any letter except the letter &quot;X&quot;. The person must refrain from clicking if they see the letter &quot;X&quot; presented. Clicking to the letter “X” is a commission error, not clicking to other letters are omission errors.
The outcome measures presented are Total number of errors = Total number of omission + commission errors This outcome measure is presented at each study visit (baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 16)</description>

        <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) is a self-report instrument designed to measure the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning. There are 16 areas of functioning, each scored from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The range of scores is 16-80, with lower scores representing lower functioning and satisfaction.
The outcome measures presented are Q-LES-Q Total score = Sum of all scores from all 16 areas of functioning</description>
