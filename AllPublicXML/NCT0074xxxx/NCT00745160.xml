  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if collecting information and blood from a group of
      people who never smoked but who have lung cancer, is possible across the US. The
      investigators will collect information on each patient's diagnosis and treatments. If the
      collection is successful, blood samples will be used to try to identify new genes (which are
      the basic elements of heredity, passed from parents to their offspring), which may explain
      and predict why certain patients develop lung cancer without having smoked tobacco.

        Never-smokers with lung cancer

        Internet recruitment The study will be advertised through a specifically designed website
        linked to the MSKCC Lung Cancer webpage. The website will be designed after approval of the
        study. The website will be accordingly reviewed by the IRB. We plan to advertise this study
        by word-of mouth at scientific meetings and on patient associations' websites and/or
        bulletins, with permission. The website will post a description of the study and an
        invitation to participate.

        Interested patients will be given an email or mail address and/or phone number 866-854-4652
        to contact MSKCC investigators about the study.
