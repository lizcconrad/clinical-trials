    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and initial efficacy of the epidural
      injection procedure when combined with real-time multi-frequency bio-impedance measurements
      that collect data on the electrical bioimpedance characteristics of living human tissue on
      the path of the epidural needle.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or females 18 - 60 years of age

          2. Imaging spine study (CT or MRI) in previous 3 months.

          3. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-III

          4. Patients undergoing elective standard pain relief treatment of Epidural Steroid
             Injection

          5. Patients must be willing to participate in the study, and provide written informed
             consent

          6. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during the
             screening and baseline visits or the patient must be surgically sterile or be at least
             one year postmenopausal

          7. Women of child-bearing potential must be using a medically acceptable method of birth
             control throughout the study such as: bilateral tubal ligation or the use of either a
             contraceptive implant, a contraceptive injection, an intrauterine device, or an oral
             contraceptive that has been taken for at least three months, which the subject agrees
             to continue using during the study, or a double-barrier method which must consist of a
             combination of any two of the following: diaphragm, cervical cap, condom or
             spermicide.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any contraindications for epidural injection

          2. Patient with severe scoliosis

          3. Previous spinal surgery, or any additional surgical intervention in the level of
             epidural injection other than elective standard pain relief treatment of Epidural
             Steroid Injection.

          4. Documented, known or per examination neurological deficiency in lower extremities.

          5. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients

          6. Patients who have participated in another study within 30 days of enrolment

          7. Investigator's opinion that the patient is medically unfit or would be at major risk
             if enrolled into the study i.e. known coagulopathy or recent use of anticoagulants or
             anti aggregates.

          8. Presence of fever, sepsis or infection near the point of insertion or an infection in
             the bloodstream which may &quot;seed&quot; onto the catheter

          9. Patients with known Hypovolemia

         10. Any known Anatomical abnormalities, such as spina bifida, meningomyelocele or
             scoliosis

         11. Patient suffering problems of the central nervous system, including multiple sclerosis
             or syringomyelia

         12. Patients with identified heart-valve problems

         13. Patients excessively hirsute where the surface electrodes are to be placed that are
             unwilling to shave these areas.
