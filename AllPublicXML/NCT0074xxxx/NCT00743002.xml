    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to show the effect of treatment with TT223 or placebo on blood glucose
      control after 12 weeks of treatment with a 6 month follow-up. TT223 is administered by
      injection once daily to patients currently treated with Metformin and/or Thiazolidinedione.
