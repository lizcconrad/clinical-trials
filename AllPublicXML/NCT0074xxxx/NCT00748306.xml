             years.

             [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked]

         10. Demonstration of a positive wheal and flare reaction (≥3 mm relative to negative
             control) to at least one allergen from a battery of allergens (including house dust

         17. The subject has a screening QTc value of &gt;450msec, PR interval outside the range 120
             to 220msec or an ECG that is not suitable for QT measurements (e.g. poorly defined
             termination of the T-wave).

         18. The subject has tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface
             antigen.
