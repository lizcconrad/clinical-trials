    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of a diet rich in palm olein, a fraction of
      palm oil, to a diet rich in olive oil and a diet rich in Danish lard on plasma total-, LDL
      and HDL cholesterol as well as triacylglycerol (TAG), fasting insulin and glucose, C reactive
      protein and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in healthy men. The investigators hypothesis is
      that palm olein and olive oil will have the same effect on plasma total cholesterol, LDL- and
      HDL concentration and maybe also on the secondary outcome parameters that are related to
      cardiovascular disease risk. This may be caused by the differences in the sn-positioning of
      palmitic acid in palm olein. This difference may cause the palmitic acid in palm olein to be
      more prone to soap formations and excretion than palmitic acid from other sources, e.g. lard.

      This study is a double blinded, randomized, controlled 3 x 3 week crossover intervention
      study, without washout periods. The participants receive the three test foods in random
      order, decided by draw of lots. Blood samples are drawn in duplicate (on two following days)
      before and after each dietary period.
