        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male and female migraine patients (age 18 to 65 years) with or without aura,
             diagnosed according to IHS criteria.

          -  Established migraine diagnosis for &gt;= 1 year.

          -  Age at migraine onset &lt;= 50 years.

          -  Well documented (for &gt;= 3 months) retrospective history of migraine with headache of
             moderate to severe intensity and with an attack duration of at least 6 hours and
             migraine frequency of 2-8 times / month

          -  Other forms of headache are permitted if they on average occur on not more than 10
             days / month and if the patient is able to differentiate migraine headache from other
             forms of headache.

          -  Patient has provided written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and local
             legislation.

          -  Patient is in general good health based om screening assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child-bearing potential without an adequate method of contraception

          -  Any woman of child-bearing potential not having a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline

          -  Breastfeeding women

          -  Males not willing to use adequate contraception (condom use plus another form of
             contraception e.g. spermicide, oral contraceptive taken by female partner,
             sterilization, IUD [intrauterine device]) during the whole study period from the time
             of the first intake of study drug until three months after the last intake.

          -  History of hemiplegic, ophthalmoplegic, or basilar migraine or cluster headache.

          -  History of treatment resistant migraine attacks, defined as a lack of response to a
             range of commonly used acute anti-migraine compounds.

          -  History of , clinical evidence for, or screening/baseline findings suggestive of
             significant medical disorders (e.g. cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, hepatic,
             respiratory, haematological, renal, gastrointestinal, immunological, metabolic,
             hormonal, neurological or psychiatric disorders)
