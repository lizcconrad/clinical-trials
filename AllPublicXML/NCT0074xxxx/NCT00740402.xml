  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the process of acquiring a motor skill subject in
      post-stroke, comparing them with healthy subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 post-stroke patients were comprised to the experimental group (EG) and 20 health subjects
      were included to the control group (CG. Inclusion criteria: chronic stroke, single stroke
      event, lesion in anterior circulation, right handed subjects, MEEM over 23 points. The task
      consisted in a maze paradigm, made by pencil and paper, with the non affected side for EG and
      left upper extremity for CG. The instruction was given to the subjects to complete the task
      as fast as possible. The study consisted in three phases: acquisition (AQ)with 30 trials,
      transfer (TR, short retention (R1)and long term retention (R2 both with 5 trials.
