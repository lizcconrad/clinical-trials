  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label dose escalation study of GC33 in patients with advanced or
      metastatic HCC. This study is designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      and preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity. Enrollment will proceed until a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and a recommended Phase II dose has been established.
