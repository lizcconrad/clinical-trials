      This project compares gold standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (based on LEARN, Diabetes
      Prevention Program, LOOK Ahead) used in both research and clinical settings, with
      acceptance-based behavioral therapy for weight loss. Standard behavior treatment (SBT)
      focuses on modifying eating, thinking, and activity levels. Participants limit their daily
      caloric intake, keep food records, increase physical activity, and practice weight control
      behaviors, such as stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, alternative coping skills, and
      distinguishing hunger from cravings. The acceptance-based approach (ABT) incorporates the
      behavioral and nutritional components, but replaced the cognitive and motivational components
      with components that are consistent with an acceptance-based approach, such as acceptance and
      willingness to experience cravings, cognitive defusion, mindfulness training to interrupt
      automatic eating, and values work. These components are drawn from Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, &amp; Wilson, 1999), a cognitive-behavioral therapy that has been
      gaining increasing attention and empirical support (Bach &amp; Hayes, 2002; Bond &amp; Bunce, 2000;
      Hayes et al. 2004). Though relatively new, acceptance-based strategies have demonstrated
      effectiveness in helping individuals to respond to unwanted thoughts and feelings (Hayes,
      Rissett, Korn, Zettle, Rosenfarb, Cooper, &amp; Grundt, 1999, Keogh, Bond, Hanmer, &amp; Tilston,
      2005) and offer a novel alternative to control-based strategies (such as distraction and
      confrontation).

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either the traditional behavioral
      therapy condition (SBT) or the acceptance-based behavioral therapy condition (ABT). Both
      conditions are delivered in group format. A total of 30, 75 minute sessions will take place
      over the course of 40 weeks.

      Specific Aims

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the treatment, and its short and
           moderate-term effectiveness relative to the current gold standard behavioral treatment
           (SBT).

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of ABT with novice clinicians and with weight control
           experts.

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of ABT would be moderated by mood disturbance, emotional
           eating, disinhibition or susceptibility to food stimuli.
