  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to demonstrate that the target population can receive a packed FORESEE
      HOME unpack it, install and operate it to an extent that the FORESEE HOME can monitor them
      for changes in the visual field with good specificity. And evaluate the device usage on a
      small scale, at the subjects' homes before a commercial use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerical output of the FORESEE HOME, output of the usability parameters provided by the
      FORESEE HOME device, counts of the number of subjects who successfully set up the device and
      conduct testing sessions.
