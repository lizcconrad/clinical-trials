  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite remarkable gains in treatment over the last decade short-term mortality for those who
      survive to hospital with AT-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains high
      (5%-10%). Different studies have pointed out that reperfusion (intravenous fibrinolysis or
      percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and its timing are critical in decreasing STEMI
      patients' mortality. Studies of prehospital 12 lead electrocardiograms (12 lead PHECG) with
      advance emergency department (ED) notification suggest that there is a time to treatment
      advantage with this intervention. The use of 12 lead PHECG is not currently universal and
      part of standard treatment throughout the province. The purpose of the study is to follow
      STEMI study subjects during standard treatments and to compare the outcomes of subjects that
      received 12 lead PHECG with advanced ED notification in mixed rural/urban areas with outcomes
      of subjects treated in areas with only 3 lead PHECG monitoring and indirect ED notification.
      The investigators hypothesize that there will be a survival benefit for study subjects with
      12 lead PHECG and advance ED notification in rural and urban environments through a reduction
      in door-to-reperfusion time and that 12 lead PHECG will be a cost-saving technology for the
      province of Ontario.

      Many studies have established that reperfusion reduces mortality in ST-elevation acute
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients; the earlier reperfusion therapy is delivered, the
      greater the mortality reduction. Most STEMI patient in Ontario still do not receive
      reperfusion therapy within established target times of &lt;30 minutes for fibrinolysis or &lt;90
      minutes for PCI. 12 lead PHECG with advance ED notification may have a time to treatment
      impact in STEMI patients. However studies, investigating this intervention were all small,
      largely urban trials, and were carried out with advanced care paramedics. In Ontario, many
      emergency medical services (EMS) systems cover large rural regions, and are frequently
      staffed by primary care paramedics with only basic life support training. Thus, the benefit
      of 12 lead PHECG in these settings is unclear. In addition, no study has assessed the
      cost-effectiveness of 12 lead PHECG compared to 3 lead PHECG.

        This study will be conducted across Ontario. Selected regions representing approximately
        17% of the population of Ontario and 6.4% of the popluation of Canada. Covering an area of
        181426 per square kilometers with variable population densities from 2.5 to 234 person per
        square kilometers and representing rural, suburban, urban, and metropolis areas will be the
        catchment area for the study. A variety of EMS operators under the control of EMS Base
        Hospital programs will be involved in the data collection for this study. Patients
        presenting with suspected ischemic chest pain will be tracked as a part of the trial.
