      Test whether Basic Life Support (BLS) providers can successfully place Enzymatically
      Augmented Subcutaneous Infusion (EASI) Access lines for subcutaneous infusion, and
      characterize intravascular absorption of EASI-administered (tracer-labelled) glucose (D5W).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be at least 18 years of age and have none of the following conditions:

               -  pregnancy (negative urine pregnancy test to be performed before study
                  participation),

               -  diabetes, or coagulopathic (including taking any anticoagulants);

          -  Subjects cannot be taking steroids or other immunosuppressants.

          -  Because of the potential for reduced hyaluronidase effectiveness, the study excludes
             patients taking more than 80 mg daily aspirin, as well as any patients taking ACTH,
             antihistamines, or estrogen other than in oral contraceptive preparations.

          -  Subjects will not be required to fast before the study, but will not allowed to eat or
             drink during the EASI infusion or the phlebotomy sampling time frame.

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 20 subjects were consented. The study day ran long, so 2 subjects who had consented (and had an initial intravenous {IV} access placed, but no EASI access placed) declined to have any of the study procedures performed since the 2-hour phlebotomy window would have kept them at the study site until the evening.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Number of subjects (out of a possible 18) in whom EASI-administered tracer-labeled glucose was absorbed systemically.Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on timed phlebotomy samples, to assess for tracer-labeled glucose.Isotopic glucose enrichment was determined by plasma analysis on a Hewlett-Packard 5985B quadruple mass spectrometer, using + chemical ionization (methane reagent gas).

          <description>Number of subjects (out of a possible 18) in whom EASI-administered tracer-labeled glucose was absorbed systemically.Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on timed phlebotomy samples, to assess for tracer-labeled glucose.Isotopic glucose enrichment was determined by plasma analysis on a Hewlett-Packard 5985B quadruple mass spectrometer, using + chemical ionization (methane reagent gas). A 12m×0.20mm ID, OV-1 capillary column (He carrier) was used in the gas chromatograph.Enrichments of glucose were calculated as atom percent excess relative to natural background level.</description>
