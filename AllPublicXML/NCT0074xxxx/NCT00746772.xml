  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease whose prevalence in the general
      population is 0.5 -2.2%.Oral lesions in OLP are chronic, rarely undergo spontaneous
      remission. Patients with OLP had significantly increased risk of oral squamous cell
      carcinoma, irrespective of the clinical type of OLP and therapy. there is currently no cure
      for OLP. Previous study demonstrated a decreased antioxidant defence and increased oxidative
      damage to lipids.DNA and proteins in lichen planus. This oxidative modifications point to
      pathophysiological alterations mainly within the basal cell layers of epidermis and at the
      dermoepidermal junction. Purslane is an excellent source of vitamin A,C and E and essential
      amino acids, has been described as a power food of the future because of its high nutritive
      and antioxidant properties. The purpose of the study was to determined the efficacy of
      Purslane in the treatment of oral lichen planus.

      Oral lichen planus is a chronic common inflammatory disorder affecting stratified squamous
      epithelia. The majority problem of OLP is development of oral squamous cell carcinoma ,
      irrespective of the clinical type of OLP and therapy. Previous study demonstrated a decreased
      antioxidant defence and increased oxidative damage to lipids, DNA and proteins in lichen
      planus .This oxidative modifications point to pathophysiological alterations mainly within
      the basal cell layers of epidermis and at the dermoepidermal junction. So oxidative stress
      could be effective in pathogenesis of OLP. Purslane is an excellent source of vitamin A,C and
      E and essential amino acids, has been described as a power food of the future because of its
      high nutritive and antioxidant properties. Purslane also decreased the level of TNF-Î± and
      IL6, that are responsible for up-regulated adhesion molecules (in OLP lymphocyte T (T cell)
      recruited and retained in sub mucosa through receptors to endothelial adhesion molecule. and
      basal keratinocytes undergo apoptosis). The purpose of the study was to determined the
      efficacy of Purslane in the treatment of oral lichen planus.

    <description>Patients had been clinically with OLP and confirmed by histopathological findings were selected for the study. Gender, age, medical history, symptoms, types, size, and site of the lesions , duration of disease and other treatment used for this disease were recorded. Local ethical committee approval was obtained before the trial started and all patients gave written informed consent. Patients were randomly divided into two groups .First group received systemic Purslane CAP with concentration antioxidant 235 mg/day in 1 dosage and second group used placebo CAP for 3 month. Each patients was examined at the beginning of the therapy ,and then 2 weeks after therapy and every 1 month up to 6 months</description>
