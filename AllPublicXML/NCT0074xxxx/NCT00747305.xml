      RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sunitinib before
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed. Giving it after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well sunitinib works when given before and after
      surgery in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To describe the gene expression of VEGF and non-VEGF angiogenic growth factor genes in
           kidney cancer specimens from patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with
           sunitinib malate.

        -  To describe the association between quantitative gene expression levels of VEGF and
           non-VEGF angiogenic factors and clinical efficacy of this drug, as measured by response,
           duration of response, and time to progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 8 weeks. Within 2 weeks after
      completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo a nephrectomy and evaluation for
      response to therapy. Beginning 4-8 weeks after surgery patients resume oral sunitinib malate
      once daily for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients with disease progression after 8 weeks of adjuvant treatment receive treatment off
      study with other agents.

      Viable (non-necrotic) tumor and non-tumor kidney tissue samples are obtained at the time of
      nephrectomy for correlative biomarker studies. Tissue samples are analyzed for gene
      expression of VEGF and non-VEGF angiogenic factors by real-time RT-PCR, western blot, and/or
      IHC. Blood samples are obtained at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks for evaluation of
      circulating levels of VEGF and selected chemokines.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed monthly.
