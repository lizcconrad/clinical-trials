      This registry is a multi-center, prospective, longitudinal, observational program that will
      gather and analyse data on participants treated with infliximab, golimumab, golimumab
      Intravenous (I.V) or ustekinumab. Treatment will be prescribed by the physician according to
      actual clinical practice or standard of care for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Axial
      Spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) , Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA); there will be no randomized
      assignments to treatment. At baseline and approximately every 6 months thereafter,
      information will be collected to assess safety, clinical outcomes, quality of life,
      comorbidities, pharmacoeconomics and treatment regimens among cohorts of participants
      receiving infliximab, golimumab, golimumab I.V or ustekinumab for the treatment of RA, AxSpA
      and PsA.
