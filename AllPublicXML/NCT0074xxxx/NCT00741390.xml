  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The procurement of blood for SMBG, usually via a finger stick, is considered by many patients
      to be the most painful portion of diabetes therapy. This has led to the marketing of smaller
      gauge lancets, lancing devices with variable depth settings and blood glucose sensors that
      require less blood for measurement.

      In this study, two main outcomes were evaluated: The first, which was assessed at Visit 1,
      was whether specific combinations of lancets and lancing devices would yield sufficient blood
      volume to allow valid assessment of diabetic subjects' glucose levels. The other outcome,
      assessed at Visit 2, was the level of pain perceived by subjects during lancing with specific
      combinations of lancets and lancing devices. During Visit 2, pain assessment was done using a
      Visual Analog Scale and such that for each lancet/lancing device, the lowest lancing device
      setting that yielded a valid BG reading for each subject during Visit 1 was used. A third
      outcome measure, overall comfort with lancing, was also assessed at Visit 2.

      A total of 5 combinations of lancets and lancing devices were evaluated.

      These were as follows:

        -  BD/33G = BD Lancet device/BD 33G lancets (BGM measured with the OneTouch® UltraMini™
           (BGM) and OneTouch® Ultra® test strips)

        -  OTM/33G =OneTouch® Mini Lancet device / BD 33G lancet (BGM measured with the OneTouch®
           UltraMini™ (BGM) and OneTouch® Ultra® test strips)

        -  OTM/28G =OneTouch® Mini Lancet device / OneTouch® UltraSoft® 28G Lancet (BGM measured
           with the OneTouch® UltraMini™ (BGM) and OneTouch® Ultra® test strips)

        -  OTU/28G = OneTouch® UltraSoft® Lancet device/OneTouch® UltraSoft® 28G Lancet (BGM
           measured with the OneTouch® UltraMini™ (BGM) and OneTouch® Ultra® test strips)

        -  ACC/28G= Accu-Chek® Softclix Lancet device/Accu-Chek® Softclix 28G Lancet (BGM measured
           with Accu-Chek® Advantage BGM and Accu-Chek® Comfort Curve test strip)

      After enrollment and qualification, subjects were assigned to one of 4 intervention arms. The
      arm assignment determined which 3 of the 5 combinations of lancets and lancing devices the
      subjects would evaluate in Visit 1 (for volume adequacy) and of these 3, which 2 they would
      evaluate in Visit 2 (pain during lancing). The lancet/lancing device combinations assigned to
      each arm are shown in the Assigned Interventions Table below.

    <description>Number of subjects in whom valid meter reading was obtained with each device configuration. The primary outcome of a successful lancing is defined as whether or not a technician is able to use the lancing system to yield a blood sample of sufficient volume to yield a valid meter reading.</description>

    <measure>Difference in Lancing Pain for Device Pair at Visit 2. (For Subjects Assigned to Arms A, B, C Only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately Day 3 (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>In Visit 2 subjects kept the same group assignment they had in Visit 1. Each subject tested 2 of the 3 systems from Visit 1. Up to 6 pairs of lancings were performed in order to obtain 4 evaluable pairs. After each pair of lancing, the subject was asked to record the pain from the 2nd lancing as compared to the first using a 150mm visual analog scale(0mm = same pain, -75mm = max score for less painful than first lancing,+75mm = max score for more painful). A positive value on the scale (and in table below) indicates that the first device in the pair was more painful than the second.</description>

    <measure>Difference in Lancing Pain for Devices in Visit 2 Only. (For Subjects Assigned to Arm D Only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately Day 3 (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects who participated in Study Visit 2 kept the same group assignment they had in Study Visit 1. Each subject tested 2 of the 3 systems they experienced during Visit 1. Up to 6 pairs of lancings were performed in order to obtain 4 evaluable pairs.
After each pair of lancing, the subject was asked to record the difference in the pain they perceive between two lancing systems using the 150 mm visual analog scale. A positive value on the scale (and in the table below) indicates that the first device in the pair was more painful than the second.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reported Device Preference Within Lancing Pair at Visit 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately Day 3 (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>After each pair of 4 lancings, the subject was asked: &quot;Which of the two devices did you find more comfortable, overall?&quot; The choices were: first lancing, second lancing or equivalent. The &quot;Stated Preference&quot; row indicates # of lancing pairs in which one device was preferred over the other device while the 2 rows below indicate the # of pairs in which each device was preferred. First and second device refers to the 1st and 2nd devices identified in column headers, not the device order during testing. The &quot;No Preference&quot; row includes lancing pairs with preference of &quot;equivalent&quot; or no answer.</description>

        <description>Number of subjects in whom valid meter reading was obtained with each device configuration. The primary outcome of a successful lancing is defined as whether or not a technician is able to use the lancing system to yield a blood sample of sufficient volume to yield a valid meter reading.</description>
        <time_frame>Study Day 1 (Visit 1)</time_frame>
        <population>BD/BD33g and Mini/BD33g were included in 4 arms,the Mini/OT28g in 2 arms,and Ultra/OT28g and AC/AC28g in 1 arm. Thus the # of subj evaluated for each device was 246, 246, 124, 63, and 60, resp. Subj were analyzed for blood volume adequacy if they completed the depth setting/volume testing for at least 1 device w/o significant protocol deviation.</population>

In Study Visit 1 each subject was randomly assigned to one of four groups, each subject evaluated three different lancet device/lancet combinations. The order of evaluation of the three systems was randomly assigned for each subject. Subjects started at the middle depth setting of each lancet device. The lowest depth setting for each system yielding sufficient volume for each system was recorded for that subject and used during Visit 2. All subjects whom obtained adequate sample volumes were selected to participate in Study Visit 2.</description>

        <title>Difference in Lancing Pain for Device Pair at Visit 2. (For Subjects Assigned to Arms A, B, C Only)</title>
        <description>In Visit 2 subjects kept the same group assignment they had in Visit 1. Each subject tested 2 of the 3 systems from Visit 1. Up to 6 pairs of lancings were performed in order to obtain 4 evaluable pairs. After each pair of lancing, the subject was asked to record the pain from the 2nd lancing as compared to the first using a 150mm visual analog scale(0mm = same pain, -75mm = max score for less painful than first lancing,+75mm = max score for more painful). A positive value on the scale (and in table below) indicates that the first device in the pair was more painful than the second.</description>
        <time_frame>Approximately Day 3 (Visit 2)</time_frame>
        <population>Of the 234 subjects that completed Visit 2, 229 had evaluable pairs and were included in the analysis for Visit 2. Some of the lancing pairs from several subjects were excluded due to protocol deviations, subject discontinuation or adverse events. Of these 175 subjects were analyzed for this primary outcome.</population>
