  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and general safety in the human
      airway as well as assess the safety and depth and area of treatment using liquid nitrogen
      sprayed through a catheter via flexible fiber optic bronchoscopy (FFB) using surgical
      resection specimens from patients undergoing lobectomy.

      The primary endpoints for this study are patient safety and the histological effects of
      cryospray therapy in lobectomy patients.

      The proposed study is a single center study to evaluate the safety and treatment effect of
      sprayed liquid nitrogen through a catheter via FFB using surgical resection specimens from
      patients undergoing lobectomy.

    <description>CSA Medical, Inc. (formerly CryMed Technologies, Inc.) received FDA market clearance for the CSA System (CryoSpray AblationTM System, formally Cryo Ablator System) on April 21, 2006. It is a Class II device &quot;intended to be used as a cryosurgical tool for the destruction of unwanted tissue in the field of general surgery, specifically for endoscopic applications&quot; (K070893). As defined by the FDA, the CSA System is a cryosurgical unit with a liquid nitrogen cooled cryocatheter and accessories used to destroy tissue during surgical procedures by applying extreme cold</description>
