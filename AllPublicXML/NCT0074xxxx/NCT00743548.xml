  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's purpose is to find an easy and effective alternative to dental floss for those
      persons who cannot or choose not to dental floss so that they can maintain and/or achieve
      optimal oral health. The study hypothesis is that the inter-dental brush is as effective as
      dental floss for removing plaque from between the teeth and for reducing bleeding gums in
      persons with gingivitis, but may be easier to use and thus encourage daily home use.

      Purpose:

      To determine if the interdental brush is just as effective at removing plaque and reducing
      bleeding gums between the teeth as dental floss.

      Rationale:

      Many people find dental floss difficult to use and thus, do not floss daily to maintain oral
      health and prevent gum disease. These individuals may find the interdental brush easier to
      use and may be motivated to use it daily for optimal oral health.

      Study design:

      Study subjects will use the dental floss AND the interdental brush for 12 weeks. Plaque and
      bleeding scores will be measured before the study begins (week 0), mid-way (week 6), and at
      the end of the 12 weeks. All study subjects receive a teeth cleaning prior to the first
      measurements and oral hygiene instructions on how to floss and use the interdental brush.
      Subjects will also answer 4 short questions about their product preference and ease of use.

      Study subjects:

      32 healthy adult volunteers with bleeding gums. To be included in the study, subjects require
      8 bleeding sites, 4 areas that can accommodate the interdental brush, dexterity to dental
      floss, and willingness to come for 4 study visits. Exclusion criteria include smokers because
      this can affect the bleeding scores; individuals with braces (orthodontia) which affects
      plaque levels; individuals using chlorhexidine which is a prescription strength mouthwash
      used to treat moderate to severe gum disease; pregnant women; and those individuals requiring
      antibiotics prior to dental appointments. Enrolled study subjects receive a teeth cleaning
      (value $180), $75 for completing the study, and all study related supplies.
