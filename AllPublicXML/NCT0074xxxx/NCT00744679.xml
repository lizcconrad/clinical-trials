    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of natalizumab (Tysabri)
      at steady state.

      The secondary objective is to assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) profile (α4 integrin
      saturation) of Tysabri at steady state.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide signed and dated
             informed consent and authorization to use protected health information (PHI) in
             accordance with national and local subject privacy regulations.

          -  Must be a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach: United
             Commitment to Health Prescribing Program (TOUCH) who is not expected to discontinue
             Tysabri therapy prior to completion of the requirements of this study.

          -  Must have been treated with monthly IV infusions of Tysabri 300 mg for at least 12
             months, with the 9 most recent doses having been administered at 28±7 day intervals.

          -  Must test negative for antibodies to Tysabri at the Screening Visit.

          -  Must have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan, performed prior to the
             initiation of treatment with Tysabri, on file.

          -  Must weigh between 42 and 126 kg, inclusive.

          -  All male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential must practice
             effective contraception during the study.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or abnormal laboratory results indicative of, any clinically significant
             cardiac, endocrinologic, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, psychiatric, and renal, or other major
             disease, as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Positive result for antibodies to Tysabri at any prior evaluation.

          -  Treatment with an investigational product or approved therapy for investigational use
             within 6 months prior to the start of PK sample collection or during the course of
             this study. Concurrent participation in an observational study (e.g., Tysabri Global
             Observational Program in Safety [TYGRIS]) is permitted.

          -  Pre-scheduled for any elective procedure or medical treatment during the study period.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse (as defined by the Investigator) within 2 years prior
             to the Screening Visit.

          -  Female subjects who are breastfeeding, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant while
             on study.

          -  Alcohol use within 24 hours prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with study requirements, including the presence
             of any condition (e.g., physical, mental, social) that is likely to affect the
             subject's ability to comply with the study protocol.

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Biogen Idec,
             make the subject unsuitable for enrollment.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
