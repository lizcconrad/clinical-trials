      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Raltegravir and Epzicom over 48 weeks in ART-naive
      HIV-infected subjects.

  <detailed_description>

      -  This is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, pilot study to evaluate the efficacy,
           safety, and tolerability of RTG BID and ABC/3TC QD. A total of 30 subjects will be
           enrolled at 3 U.S. sites.

        -  The study includes a 30-day screening period, a treatment period (baseline through week
           48), and a follow-up visit, 2 to 4 weeks after the last study visit, as needed to
           resolve any ongoing AEs or to confirm virologic status.

      Virologic failure (VF) is defined as having either virologic non-response or virologic
      rebound. Virologic failure is confirmed by having 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels taken
      at least 2 weeks apart according to the following definitions:

        -  virologic rebound is defined as HIV-1 RNA level ≥400 copies/mL after initial response of
           HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 copies/mL or &gt;1 log10 copies/mL increase above nadir;

        -  virologic non-response is defined as HIV-1 RNA &gt;400 copies/mL at week 24.

        -  Subjects will be discontinued from the study if virologic failure is confirmed. When a
           subject is suspected to have virologic failure, a confirmatory HIV-1 RNA must be
           performed at an unscheduled visit between 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the initial
           assessment, and a plasma sample collected for resistance testing.

        -  Subjects who experience symptoms consistent with a clinically suspected ABC HSR must
           permanently discontinue ABC/3TC, and will be allowed to substitute study-provided
           fixed-dose combination ZDV/3TC 150/300 mg (COMBIVIR®) BID for ABC/3TC and remain in the
           study.

          -  Negative for HLA-B*5701 allele

          -  Screening HIV-1 RNA &gt;1,000 copies/mL

          -  Screening laboratory values:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL

               -  Platelet count &gt;50,000/mm3

               -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and alkaline phosphatase &lt;5 x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;2.5 x ULN

               -  For men, (140 - age in years) x (body weight in kg) ÷ (serum creatinine in mg/dL
                  x 72) = CrCl (mL/min)*

               -  For women, multiply the result by 0.85 = CrCl (mL/min)
