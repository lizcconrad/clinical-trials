      1. To evaluate the effect of S-2367 on body weight when administered following a 6-week
           placebo lead-in period and then a 54-week 800 kilocalorie deficit reduced calorie diet
           compared to placebo in healthy obese male and female subjects

        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-2367 during 54 weeks of drug exposure

        3. To evaluate the steady-state/trough pharmacokinetics of S-2367
