      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of home-delivered Medical Nutrition Therapy
      on clinical outcomes for persons with diabetes. The primary outcomes of this studies include
      A1c (A1C), blood glucose, blood pressure, Body Mass Index, lipid levels and other measures of
      disease progression and management as well as costs of medical care provided throughout the
      intervention period.

      Data collected as a result of this project will be evaluated in aggregate to demonstrate the
      potential impacts on health and medical costs available through this type of intervention,
      with long-term goals of reducing disability and deaths due to chronic disease.
