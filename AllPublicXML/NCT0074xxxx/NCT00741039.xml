  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infections due to influenza and pneumococcus can be very serious and cause death. Anyone can
      get these infections. However, some people are at greater risk from the disease, including
      people 65 and older, the very young, and people with special health problems such as people
      with certain types of cancer, heart, lung, or kidney disease, or diabetes. Influenza can
      cause a very serious lung infection (pneumonia) and increase the risk of stroke and heart
      attacks. Pneumococcal disease can lead to serious infections in the lungs (pneumonia), the
      blood (bacteremia), and the covering of the brain (meningitis). People with the special
      health problems mentioned above are even more likely to die from the disease. Although there
      are drugs to treat these infections, they are not always effective. This makes prevention of
      the disease through vaccination even more important.

      This study will look at the body's response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. We
      want to see how well they it will protect. Immunization is the same as vaccination. Our goal
      is to protect as much as we can. We are doing the study because more information is needed to
      see how well older patients with cancer respond to these vaccines and how well they protect
      against disease caused by influenza and pneumococcus.
