  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Often, incurable cancer patients suffer from severe symptoms as (neuropathic) pain
      and fatigue with polypharmaceutic interventions as a consequence. Regarding neuropathic pain
      in incurable cancer patients, pregabalin has been registered for neuropathic non-cancer pain,
      and amitriptyline is not registered for neuropathic pain, but is recommended as the drug of
      first choice in the Dutch handbooks of palliative care. As a consequence of an adaptation of
      a Dutch law (July 2007) about off-label medication prescription, off-label medication is not
      allowed anymore unless a standard or protocol exists. No clinical trials for this patient
      group have been published before.

      Objective: To compare efficacy, side effects and costs of a strategy with amitriptyline as
      drug of first choice versus a strategy with pregabalin as drug of first choice.

      Study design: An open label, randomised non-inferiority trial Study population: Incurable
      cancer patients with neuropathic pain Intervention: When a patient decides to take part in
      the study, he will be allocated randomly to one of the two study groups. A minimisation
      algorithm will be used, that balances for the cause of neuropathic pain (tumour related
      versus treatment related), type of treatment (ongoing chemo- or radiotherapy versus not
      ongoing chemo- or radiotherapy) and institution. Each drug will be prescribed in a step up
      procedure. Patients will be followed during 8 weeks.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Neuropathic pain, as measured with the mean VAS and McGill
      questionnaire, strategy success, costs per strategy, side effects, quality of life and
      concomitant analgesic drugs.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: There are hardly any risks for the patients. The drugs in both arms already are
      usual care for the target population. If there is no or a too small effect, the drug of the
      other arm will be added, which strategy also is already usual care. All other medication,
      except for Tricyclic Antidepressants Drugs (TADs) and Anti Epileptic Drugs (AEDs), as well as
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy are allowed. The patient has to visit the hospital 2 times
      during the study period. The patient had to fill in a pain diary daily (5 min), cost diary
      and EQ-5D every other week (10 min), related questionnaires as HADS, McGill and EORTC-QLQ-C30
      monthly (20 min).
