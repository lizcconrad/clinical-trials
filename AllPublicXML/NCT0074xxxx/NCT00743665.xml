      The primary aim of this study is to characterize the quality of life of youth with Cyclic
      Vomiting Syndrome (CVS) as well as the strategies they use to cope with stress, their
      strengths and vulnerabilities, and to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety in these at
      risk youth. The impact of CVS on the child's parent and family will also be assessed.

      A second aim is to evaluate the associations among coping strategies, personal strengths and
      vulnerabilities and the frequency and intensity of CVS attacks to determine if particular
      coping styles and personal characteristics are associated illness severity, psychiatric
      co-morbidity and quality of life
