    <textblock>
      Objective: To determine the effects of resveratrol extract given in a 215 mg dose in a daily
      supplement currently available over the counter, on cognitive and global functioning in
      patients with mild to moderate AD on standard therapy.

      Background: Many animal and in vitro studies have shown that resveratrol, a naturally
      occurring polyphenol found in red wine, can increase cognition, reduce neural degeneration,
      promote clearance of amyloid-beta peptides, and alter aging mechanisms. Therefore,
      resveratrol may reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and possibly its pathology.
      Objective: A pilot study to determine the effects of resveratrol on cognitive, behavioral and
      global functioning in patients with mild-to-moderate AD on standard therapy. Design:
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants: 50 patients with
      mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) defined as a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) between
      10-27 will be enrolled in the study. Patients must have an established diagnosis of AD by
      NINCDS diagnostic criteria, be on stable dose of cognitive enhancing medications
      (cholinesterase inhibitor and/or NMDA receptor antagonist) Screening/Enrollment:
      Institutional Review Board approval will be obtained. The chart review and the enrollment
      discussion will be carried out by a non-physician member of the research team. Participants
      will be screened and randomized until a total of 50 eligible patients, 25 in each arm are
      obtained.

             disease, with stable dosing for at least the last 2 months (and with no intent to
             change for the duration of the study).

             for &lt;2 years must undertake pregnancy testing (urine test) at Visit 1, which must be

         12. Subject has provided full written informed consent prior to the performance of any

        apply:

          1. Diagnosis of possible, probably, or definite vascular dementia in accordance with
             NINDS-AIREN criteria (Appendix 4).

          2. History or evidence of any other CNS disorder that could be interpreted as a cause of
             dementia; e.g. cerebrovascular disease (stroke, hemorrhage), structural abnormality,
             epilepsy, infectious or inflammatory/demyelinating CNS conditions, Parkinson's
             disease.

          3. Evidence of the following disorders: current vitamin B12 deficiency, positive syphilis
             serology, or active thyroid dysfunction (particularly that suggestive of
             hypothyroidism), including abnormally high or low serum levels of thyroid stimulating
             hormone (TSH) that is clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.

          4. History of Type 1 diabetes mellitus or secondary diabetes mellitus.

          5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus where the subject is being treated with insulin, a PPARγ
             agonist, or an insulin secretagogue (e.g. a sulfonylurea or glitinide).

          6. Any patient with an HbA1c≥8.5%. (See Section 6.3.8.4 for Safety Measures for Enrolled
