      The purpose of this study is to compare the quality of life in patients with unresectable
      hilar cholangiocarcinoma on palliative metallic stent versus plastic Stent.

    <textblock>
      In the patient with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma,palliative biliary stent is the one
      way to help him.

      The aim of palliative treatment is to improve quality of life and relief symptom,or sometime
      ,extended survival rate.

      There are two types of biliary stent:

        1. plastic stent made from polyethylene or polytetrafluoroethylene

        2. metalic stent braided in the form of a tubular mesh from surgical-grade stainless steel
           alloy and designed to expand to a maximum diameter of 10mm.

      The main drawback of plastic stent is relatively high occlusion rate, but its advantage is
      the lower cost.

      In the reasons of higher occlusion rate , the lower cost of plastic stent versus metallic
      stent that should be stent exchange when occluded, so we would to know about quality of life
      in both group.
