      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if combining a curcumin preparation with
      standard radiation therapy and chemotherapy (capecitabine) can help to shrink or slow the
      growth of rectal cancer. The safety of this combination and whether curcumin can help to
      decrease some of the side effects of standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy will also be
      studied.

      The Study Therapy:

      Radiation therapy and capecitabine are commonly used treatments for rectal cancer.

      Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice, turmeric, which is commonly used in Indian
      cooking. Researchers hope the curcumin will interfere with the coping mechanism that cancer
      cells use to avoid being killed by radiation, thus allowing the radiation to have a greater
      likelihood of killing the cancer cells.

      Study Therapy Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive radiation
      therapy once a day, for 5 days in a row (Monday-Friday) for 5-6 weeks (up to 28 treatments in
      all). You will take capecitabine capsules by mouth twice a day, at morning and night, on each
      of the days that you receive radiation therapy. These capsules will not be taken on Saturday
      or Sunday. These capsules should be taken within 30 minutes after eating and with a full
      glass of water, but not with fruit juice.

      You will also be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice) to one of two groups.
      Participants in one group will receive additional treatment with a curcumin preparation.
      Participants in the other group will receive a placebo. The placebo is a substance that looks
      like curcumin but has no active ingredients. You have a 2 in 3 chance of getting curcumin.
      This means that for every 3 participants enrolled, 2 will get curcumin and 1 will get
      placebo. Neither you nor your doctor will know to which group you are assigned.

      You will take curcumin/placebo capsules by mouth twice a day, every day that you receive
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy, on an empty stomach. The first dose of the day should be
      taken about 1 hour before radiation therapy and the second dose should be taken later in the
      evening. These capsules must be taken on Saturday and Sunday as well. The placebo or curcumin
      treatment will continue after you complete chemotherapy and radiation therapy and for an
      additional 6 weeks.

      Study Visits:

      Every week while you are having chemotherapy and radiation treatments, you will have the
      following procedures performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for side effects from chemotherapy
           and radiation therapy.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you are experiencing.

        -  A plain X-ray film will be taken to check if you have been positioned correctly.

      Questionnaires:

      You will be asked to fill out 2 questionnaires about your symptoms at the time of enrollment,
      1 time a week while receiving radiation therapy, and just before surgery. The 2
      questionnaires should take a total of about 10 minutes to fill out.

      Length of Treatment:

      You will receive up to 11 1/2 weeks of curcumin or placebo on this study. You will be taken
      off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 6-12 weeks after completing radiation therapy, you will have a follow-up visit. At this
      visit, you will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests. You will be asked about any side effects you are experiencing. You will be evaluated
      by a surgeon at this time. If the tumor can be surgically removed, you will be offered
      surgery to remove the tumor, as is standard of care for the disease. In addition, no matter
      when you had surgery, at about 1 month (+/- 1 week) after finishing the study drug, you will
      receive a telephone call from the study staff. They will ask you about any side effects you
      are experiencing that may be related to the study drug.

      Your medical record will be reviewed from time to time to check your health status
      information.

      This is an investigational study. Capecitabine, radiation therapy and curcumin are all
      commercially available. Capecitabine is FDA approved for treating colon cancer after surgery,
      and for treating rectal cancer (a specific type of colon cancer) that has spread. Radiation
      therapy is a standard treatment for rectal cancers. The use of curcumin with capecitabine and
      radiation therapy in this study is investigational. At this time, the combination is being
      used in research only.

      Up to 45 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

    <description>Primary outcome for this trial is the pCR rate, which is evaluated at the time of surgery. pCR rate expected to be 18% in the control group.
Target pCR rate is 36% or more in the curcumin treatment group. For those participants randomized to curcumin, a two-stage design employed with a significance level of 10% and 80% power.
Curcumin considered for further development if there are 9 or more patients with pCR among these 30 patients.</description>
