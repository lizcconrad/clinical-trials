      The purpose of this study is to compare two exercise programs to determine how well they help
      older adults make exercise a regular habit after 9 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although only a small percentage of older adults engage in habitual physical activity,
      previous studies have demonstrated interventions that include cognitive-behavioral strategies
      can enhance long-term, independent physical activity. In addition, there are episodic charity
      events, such as charity walks, that attract large numbers of participants of all age ranges
      to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity. These actions are a form of prosocial
      behavior, defined as voluntary, intentional behavior that results in benefits for another.
      The opportunity to help others seems to be a motive in inspiring these individuals to at
      least engage in one session of moderate physical activity. Thus, the current research project
      contemplates whether prosocial behavior may be implemented as a viable behavioral incentive
      for long-term physical activity.

      Both the Prosocial Behavior Physical Activity (PBPA) group and the Physical Exercise (PE)
      group will receive a cognitive-behavioral intervention to teach participants the behavioral
      skills necessary to engage in long-term (9-month) independent physical activity. Both
      programs will provide supervised exercise sessions so that participants learn how to safely
      and effectively engage in physical activity, and both programs will help participants set
      goals for activity and overcome barriers to exercise. However, in PBPA group, participants
      will be able to also earn boxes of food for donation to a charity based upon their physical
      activity.
