  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From the relationship between pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD), dyspnea, and dynamic hyperinflation during ventilatory increasing, the investigators
      hypothesize that

        1. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing will reduce dyspnea more than normal
           breathing during exercise in mild to moderate COPD patients.

        2. PEP breathing will improve dynamic hyperinflation during exercise more than normal
           breathing in mild to moderate COPD patients.

        3. PEP breathing will improve cardiorespiratory function during exercise than normal
           breathing in mild to moderate COPD patients.

    <textblock>
      Expiratory airflow limitation is the pathophysiological hallmark of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) that leads to air trapping and increases in dynamic hyperinflation
      (DH) and consequently causes dyspnea during exercise. Although pursed lips breathing is a
      simple technique that provides a positive back pressure may retard the airway collapsed, but
      previous studies showed an unsuccessful reduction of DH which might cause by insufficient
      back pressure. And thereby a conical positive expiratory pressure (C-PEP) has been developed
      in our laboratory to generate back pressure higher than pursed lips breathing. Moreover, an
      effect of PEP on DH has not carried out in patient with COPD. Therefore, the objective of the
      present study was to examine effects of a C-PEP on DH and respiratory response during
      exercise in patient with COPD.

    <description>Conical positive expiratory pressure device (C-PEP) in this study was designed on the principle of expiratory flow retardation. The principle occurs when exhaling through a small tube diameter, i.e. a small straw, pursed lip breathing, or positive expiratory pressure. Expiratory retardation, results from a decrease in tube diameter, creates flow resistance during exhalation. With flow resistance, the greater the flow the greater the back pressure, and the less the flow the lower the pressure. Expiratory retardation was applied in an attempt to facilitate exhalation and to relieve the air trapping.
The optimal design was found to be: cone shape, proximal diameter is 2.0 cm, distal diameter is 0.6 cm, and length is 2.5 cm.
Subjects will rest for 10-15 minutes until HR, BP are stabilized. They will undertake 15 min of alternating quadriceps exercise (30% 1 RM) either breathing with the C-PEP device.</description>
