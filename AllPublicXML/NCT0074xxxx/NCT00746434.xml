    <textblock>
      The aim of this proof of concept study is to show the safety and efficacy of 0.5 % dermal
      roflumilast cream in the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults. This is a multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. 3-10 % of the body
      surface area (BSA) should be covered with a mild to moderate form of plaque psoriasis. In a
      4-week treatment period 76 mg cream is applied two times daily on up to 2% of the BSA. After
      a screening phase, a washout phase of flexible duration (max 30 days, time depending upon
      pre-medication), the 28 day treatment phase follows. As roflumilast is a potent
      anti-inflammatory substance, a positive effect on this form of dermal disease is anticipated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient (who is able to read, to write and to fully understand English language) has
             been informed both verbally and in writing about the objectives of the clinical study,
             the methods, the anticipated benefits and potential risks and the discomfort to which
             he/she may be exposed, and has given written consent to participation in the study
             prior to study start and any study-related procedure.

          -  Patient is suffering from mild to moderate plaque psoriasis

          -  Male or female patient of any ethnic origin, age 18 years or older presenting a
             minimum of 3% to a maximum of 10% BSA affected by mild to moderate plaque psoriasis
             proven by a dermatologist.

          -  Patient must have a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 in severity score of psoriasis

          -  Patient must have at least one target lesion of at least 1% BSA.

          -  Patient must be willing to wash out from current active therapy for at least 14 days
             prior to Day 1.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the Screening
             and Baseline Visits and agree to use a highly effective method of birth control. A
             highly effective method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has spontaneously improving or rapidly deteriorating plaque psoriasis within
             at least the past 3 month.

          -  Patients who have a known history of psoriasis unresponsive to topical treatments.

          -  Patient has a physical condition (e.g., atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, tinea
             corporis) which, in the Investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of plaque
             psoriasis or which exposes the patient to an unacceptable risk by trial participation.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values and vital signs suggesting an unknown
             underlying disease and requiring further clinical evaluation (as assessed by the
             Investigator).

          -  Patient is pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy during the trial period.

          -  Patient is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device trial.

          -  Patient has received an investigational drug or an investigational device within 30
             days prior to trial start.

          -  Patient has a history of allergic reactions to roflumilast or any inactive ingredients
             of the trial medication.

          -  Patient has positive results in any of the virology tests of acute or chronic
             infectious HIV and hepatitis virus infections.

          -  Abuse of alcohol or drugs
