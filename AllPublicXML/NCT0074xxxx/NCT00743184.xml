  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy of ozarelix compared to placebo in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms
      (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men as assessed by the
      International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Week 14.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

      Patients who meet the entry IPSS inclusion criteria at Week 0 will be randomized and enroll
      in the double-blind treatment period. Patients will be randomized to one of three treatment
      arms and will receive two 6-month courses of study drug administered on Days 0 and 14 of each
      6-month course. Treatment arms include: ozarelix 30mg + 15mg, ozarelix 15mg + 15mg or placebo
      + placebo. Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at defined intervals throughout
      the study. At Week 52 all patients on study will be eligible to receive ozarelix for two
      additional courses in the open-label treatment period.
