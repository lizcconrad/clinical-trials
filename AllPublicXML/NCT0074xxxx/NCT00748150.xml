      At enrolment, subjects were stratified into two age strata (18 to 60 years, over 60 years).
      Total duration of the study is three weeks. Vaccinations were to be administered on day 1.
      Blood samples were collected at day 1 (baseline, before the vaccination) and at day 22 (three
      weeks after the vaccination). Sera were tested by Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay.
      Safety was assessed until 3 weeks after the vaccination.
