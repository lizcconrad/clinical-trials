  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Superficial skin and soft tissue abscess are frequently managed by opening them up with a
      procedure called &quot;incision and drainage&quot;. It is routine practice in the United States to
      place packing material inside the abscess cavity after opening them up, in order to promote
      better wound healing and limit abscess recurrence. However, this practice has never been
      systematically studied or proven to decrease complications or improve healing. Patients with
      wound packing usually return to the emergency room or practice setting for multiple &quot;wound
      checks&quot; and dressing/packing changes which lead to missed days from work or school and
      utilization of healthcare resources. This procedure can often be painful and may even require
      conscious sedation (and the risks entailed) especially in children. With rates of superficial
      skin and soft tissue abscesses on the rise, and emergency room resources being stretched, it
      is important to determine whether packing wounds is necessary or even advantageous to
      patients.

      This study is the first to systematically evaluate the efficacy of wound packing after
      superficial skin or soft tissue abscess incision and drainage in children. The investigators
      will be evaluating wound healing, complications, recurrence and pain associated with packing
      both short and long term. In addition, the investigators will also be evaluating the utility
      of bedside point-of-care ultrasound use in predicting the presence of pus inside the abscess
      cavity. This test may be useful to determine whether incision and drainage is necessary for
      an individual who has a skin infection that is suspicious for an abscess.
