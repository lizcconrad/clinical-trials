  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the experiences and quality of life of women who have
      been treated for melanoma. By quality of life, we mean how they are feeling about different
      aspects of their life. In this study, we are especially interested in their feelings about
      survival, physical appearance and any family concerns. We will administer a series of QOL
      questionnaires, data sheets with many questions, to get their response to measure their
      feelings about these issues.
