      The study will be a prospective study of patients presenting with anogenital warts. The
      objective are to assess proportion of anogenital warts to the total number of sexual
      transmitted infection patients, to quantify direct and indirect cost of illnesses and
      psychological burden associated with anogenital warts and to estimate government program
      expenditure for the prevention and control and treatment of the STI/anogenital HPV infection.

      An observational study, multiple visit, 2-center study will be conducted in Rajavithi General
      Hospital, and Bangrak Hospital. One hundred and fifty subjects will be enrolled from both
      hospitals. Anogenital wart patients presented in Rajavithi General Hospital and the STI
      clinic at Bangrak Hospital will be recruited prospectively. All patients will be treated
      according to standard medical guidelines or usual care of the institutes. After the baseline
      assessment, the patients will have follow up visits with their physicians and will also be
      interviewed at the clinical sites three time approximately at day 7 (-2+7 days), month 1 (+-7
      days), and month 6 (+-7 days) until they are cure. At month 6 (+-14 days), telephone
      assessment for the capture of any signs of disease recurrence will be done. All patients will
      be followed for 6 months under the same schedule.
