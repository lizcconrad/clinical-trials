  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a neuroendocrine tumor registry. A registry is a
      collection of information. To create this registry, the investigators would like to get
      information, blood and tumor samples from people with neuroendocrine tumors. By collecting
      this information and material, the investigators are hoping to learn more about the genetic
      causes of neuroendocrine tumors. All of this will help us to better understand neuroendocrine
      cancer, so the investigators can find better ways to treat and diagnose this disease. DNA
      will be taken from the blood samples and will be used in future studies. This will be an
      important resource from which the investigators can study genes that may be related to a
      higher risk of neuroendocrine tumors.

      The information collected will include medical information, family history of cancer and your
      answers to questions about how the cancer affects quality of life.

    <description>All participants will complete an epidemiology study questionnaire as well as a quality of life questionnaire. They will also be asked to donate blood samples. We will request participation in a tissue repository consisting of fresh frozen or paraffin embedded tissue. The repository will be of serum, plasma and tumor tissue. Follow-up will occur on patients every 6 months for the first year after consent and then annually.</description>

      All participants will be invited to provide a DNA (blood sample) and tissue sample for the
      purposes of developing a tissue repository. Blood samples will be collected. Expected accrual
      is 150 patients per year. Patients who donate blood and/or tissue samples are considered
      evaluable for protocol; however, it is preferred that both are obtained.
