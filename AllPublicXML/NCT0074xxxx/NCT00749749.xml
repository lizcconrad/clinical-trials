      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the CollaRx Bupivacaine Implant is safe and
      effective in reducing the amount of narcotic pain medication needed to control pain during
      the first 96 hours after abdominal hysterectomy when compared to the ON-Q PainBuster Post-op
      Pain Relief System.

    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy is the second most common surgery among women in the United States (US).
      Abdominal hysterectomy surgery may be performed to treat benign tumors, such as fibroids,
      heavy periods, painful periods and chronic pelvic pain. The most common route for performing
      hysterectomy is through an incision in the abdominal wall; however, about 20% are performed
      vaginally.Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy is performed when warranted.

      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medication) that has an established safety profile.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cattle tendons and contains bupivacaine.
      When inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at
      the site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at
      the surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery.

      The ON Q system consists of 1 elastometric pump with a fill volume of 270 mL containing 0.25%
      bupivacaine; 1 soaker catheter measuring 12.5 cm in size; and a fill port, tubing, clamp,
      filter and flow restrictor. The pump provides positive pressure and is portable. It may be
      attached to the patient's dressing or placed in a carrying pouch. The catheter is inserted
      directly into the surgical wound providing a continuous flow of bupivacaine into the wound. A
      capillary flow restricting orifice located at the end of the tubing controls the flow rate.

      This study will compare the total narcotic use in patients with the CollaRx Bupivacaine
      Implant with the total narcotic use in patients with the ON Q PainBuster Post op Pain Relief
      System after abdominal hysterectomy.

               -  A nonlaparoscopic incision for benign nonhysterectomy gynecological procedures
                  (such as myomectomy or adnexal surgery) is acceptable if the surgical indication
                  is not to treat pelvic pain.

               -  No concomitant vaginal procedures such as anterior and posterior colporrhaphy
                  (A&amp;P repairs) are allowed. An abdominal urethropexy and an incidental
                  appendectomy will be allowed.

          -  Has a risk classification of I, II or III according to the American Society of
             Anesthesiologists (ASA).

          -  Is nonpregnant (negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 0 before surgery) and
             nonlactating.

          -  Is free of other physical or mental conditions that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may confound quantification of postoperative pain resulting from the
             abdominal hysterectomy.

          -  Has the ability to read, understand and comply with the study procedures and the use
             of the pain scales; is deemed capable of operating a patient controlled analgesia
             (PCA) device; and is able to communicate meaningfully with the study staff.

          -  Must voluntarily sign and date an informed consent form (ICF), approved by an
             Institutional Review Board (IRB), prior to the conduct of any study specific
             procedures.

          -  Must be able to fluently speak and understand English and be able to provide
             meaningful written informed consent for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             grapefruit juice).

          -  Has used long acting analgesics within 24 hours of surgery. Short acting analgesics
             such as acetaminophen may be used on the day of surgery but are subject to
             preoperative restrictions for oral intake.

          -  Has used aspirin or aspirin containing products within 7 days of surgery. Aspirin at a
             dose of ≤ 325 mg is allowed for cardiovascular prophylaxis if the patient has been on
             a stable dose regimen for ≥ 30 days prior to Screening.

          -  Has undergone major surgery within 3 months of the scheduled hysterectomy.

          -  Has used opioids or tramadol on an extended daily basis (&gt; 7 days) prior to surgery.
             Patients who, in the Investigator's opinion, are developing opioid tolerance are to be
             excluded.
