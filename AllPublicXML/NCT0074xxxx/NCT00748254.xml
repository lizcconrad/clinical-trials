  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine if a new emerging technology called
      photoacoustic tomography (PAT) can be adapted for use in humans for the detection of chronic
      rheumatoid arthritis.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The objective of this proposal is to adapt photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a novel,
      nonionizing, noninvasive, laser-based technology, for structural and functional imaging of
      human peripheral joints affected by inflammatory arthritis.

      Combining the advantages of both light and ultrasound scanning, PAT holds promise to present
      objective optical information in subsurface joint tissues with high sensitivity and high
      spatial resolution.

      This could be of considerable help in the early detection of inflammatory joint diseases. PAT
      may also prove useful in further understanding the pathophysiology of these disorders and
      assisting with therapeutic decisions, including assessment of new pharmacological therapies.

        Subjects are 1) people who are either healthy volunteers or have patients who have
        rheumatoid arthritis for more than 2 years and who have a rheumatologist who referred them
        to this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women 18 years of age through age 60 can participate in this study.

          -  Patients can participate in this study if they have had rheumatoid arthritis for more
             than 2 years and their rheumatologist has referred them to this study.

          -  Patients can participate as a healthy volunteer with a known history of rheumatoid
             arthritis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, who have electrically, magnetically or mechanically activated implants such
             as heart pacemaker, magnetic surgical clips, prostheses or implanted neurological
             stimulator.

          -  Pregnant patients.

          -  Patients who is claustrophobic.

          -  Patients with impaired renal function cannot participate in this study such as elevate
             creatinine clearance, patients on kidney dialysis etc.

          -  Patients with shock hypotension or unstable low blood pressure.

          -  Patients with Rhabdomyolysis.

          -  Patients who have had a contrast enhanced (with gadolinium) MRA (magnetic resonance
             angiography)/ or MRI within the last 3 months. (Contrast is a medication injected into
             a vein during a imaging examination that helps produce clearer images/pictures).
