    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of NaFeEDTA-fortified whole wheat flour in
      improving cognition, hemoglobin, iron status and total body iron among school children in
      urban Bangalore.

      Background: Iron (Fe) deficiency is a major cause of anemia in children. Fortification of
      wheat flour with NaFeEDTA, a highly bioavailable iron fortificant that protects Fe from the
      phytic acid present in wheat flour, could be a practical approach to addressing this problem.

      Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of NaFeEDTA-fortified whole wheat flour in improving mental
      performance and reducing iron deficiency and improving body iron stores in urban, school
      going Indian children.

      Methods: A randomized, double-blind, 7 month, school-based feeding trial was carried out in
      Bangalore, India. Iron-depleted (serum ferritin, SF &lt;20 µg/L), and/or iron deficient (serum
      transferrin receptor, TfR &gt;7.6 mg/L), 6 -13 year old children (N=194) were randomly assigned
      to either receive a whole wheat flour based lunch meal fortified with 6 mg Fe as NaFeEDTA or
      an identical unfortified control meal. The meals were administered under supervision and left
      overs were weighed. Hemoglobin (Hb) and iron status were measured at baseline, 3.5 months,
      and 7 months. At baseline and at 7 months, the study children were also subjected to a
      battery of cognitive tests to assess attention/concentration, motor development, visuospatial
      and verbal abilities. Sensory evaluation using triangle tests were carried out using meals
      prepared from the fortified and unfortified whole wheat flour.
