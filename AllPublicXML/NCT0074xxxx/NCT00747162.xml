      The investigators plan to enroll 500 consecutive Subjects at a major trauma center for this
      study. For each patient, the body mass index (BMI), age, sex, diastolic pressure and mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) at time of measurements. Additional information including diseases
      such as diabetes and vascular disorders will be recorded. Social demographics including
      alcohol and tobacco use will be recorded. This is important as alcohol and tobacco use could
      also contribute to cardiovascular diseases. The skin pigmentation of each subject will be
      recorded. Two different methods will be used for this measurement. Each patient will be
      graded on a six point scale as described by Young (Young, 1997). Additionally, each subject
      will have their skin measured using a reflectance colorimeter. The colorimeter,
      DermaSpectrometer II (cyberDerm, Broomall, PA) uses visible light to measure the amount of
      light reflected off the skin. By measuring the light reflectance, the skin pigmentation can
      be measure (Clarys, 2000). Muscle oxygenation will be measured using a continuous dual
      wavelength near infrared spectrometer. Using the different absorption characteristics of
      deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin, the concentration of oxyhemoglobin in the muscle at an
      approximate depth of 2.5 cm is determined. The INVOS cerebral oximeter (Somanetics, Troy, MI)
      will be used for all measurements.
