      PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS

        -  Rakesh Patel, MD- Radiation Oncologist

        -  Peter Beitsch, MD- Breast Surgeon

      REGISTRY DESIGN

        -  Multicenter, non-randomized, post market registry of intracavitary accelerated partial
           breast irradiation in appropriately selected patients.

      SAMPLE SIZE AND SITES:

        -  Approximately 400 patients may be enrolled.

        -  Up to 100 qualified U.S. sites may participate in this registry.

      ENDPOINTS:

        1. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS

             -  Subcutaneous Toxicities - The incidence of signs and symptoms of subcutaneous
                toxicities will be recorded at the following follow-up visits; at six (6) month,
                one (1) year, two (2) year, three (3) year, four (4) year, and five (5) year.

             -  Skin Toxicities - Specific toxicities that can result from radiation therapy will
                be recorded at each follow-up visit. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
                Events will be used and to be recorded at each follow-up visits; at one (1) month,
                six (6) month, one (1) year, two (2) year, three (3) year, four (4) year, and five
                (5) year.

             -  Cosmetic Outcome - Cosmetic outcome will be recorded at the following follow-up
                visits; at one (1) month, six (6) month, one (1) year, two (2) year, three (3)
                year, four (4) year, and five (5) year. Cosmetic outcome will be assessed and
                graded in two ways:

             -  Patient Quality of Life Questionnaire - A Quality of Life Questionnaire (QOL) will
                be completed at the following visits; at one (1) month, six (6) month, one (1)
                year, two (2) year, three (3) year, four (4) year, and five (5) year.

        2. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

             -  Local-regional Breast Failure - The secondary efficacy endpoint is ipsilateral
                breast failure at five (5) years.

           This includes:

             -  Ipsilateral recurrence within the initially treated volume. (Within the tumor bed)

             -  Ipsilateral recurrence of cancer outside of the initially treated volume.
                (Elsewhere Failure)

             -  Axillary nodal recurrence

                  -  Survival - to be recorded at each follow-up visit

             -  Overall Survival

             -  Disease Free Survival

                  -  Device Performance - to be recorded during the balloon applicator placement
                     and during the course of the radiation treatments:

             -  Ability to deliver treatment

             -  Axxent System / Balloon Applicator performance

        3. TREATMENT DEVICE

      The device to be used is the electronic brachytherapy system for the treatment of early stage
      breast cancer with intracavitary accelerated partial breast irradiation. The device
      manufacturer is Xoft, Incorporated. All Xoft technology cleared by the FDA for the treatment
      of early stage breast cancer can be used in this post market data collection registry.

      OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

      Representatives from American Brachytherapy Society (ABS), American Society of Breast
      Surgeons (ASBS), and American College of Radiation Oncology (ACRO)will oversee study
      management.
