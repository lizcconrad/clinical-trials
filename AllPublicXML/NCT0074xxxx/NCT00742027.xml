  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of oral panobinostat in patients with
      refractory/relapsed classical HL who have received prior treatment with high dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Safety of panobinostat will also be
      assessed. Other markers that may correlate with efficacy or safety will be explored.

             therapy alone is not sufficient for inclusion into this study.

          5. Patient has at least one site of measurable nodal disease at baseline ≥ 2.0 cm in the
             longest transverse diameter and clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular
             dimensions, as determined by CT scan (MRI is allowed only if CT scan can not be
             performed).

             Note: Patients with bone marrow involvement are eligible, but this criteria alone
             should not be used for disease measurement

          6. Patient has the following laboratory values (labs may be repeated, if needed, to

                  given to correct values that are &lt;LLN. Post-correction values must not be deemed
                  to be a clinically significant abnormality prior to patients being dosed.

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN
