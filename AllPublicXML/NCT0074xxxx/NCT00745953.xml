  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, obesity is considered an indirect cause of heart disease. Obese individuals
      typically present with a number of traditional Framingham risk factors (hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes), predisposing them to heart attacks and subsequent heart
      failure. However, an emerging body of basic research revisits a hypothesis that fat is a
      direct cardiotoxin. Under healthy conditions, most triglyceride is stored in fatty tissue
      (adipocytes) while the amount of triglyceride stored in non-adipocyte tissues (such as the
      pancreas, the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart) is minimal and very tightly regulated. When
      this regulation is disrupted, intracellular triglyceride accumulates excessively in these
      organs (&quot;steatosis&quot;) and has been implicated in activating adverse pathways which culminate
      in irreversible cell death (&quot;lipotoxicity&quot;), leading to several well-recognized clinical
      syndromes. These include non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), pancreatic beta-cell failure
      in type 2 diabetes, and dilated cardiomyopathy.

      It has been recently observed that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in addition to
      lowering blood pressure improve insulin sensitivity and decrease the risk for type 2
      diabetes. This study will test the above theory in two study groups: Valsartan vs.
      Hydrochlorothiazide. We hypothesize that in obese humans with elevated myocardial
      triglycerides, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (Valsartan group) will reduce
      myocardial fat with improvement of insulin sensitivity and heart function.

      Basic science in animal models of genetic obesity have demonstrated that obese, insulin
      resistant animals have fatty hearts with reduced functional ability. More importantly,
      insulin sensitizing treatment of prediabetic rats delayed development of diabetes and
      improved heart function. A primary aim of our laboratory is to translate basic animal
      research, suggesting that excessive lipid accumulation in the myocardium is toxic, into the
      clinical setting using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy technology. The
      results of this research may identify new biomarkers and drug targets to prevent cardiac
      disease in obese humans.

      We used our novel in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy technique that enables
      quantification of triglyceride in human myocardium non-invasively, to demonstrate that obese
      humans like obese animals are characterized by elevated fat in myocardium. We hypothesize
      that in obese humans with elevated myocardial TG, blockade of the renin-angiotensin system
      will reduce myocardial fat with improvement of insulin sensitivity and heart function.

      The aims of this study are to test if in obese people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT):

      Aim 1) Valsartan treatment will reduce myocardial fat and will improve heart geometry and
      function,

      Aim 2) therapy with thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) treatment will elevate
      myocardial fat.

      We are planning to test the action of Valsartan versus HCTZ as we expect that these drugs
      cause opposite metabolic effects. The landmark trial ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and
      Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) has refocused attention to the
      thiazide-type diuretics as the first-line therapy for most patients with hypertension.
      Despite proven reduction in cardiovascular outcomes and low costs, there is on-going concern
      that one of the major side effect of the thiazides—glucose intolerance—may fuel the current
      U.S. epidemic of type 2 diabetes. Despite of efficacy and low cost thiazide diuretics are
      long known to cause insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and precipitation of
      overt diabetes.

    <description>This arm will determine if blockade of the renin-angiotensin system reduces myocardial fat levels and improves insulin sensitivity. It consists of 6 visits: visit1 (baseline); visit2 (2 weeks); visit3 (1 month); visit4 (3 month); visit5 (6 month); visit6 (8 month). Visits 1 &amp; 6 will consist of blood tests, glucose tolerance test by FSivGTT, MRS, &amp; 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. During visit 1, patients receive automatic blood pressure monitor, OMRON, to record blood pressure between visits. Visits 2 &amp; 3 are needed for the adjustment of medication to the final dose level. During visits 4 &amp; 5, Dr. Price will check subject's status as they continue the medication. In case of uncontrolled blood pressure, Dr. Price will prescribe amlodipine for the additional BP control.</description>
