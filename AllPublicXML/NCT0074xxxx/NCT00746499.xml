  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy subjects will take study drug by mouth twice a day for 7 consecutive days, blood and
      cervicovaginal samples will be taken most mornings around the AM dose. Two visits, ~14 hrs in
      length will be required on Day 1 and 7. The purpose of this study is to measure how much
      raltegravir is found in the genital tract after taking it orally.

      This study is looking at blood and cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) samples of healthy volunteers
      taking raltegravir. The purpose of this study is to measure the extent that raltegravir
      penetrates into other body compartments, such as the genital tract. Subjects will take the
      study drug for 7 days, a total of 10 visits to the research center will be required. A
      screening visit will occur on no more than 28 days On Days 1 and 7 the subject will stay in
      the research center for approximately 12 hours for scheduled blood and CVF sampling. Days 3-6
      and 8-9 will involve a short visit to the research center for one pre-dose blood and CVF
      sample before the morning dose. A follow up visit will occur about 7-10 days after last dose.
