  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether community based management of infections
      with antibiotics administered by health extension workers reduce all cause mortality in
      neonates after the first day of life compared to current MOH IMNCI model of referral to
      hospital

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although 44% of neonatal deaths in Ethiopia are due to infection, access to treatment for
      neonatal infections is very low for most families. Even though the newly adapted Integrated
      Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) package includes assessment of newborns,
      if a baby has any danger signs that may be suggestive of infection and is taken to health
      posts, the baby is to be referred to hospital for treatment. Given that only about 5% of
      neonatal deaths occur in hospitals and the distance to hospital is often far and the costs
      prohibitive, very few babies are likely to receive essential lifesaving antibiotics. Evidence
      from India, Bangladesh, and Nepal demonstrates that community health workers can effectively
      manage neonatal infections at home. However it is not known whether and community-based
      management of neonatal infections is effective, feasible and acceptable in the Ethiopian
      context. Local evidence regarding lives saved and cost is required in order to inform health
      policy and programming regarding community-based treatment of neonatal infections.
