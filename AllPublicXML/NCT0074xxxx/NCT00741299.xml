  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether tobacco smoking is associated with bipolar
      affective disorder (severity of depressive and manic symptoms, presence of psychotic
      symptoms, history of a suicide attempts and other clinical features.)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An association exists between smoking and schizophrenia, independent of other factors and
      related to psychotic symptomatology. Only a few small descriptive studies have examined the
      prevalence and correlates of tobacco use among bipolar patients with conflicting results.
      Patients who smoke score higher on rating scales for psychotic symptoms than their
      non-smoking peers. While the association of smoking with psychotic symptomatology in
      schizophrenia is established, such association according to bipolar affective disorder has
      been reported in a few studies and remains unclear. Also a few studies reported about
      association of smoking with depressive and manic symptoms, and with suicidal behavior in
      bipolar patients. Thus further investigation of these issues is warranted.
