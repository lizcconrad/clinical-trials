  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to examine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (how the body processes a drug), and activity of GS-9450 in preventing liver damage due to
      scarring, or fibrosis, caused by Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (also known as NASH).

      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo controlled, multicenter
      study investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of multiple oral
      doses of GS 9450 in adults with NASH. Approximately 110 subjects 18 75 years of age with
      elevated ALT (&gt; 60 U/L at screening), fatty liver on screening ultrasound, and biopsy-proven
      NASH will be randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to one of five parallel treatment groups (22 subjects per
      treatment group) as follows:

      GS-9450 1mg by mouth (PO) once daily, GS-9450 5 mg PO once daily, GS-9450 10 mg PO once
      daily, GS-9450 40 mg PO once daily, or Matching placebo PO once daily Qualifying subjects
      will be stratified by the presence/absence of type 2 diabetes (i.e., on/off oral diabetic
      medication at entry) and by geographic region (US and France). Following randomization,
      subjects will return within five business days later for a baseline visit, at which time they
      will be dispensed study medication and enter a 4-week treatment phase. Upon completion of the
      treatment phase, subjects will enter a 4 week off-treatment follow-up period. Each subject's
      participation in the study will last up to approximately 12 weeks (inclusive of screening,
      treatment phase, and off-treatment follow-up period).
