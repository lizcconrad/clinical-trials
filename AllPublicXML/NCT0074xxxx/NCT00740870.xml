      The primary objective is to confirm the long-term functionality of implantation of the
      Medtronic Melody TPV at 5 years is no worse than the historical control established through
      literature review. The secondary objectives are to assess safety, procedural success, and
      clinical utility of transcatheter implantation of the Melody TPV.

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Freedom From TPV Dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To assess whether long-term functionality of implantation of the Medtronic Melody TPV at 5 years is no worse than the historical control established through literature review. This study is designed to test the null hypothesis that the true freedom from TPV dysfunction at 5 years after Melody implantation (PMelody) is less than or equal to 36% (PControl). To reject the null hypothesis means that freedom from TPV dysfunction at 5 years after Melody implantation (PMelody) is greater than 36% (PControl). The null (H0) and alternative (HA) hypotheses are written as follows:H0: PMelody ≤ PControl and HA: PMelody &gt; PControl. TPV dysfunction is a composite outcome defined as the following:
Hemodynamic dysfunction of the TPV
Moderate or greater pulmonary regurgitation, and/or
Mean Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) gradient greater than 40 mmHg
RVOT reoperation for conduit dysfunction or device-related reasons
Catheter re-intervention on the TPV</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Procedural Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 Hours post implant</time_frame>
    <description>Procedural success is a composite outcome defined as:
Melody TPV fixated within the desired location
Right Ventricle (RV) - Pulmonary Artery (PA) peak-to-peak gradient (measured in the catheterization lab) less than 35 mmHg post-implant
Less than mild pulmonary regurgitation by angiography post-implant
