      The purpose of this study is to identify 15 patients with autonomic failure and obtain blood
      samples for RNA from those participants and 15 control subjects within the same age range.
      The stabilized blood samples, along with a limited data set, will be shipped to Western
      Michigan University where the actual laboratory analysis (a separate study) of the samples
      will take place.

      Unique genetic inscriptions, called gene expression signatures, are currently being
      identified for many diseases, including neurological diseases. The secondary goal of this
      study is to support the research being done at WMU and they try to look for MSA-specific
      signs are present in whole blood samples of MSA patients at late-stages of the disease. This
      is a pilot study that has a long term goal (through additional studies) a MSA-specific gene
      expression signature for the development of a diagnostic test for this disease that can be
      used in the future. Other patient groups with autonomic failure, characterized by significant
      drop in blood pressure on standing, will also be included in this study, to look for similar
      genetic inscriptions.

      This pilot study is expected to last for 2 years. The investigators at WMU will need some
      de-identified health Information about the subjects, including their age at diagnosis, age
      (when sample drawn) and list of their medications

      Patients with one of the following autonomic problems will be recruited to participate in
      this study: multiple systems atrophy (MSA), pure autonomic failure (PAF) or Parkinson's Plus.
      The study consists of drawing 15 ml of whole blood for RNA. The blood is drawn in special
      collection tubes to stabilize the RNA material in the blood. The samples will be frozen and
      shipped to WMU for analysis.

      The patients will also be asked to provide the current list of their medications, their age
      and the age when they were first diagnosed with their neurologic or autonomic disorder. This
      information will be de-identified and sent to the investigators at WMU as a limited data set.
