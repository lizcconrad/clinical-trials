      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of three different interventions to
      improve treatment adherence among patients with arterial hypertension or diabetes in rural
      Cameroon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non communicable chronic diseases such as arterial hypertension (AH) and diabetes (DM) are a
      great burden for public health in Cameroon. However, outside the main cities access to
      appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these health-conditions is still very poor.

      The Swiss NGO &quot;Fondation Coopération Afrique&quot; started in 2007 a program to integrate chronic
      disease management with focus on AH and DM into the primary health care system of peripheral
      non-physician health facilities in a rural area of Central Cameroon. A first evaluation after
      one year revealed very low treatment adherence among the newly diagnosed patients as the main
      challenge.

      In order to improve patient's adherence we expose them randomly to one of three
      interventions:

      The first intervention consists in a written agreement on long-lasting therapy (treatment
      contract). Patients get information about the importance of a regular long term treatment and
      personal engagement to follow treatment and clinical controls regularly.

      The second intervention introduces in addition to the treatment contract a reminder system.
      In case of follow-up failure a community worker traces the patient to recall the visit at the
      health centre.

      The third intervention consists of the treatment contract combined with a financial incentive
      in form of one month free treatment after four months of regular follow-up.

      We allocated randomly one of the three interventions to each health center.
