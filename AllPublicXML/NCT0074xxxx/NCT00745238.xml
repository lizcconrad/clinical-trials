  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Myotonic dystrophy lead to highly heterogeneous, multisystemic symptoms including
      myotonia, progressive muscle weakness, cardiac conduction defects, cataract, metabolic
      dysfunction, and excessive daytime somnolence. This last symptom is related to respiratory
      failure and/or to involvement of the central nervous system. However the metabolic
      disturbances could contribute to it. From the respiratory point of view this disease is
      characterised by the progressive appearance of respiratory failure of muscular origin but
      mainly associated with a defect in the central respiratory drive. The treatment for this
      hypoventilation is non-invasive ventilation (NIV).

      It is not currently absolutely clear as to the best choice of criteria to judge long term
      effectiveness of NIV. The most usual criteria are normalisation of daytime blood gases,
      diminution of respiratory work, improvement in daytime symptoms and improvement in sleep
      structure. Other criteria are currently little studied, for instance the contribution of the
      interaction between alveolar hypoventilation and oxygen desaturation during the night and
      biological deficiencies such as systemic inflammation, glucose intolerance or insulin
      resistance. Likewise there is little information about the interaction between alveolar
      hypoventilation and endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness both being accurate
      predictive factors for cardiovascular risks.

      Aim: to evaluate the impact of NIV on endothelial dysfunction in patients with myotonic
      dystrophy. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of NIV on systemic inflammation,
      arterial stiffness, insulin-resistance, quality of sleep, and daytime vigilance in these
      patients.

      Methods: Patients with chronic alveolar hypoventilation already treated by long term NIV will
      be included. They will have an initial check-up (Visit 1), then will interrupt NIV treatment
      for four weeks (Visit 2), and then return to NIV treatment. The last check-up will be done
      four weeks after NIV resumption (Visit3).

      Expected results: It is expected that NIV withdrawal will results in a deterioration of
      cardio-vascular parameters (endothelial function and arterial stiffness), metabolic
      parameters (insulin-resistance and systemic inflammation), quality of sleep and daytime
      vigilance. Return to NIV treatment may show an improvement of these parameters with a basal
      state recovery.

    <textblock>
      NIV is a technique of assisted ventilation that does not use the endotracheal route as the
      interface between the patient and the ventilator. NIV by positive pressure assistance
      involves ventilating the patient by means of a mask adjusted on the nose or covering the nose
      and mouth. This technique is now the recommended therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
      chronic alveolar hypoventilation. It improves survival and quality of life, and improves
      daytime blood gases in patients suffering form chronic restrictive respiratory failure.

      For each check-up (3 visits), patients will have a polysomnography, a complete respiratory
      function measurement (Flows and lung volumes, CO2 sensitivity test, SNIF test, blood gazes
      analysis), a test of endothelial function (peripheral arterial tone), a test of arterial
      stiffness (pulse wave velocity), an assessment of systemic inflammation (ultra sensitive CRP,
      TNFa, IL6), assessment of diurnal vigilance tests ( OSLER test and sleepiness scale) and
      assessment of metabolic and endocrinal function (insulinemia, glucose blood level, Leptin,
      DHEA).

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients (&gt;18 yrs) suffering from myotonic dystrophy already treated by long term
             nocturnal non invasive ventilation for more than six months for a chronic hypercapnic
             respiratory failure (Level of PaCO2 at beginning of the treatment should be between 45
             and 55 mmHg)

          -  Patients should use his (her) non-invasive ventilation more than 4 hours and less than
             12 hours per day.

          -  Patients could have an associated obstructive or/and central sleep apnea.

          -  NIV treatment should be consider as &quot;efficient &quot;: To allow an improvement of PaCO2
             during wakefulness in the morning when using NIV compared to PaCO2 at the beginning of
             the treatment; To allow an improvement of the nocturnal oxymetry compared to baseline
             (mean nocturnal SaO2 &gt; 90%).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with a concomitant respiratory condition contributing to daytime alveolar
             hypoventilation.

          -  Patients judged by investigators as at high cardiovascular risk, this contraindicating
             NIV withdrawal.

          -  Patients with cardiac failure and periodic breathing.

          -  Patients who have had an acute episode of respiratory failure in the previous month.

          -  Incapacitated patients in accordance with article L 1121-6 of the public health code.

          -  Patients treated by oral corticosteroids or oral long-term non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID).
