      An open label, dose-escalation study to evaluate safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of CPI-613 given twice weekly for three
      consecutive weeks in cancer patients

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the safety and MTD of CPI-613 when administered 2x weekly for 3 consecutive
           weeks.

        -  To determine pharmacokinetics of CPI-613 following intravenous (IV) administration.

        -  To observe the anti-tumor effects of CPI-613, if any occur.

    <description>CPI-613, the investigational drug, is a novel anti-tumor compound believed to operate via a novel mechanism of action that does not belong to any existing pharmacological class of anticancer agents currently being used in the clinics. Specifically, CPI-613 is Cornerstone Pharmaceutical Inc.'s lead drug from its Altered Energy Metabolism-Directed (AEMD) technology platform. It is selective against tumor cells (but not normal cells)according to preclinical studies</description>

             sterile) must use accepted contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device
             [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative serum or
             urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment initiation. (Note: Pregnant
             patients are excluded because the effects of CPI-613 on a fetus are unknown.)

          -  Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study period,
             unless documentation of infertility exists.

          -  Mentally competent, ability to understand and willingness to sign the informed consent
             form.

          -  No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents (except CPI-613), or treatment with
             biologic agents within the 3 weeks prior to treatment with CPI-613. At least 2 weeks
             must have elapsed from any prior surgery or hormonal therapy. Patients must have fully
             recovered from the acute toxicities of any prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs,
             radiotherapy or other anti-cancer modalities (returned to baseline status as noted
             before most recent treatment). Patients with persisting, stable chronic toxicities
             from prior treatment ≤Grade 1 are eligible, but must be documented as such.

          -  Laboratory values ≤2 weeks must be:

               -  Adequate hematologic (white blood cell [WBC] ≥3500 cells/mm^3 or ≥3.5 bil/L;

             patients' risk for toxicity.

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural tumor.

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding, and any patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g.,

          -  Pregnant women, or women of child-bearing potential not using reliable means of

          -  Lactating females because the potential of excretion of CPI-613 into breast milk.
             (Note: Lactating females are excluded because the effects of CPI-613 on a nursing

          -  Life expectancy less than 3 months.
