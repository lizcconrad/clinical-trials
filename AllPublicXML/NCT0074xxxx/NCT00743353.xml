      The purpose of this research study is to get information from volunteers without cancer and
      patients with cancer who have received a new investigational study agent called, &quot;[F-18]
      RGDK5,&quot; to evaluate biodistribution and dosimetry for the study agent and determine F-18
      RGD-K5 uptake in angiogenic tumor. the system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      [F-18]RGD-K5 is being investigated as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for the detection and
      localization of angiogenesis tissue or lesions supporting the application and role of
      integrins in anti-angiogenic therapies to benefit patients with cancer and inflammatory
      diseases.

      The primary objectives of this exploratory study are:

        -  To gain information on biodistribution of [F-18]RGD-K5, and to evaluate the PET images
           with [F-18]RGD-K5 for resolution, signal to background ratio and for the detection and
           localization of angiogenesis tissue. This Exploratory Investigational New Drug (EIND)
           study is designed to obtain preliminary imaging and fundamental biodistribution,
           metabolism and safety information to demonstrate early proof of concept. The information
           collected under this study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, to assess the
           subject's response to therapy, or for clinical management for the subject.
