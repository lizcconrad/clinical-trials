  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a comprehensive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy protocol for adult
      patients with Trichotillomania that emphasizes relapse prevention and that addresses comorbid
      affective symptoms, as well. The study will compare the efficacy of CBT with a minimal
      attention control (MAC)condition. We hypothesize that outcome at post-treatment, 3-month, and
      6-month follow-up will be better for the CBT vs. MAC condition including higher responder
      rates and greater reduction in hair pulling severity.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for
      patients with trichotillomania.

      Following entry into the study, subjects will be randomized into a cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) or a minimized attention control (MAC) condition. Subjects will be assessed
      with the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ), the Affective Regulation Rating (ARR),
      the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety
      Inventory (BAI), Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), the Difficulties in Emotion
      Regulation Scale (DERS), Hair Pulling Scale (HPS), Trichotillomania (TTM) Impact Scale,
      Psychiatric Institute Trichotillomania Scale (PITS), National Institute of Mental Health
      Trichotillomania Severity Scale(NIMH-TSS), the Generalized Expectancy for Negative Mood
      Regulation Scale (NMR), The Milwaukee Inventory for Subtypes of Trichotillomania- Adult
      Version (MIST-A), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the Quality of Life
      Inventory (QOLI), the Readiness to Change Hairpulling Behavior (RCHPB), the Self-Esteem Scale
      (SES), the Skin Picking Scale (SPS) and the Scales of Psychological Well-Being (SPWB).
      Subject randomization to a treatment arm will be determined by a random number generator.

      Subject change scores will be assessed for the above scales.
