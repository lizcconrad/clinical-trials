      ,Cilostazol , Cilostazol metabolism OPC-13015 and OPC-13213 will be measured.

      Safety evaluation:

      Analysis the abnormality of Adverse Event, Vital Sign, Physical Examination, 12-lead ECG, and
      Laboratory Tests (including blood routine examination, routine urine analysis, blood
