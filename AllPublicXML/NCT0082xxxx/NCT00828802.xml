    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what dose of lenalidomide is safe to use in
      combination with decitabine when given in people with myelodysplastic syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of different kinds of stem cell abnormalities. It
      is characterized by low blood counts and abnormal blood cell formation. These abnormal blood
      cells can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, infection, and bleeding. There is significant
      risk of developing acute leukemia in this disorder.

      The only known curative therapy is an allogeneic bone marrow transplant of which the vast
      majority of patients with this disorder are not candidates. Currently three drugs have been
      approved for the treatment of MDS: azacytidine, decitabine and lenalidomide for low grade
      patients with a chromosome 5q abnormality. Azacytidine and decitabine have been demonstrated
      to improve blood counts, improve the quality of life, and decrease the risk of progression to
      AML or death in a sizable minority of MDS patients. A recent study of MDS patients who had
      responded clinically to decitabine revealed that their bone marrow biopsies still showed
      stromal abnormalities such as increased angiogenesis. Lenalidomide acts at the level of the
      stromal - marrow cell interaction. It is hypothesized that the combination of decitabine with
      lenalidomide may show synergistic results.
