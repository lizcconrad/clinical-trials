      written instruction on subjects' understanding of melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a randomized, controlled trial comparing the effect of video-based patient
      education with written instruction on subjects' understanding of melanoma.

      Subjects randomized to the video-based education arm will be instructed to watch a video on
      the definition of melanoma, risk factors associated with the development of melanoma, and
      signs that should prompt an evaluation for melanoma. Subjects randomized to the written
      education arm will receive written information on the definition of melanoma, risk factors
      associated with the development of melanoma, and signs that should prompt an evaluation for
      melanoma. The contents of the video and the written educational materials will be comparable.

      At the end of the study period 1 month later, subjects will be interviewed via telephone
      regarding their understanding of melanoma. Subjects will also be interviewed regarding their
      comprehension and attitude towards video-based and written education materials.
