  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 3 fixed doses of SSR411298
      (10, 50 or 200 mg daily) compared to placebo, in elderly patients with Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD), based on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the tolerability and safety of an 8-week treatment with SSR411298 versus
           placebo in elderly patients with MDD.

        -  To evaluate the effect of SSR411298 on disability, anxiety, cognitive function, sleep,
           pain and somatic symptoms related to depression, and bone markers.

        -  To assess SSR411298 plasma concentrations.

        -  To assess plasma endocannabinoid concentrations.

    <measure>17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks (from D-1 (before randomization) up to D56)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D consists of 17 items assessing signs and symptoms of depression. All items are scored with a severity rating from 0 (not present) to 2 or 4 (very severe), depending on the item. The minimum and maximum possible scores are 0 and 52, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks (from D-1 (before randomization) up to D56)</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS consists of 10 items assessing signs and symptoms of depression. All items are scored with a severity rating from 0 (not present) to 6 (most severe). The minimum and maximum possible scores are 0 and 60, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>D-1 (before randomization) and D56</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-1 Severity of Illness score is rated on a 1 to 7 point scale.
The CGI-2 Improvement score is a component of the CGI; the Improvement score captures the investigator's clinical impression regarding global improvement (or worsening) on a 7-point scale.</description>

    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>D-1 (before randomization) and D56</time_frame>
    <description>The GDS is a 15-item self report scale used to assess the more specific aspects of depression in elderly depressed patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>D-1 (before randomization) and D56</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS contains 3 questions, which assesses interference in three domains, work and school, family life and home responsibilities, and social life. Each question is answered on a 10-point Likert Scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAM-A) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>D-1 (before randomization) and D56</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A consists of 14 items assessing signs and symptoms of anxiety. All items are scored with a severity rating from 0 (not present) to 2 or 4 (very severe), depending on the item. The minimum and maximum possible scores are 0 and 56 respectively.</description>
