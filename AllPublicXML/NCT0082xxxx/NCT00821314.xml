      Importance of the problem OAB is a common health problem. Milsom et al. [1] randomly selected
      a population from six European countries. From this population, 17% of the respondents
      reported having OAB symptoms with 14% reporting frequency, 9% urgency, and 6% urge
      incontinence. The study by Milsom et al. [1] showed that OAB adversely affected the lives of
      the majority (65%) of the respondents who reported OAB symptoms. Chen et al. [2] also
      reported that the prevalence of OAB in Taiwanese women was similar to that of Western women.
      In the study of Chen et al.[2], the prevalence of OAB was 18.6% for the patients; perceptions
      and the number of OAB condition significantly increased in the elderly women (over 65 years
      old, 39.3%). Apart from impairing the physical health, OAB may have a tremendous effect on
      psychological and social well-being. Information on the symptoms and disease severity can
      yield important information that often complements objective measures.

      Incontinence, increased urge and increased frequency of micturition affect nearly 100 million
      people in the western world (33 million in the US and 66 million in the European Union).
      These conditions are not life threatening but they seriously affect quality of life and
      ability to work. OAB is in some studies reported to have an incidence of up to 17 % in the
      western population with great consequences for the quality of life.

      Economic cost The total economic cost of this group of conditions is high. In 2002 the costs
      in the US were approximately $12.7 billion[1] (estimated to be $17 billion and â‚¬22
      billion/year in 2005). Approximately 25% of this expenditure is spent on treatment (drug
      therapy, clinical consultation and surgery). Of those who suffer only 28% have sought help
      and only half of those currently receive treatment. Less than 3% regain long lasting normal
      control. Therefore, these costs are an under-estimate and the problem is large.

      It is necessary to state whether correlations between objective findings and subjective
      perception of symptoms exist, and whether the patient's 'everyday' symptoms are reproduced
      during objective studies, when the results are reported. The principle aim of urodynamics is
      to reproduce a patient's symptoms and to provide a patho physiological explanation for them.
      The purposes of this study is to evaluate whether there is a relation between the position
      (sitting/standing up vs supine position) and the bladder sensations in both healthy
      volunteers and patients with OAB. Furthermore we would like to study patient perception of
      bladder condition and bladder filling and volumes voided as well as the functional and
      maximal bladder capacity in patients with OAB.

      Because patients with pelvic floor dysfunction have widely varying expectations from
      treatment, the patient's goal for treatment is highly subjective. Therefore, strategies for
      assessing OAB should incorporate self-perceived disease condition.

        The study population consists of two groups. One group consist of patients with OAB. The
        second group consist of volunteers without micturition complaints. (25 male &amp; 25 female)

        The second group of patients with OAB. (25 male&amp; 25 female) Both groups will be subjected
        to the exact same protocol.
