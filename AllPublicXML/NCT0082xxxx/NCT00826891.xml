      This is a single arm, open-label study in women from China who have Advanced (stage IVB)
      Recurrent or Persistent cervical cancer to ⑴assess the response rate (i.e., CR + PR) of
      Cisplatin combined with Topotecan in treatment of advanced (stage IVB) recurrent or
      persistent Cervical cancer; ⑵assess the toxicities of CT regimen in treatment of cervical
      cancer. Prior to treatment, written informed consent should be obtained from all patients.
      Eligible patients will be assigned to CT regimen. The CT regimen is topotecan 0.75 mg/m2 IV
      during 30minutes days 1, 2, and 3; followed by cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day1, repeated every
      21 days. The study will consist of two phases: the safety run-in phase and study phase.

    <description>Patients must have specific minimum neutrophil and platelet counts before administration of Hycamtin. The dose of Hycamtin is 0.75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily on days 1, 2, and 3; followed by cisplatin 50 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 repeated every 21 days (a 21-day course).
Dosage adjustments for subsequent courses of Hycamtin in combination with cisplatin are specific for each drug.
Dose levels for cisplatin Initial dose 0 = 50 mg/m2 Dose reduction level -1 = 37.5 mg/m2 Dose reduction level -2 = 25 mg/m2
Dose levels for topotecan Initial dose 0 = 0.75 mg/m2 Dose reduction level -1 = 0.60 mg/m2 Dose reduction level -2 = 0.45 mg/m2</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  women with advanced recurrent or persistent carcinoma of the uterine cervical who were
             unsuitable candidates for curative treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy.

          -  Histologic types included squamous, adenosquamous, and adenocarcinoma of the cervia.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old.

          -  Measurable and/or evaluable disease parameters will be documented and recorded using
             clinical evaluation (and using CT for pathologic nodes when present).

          -  Life expectation greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function.

          -  Patients without history of sensitivity to camptothecin or platinum.

          -  Patients who are non-child-bearing potential, or consistent and correct use of methods
             of birth control from 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of study
             medication until 28 days after the final dose of observational medication.

          -  performance status 0 to 2; to have recovered from the effects of recent surgery,
             chemoradiotherapy, or radiotherapy; and to be free of clinically significant
             infection.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infections.

          -  Patients with concurrent severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy which
             would expose the patient to extreme risk.

          -  Patients who received another investigational drug within 30 days prior to study
             entry.

          -  Patients who are receiving concurrent other chemotherapy, hormonal, immunotherapy or
             radiotherapy. Radiotherapy for palliation of related bone metastases is permitted.

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions to compounds chemically related to
             topotecan or platinum.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies within the last five years, with the
             exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
