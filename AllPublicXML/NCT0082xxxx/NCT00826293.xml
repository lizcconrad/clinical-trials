      Application of a belt for stabilization while exercising accelerate and optimize recovery in
      patients diagnosed with shoulder impingement syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stabilization through belts is commonly used as an adjunct for treatment of musculoskeletal
      problems. Although this treatment is popular among clinicians, there is a paucity of evidence
      on its use for shoulder pathology. The objective of this double-blinded longitudinal
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to determine the clinical efficacy of stabilization
      belting applied to patients receiving rehabilitation treatment for shoulder impingement
      syndrome. The study population will include patients who have been referred to the
      physiotherapy department of the Holland Orthopaedic &amp; Arthritic Centre for conservative
      treatment. Patients will be randomized into the treatment and control groups. The primary
      outcome measure is the Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH)
      questionnaire.
