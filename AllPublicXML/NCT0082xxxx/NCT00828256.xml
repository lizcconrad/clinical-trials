  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic repair has become the preferable surgical technique to treat rotator cuff tears
      in the last decade. Many researches demonstrate equal and even superior outcome with this
      surgical technique, while others show opposite results.

      The aim of this study is to estimate the anatomic and functional results of the arthroscopic
      repair among the patients of the orthopedic department at the Soroka University Medical
      Center, in order to check the investigators hypothesis that indeed - the arthroscopic repair
      of the rotator cuff is the better surgical technique.

      Methods: study population - 80 patients who had had an arthroscopic repair of the rotator
      cuff between the years 2005-2008 at the SUMC.

      Inclusion criteria: age over 18 years. arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. date of operation
      not before 2005.

      Study design:

        1. Data base Collection.

        2. Inviting the patients for physical examination + ultrasound examination of the operated
           shoulder + filling out questionnaires (SF36, CONSTANT SCORE)

        3. Statistical analysis

        4. Publication
