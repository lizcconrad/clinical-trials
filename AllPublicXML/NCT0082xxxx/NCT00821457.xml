  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renovo, a Biopharmaceutical company involved in the development of drugs to improve the
      appearance of scars and enhance wound healing, are proposing to carry out research in
      improving the appearance of existing scars that are 2-6 months old using Juvista. Juvista has
      not previously been administered to pre-existing scars without surgical revision, but it is
      thought that some beneficial effects seen with Juvista in previous trials may also be seen
      when administered to existing scars whilst the scar is maturing. This proof of concept study
      will therefore investigate the effect of Juvista in Caucasian male and female patients when
      administered to scars that are between two and six months old.

      Scarring in the skin can vary hugely between individuals; therefore the most reliable way to
      assess the efficacy of an improvement of scar appearance is to use a model where each patient
      acts as their own control. A placebo will also be used for this trial as there are currently
      no approved pharmaceuticals for the improvement of scarring.

      A total of 20 patients will be allocated to one of two dosing groups. Patients who enter the
      study will have linear scars resulting from broken skin (e.g. trauma, surgery) between 7 and
      20cm in length, as well as meeting other specific criteria. The scar to be treated will be
      divided into two equal segments. Each segment will receive an intradermal injection of
      Juvista or placebo on Day 0 and 24 hours later.

      The measure of change in scar appearance will be performed using colour analysis which will
      assess the change in colour between the Juvista treated segments versus the placebo treated
      segment of the scar, with reference to the surrounding skin within each patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and Female Caucasian patients aged 18-45 years who have provided written informed
             consent.

          -  A body mass index between 15 and 35 kg/m2 (calculated using Quetelet's index [weight
             (kg)/height m2]

          -  Patients with, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinically acceptable results for
             the laboratory tests specified in the trial protocol (see Section 6.4.2). All
             laboratory tests must be performed within 28 days of the first trial dose
             administration.

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential who are using a highly effective method(s)
             of contraception and agree to do so from at least the screening visit until one month
             after administration of the final study dose. For the purposes of the protocol, highly
             effective method(s) of contraception will be defined as consistently and correctly

             o CLcr = (140-age (years)) x weight(kg)/ 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) { x 0.85 for
             females }

             Investigator considers will adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or
             involves the areas to be examined in this trial.

             months will still be eligible).
