      Presently,the diagnostic method of small hepatocellular carcinoma has been greatly elevated
      in China.The treatment is being from simplification to diversification,from entirety to
      individualization.Confronting small hepatocellular carcinoma,we not select simple operation
      treatment but select a treatment that have more predominance and more fitting with patients
      in various kinds of treatment methods;including operation ,TACE,PEI,et al.which is better ?
      There are many arguments.

      randomly put in group standard:

        1. via clinical diagnosis and confirm it is primary liver cancer, and not accept any
           anticancer treatment.

        2. age: 18-70 years.

        3. early hepatocyte cancer，which is single focus of infection diameter ≤ 3 cm.

        4. estimate tumor can gain treatment of curing operation or TACE plus PEI.

        5. better liver function (Child-Pugh，class A or B).

      Case loads: 160 residents with small hepatocellular carcinoma in China

      Therapeutic regimen: under normal rules, the operation group open abdomen to perform
      operation through subtotal incision while the patient has been general anesthesia with
      trachea cannula. The operation range on hepatic tissue of un-tumor tissue around tumor should
      maintain at least 1cm. As for the micro-create treatment combination group, taking TACE all
      through arteria cruralies super-elect arteria hepatica and injecting MITO、FUDR、iodipin. By B
      transonogram guiding to nyxis liver biopsy,and perform per cutem absolute alcohol injection
      treatment.

      Research end-point:

        1. ensemble life span.To compare 1、2 and 3 year overall survival rate in hepatectomy and
           TACE plus PEI for small hepatocellular carcinoma

        2. intraliver recurrence rate; distant metastasis rate; non-tumor life span; band tumor
           life span
