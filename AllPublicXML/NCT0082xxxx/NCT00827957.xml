  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled therapeutic hypothermia is a method of preserving neurological function
      post-resuscitation.It has been associated with improved functional recovery and reduced
      histological deficits in animal models of cardiac arrest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three randomized clinical studies have been reported showing improved neurological outcome
      and reduced mortality in post-resuscitation patients treated with hypothermia compared to
      controls. Of the various methods of inducing hypothermia, internal cooling using an
      endovascular catheter and external cooling using gel pads with a water based circulating
      system have shown the most promise. There have not been any studies looking at outcomes
      between the two methods of cooling.

    <description>The gel-coated external cooling device consists of four water circulating gel coated energy transfer pads, and is placed on the patient's back, abdomen, and both thighs. Depending on the size used, the total surface area ranges between 0.60 and 0.77 m2. It is connected to an automatic thermostat controlling the temperature of the circulating water (4°C to 42°C) based on the patient's core temperature.</description>

    <description>The intravascular cooling system uses a single lumen (8.5 Fr,38 cm) central venous catheter inserted into the inferior vena cava via the left or right femoral vein. Normal saline is pumped through three balloons mounted on the catheter and returned to a central system in a closed loop. The saline flow within the balloons is in close contact with the patient's blood flow and serves as a heat exchange system. An automatic temperature control device adjusts the temperature of the circulating saline (4°C to 42°C) based on the patient's core temperature.</description>
