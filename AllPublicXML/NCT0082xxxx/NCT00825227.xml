      Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Armodafinil Treatment for Patients With Fatigue
      Associated With Taxane Chemotherapy Alone or in Combination With Other Agents

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of study was to determine whether armodafinil treatment at a dose of
      150 mg/day is more effective than placebo treatment in reducing fatigue in patients receiving
      taxane chemotherapy alone or in combination with other agents by comparing the change from
      Screening cycle to treatment cycle (cycle 2) in the patient's average daily rating of their
      worst fatigue severity during the past 24 hours. In addition, the change in the percentage of
      days with severe fatigue and the mean Brief Fatigue Inventory scores were to be recorded.

    <description>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) measures fatigue severity and impact on function on 11-point scale (0-10). Primary outcome measure is average daily rating of BFI question 3: worst level of fatigue over past 24-hours. 0 = no fatigue, 10 = worst imaginable. Study was terminated after only a few patients enrolled and therefore efficacy results were not analyzed and are not reported. Maximum response (most fatigue) would score 10 and minimum response (least fatigue) would score 0. Change was measured from Baseline (cycle 1) to cycle 2. Changes based on matching baseline period with cycle 2 period.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Days With Severe Fatigue, From Patient Responses to the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of up to 8 weeks total (Screening and Double-Blind)</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) measures severity of fatigue and impact of fatigue on daily functioning in past 24 hours. It is a 9-item questionnaire that uses an 11-point scale (0-10) to assess severity. 0 represents no fatigue, 10 represents as bad as you can imagine. The percentage of days with severe fatigue as assessed by the BFI was to be assessed. Study was terminated as a result of a business decision after only a few patients were enrolled and therefore efficacy results were not analyzed and are not reported.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Global Score</measure>

    <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) measures severity of fatigue and impact of fatigue on daily functioning in past 24 hours. It is a 9-item questionnaire that uses an 11-point scale (0-10) to assess severity. Question 3 asks for worst level of fatigue during past 24-hours. 0 represents no fatigue, 10 represents as bad as you can imagine. The global score (0 to 90) determined by adding each item was to be assessed. Study was terminated as a result of a business decision after only a few patients were enrolled and therefore efficacy results were not analyzed and are not reported.</description>

        <description>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) measures fatigue severity and impact on function on 11-point scale (0-10). Primary outcome measure is average daily rating of BFI question 3: worst level of fatigue over past 24-hours. 0 = no fatigue, 10 = worst imaginable. Study was terminated after only a few patients enrolled and therefore efficacy results were not analyzed and are not reported. Maximum response (most fatigue) would score 10 and minimum response (least fatigue) would score 0. Change was measured from Baseline (cycle 1) to cycle 2. Changes based on matching baseline period with cycle 2 period.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Days With Severe Fatigue, From Patient Responses to the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Assessment Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) measures severity of fatigue and impact of fatigue on daily functioning in past 24 hours. It is a 9-item questionnaire that uses an 11-point scale (0-10) to assess severity. 0 represents no fatigue, 10 represents as bad as you can imagine. The percentage of days with severe fatigue as assessed by the BFI was to be assessed.
