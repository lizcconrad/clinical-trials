  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major tumor type worldwide, especially in China as the
      sequence of hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. Activation of the coagulation system occurs
      commonly in patients with malignancy. Several studies have suggested that anticoagulant
      therapy may improve survival in patients with malignancy. The low molecular weight heparins
      (LMWHs) lend themselves to such studies because of their effects in experimental models of
      malignancy and the relative ease of administration compared with unfractionated heparin. The
      purpose of the present RCT was to determine whether addition of LMWH to transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) would improve HCC patient outcome compared with TACE alone.

  <detailed_description>

      100 patients will be randomly assigned to receive either TACE alone or TACE plus LMWH. A
      block of every 4 participants and a stratified randomization according to portal vein cancer
      emboli will be used to restrict randomization. LMWH consisted of nadroparin Ca will be given
      at a dose of 4100 U twice daily during 6 weeks after TACE. The time to progression(TTP) and
      overall survival within two years will be used to evaluate the effect of LMWH on HCC.
