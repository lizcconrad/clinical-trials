  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to Seoul cancer registry data (2000), cancer became the leading cause of death in
      Korea, accounting for 23.9% of all deaths and gastric cancer is the most prevalent malignant
      neoplasm, comprising 20.8% of all cancers. Korea and some part of Asian countries have the
      highest incidence of gastric cancer in the world. Therefore, gastrectomy became one of the
      most common cancer operation in Korea. Thanks to early detection and intervention, the
      mortality of early gastric cancer drops dramatically and is now believed to be one of the
      most curable diseases among all the cancers. However, after successful operation and the
      declaration of cure of the stomach cancer, the patients are left without stomach for all his
      remaining life. If the patients lose most of his stomach tissue, there are several problems,
      which include loss of reservoir function for food and indigestion. Besides, loss of appetite
      is of the paramount importance because the stomach is an important endocrine organ
      controlling the appetite via gut-brain axis and the main axis is through a hormone called
      ghrelin, the only orexigenic hormone in human.

      Because ghrelin is mainly secreted by the fundus and body, operations such as laryngoscopic
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: (LRYGBP), laryngoscopic-adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB)
      virtually abolish the ghrelin expressing cells. Thus loss of appetite is an inevitable
      consequence. Then what happens of the plasma ghrelin after Billoth surgery (standard gastric
      cancer operation) which removes antrum and body of the stomach where ghrelin expressing cells
      are relatively less distributed? Also puzzling is the fact that after surgery some patients
      start to gain weight while others continue to lose weight and appetite. Are there
      ghrelin-expressing cell hyperplasia in the patients who start to gain weight?

      The gastrectomy operation which is performed at the investigators institute is Billoth I or
      II operation. The operation virtually eliminate the half of the body and most of the antrum.
      If fundus is involved also, proximal gastrectomy is the operation of the choice. Most of the
      patients who have these operations will lose weight during 1-3 months after surgery,
      thereafter slowly recover. However, the mechanism of the weight recovery has not been
      elucidated so far.

      To elucidate the mechanism of re-gaining body weight and possible ghrelin expressing cell
      hyperplasia, the investigators designed the prospective study to investigate the stomach
      tissue as well as plasma ghrelin in the patients who are going to have Billoth surgery. The
      items to be investigated include plasma for hormones (ghrelin, leptin, insulin, CCK, PYY),
      stomach tissue for ghrelin, diet evaluation and body weight (body mass index) changes for 7
      months after gastrectomy.

      The investigators hope that their study will reveal the valuable information on the body
      weight recovery and appetite issue. So far the issue of the stomach cancer patients was
      related to survival issue. However, to lead a comfortable life the quality of life is also
      very important. The investigators approach will hint the way of surgery which will benefit
      the patients to live a happy life.

      The below is the items to be included in the study.

        -  diet evaluation: standard three-day diet evaluation table (Dept. of Nutrition)

        -  body weight and height: BMI .

        -  ELISA for plasma ghrelin, leptin, insulin, CCK, PYY: whole blood 5 ml in EDTA tube
           (sampling time: during fasting, around 8 AM-9 AM if possible)

        -  two biopsy specimen: the same site. Fundus. One for ELISA and one for IHC

        -  ELISA for tissue ghrelin: frozen in liquid nitrogen

        -  immunohistochemistry for ghrelin producing cell hyperplasia, Paraffin block cutting for
           immunohistochemistry

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with informed consent

          -  gastric cancer patients treated by subtotal gastrectomy (without chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy) : Actually the differentiation of EGC or AGC depend on the depth of
             invasion. Therefore if the patients are not cachetic because of metastasis or tumor
             burden, there is no need toe exclude the AGC patients from the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with chemotherapy or radiation therapy diabetes mellitus: It has been
             reported that plasma ghrelin is influenced by the insulin. Thus a history of diabetes
             exclude the enrollment of the protocol.
