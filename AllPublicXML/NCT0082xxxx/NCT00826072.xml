  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury is a common complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass,
      and it is significantly related to prolonged postoperative recovery, hospital stays and
      medical cost. Currently available predictors of acute lung injury after cardiac surgery are
      still limited within clinical data. Several genetic polymorphism of inflammatory mediators
      have been reported to be associated with severity of sepsis and ARDS, but the association of
      these inflammatory polymorphism and acute lung injury after cardiac surgery has never been
      reported. This study is performed to investigate the association of genetic polymorphisms
      including TNF -308A/G, IL-10 -1082A/G and IL-6 -572C/G and postoperative lung injury.
