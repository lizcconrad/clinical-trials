    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine which of the commonly used meal supplements is the
      best product for patients with DM. This is important because meal supplements are becoming
      more popular as meal replacements in the United States. Peak blood sugar occurs about 2 hours
      later after a meal. Therefore, the best product would be the one that produces a smallest
      rise in blood sugar.

      The purpose of the study is to determine which of the commonly used commercial nutritional
      supplements are preferential for patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). We will compare the
      post-prandial blood glucose (BG) responses in response to 3 different nutritional supplements
      each containing 50 grams of carbohydrate in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      relate these responses to one of the two well-recognized indices of insulin sensitivity -
      HOMA-R and QUICKI.

    <description>Each participant will consume all three nutritional supplements randomly assigned by computer program to drink one of the three products in one week intervals. Each product will contain 50 grams of carbohydrate but differs in volume, fat, protein, and fiber composition. BG will be tested by finger sticks before (fasting) and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes after drinking the supplement. The participants will have 8 finger stick blood sugar measurements over about 3 hours on each of the 3 testing days.</description>
