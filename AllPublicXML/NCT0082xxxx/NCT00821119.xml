  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that nasal intermittent positive
      pressure(NIPP), used as a primary mode of ventilation in preterm infants with RDS, will
      decrease the need for conventional endotracheal ventilation when compared to nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure.(NCPAP)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory distress syndrome(RDS) and its sequelae, bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD) are
      complications of prematurity.The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial and one of the most
      important risk factors is the ventilator-induced lung injury caused by invasive respiratory
      support.

      The two modes of non-invasive ventilation, NIPP and specially NCPAP, have been used
      frequently in the respiratory care of preterm infants in neonatal units.NCPAP is currently a
      common practice for the treatment of RDS . NIPP has been found to be more effective than
      NCPAP in apnea of prematurity and immediately after extubation in preterm infants,decreasing
      the need of endotracheal ventilation.

      Alternative techniques of non-invasive ventilation has been suggested in some studies to
      decrease respiratory morbidities associated with prematurity.This non-invasive approach could
      be used initially as a primary mode of ventilation for infants with RDS in a effort to
      decrease lung injury and BPD.Studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of these
      therapies.
