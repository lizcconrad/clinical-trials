  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, international, 2-arm, open-label clinical trial
      designed to compare the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with that of
      capecitabine + lapatinib in participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Participants will be treated
      until disease progression (PD), unmanageable toxicity, or study termination. Once disease
      progression is reported, all participants will be followed for survival every 3 months until
      death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With PD or Death as Assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization through the data cut-off date of 14 Jan 2012 (up to 2 years, 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PD was assessed by an IRC using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as target lesions (TLs) and recorded at baseline. TLs should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements either by imaging or clinically. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline sum longest diameter (SLD). All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-TLs and recorded at baseline. PD for TLs was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 20 percent (%) increase in SLD, taking as reference smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PD for non-TLs was defined as appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Percentage of Participants with PD by IRC or death from any cause was reported.</description>

    <time_frame>From the date of randomization through the data cut-off date of 14 Jan 2012 (up to 2 years, 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed by an IRC according to modified RECIST. OR was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as TLs and recorded at baseline. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline SLD. For TLs, a CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs and a PR was defined as &gt;/= 30% decrease in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. For non-TLs, a CR was defined as the disappearance of all non-TLs and a PR was defined as the persistence of 1 or more non-TLs. Confirmation of response at a consecutive tumor assessment at least 4 weeks apart was required. Participants without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders. The percentage of participants with CR or PR by IRC was reported. The 95% CI was computed using Blyth-Still Casella exact CI method.</description>

    <description>Tumor response was assessed by an IRC according to modified RECIST. DOR was defined as the time from first documented OR to first documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred earlier. OR was defined as a CR or PR determined on 2 consecutive tumor assessments at least 4 weeks apart. For TLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs; PR was defined as &gt;/=30% decrease in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD; and PD was defined as &gt;/=20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-TLs, CR was defined as the disappearance of all non-TLs; PR was defined as the persistence of 1 or more non-TLs; and PD was defined as appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs.

    <description>Tumor response was assessed by an IRC according to modified RECIST. Participants were considered as experienced clinical benefit if they had an OR or maintained stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months from randomization. OR: CR or PR determined on 2 consecutive tumor assessments &gt;/=4 weeks apart. For TLs, CR: disappearance of all TLs; PR: &gt;/=30% decrease in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD; PD: &gt;/=20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1 or more new lesions; and SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. For non-TLs, CR: disappearance of all non-TLs; PR/SD: persistence of 1 or more non-TLs; and PD: appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Participants without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders. The 95% CI was computed using Blyth-Still Casella exact CI method.</description>

    <time_frame>From the date of randomization through the data cut-off date of 14 Jan 2012 (up to 2 years, 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure was defined as discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including PD (per investigator review), treatment toxicity, or death from any cause. For &quot;Lapatinib + Capecitabine&quot; arm, a participant was considered as treatment failure only if both drugs were discontinued. For TLs, PD was defined as &gt;/=20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-TLs, PD was defined as appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Percentage of participants with treatment failure was reported.</description>

    <description>Time to treatment failure was defined as the time from randomization to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including PD (per investigator review), treatment toxicity, or death from any cause. For &quot;Lapatinib + Capecitabine&quot; arm, a participant was considered as treatment failure only if both drugs were discontinued with treatment failure date as the later of the 2 discontinuation dates. For TLs, PD was defined as &gt;/=20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-TLs, PD was defined as appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. The median time to treatment failure was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.

    <time_frame>From the date of randomization through the data cut-off date of 14 Jan 2012 (up to 2 years, 11 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom progression was defined as the documentation of a &gt;/= 5-point decrease from baseline in the scoring of responses as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-for participants with Breast Cancer (FACT-B) questionnaire with the Trial Outcomes Index-Physical/Functional/Breast (TOI-PFB) subscale. The FACT-B TOI-PFB subscale contained 24 items from 3 subsections of the FACT-B questionnaire: Physical well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns for breast cancer participants (breast cancer subscale [BCS]). All items in the questionnaire were rated by the participant on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very much&quot;). The total score ranged from 0 to 96 with higher score indicating better perceived quality of life. The percentage of participants with symptom progression was reported.</description>

        <description>PD was assessed by an IRC using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as target lesions (TLs) and recorded at baseline. TLs should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements either by imaging or clinically. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline sum longest diameter (SLD). All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-TLs and recorded at baseline. PD for TLs was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 20 percent (%) increase in SLD, taking as reference smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PD for non-TLs was defined as appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Percentage of Participants with PD by IRC or death from any cause was reported.</description>

        <description>Tumor response was assessed by an IRC according to modified RECIST. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as TLs (on the basis of their size and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements either by imaging or clinically) and recorded at baseline. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline SLD. All other lesions were identified as non-TLs and recorded at baseline. PD for TLs: &gt;/= 20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PD for non-TLs: appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. PFS: time from randomization to first documented PD by IRC or death from any cause (whichever occurred earlier). The median duration of PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR) as Assessed by an IRC</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed by an IRC according to modified RECIST. OR was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as TLs and recorded at baseline. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline SLD. For TLs, a CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs and a PR was defined as &gt;/= 30% decrease in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. For non-TLs, a CR was defined as the disappearance of all non-TLs and a PR was defined as the persistence of 1 or more non-TLs. Confirmation of response at a consecutive tumor assessment at least 4 weeks apart was required. Participants without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR) as Assessed by an IRC</title>
          <description>Tumor response was assessed by an IRC according to modified RECIST. OR was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total were identified as TLs and recorded at baseline. A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated as baseline SLD. For TLs, a CR was defined as the disappearance of all TLs and a PR was defined as &gt;/= 30% decrease in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. For non-TLs, a CR was defined as the disappearance of all non-TLs and a PR was defined as the persistence of 1 or more non-TLs. Confirmation of response at a consecutive tumor assessment at least 4 weeks apart was required. Participants without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders. The percentage of participants with CR or PR by IRC was reported. The 95% CI was computed using Blyth-Still Casella exact CI method.</description>

The 95% CI was computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.</description>

        <description>Symptom progression was defined as the documentation of a &gt;/= 5-point decrease from baseline in the scoring of responses as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-for participants with Breast Cancer (FACT-B) questionnaire with the Trial Outcomes Index-Physical/Functional/Breast (TOI-PFB) subscale. The FACT-B TOI-PFB subscale contained 24 items from 3 subsections of the FACT-B questionnaire: Physical well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns for breast cancer participants (breast cancer subscale [BCS]). All items in the questionnaire were rated by the participant on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very much&quot;). The total score ranged from 0 to 96 with higher score indicating better perceived quality of life. The percentage of participants with symptom progression was reported.</description>
