      In this study, we intend to divide the subjects who have been confirmed recurrent HCC into
      two groups: Group A: treatment with pure surgery or Group B: treatment with pure radio
      frequency. We will compare the non-tumor survival time, long-term survival rate between the
      two groups, summarize the merits and demerits of both groups, and try to establish a
      standardized therapy and treatment for the this kind of patients through prospective studies
      on the molecular biological difference of pathological samples between the first and second
      surgeries.

      The recurrence and metastasis of primary liver cancer (PLC) have always been a tough problem
      for surgeons. Gu Hong-guang reported the five years recurrence rate in PLC subjects reached
      75~100%, among which 60% were discovered within three years after surgeries, with the peak
      appearing at 18~24 months. According to a report delivered by Zhong-Shan Hospital, the
      recurrence rate of small HCC was 40%, and that of large HCC was 1.9 times of small HCC. Chen
      Han agreed that the recurrence rate in 1~2 years reached 71.6%, while in 2~11 years was
      28.4%. With the rapid development of iconography and surgical techniques, it is possible for
      surgeon to resect the recurrent HCC now. In 1986, Nagasue et al. reported the excision of
      recurrent HCC and proved that comparing with non-surgical treatment, subjects with recurrent
      HCC excision got a higher survival rate. However, the excision rate of recurrent HCC has
      always been an arguable point. Nakajima et al. suggested the excision rate in 133 subjects
      was 24%, while Matsuda et al. agreed that in 91 subjects reached 44%, and Zhoo reported that
      in 384 subjects was 35%; Kakazu et al. insisted that in 286 subjects was 17%; Nagasue et al.
      said that in 290 subjects was 30%; Shoto et al. reported that in 341 subjects was 19% and
      Poon et al. advocated that in 244 subjects was 10%. He Sheng summarized the 1295 subjects in
      recent five years, and only 106 of them had the opportunities to have excision again (8.18%).
      Sugimachi, Minagawa et al. reported separately the 5 year survival rate in recurrent HCC
      subjects were 47.5% and 56.0%, which showed no significant difference with the first
      surgeries, but better therapeutic effects, meanwhile, third and forth surgeries could also
      get similar survival rate, which indicated that surgical excision is a vital treatment in
      recurrent HCCs. Chen Han in our hospital reported the first, third, fifth, and tenth year
      survival rate in 162 recurrent HCC subjects who underwent first surgical treatment were
      separately 96.8%, 66.7%, 43.6% and 21.8%; while that in subjects who received second surgical
      treatment were separately 94.7%, 44.9% and 25.0% at the first, third, and fifth year (mean
      survival time was 45 months, and average survival time was 54 months).

      In this study, we intend to divide the subjects who have been confirmed recurrent HCC into
      two groups: Group A: treatment with pure surgery or Group B: treatment with pure radio
      frequency. We will compare the non-tumor survival time, long-term survival rate between the
      two groups, summarize the merits and demerits of both groups, and try to establish a
      standardized therapy and treatment for the this kind of patients through prospective studies
      on the molecular biological difference of pathological samples between the first and second
      surgeries.
