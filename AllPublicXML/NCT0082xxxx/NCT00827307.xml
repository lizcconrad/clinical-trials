      The purpose of this study is to compare Zoladex plus tamoxifen with tamoxifen alone as
      adjuvant hormonal therapy in pre- or perimenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer in
      terms of breast density, estrogen levels, lipidemia, endometrial thickness and
      ultrasonographic abnormalities.

      After the completion of primary treatment(surgery and/or adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy
      could be given concurrently with study medication), eligible patients will be randomized to
      receive Zoladex plus tamoxifen or tamoxifen alone. The duration of study medication along
      with the follow-up will be 18 months, or until disease recurrence,or discontinuation of study
      therapy (as a result of an adverse event, a patient's request, or an investigator's
      decision), further treatment will be at investigator's discretion.

      During the study period, contralateral mammograms and transvaginal ultrasound will be
      undertaken at baseline and after 6, 12 and 18 months of study medications. Mammographic
      density assessment will be undertaken by a single radiologist. Serum measurements including
      estrogen levels and lipidemia will be obtained at baseline and after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months
      of study medications.
