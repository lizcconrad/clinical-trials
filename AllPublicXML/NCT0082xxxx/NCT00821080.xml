      This study is evaluating a combination of drugs called sirolimus and vandetanib to treat
      glioblastoma. Sirolimus has been approved for use in patients who undergo organ transplants.
      Sirolimus works by suppressing the immune system so the body will not reject the transplanted
      organ. Vandetanib is an investigational drug and we are trying to find the highest and safest
      dose of vandetanib with sirolimus that can be given safely.

      -  Vandetanib will be given to participants in tablet form. The dose taken will depend upon
           when they are enrolled in the study. The doctor will inform them of which dose they are
           on and how many tablets they will be taking.

        -  Sirolimus will also be given to participants in tablet form. The dose taken will depend
           upon when they are enrolled in the study. The dose on the first day will be higher than
           the dose taken every other day.

        -  Participants will also be given Bactrim, one double-strength table three times each week
           (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) to help prevent participants from getting a type of
           pneumonia called pneumocystis pneumonia.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed before the participants begin
           taking the study drugs and before every 4 week cycle: Physical exam; medical history;
           questions about any side effects; tumor assessment by MRI or CT (only before every other
           cycle); Mini-Mental Status exam (MMSE); ECG (week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, then every 3 months
           thereafter); blood pressure; blood tests and urine tests.

        -  Participants will be in this research study for a maximum of 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed glioblastoma at some point in their disease course

          -  All patients must have received prior standard therapy including resection if
             feasible, radiation and temozolomide

          -  May have received 3 or fewer chemotherapy or biotherapy systemic regimens. Gliadel
             wafer therapy is not counted as a regimen. Patients may not have received any prior
             anti-VEGF, anti-EGF therapy or mTOR inhibitors.

          -  Lab values as outlined in protocol

          -  Must have recovered from immediate post-operative period and must be maintained on
             stable or decreasing corticosteroid regimen for at least 3 days prior to the start of
             treatment

          -  Must have recovered from possible complications of prior chemotherapies and have a
             period of 28-42 days since last treatment. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from a
             non-nitrosourea chemotherapy or 6 weeks from a nitrosourea chemotherapy. Patients must
             be at least 1 week from the use of non-cytotoxic therapies

          -  Must be at least 3 months from the completion of radiation or radiosurgery
