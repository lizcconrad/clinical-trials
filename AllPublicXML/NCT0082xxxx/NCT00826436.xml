      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending,
      multiple, oral doses of PRA-027 in Japanese postmenopausal women. The secondary purpose is to
      evaluate the PK and PD profile of multiple oral doses of PRA-027 in Japanese postmenopausal
      women.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Aged 35 to 65 years inclusive on study day 1 of the treatment period. Menopause may be
             spontaneous or due to surgery.

             Postmenopausal women are defined as follows:

               -  Spontaneous amenorrhea must have begun by age 55 years.

               -  Spontaneous amenorrhea must have initiated at least 6 months before study day 1
                  of the treatment period.

               -  For subjects who have had spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 6 months but less
                  than 12 months before screening, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level must be
                  ≥ 38 mIU/mL.

               -  For subjects who have had spontaneous amenorrhea for 12 months or longer before
                  screening, no FSH level determination is required.

               -  For subjects who have had amenorrhea as a result of bilateral oophorectomy
                  without hysterectomy; surgery must have occurred at least 6 months before
                  screening. No FSH measurement is required. Subjects must provide evidence of the
                  procedure by an operative report or by ultrasound scan. The date (month/year) of
                  the subjects' last menstrual period must be determined and recorded on the source
                  document.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) in the range of 17.6 to 26.4 kg/m2 and bodyweight ≥ 45 kg.

             BMI is calculated by taking the subject's weight, in kilograms, divided by the square
             of the subject's average height, in meters, at screening:BMI = weight (kg)/[Height
             (m)]2

          3. Healthy, as determined by the investigator, on the basis of screening evaluations.

          4. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatinine
             levels should be below the upper limit of normal at screening.

          5. Nonsmoker or smoker of fewer than 10 cigarettes per day as determined by history. Must
             be able to abstain from smoking during the inpatient stay.

          6. Have a high probability for compliance with and completion of the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Presence or history of any disorder that may prevent the successful completion of the
             study.

          2. Any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory,gynecologic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic,dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or
             psychiatric disease.

             - Women with asymptomatic leiomyomata may be enrolled in the study.

          3. Women who have undergone a hysterectomy.

          4. Women with complex or simple ovarian cysts greater than 3 cm indiameter.

          5. Any surgical or medical condition that may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the test article (eg, resection of liver,
             kidney, gallbladder, or gastrointestinal tract).

          6. Acute disease state (eg, nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea) within 7 days before
             receiving test article (treatment period study day 1).

          7. History of drug abuse.

          8. Admitted alcohol abuse or history of alcohol use that may interfere with the subject's
             ability to comply with the protocol requirements.

          9. History or presence of polycystic ovarian disease.

         10. History of female infertility.

         11. History or family history of arterial or venous thrombosis.

         12. Any clinically significant deviation from normal limits in results of physical
             examinations, vital sign measurements, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), or clinical
             laboratory tests.

         13. Demonstration of positive findings on orthostatic testing at screening. The definition
             of a positive finding is a ≥20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure, a ≥ 10 mm Hg
             decrease in diastolic blood pressure, or a ≥ 30 bpm increase in pulse, after standing
             for 3 minutes.

         14. Positive serologic findings for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies,
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.

             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates and phencyclidine [PCP]).

         16. History of any clinically important drug allergy or adverse drug reaction (eg,
             relapsing dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity, drug allergy, hypersensitivity to
             ingredient in the test articles, angioedemas)

         17. Use of any investigational or prescription drug within 90 days before receiving test
             article (treatment period day 1)or prescription drug within 30 days before study day
             1.

         18. Consumption of any caffeine-containing products (eg, coffee, tea, chocolate, or
             carbonated beverages) or alcoholic beverages within 48 hours before receiving test
             article (treatment period day 1).

         19. Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit-containing products within 72 hours before
             study day 1 (treatment period day 1).

         20. Use of any over-the-counter drugs, including herbal supplements (except for the use of
             vitamins ≤ 100% of the recommended daily allowance), within 14 days before receiving
             test article (treatment period day 1).

         21. Donation of blood within 90 days before study day 1.

         22. Subjects deemed by the investigator to be inappropriate according for the inclusion in
