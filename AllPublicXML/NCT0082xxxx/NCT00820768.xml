          4. Patients must have recovered for at least 3 weeks from prior treatment regimens and
             have no residual toxicity &gt; Grade 2 (with the exception of peripheral neuropathy which
             must have improved to ≤ Grade 1).

          5. Patient should have full recovery from any reversible side effects of prior
             chemotherapy.

          6. Patient should have full recovery for at least 4 weeks since major surgery.

          7. ECOG performance status 0-2.

          8. Age ≥18 years.

          9. Patient must have the following blood counts at Baseline:

               -  WBC ≥ 3.0 x 10 cells/L.

               -  ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10 cells/L.

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 10 cells/L.

               -  Hgb ≥ 9grams/dL.

         10. Patient must have the following blood chemistry levels at Baseline:

               -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 1.5x upper limit of normal range (ULN);

               -  Total Bilirubin ≤ ULN;

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5x ULN (unless bone metastasis is present in the absence
                  of liver metastasis;

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

         11. Peripheral neuropathy Grade ≤ 1 by NCI CTCAE V3.0.

         12. Female of childbearing potential with negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours
             prior to the first dose of study drug.

         13. Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to utilize contraception
             considered adequate and appropriate by the investigator (including one barrier method)
             for the duration of the study and for 2 months after the end of study.

         14. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.

         15. Informed consent document has been obtained.

         16. If obese, a patient must be treated with doses calculated using his/her actual BSA
             (the physician must be comfortable treating at the full BSA dose regardless of BSA).

        the study.

          1. Concurrent therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, kinase inhibitors, immunotherapy,
             etc) for advanced solid tumor.

          2. Patients receiving known CYP450 3A4 inhibitors.

          3. Bisphosphonate therapy is allowed, however, patients should be stable on their current
             bisphosphonate, with no change, start or stop of treatment within 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

          4. Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal tumor involvement should be
             excluded from this clinical trial.

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious ongoing or
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/ social situations that would limit
             compliance with study.

          6. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease including congestive heart failure
             (New York Heart Association Class III or IV), active angina pectoris or recent
             myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months).

          7. History of other malignancy within the last 5 years which would affect the diagnosis
             or assessment of advanced solid tumor excluding non-melanomatous skin cancer and
             cervical carcinoma.

          8. Patients who have received an investigational drug within the previous 3 weeks.

          9. Patient is currently enrolled in any other clinical study in which investigational
             procedures are performed or investigational therapies are administered. A patient may
             not enroll in such clinical trials while participating in this study.

         10. Pregnant or nursing women.

         11. Patients with history of allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug or its
             excipients.
