      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to obtain descriptive information about the nature and extent of
      body image concerns among surgical patients with head and neck cancer, satisfaction with care
      received regarding body image issues, and interest in psychosocial services targeting body
      image disturbance. Findings from this study provide important preliminary data to guide
      future large scale research on the critical, yet understudied, psychosocial issue of body
      image functioning for head and neck cancer patients. Information obtained from this study can
      specifically be used to facilitate the development of appropriate disease-specific body image
      instruments and to determine the need for body image focused psychosocial interventions to
      enhance quality of life and the survivorship experience for these patients.

      Primary Aims

        1. To characterize the nature and extent of body image concerns in surgically treated
           patients with head and neck cancer and determine preferences for psychosocial
           intervention.

        2. To compare body image and quality of life outcomes for patients at different time points
           relative to initiation of treatment. Specific time points of interest are pre-treatment,
           within one year of initial surgical treatment, and greater than 1 year following initial
           surgical treatment.

      Secondary Aim

      1. To compare body image and quality of life outcomes for patients with oral cavity,
      cutaneous, and midface cancers.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to fill out 1 questionnaire. This
      questionnaire can be filled out while you are waiting to be seen by your head and neck doctor
      and will take about 15-20 minutes to complete.

      In this questionnaire, you will be asked questions such as your age, gender, education level,
      and smoking history. You will also be asked about your treatment for cancer and how it has
      affected your appearance and body. There will also be questions about your mood, physical
      health, alcohol use, and social well-being.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after you complete the questionnaire.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 350 people will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
