  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) like LBH589 have recently been established as novel
      potent anti-cancer agents for solid and hematologic malignancies. Several pre-clinical
      reports have shown a good anti-tumoral activity of different HDACi on human or murine HCC
      models. These compounds, e.g. Trichostatin A, SAHA, MS-275 and others, have been shown to
      induce apoptosis in HCC cells and to inhibit growth of HCC by inhibiting proliferation and
      tumor-related angiogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, HDACi sensitize HCC in a synergistic manner
      to other forms of cytotoxic stimulation, e.g. by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or
      TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. It has also been shown that the combination of HDACi with various
      kinase inhibitors like sorafenib, erlotinib or others, promotes the anti-tumor efficacy of
      single agents.

      Based on the investigators' own previous experiences with different HDACi and LBH589 in
      preclinical HCC models, a strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic as well as an
      anti-angiogenic effect will be expected by combining LBH589 with an existing sorafenib
      treatment. It is assumed that this combination will prolong overall survival and
      time-to-progression with lowered adverse effects in HCC patients.
