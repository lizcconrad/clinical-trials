  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will be assessed for immunologic response to
      pneumococcal vaccination. Patients with IBD meet criteria as outlined by the Centers for
      Disease Control (CDC) for pneumococcal vaccination, yet the investigators have found that
      pneumococcal vaccination in this population is under-utilized. It is unknown whether or not
      IBD or IBD-related medications impact the immune response to this recommended vaccine.

      Three groups of 25 patients each will be recruited. The first group will consist of
      outpatients with IBD who are receiving infliximab (Remicade TM) while on concommitant
      immunosuppressive therapy (with either 6MP, azathioprine, or methotrexate). This group is
      intended to represent a common 'heavily immunosuppressed' patient group with IBD.

      The second group will consist of patients with IBD seen in our outpatient clinic who are not
      on any immune-suppressive medications. These patients meet CDC criteria for vaccination by
      virtue of having a chronic medical illness. The third group will consist of healthy
      age-matched (to the first group) controls.

      After obtaining informed consent, patients will be screened with baseline lab tests including
      testing for antibodies against pneumococcus. At the baseline visit, patients will also
      undergo a brief medical history, physical examination, and assessment of their IBD disease
      activity.

      Included patients will then undergo a one-time intramuscular vaccination with 23-valent
      polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax TM). One month later, subjects will return for
      a blood draw to assess for response to pneumococcal vaccination.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females over the age of 18 with inflammatory bowel disease; healthy controls
             will be age- and sex-matched.

          2. The patient must understand and voluntarily sign and informed consent document

          3. A history of chronic (greater than 1 month) ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease
             diagnosed and documented by the standard clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, and
             histopathologic criteria

          4. (Group 1): Outpatients at CSMC IBD center with IBD who are on maintenance anti-TNF
             therapy with infliximab OR ADALIMUMAB plus concomitant immunomodulator therapy (with
             either 6MP, AZA, or MTX)

          5. (Group 2): Outpatients at CSMC's IBD Center with documented IBD who are not on any
             immune-suppressive medications. Treatment with oral or topical 5-ASA products,
             antibiotics, or probiotics, are permitted.

          6. (Group 3): Healthy volunteers without chronic illness, not on immune-suppressive
             medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine

          2. Current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, endocrine (including thyroid), pulmonary, cardiac, infectious, neurologic
             or cerebral disease. Included are ongoing chronic active conditions such as chronic
             active hepatitis.

          3. Patients who in the judgment of the investigator are unwilling or unable to comply
             with all the protocol-related assessments and procedures.

          4. History of alcohol or other drug abuse within one year, or any conditions associated
             with poor compliance.

          5. Patients in whom venipunctures are not feasible due to poor tolerability or lack of
             easy access.

          6. Healthy volunteers or patients with a history of prior pneumococcal vaccination

          7. Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the patient at
             unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.
