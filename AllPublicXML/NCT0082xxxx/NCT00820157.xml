      The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcomes of cytoreductive surgery followed
      by Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) with TACE alone in patients with MNHCC so as to
      establish a treatment standard for MNHCC.

    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the world's most common malignancies, especially in
      East-Asian countries. Hepatic resection has been accepted as the only means of cure for
      patients with HCC. The results of hepatic resection for early-stage HCC are
      favorable.Nevertheless, the role of surgical resection for multinodular HCC (MNHCC) is less
      well-defined.The presence of multiple tumors has been shown to be one of the most significant
      independent factors to influence cumulative survival rates in HCC after hepatic
      resection.Using the BCLC criteria,liver transplantation provides an alternative curative
      treatment option for MNHCC with size ≤ 5 cm in diameter and tumor number &lt;3，but MNHCC beyond
      these criteria usually receive palliative therapy.

      For MNHCC which not suitable for curative treatment, non-surgical and surgical interventions
      are available for palliative care.Cytoreductive surgery has the potential to increase the
      quality and quantity of survival in patients with advanced HCC. Cytoreductive surgery is
      carried out with partial hepatectomy,cryosurgery,microwave coagulation therapy(MCT),or
      absolute alcohol injection.It has been shown to prolong survival and provide good symptomatic
      relief in patients with good surgical risks in non-randomized studies.Cytoreductive surgery
      aims at removal or destruction of all macroscopic tumours, allowing microscopic foci to
      persist while preserving as much of the functional liver tissue as possible. The development
      of effective local ablative therapy (LAT), such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy,
      facilitates reduction of the tumour burden even further during the operation.Cytoreductive
      surgery can also be followed by other non-surgical treatments,such as regional therapy or
      systemic therapy, to deal with the residual disease or micrometastases.

      The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcomes of cytoreductive surgery followed
      by TACE with TACE alone in patients with MNHCC so as to establish a treatment standard for
      MNHCC.
