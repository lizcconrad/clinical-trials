  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 Evaluate the safety and tolerability of RAD001 in combination with sorafenib in
      patients with advance hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)

      Phase 2 To estimate the treatment effect as a measure of anti-tumor activity in terms of Time
      to Progression (TTP) of the combination of RAD001 plus sorafenib, at the MTD, as compared to
      sorafenib alone
