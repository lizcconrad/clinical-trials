      This study is a prospective randomized clinical trial. The purpose of this 4-stage study is
      to explore the effects of patient-preferred music, relaxation music, and standard care
      environment on patients in intensive care units.

      Stage 1: Recommendation of relaxation music by music therapists who serves as expert panel

      Stage 2: Analysis of recommended relaxation music by music therapists

      Stage 3: Content validation of relaxation music by healthy adults

      Stage 4: Comparison of patients' physiological, psychological, and biological responses to
      patient-preferred music, relaxation music, and standard care environment
