      Purpose : to evaluate the efficacy of ECP in children with refractory acute GVHD This study
      addresses patients with persistent GVHD after steroid and/or monoclonal antibody therapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One arm. Six sessions in two weeks. Classification in complete response (resolution of all
      signs of GVHD), partial response (improvement of at least one grade) or absence of response
      (Glucksberg criteria). Tapering depending on patient condition during weeks 2 to 10. Final
      evaluation at week 10. Steroid therapy tapering at the discretion of the investigator.
