      Patients suffering from migraine will be randomly allocated to one of two different
      behavioral interventions:

        -  mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) an eight week intervention program based
           different meditation &amp; yoga techniques and teaching information regarding the
           relationship between stress and health.

        -  into an active control group teaching three times within eight weeks relaxation
           techniques (progressive muscle relaxation PMR) and giving psychoeducation on migraine.
           The investigators will measure the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks before
           during and after the intervention as well as secondary variables on quality of life and
           psychological functioning. The hypothesis is that patients allocated to the MBSR
           intervention will reduce the frequency of their migraine attacks compared to the active
           control group and compared to their own baseline.

      Sixty patients suffering from migraine will be randomly allocated to one of two different
      behavioral interventions: (i) mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) an eight week
      intervention program based different meditation &amp; yoga techniques and teaching information
      regarding the relationship between stress and health. or (ii) into an active control group
      teaching three times within eight weeks relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation
      PMR) and giving psychoeducation on migraine. The investigator will measure the frequency and
      intensity of migraine attacks before during and after the intervention by headache diaries as
      well as secondary variables on pain sensation, psychological well being, generic quality of
      life, pain regulation, pain acceptance, mindfulness, compliance and satisfaction with the
      intervention. The hypothesis is that patients allocated to the MBSR intervention will reduce
      the frequency of their migraine attacks compared to the active control group and compared to
      their own baseline.
