      There are no clear markers to identify sepsis and acute lung injury at early stage in
      clinical settings which would result in improved survival of the patients. In collaboration
      with the research team led by Dr. Zhang at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, we have initiated
      a pilot study looking for biological markers to detect severe sepsis and ARDS. We have found
      that human neutrophils peptides (a-defensins), certain coagulation variables and cytokine
      levels are very sensitive markers to differentiate severe sepsis, ARDS from cardiovascular
      diseases in ICU patients. These findings may provide valuable information for therapeutic
      guideline in clinical practice. The present study will focus on testing 'biological markers'
      to identify patients with sepsis and acute lung injury. We will examine the roles of three
      components of markers including inflammation, neutrophil activation and coagulation. We are
      hoping that this proposed translational research will help develop novel therapeutic strategy
      in sepsis and acute lung injury patients.
