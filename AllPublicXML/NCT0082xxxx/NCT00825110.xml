  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the principal research objective is to form a database of tissue samples from patients with
      colorectal (bowel) cancer. The tissue samples that will be used for this research will have
      already been taken for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons. We will also be asking for consent
      for a research blood sample. The database will be used to improve our understanding of the
      molecular genetics and gene expression patterns in colorectal cancer.

      All patients at the Royal Marsden with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer will be eligible to
      enter this study. This will include patients both with early and advanced disease, provided
      they give informed consent. They will give written consent to participate, to include consent
      for analysis of existing tumour tissue and consent for collection of demographic and
      clinicopathological data relating to their case and its future outcome, and consent for a
      blood sample to be taken for research purposes. Additionally, old samples of material surplus
      to clinical requirements may be collected without specific consent if there is no possibility
      that it would affect the patient's interest (eg the patient has died).
