  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if established parenteral nutrition (PN) associated
      liver disease can be reversed or its progression halted by using a parenteral fat emulsion
      prepared from fish oil as measured by normalization of serum levels of hepatic enzymes and
      bilirubin.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the need for and time to small bowel
      transplantation or liver transplantation. This will be calculated as both the age at time of
      primary transplant as well as the length of time from initial evaluation to
      transplant.Secondary objectives are to determine if there are improvements in clinical
      measures associated with established parenteral nutrition- associated liver disease (PNALD).
      These will be determined by measurement of total and direct bilirubin levels, platelet count,
      serum albumin, and changes in both length and weight growth curves.

    <description>This study will be a prospective, non-randomized, open-label study of Omegaven™ for provision of parenteral lipid calories. The study cohort, receiving the PN lipid at 1g/kg/day, will be compared to historical controls at UNMC where parenteral lipid calories were provided exclusively through soybean-based formulations. The study is planned to enroll 100 patients. The Intestinal Rehabilitation Program at UNMC sees between 20 and 30 new pediatric patients per year, with almost all being PN-dependent and over 75% presenting with a bilirubin ≥ 2mg/dL. Based on these calculations, we estimate 4-5 years to enroll 100 patients.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be enrolled in the Intestinal Rehabilitation Program at the University
             of Nebraska Medical Center, AND:

          -  Be unable to meet nutritional needs solely by enteral nutrition and be expected to
             require PN for at least another 30 days

          -  Have clinical evidence of parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) as
             defined as a direct bilirubin of 2 mg/dl or more. A liver biopsy is desirable but not
             necessary for treatment

          -  Signed patient informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parent or guardian or child unwilling to provide consent or assent

          -  Inability or unwillingness on the part of parent/guardian or child to follow clinical
             recommendations of the Intestinal Rehabilitation Program

          -  Allergies or clinical conditions precluding safe use of Omegaven™
