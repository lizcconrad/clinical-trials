    <textblock>
      This study is working to research the efficacy and significant of the anti-virus therapy in
      the unresectable Hepatitis B virus (HBV) related primary liver cancer(PLC) so as to establish
      treatment standards of anti-virus therapy in PLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      primary liver cancer(PLC)is one of the world's most common malignancies, especially in
      East-Asian countries.Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with 70-90% of PLC cases
      in China. PLC can develop during any stage of the natural course of chronic HBV infection and
      anti-virus therapy should be considered during the management of PLC. However, there is no
      definite guide on when or how to practice the anti-virus therapy, especially in unresectable
      or inoperable PLC. Because of these facts, research on the significant of the anti-virus
      therapy in the HBV-related PLC is urgently needed.

      200 patients will be randomly assigned to anti-virus therapy group and control gruop.The time
      to progression(TTP) and overall survival within two years will be used to evaluate the effect
      of anti-virus therapy on PLC.

      The aim of this study is to research the efficacy and significant of the anti-virus therapy
      in the unresectable HBV-related PLC so as to establish treatment standards of anti-virus
      therapy in PLC.

             upper limit of normal value, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase ≤
             10 times the upper limit of normal value.

          4. hemoglobin≥8.5g/dl, PT-INR≤2.3 or PT&gt;6 seconds of normal value.
