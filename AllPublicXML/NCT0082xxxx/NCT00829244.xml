    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this trial is to compare the ovarian response in assisted
      reproductive technology (ART) subjects administered GONAL f® according to the 'Consistency in
      recombinant follicle stimulating hormone [r-FSH] starting doses for individualized treatment'
      (CONSORT) calculator versus given a standard GONAL f® dose of 150 International Unit (IU) per
      day.

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 244 participants gave informed consent and were screened for study entry. Forty-four (44) of these participants were not randomized due to: screening failure (38), failure to down regulate (3), or other reasons (3).
