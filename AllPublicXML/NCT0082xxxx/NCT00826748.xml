  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of inhaled beclomethasone (an inhaled
      corticosteroid) on the pattern of the lung airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages gene
      expression of healthy smokers. We hypothesize that the administration of beclomethasone will
      result in reversibility of some of the airway epithelium and alveolar macrophage gene
      expression changes induced by cigarette smoking.

      The study will involve healthy smokers and non smokers enrolled in IRB approved protocol
      #0005004439 entitled &quot;Evaluation of the Lungs of Normal (Smokers, Ex-smokers, Non-Smokers)
      Individuals with Segmental Bronchopulmonary Lung Lavage, Bronchial Brushing, and Bronchial
      Wall Biopsy&quot;. They will be invited to participate in this protocol only if they meet the
      additional inclusion/exclusion criteria of this protocol (see inclusion/exclusion criteria,
      section A6). The Principal Investigator, Ann E. Tilley, MD or authorized representative will
      obtain consent from individuals for this study. Once enrolled, smokers will be randomized to
      either the treated smoker group [320 micrograms (mcg) of beclomethasone; 2 puffs twice a day
      (each puff delivers 80 mcg) for 7 days] or non-treated group. Beclomethasone is available as
      a metered dose inhaler [QVAR(TEVA Pharmaceuticals)] delivering 80 micrograms (mcg) of
      beclomethasone per one puff. We will be using QVAR HFA (TEVA Pharmaceuticals), which delivers
      80 mcg per puff. QVAR will be purchased by the Department of Genetic Medicine. It will be
      dispensed as appropriate to each research subject recruited in the trial at the Department of
      Genetic Medicine at 1305 York Ave YAB-13th floor, New York, NY 10021 (a facility of Weill
      Medical College). It will be stored at The Arthur &amp; Rochelle Belfer Gene Therapy Core
      Facility located at 515 E. 71st St., S901, New York, NY 10021 under the supervision of
      Stephen Kaminksy, PhD, Co-Director of the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice). Each study
      individual will receive 1 package of the study medication which consists of 1 canister of
      QVAR 80 MDI (metered dose inhaler). Non-smokers, defined as individuals who have never
      smoked, will act as control like the Non-Treated Smoker group and receive no treatment. For
      all subjects, the screening, baseline bronchoscopy, and the bronchoscopies on Days 7±3 and
      14±3 tests will be performed as part of IRB approved protocol #0005004439. No additional
      bronchoscopies will be performed under the current protocol.

    <measure>Number of Participants With A Significant Change in Gene Expression in the Airway Epithelium and Alveolar Macrophages at Days 7 and 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Analysis will be done on samples collected on Day 7 and Day 14 following initiation of therapy compared to baseline values obtained on the day prior to initiation of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study endpoint is a change in the gene expression in the airway epithelium or alveolar macrophages of healthy smokers following treatment with beclomethasone. Airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages are processed to yield high quality RNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) is transcribed from the RNA in vitro and the product is hybridized onto gene microarray chips. The chip is then scanned and the image analyzed using the Affymetrix Microarray suite version 5 (MAS5) algorithm. Using GeneSpring software the data is normalized and differential expression is determined by fold change (up or down regulation) of the individual genes by comparing the geometric mean expression value from the airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages obtained from Day 7 and Day 14 following initiation of therapy to baseline values.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With A Significant Change in Gene Expression in the Airway Epithelium and Alveolar Macrophages at Days 7 and 14</title>
        <description>The primary study endpoint is a change in the gene expression in the airway epithelium or alveolar macrophages of healthy smokers following treatment with beclomethasone. Airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages are processed to yield high quality RNA. Complementary DNA (cDNA) is transcribed from the RNA in vitro and the product is hybridized onto gene microarray chips. The chip is then scanned and the image analyzed using the Affymetrix Microarray suite version 5 (MAS5) algorithm. Using GeneSpring software the data is normalized and differential expression is determined by fold change (up or down regulation) of the individual genes by comparing the geometric mean expression value from the airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages obtained from Day 7 and Day 14 following initiation of therapy to baseline values.</description>
        <time_frame>Analysis will be done on samples collected on Day 7 and Day 14 following initiation of therapy compared to baseline values obtained on the day prior to initiation of treatment.</time_frame>
        <population>Subjects underwent bronchoscopy procedure at 7 and 14 days after baseline to collect samples including small airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages.</population>
