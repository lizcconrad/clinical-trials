      The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety in use of the drug Heparin
      Sodium, produced by Cristália Laboratory, compared drug Liquemine ®, manufactured by Roche
      Laboratory, and secondary purpose was to evaluate the non-inferiority clinical testing of the
      product on the product comparator and pharmacodynamic effect, as evidenced by analyzing the
      parameters and TTPA Anti-Xa in patients with chronic renal failure in treatment of
      hemodialysis.
