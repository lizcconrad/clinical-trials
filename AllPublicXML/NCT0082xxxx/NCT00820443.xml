    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Ceramic on Metal Total Hip
      when compared to a TRANSCEND® historical control group of patients with primary total hip
      replacement.

    <textblock>
      This investigational device study is a non-randomized, non-inferiority, multi-center,
      historically controlled study. The primary objective will be evaluated at the primary
      endpoint (24 months) by the primary efficacy and safety measures that define patient success.
      The proportion of patient success will determine whether the primary objective has been met
      (study success).

      The investigational device will be compared to a historical control comprised of patients
      from the TRANSCEND® Ceramic on Ceramic IDE study. This comparison will be made using all
      primary and secondary measures. However, only primary measures will be used to determine
      study success.

    <measure>Primary Endpoint/Measures: Success at 24 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Month</time_frame>
    <description>The patient success definition is measured at the 24 month interval by the following:
Harris Hip Score (HHS) of &gt; 80 • &lt; 2mm radiolucency (width) in any Gruen (stem) or DeLee/Charnley (cup) zone and no more than mild pain.
No revision or removal of any part of the device for aseptic reasons prior to or on day 730 following the index surgical procedure.
A patient must meet all three criteria in the definition to be considered a success. A patient who does not meet all three criteria will be deemed a failure.
The Harris hip score, is used to measure the outcome of total hip arthroplasty. Eight sections on the HIP are rated by the patient: pain, distance walked, activities, public transportation, support, limp, stairs and sitting. Total scores are out of 100 and grouped as follows: 90 - 100 Excellent,80 - 90 Good,70 - 79 Fair,60 - 69 Poor.&lt; 60 Failed.Any score above 60 is acceptable, although the higher the score, the better the patient's overall adjustment after the surgery</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>UCLA: University of California LosAngeles Activity Score
UCLA score is a validated scoring system for hip replacement outcome, The single item UCLA scale asks patients to rate their activity level from 1 to 10, with 1 defined as &quot;no physical activity&quot; and 10 defined as &quot;regular participation in impact sports&quot;. The score is the higher the better.</description>

    <measure>WOMAC Raw Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations (range is 0-96).</description>

    <measure>Metal Ion Analysis (Unilateral Only):Serum Cobalt</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serum cobalt and chromium are recommended as the optimal tests for evaluation of joint implant wear, patients with CoM implants have elevated serum chromium and cobalt concentrations. Clinically important implant wear is indicated when serum chromium exceeds 15 ng/mL and cobalt exceeds 10 ng/mL; these symptomatic patients are likely to have significant implant deterioration. serum cobalt and chromium are highest in the first year after implant. In subsequent years, and after run-in wear (initial wear of a hip implant that produces the greatest amount of metal ion release), cobalt and chromium concentrations decline, then reach steady state around 3 years after implant.</description>

        <title>Primary Endpoint/Measures: Success at 24 Months</title>
        <description>The patient success definition is measured at the 24 month interval by the following:
Harris Hip Score (HHS) of &gt; 80 • &lt; 2mm radiolucency (width) in any Gruen (stem) or DeLee/Charnley (cup) zone and no more than mild pain.
No revision or removal of any part of the device for aseptic reasons prior to or on day 730 following the index surgical procedure.
A patient must meet all three criteria in the definition to be considered a success. A patient who does not meet all three criteria will be deemed a failure.
The Harris hip score, is used to measure the outcome of total hip arthroplasty. Eight sections on the HIP are rated by the patient: pain, distance walked, activities, public transportation, support, limp, stairs and sitting. Total scores are out of 100 and grouped as follows: 90 - 100 Excellent,80 - 90 Good,70 - 79 Fair,60 - 69 Poor.&lt; 60 Failed.Any score above 60 is acceptable, although the higher the score, the better the patient's overall adjustment after the surgery</description>

        <population>Patients with Harris Hip Score (HHS) of &gt; 80 Because there isn't complete radiographic data,the composite primary outcome is not analyzed at 24 month as in protocol. Only the number of patients who has HHS score greater that 80 is entered.Due to missing values/assessments/data, not all of the participants were evaluated at 24 months, only 197.</population>

        <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is a widely used, proprietary set of standardized questionnaires used by health professionals to evaluate the condition of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, including pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0–20), two for stiffness (score range 0–8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0–68). Physical functioning questions cover everyday activities such as stair use, standing up from a sitting or lying position, standing, bending, walking, getting in and out of a car, shopping, putting on or taking off socks, lying in bed, getting in or out of a bath, sitting, and heavy and light household duties Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations (range is 0-96).</description>

        <title>Metal Ion Analysis (Unilateral Only):Serum Cobalt</title>
        <description>Serum cobalt and chromium are recommended as the optimal tests for evaluation of joint implant wear, patients with CoM implants have elevated serum chromium and cobalt concentrations. Clinically important implant wear is indicated when serum chromium exceeds 15 ng/mL and cobalt exceeds 10 ng/mL; these symptomatic patients are likely to have significant implant deterioration. serum cobalt and chromium are highest in the first year after implant. In subsequent years, and after run-in wear (initial wear of a hip implant that produces the greatest amount of metal ion release), cobalt and chromium concentrations decline, then reach steady state around 3 years after implant.</description>
