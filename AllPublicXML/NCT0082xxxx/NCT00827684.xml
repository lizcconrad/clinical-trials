      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of temsirolimus as a
      single drug, and of temsirolimus in combination with irinotecan in chemotherapy resistant
      patients with KRAS mutated colorectal cancer.

    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy resistance is a major challenge in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), and EGFR
      inhibitors have been introduced as 3rd line treatment to chemotherapy refractory patients.
      However, it has recently been established that response to treatment with irinotecan and
      cetuximab is confined to patients with wtKRAS tumors. Therefore, downstream targets are being
      proposed as potential inhibitors of the EGFR signalling in tumours with KRAS mutations. mTOR
      is a central intracellular signalling molecule and a rational approach for potential
      reversion of chemotherapy resistance in these patients.

      Preclinical data suggest that different solid tumors could respond to mTOR inhibitors and
      report on enhanced antitumor activity in combination with different traditional cytostatic
      drugs. Furthermore recent preclinical data suggest that mTOR inhibition may induce tumor
      reduction in colon cancer xenographs. Temsirolimus (CCI-779) has been widely investigated in
      different clinical settings and is presently registered for treatment of renal cell
      carcinomas. Furthermore, is has recently shown response in metastatic breast cancer patients,
      but at present there are no clinical data on efficacy or safety in metastatic colorectal
      cancer patients.

      The present study aims at investigating the safety and efficacy of monotherapy temsirolimus
      and a combination of temsirolimus and irinotecan in chemotherapy resistant, KRAS mutated
      colorectal adenocarcinomas.
