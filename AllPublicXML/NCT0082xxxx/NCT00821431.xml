    <textblock>
      A prospective, Phase II, stratified, randomized study to compare the safety, ulcer healing,
      patient compliance (concordance) and resource utilisation of a compression device with IPC
      mode to a Class 3(c) UK standard graduated compression regime (4- layer system) on subjects
      with venous leg ulcers.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the compression device regime were instructed to wear the compression device for all wakings hours for 12 weeks. The device was applied at the following pressures:
Foot 40 mmHg, ankle 40 mmHg, mid-calf 30 mmHg, upper cuff 20 mmHg.
Subjects were instructed to wear the Intermittent Pneumatic Compression for 2 hours per day.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomised to the 4-layer compression bandage regime, Profore, were to wear the bandage system for 24 hours a day and bandage applications/dressing changes were to be performed by a trained health care professional. Four different sizes of Profore were available and size selection was based on measurement of the ankle circumference of the subject on the index leg. Profore was to be used according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer described in their package insert.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects over 18 years, willing and able to provide written informed consent

          -  Subjects able to wear the compression device and the comparative regime and follow the
             requirements of the clinical investigation plan

          -  Subjects who had an ankle to brachial pressure index (ABPI) of 0.8 or greater

          -  Subjects who had a chronic venous leg ulcer (i.e. CEAP classification of C6 1) 2 cm2

             3 months

          -  Subjects who exhibited any other medical condition which, according to the
             Investigator, justified the subject's exclusion from the study

             *Subjects who had an index venous leg ulcer greater in size than 15cm in any one
             dimension

          -  Amendment #3 dated 5th October 2007:

               -  Deletion of exclusion criterion 'Subjects with more than one ulcer on the test

            <description>The electrical compression device is operated from battery or a main adaptor. It is based upon the use of inflatable pneumatic cuffs that apply controlled compression to the foot, ankle and calf.
Compression Device: Subjects randomized to the compression device regime were instructed to wear the compression device for all wakings hours for 12 weeks. The device was applied at the following pressures:
Foot 40 mmHg, ankle 40 mmHg, mid-calf 30 mmHg, upper cuff 20 mmHg.
Subjects were instructed to wear the Intermittent Pneumatic Compression for 2 hours per day.</description>

This is a four-layer system that can be purchased either separately or as a package: a wound contact layer (Knitted viscose), a sub-compression wadding bandage, two layers of elastane bandage plus a top cohesive layer.
Profore: Subjects randomised to the 4-layer compression bandage regime, Profore, were to wear the bandage system for 24 hours a day and bandage applications/dressing changes were to be performed by a trained health care professional. Four different sizes of Profore were available and size selection was based on measurement of the ankle circumference of the subject on the index leg. Profore was to be used according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer described in their package insert.</description>
