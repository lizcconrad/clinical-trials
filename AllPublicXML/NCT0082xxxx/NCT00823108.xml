      The purpose of this study is to determine if a glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) solution can
      be safely administered to patients with septic shock. GIK has been used in thousands of
      critically ill patients in research studies with very few safety concerns. However, there is
      a lack of data in regards to patients with septic shock. There are many reasons to believe
      that GIK would be beneficial in sepsis, including improving heart function and decreasing
      inflammation. This study will administer intravenous GIK for 12 hours continuously and
      monitor 10 subjects for 24 hours. A control arm will be used and 10 patients will receive the
      same monitoring but will not receive GIK.
