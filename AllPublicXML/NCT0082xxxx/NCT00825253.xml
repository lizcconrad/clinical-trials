    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the
      pharmacodynamics (i.e. the glucose-lowering effect of the study medication over the entire
      observation phase from the time of administration and the efficacy period) and the
      pharmacokinetics (i.e. amount of the study insulin that can be determined in the blood) of a
      treatment with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BiAsp 30) administered once, twice or thrice daily
      and biphasic human insulin 30 administered once daily in type 2 diabetic subjects

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities. (Trial-related
             activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during normal
             management of the subject)

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed for at least 12 months prior to screening

          -  HbA1c value between 7% and 10.5% (both inclusive) at screening

          -  Any insulin treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening

          -  Body mass index (BMI): 25 - 40 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any oral antidiabetic agent within the past 6 months

          -  Active proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring treatment within 6 months
             prior to screening

          -  Cardiac disease: NYHA class III or IV chronic heart failure (CHF), unstable angina,
             and/or any myocardial infarction (treated or untreated) within 6 months prior to
             screening

             laboratory's upper reference limit)

          -  Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.6 mg/dL for males;
             greater than or equal to

          -  Recurrent hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemic unawareness

          -  Anaemia (haemoglobin less than 13.0 mg/dL in males and less than 12.0 mg/dL in
             females) (WHO criteria)

          -  Use of any systemic or topical medications (prescribed or non-prescribed) which may
             alter glucose metabolism (other than insulin products), including but not limited to:
             systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids, non-selective beta-blockers

          -  History of substance (e.g. drugs, alcohol) abuse or a positive result in the urine
             drug/alcohol screen or consumption of more than 14 units (women) or 21 units (men) of
             alcohol per week (One unit of alcohol equals about 250 mL of beer or lager, one glass
             of wine, or 20 mL spirits)

          -  Smoking of more than 20 cigarettes per day and inability to refrain from smoking
             during the in-house period

          -  Known hepatitis or positive serological tests for the hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibodies or HIV antibodies

          -  Uncontrolled treated/untreated hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than or
             equal to 160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mmHg)
