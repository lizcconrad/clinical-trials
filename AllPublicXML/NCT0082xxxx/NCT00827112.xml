  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to examine if the novel treatment regimen maraviroc plus boosted
      atazanavir can be expected to be safe and efficacious in treatment naive HIV infected
      patients. Based on the results from this study, a confirmatory phase 3 study may be
      conducted.

    <description>Viral tropism was determined using the trofile assay with enhanced sensitivity for participants with HIV-1 RNA greater than equal to 1000 copies/mL. The enhanced trofile assay had the sensitivity to detect 100 percent of spiked samples when C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 {CXCR4} [X4]-using HIV-1 RNA represented 0.3 percent of the total viral population.</description>
