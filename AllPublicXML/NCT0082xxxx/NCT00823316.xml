      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROMOSTEM (human
      umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells) at a dose of 1 and 5x1,000,000 hMSC/kg
      in subject for the promotion of an engraftment and prevention of graft rejection and
      Graft-Versus-Host Disease after unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for
      children with acute leukemia.

      -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a procedure in which progenitor cells
           capable of reconstituting normal bone marrow function are administered to a patient.
           This procedure has been used to treat adults and children with life-threatening
           hematological malignancies and congenital immunodeficiency disorders.

        -  In HSCT, therapeutic goal is an elimination of disease and enrichment of regenerating
           capacity to achieve engraftments resulting in continued generation of functional blood
           elements from the engrafted living cells. Transplantation of unrelated hematopoietic
           stem cells originating either from adult bone marrow or from peripheral blood often
           leads to graft-versus host-disease (GvHD), opportunistic infections and graft failure
           after transplantation.

        -  In HSCT, MSC have been used as a therapy for GvHD and other complications. The aim of
           MSC infusions in HSCT is to use the cells' immunomodulatory effects to promote
           engraftment and to reduce the immunological reactions giving rise to GvHD.

        -  There is a growing interest in co-transplantation of MSC and HSC to improve the donor
           outcome in the unrelated HSCT condition.
