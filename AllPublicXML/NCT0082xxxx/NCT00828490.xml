      The purpose of the Utah ePRM (electronic Pharmacotherapy Risk Management) project is to
      improve quality and safety of medication use while simultaneously controlling costs and
      detecting fraud and abuse.

      The ePRM project has two objectives:

        1. Refine and implement a computerized surveillance and trigger tool to support medication
           therapy and risk management services. The ePRM tool will be used to (1) identify
           potential drug-therapy problems, which include quality, safety and cost-related
           problems; (2) select patients and providers for in-depth clinical reviews and possibly
           direct intervention (i.e., letter, phone call, Medication Therapy Management Services
           (MTMS), or Academic Detailing); (3) identify potential fraud and diversion of controlled
           substances; and (4) track patterns of medication use and evaluate ePRM performance,
           identify improvements, and direct policy change.

        2. Conduct innovative multi-pronged interventions that are guided by the ePRM trigger tool.
           Clinical areas chosen for review include diabetes therapy, hypertension, asthma,
           antipsychotic therapy, pain management (opioid narcotics and anticonvulsants) and
           anticoagulation/antiplatelet drugs. Interventions in these areas will address potential
           under and overuse, or patient safety concerns. Clinical pharmacists and physicians will
           implement five types of inter-related interventions: a) provider level reviews, which
           includes prescribers' profiling and feedback for outlier prescribers; b) patient level
           reviews and letters to prescribers for high-risk patients; c) phone consultation and
           Academic Detailing with outlier prescribers; d) MTMS; and e) detecting and pursuing
           suspected fraud and abuse cases.
