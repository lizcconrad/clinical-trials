      This study is intended to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment of de novo or
      restenotic lesions of the above-the-knee femoropopliteal artery using the Zilver® Flex™
      Vascular Stent which has received the CE mark for commercial use. The study is designed as a
      single arm non-randomized post-approval study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are at least 18 years old and have at least 1 stenotic atherosclerotic
             lesion of the above-the-knee femoropopliteal artery may be considered for enrollment.

          -  To be enrolled in the study, the lesion must be the appropriate size and and no prior
             stent in the target vessel may be present.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is &lt; 18 years of age.

          -  Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Patient is simultaneously participating in an investigational drug or device study.
             The patient must have completed the follow-up phase for the primary endpoint of any
             previous study at least 30 days prior to enrollment in this study.

          -  Patient has had previous stenting of the target vessel.

          -  Patient has a medical condition or disorder that would limit life expectancy to less
             than 1 year or that may cause noncompliance with the protocol or confound the data
             analysis.

          -  Patient in whom antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated.

          -  Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions.

          -  Patient has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, antiplatelet
             medication, contrast dye, or nitinol that, in the opinion of the investigator, cannot
             be adequately premedicated.
