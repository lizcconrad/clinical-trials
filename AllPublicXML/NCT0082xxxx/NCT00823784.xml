  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemorrhoids have, in literature, extremely high ranges of prevalence, 4,4% to 36% and there
      is a debate on the best treatment for III degree hemorrhoids. The Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy is
      indicated in grade III haemorrhoids due to its advantages vs. other techniques in pain
      reduction and time before resume of normal activity. The new technique of Doppler guided
      trans-anal arterial ligation (THD) appear to be another important therapeutic tool thanks to
      its scarce complications, the minimally invasive procedure and efficacy of the short term
      results. The rationale of the two surgical techniques is different: in fact, the Stapled
      Hemorrhoidopexy is based on the hypothesis that the mucosal and sub/mucosal resection and
      stapling can cure the prolapse, etiologic factor of haemorrhoids; on the other hand, the
      interruption of the arterial inflow of hemorrhoids by THD reduces hemorrhoidal tissue.&quot; Aim
      of this study is to compare 2 techniques: The doppler guided transanal haemorrhoidal
      dearterialisation with the THD device and the stapled Haemorrhoidopexy (according to Longo)
      for III degree (Goligher) haemorrhoid, not regarding the number of prolapsed piles

      After informed consent 284 patients with III degree hemorrhoids from 10 colorectal units will
      be randomized into two groups: stapler vs doppler guided transanal hemorrhoidal
      dearterialisation with the THD device.The early and long term outcome, as well as other
      secondary outcomes (costs, return to work and degree of satisfaction) will be recorded and
      compared.
