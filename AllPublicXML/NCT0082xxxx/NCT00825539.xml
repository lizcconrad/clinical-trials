  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will assess the enhancement of task-related brain activation (BOLD
      response) in key brain areas in schizophrenia during the performance of working memory,
      episodic memory and visual activation tasks as measured by functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) in people with schizophrenia. Part 2 of the study will assess the safety and
      tolerability of multiple doses of AQW051 in people with schizophrenia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV/DSM IV TR)

          2. Subjects will be currently treated with the stable regimen of one or more of the
             following second generation antipsychotics: olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone,
             quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole.

          3. Subjects will meet the following symptom criteria:

               -  Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Hallucinatory Behavior or Unusual Thought
                  Content item scores less than or equal to 5

               -  BPRS Conceptual Disorganization item score less than or equal to 4

               -  Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) total score less than or equal to 6

               -  Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) total score less than or equal to 10

          4. Subjects will meet the following cognitive performance criteria:

               -  Maximum performance level: Performance below 1.0 SD from perfect performance on
                  the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) total (31 or less),

               -  Minimum performance level: subject must be able to validly complete the fMRI
                  cognitive paradigms

               -  WTAR: 5th grade reading level assessment

          5. Subjects must be symptomatically stable and not suffer from an acute exacerbation of
             their psychosis

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using two acceptable methods of
             contraception, (e.g., intra-uterine device plus condom, spermicidal gel plus condom,
             diaphragm plus condom, etc.), from the time of screening and for the duration of the
             study, through study completion. Pregnancy tests are required of all female subjects
             regardless of reported sterilization.

             When performed at screening and practice visit, the result of this test must be
             received before the subject may be dosed.

          7. Male subjects must be using two acceptable methods of contraception, (e.g.,
             spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the studyuntil the Study
             Completion visit.

          8. Subject must have sufficiently stable overall health, as determined by the
             Investigator. The regular intake of concomitant drugs will be allowed, if the patient
             is on stable treatment for at least 3 months prior to study enrollment and the
             concomitant drug does not belong to the list of medication that are not allowed
             according to Appendix 3. If the patient takes more than one concomitant medication, it
             is at the Investigator's discretion to decide about the patient's eligibility,
             depending on the nature of the concomitant medications and the patient's overall
             health.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Current treatment with conventional antipsychotics (e.g. fluphenazine, haloperidol) or
             clozapine

          2. Current treatment with an anticholinergic or other agent known to adversely interfere
             with the cholinergic system

          3. Subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of substance abuse (other than nicotine) within the
             last month.

          4. Subjects with a history of significant head injury/trauma, as defined by:

               -  Loss of consciousness (LOC) for more than 1 hour

               -  Recurring seizures resulting from the head injury

               -  Clear cognitive sequelae of the injury

               -  Cognitive rehabilitation following the injury

          5. Subjects with a medical or neurological disorder or treatment for such disorder that
             could interfere with the study medication of the assessment of the subject

          6. Use of certain concomitant medication

        No grapefruit or grapefruit juice is to be consumed for 14 days prior to dosing until 7
        days following the last dose.
