    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of elesclomol sodium at
      escalating doses (ultimately identifying the maximum tolerated dose). This study will also
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of elesclomol and evaluate its anti-tumor activity in
      advanced solid tumors that are metastatic and unresectable.
