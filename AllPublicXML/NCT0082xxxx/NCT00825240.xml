      The overall goal of this study is to explore colorectal cancer patients' concerns and
      interest about their health and behavior changes post treatment. Investigators will conduct
      formative research, which includes qualitative interviews, to assess the issues that cancer
      survivors are willing to work on as they transition out of active treatment.

      The specific aims are as follows:

      Aim 1: Use qualitative interview methods to describe the taxonomy of domains health promotion
      and illness prevention behavior changes for which colorectal cancer survivors need new
      information, skills training and support.

      Aim 2: Explore colorectal cancer patients' perceptions of their post treatment functional
      status.

      Aim 3: Explore the impact of cancer, treatment, and co-morbidities on colorectal cancer
      patients' health goals and functional status.
