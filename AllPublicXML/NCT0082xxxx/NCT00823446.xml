      The purpose of this study is to perform a preliminary evaluation of the safety of Revera
      Wound Care when topically applied to venous leg ulcers for 8 weeks of treatment.

      This evaluation will be done through tabulations of adverse events (AE), review of complete
      blood counts (CBC) with differential and platelet, and measuring wound healing rate.

      The secondary purpose of the study is a preliminary evaluation of an increase in the healing
      rate of venous leg ulcers treated with Revera Wound Care.

      This evaluation will be done through measuring wound healing rate (which is also being used
      to evaluate safety) and complete wound healing.
