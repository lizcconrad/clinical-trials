  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, pilot study to determine the safety and efficacy of
      acupuncture as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment compared to pharmacological
      intervention alone for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain related to aromatase inhibitors
      (AI) in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Twenty participants (20 in each arm) will be
      enrolled at the Breast Oncology clinic at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). Patients
      in the treatment arm will receive acupuncture administered twice weekly for six weeks and
      will be allowed to take pain medication as necessary. The control patients will initially
      receive pain medication alone, then will cross-over to the acupuncture arm after six weeks.
      The investigators hypothesize that acupuncture will reduce AI induced joint symptoms.

      The study will enroll a total of 40 patients, half of whom will be randomized to one of the
      two arms to receive acupuncture plus pharmacological treatment (arm A) or pharmacological
      treatment alone (arm B). Joint pain will be assessed by the BPI-SF score at baseline and six
      weeks. All patients will have a baseline BPI worst pain item (#2) â‰¥3 points on a scale of
      0-10.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of acupuncture as a
      complementary therapy to pain medication for joint pain associated with aromatase inhibitors
      for breast cancer treatment. Breast cancer patients are living longer largely due to the
      benefits of hormonal therapy. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a new class of hormonal agents
      which block estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women. However, musculoskeletal pain occurs
      in up to 50% of patients treated with AIs and often does not respond to conventional pain
      medications. AI-induced joint pain interferes with patient compliance and may cause major
      disability. Therefore, safe and effective treatments are needed to alleviate AI-induced
      musculoskeletal pain.

      Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese method of medical treatment and a popular modality for
      treating musculoskeletal pain. Acupuncture involves the use of thin needles to stimulate
      specific points of the body and leads to pain control through the release of endorphin in the
      central nervous system. Clinical trials have found a benefit of acupuncture for the treatment
      of knee and back pain. Given the lack of effective treatments for AI-induced joint pain and
      the safety and efficacy of acupuncture, it is therefore reasonable to evaluate whether
      acupuncture is effective in breast cancer patients who experience musculoskeletal pain
      related to AIs.
