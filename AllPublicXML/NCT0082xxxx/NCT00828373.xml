  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic which is widely used in daily anesthesia and surgical
      practice. It has been shown that intravenous lidocaine given during an operation has
      analgesic properties. Finally intravenous lidocaine is inexpensive and easy to administer and
      safe if non-toxic doses are respected. It is likely that the use of lidocaine infusions
      during anesthesia might increase in the coming years. Neuromuscular blockers (curare like
      substances) are used in anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation and to achieve muscle
      relaxation and immobility during surgery. Rocuronium is one of the most widely used
      neuromuscular blocking agents. Local anesthetics, such as lidocaine, are known to potentiate
      the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents. In the study the investigators want to evaluate
      the effect of intravenous lidocaine during the operation on the time course of the
      rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block. A secondary aim is to evaluate intubation conditions
      (lidocaine has been shown also to improve intubation conditions) and safety.

    <description>Immediately before induction, patients will receive 0.15 ml kg-1 of the study drug as an intravenous bolus followed, after tracheal intubation, by a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.2 ml kg-1 h-1. In the Placebo group this will be physiologic saline. The infusion will be stopped after complete recovery from the neuromuscular block.</description>

In the lidocaine Arm this regimen corresponds to 1.5 mg kg-1 lidocaine bolus injection and 2 mg kg-1 h-1 lidocaine continuous infusion. The infusion will be stopped after complete recovery from the neuromuscular block.</description>
