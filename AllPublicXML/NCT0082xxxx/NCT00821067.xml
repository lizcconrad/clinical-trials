  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      D-ribose, a natural occurring pentose carbohydrate, has repeatedly shown to enhance
      high-energy phosphates and improve function following ischemia, states of congestive heart
      failure, and recently in subjects with lung disease. An initial preliminary, open label pilot
      study demonstrated a positive benefit of D-ribose in &quot;Baby-Boomer&quot; subjects aged 50 to 65
      years old complaining of persistent fatigue. The objective of this study will build on the
      previously collected data to evaluate oral D-ribose vs. dextrose (administered as a
      supplement) in relatively healthy, yet fatigued subjects with a goal of improving their state
      of fatigue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presents with complaint of fatigue with duration longer than one month

          -  Males/Females between the ages of 50 and 65 years of age

          -  No previous clinical diagnosis of pulmonary, cardiac or metabolic disorders based on
             history

          -  Capable of performing a sub-maximal incremental treadmill exercise using
             cardiopulmonary analysis methods

          -  Normal blood pressure or those with mild, untreated pre-hypertension (&gt;120/70 or &lt;
             140/90 mmHg)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not presently taking any adenine nucleotide enhancing supplements

          -  History of non-compliance in previous studies
