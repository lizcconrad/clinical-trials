      The purpose of this study is to compare early return to function in patients treated with
      closed reduction percutaneous pinning and open reduction internal fixation in displaced
      fractures of the distal radius.

      Hypothesis: Wrist range of motion, grip strength and outcome at 2-3 months after injury are
      better in patients treated with open reduction, internal fixation (ORIF) than in patients
      treated with closed reduction percutaneous pinning techniques (CRPP). In addition patients
      treated with ORIF return to work at faster rates.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or greater

          -  Patient functions independently

          -  Dorsally displaced, extra-articular fracture (Colles' fracture); or simple
             intra-articular fracture with a single split between the scaphoid and lunate facets.

          -  Isolated injury (no other injuries).

          -  One of the following criteria:

        Substantial initial displacement

          -  Greater than 20 degrees dorsal angulation of the articular surface on the lateral
             view.

          -  Greater than 100% loss of apposition.

          -  Greater than 5 millimeters of shortening by ulnar variance on the posteroanterior
             radiograph.

          -  Greater than 2 millimeters articular incongruity (step or gap).

          -  Both dorsal and volar comminution. Inadequate initial manipulative reduction

          -  Greater than 5 degrees of dorsal angulation of the articular surface on the lateral
             radiograph.

          -  Greater than 3 millimeters of radial shortening by ulnar variance on the
             posteroanterior radiograph.

          -  Greater than 2 millimeters articular incongruity.

          -  Bayonett apposition of the volar cortex.

          -  Less than 15 degrees of ulnarward inclination of the articular surface in the
             posteroanterior radiograph. Loss of reduction within 3 weeks of injury.

          -  Any of the following changes in alignment from the initial post- reduction radiographs
             qualify:

               -  5 degrees or greater loss of palmar tilt of the articular surface on the lateral
                  radiograph.

               -  2 millimeters or greater loss of radial height by ulnar variance on the
                  posteroanterior radiograph.

               -  5 degrees or greater loss of ulnarward inclination of the articular surface of
                  the distal radius on the posteroanteriorradiograph.

               -  2 millimeters or greater articular incongruity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More complex articular fractures (i.e. anything more than a simple sagittal split
             between the scaphoid and lunate facets).

          -  Volarly displaced fractures.

          -  Infirm patients.

          -  Patients that rely on others for basic functional activities.

          -  Open fractures

          -  Fractures associated with neurovascular injury.

          -  Fractures associated with major head, neurological, or visceral injuries that will
             inhibit the ability to participate in a structured exercise program.

          -  Associated musculoskeletal injuries to the same arm.
