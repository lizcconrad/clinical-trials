  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory hematologic malignancies including those who develop recurrent
      disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have a dismal
      prognosis. Historically, both regimen-related mortality and disease recurrence have been
      significant causes of treatment failure in this heavily pre-treated patient population. The
      investigators institution has utilized mismatched family member donors for these patients for
      several reasons: (1) Only 30% of patients have matched related donors available; (2)
      transplantation can be performed more rapidly since the time to unrelated donor
      trans-plantation averages 3 to 4 months; (3) the alloimmune reactivity of natural killer (NK)
      cells following haploidentical HSCT has been shown to reduce relapse rates in certain patient
      groups; and, (4) no other curative treatment options are available.

      In the present trial, the investigators propose a novel conditioning regimen using
      clofarabine in an effort to enhance cytotoxicity while simultaneously reducing regimen
      related toxicity. In this phase I trial, the goal is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of clofarabine when used in combination with melphalan and thiotepa pre-transplant.

      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine
      in combination with thiotepa and melphalan as a conditioning regimen for a haploidentical
      stem cell transplant with an engineered graft depleted of CD3+ cells. Study participants will
      children and young adults with refractory hematologic malignancies.

      Secondary objectives include the following:

        -  To describe the one-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates in
           these study participants.

        -  To determine the time to hematopoietic recovery and donor cell engraftment following
           this study treatment.

        -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse in study participants.

        -  To estimate the incidence of overall grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GVHD and the
           rate of chronic GVHD.

        -  To estimate the incidence and describe the causes of non-hematologic regimen-related
           toxicity and regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days post HSCT.

        -  To explore the biologic significance of soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, tumor
           necrosis factor (TNF), and lymphocyte reconstitution (qualitative and quantitative, V
           beta spectratyping, TREC
