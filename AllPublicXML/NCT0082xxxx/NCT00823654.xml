  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how the cancer treatment affects the ovaries. Cancer
      treatment can make it hard for a person to conceive a child in the future. It may also bring
      on early menopause. We will check blood levels of hormones that the ovaries produce. We will
      do this before, during, and after the cancer treatment. We will also ask the patient to fill
      out questionnaires about their menstrual cycle (periods) and information about your health
      and pregnancies. This may help us learn which women will be more likely to have early
      menopause.

        Patients of premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer will be recruited from the
        Breast Cancer Service at MSKCC and New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of
        Cornell University. In addition, breast cancer patients seeking consultation with a
        reproductive endocrinologist to address issues of fertility preservation prior to the start
        of therapy will be offered participation (Dr. Oktay at Yale Medicine.

        Patients of unaffected high risk premenopausal women with BRCA mutations will be recruited
        from the Breast Cancer Services especially the high risk surveillance clinics at MSKCC and
        New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell Univeristy.

             and/or hormonal therapy. If chemotherapy is planned, the regimen must be either CMF,
             anthracycline containing, or taxane containing. If hormonal therapy is planned, the
             regimen must be limited to tamoxifen. All biologics (e.g. bevacizumab, trastuzumab,
