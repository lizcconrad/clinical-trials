  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an experimental drug known as tadalafil
      given once daily can reduce the symptoms associated with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
      (straining, urinary frequency, feeling like your bladder is still full, etc.)

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IPSS Total Score is obtained by combining the scores of the responses to Question 1 through Question 7. Each question is scored from 0-5 for a total IPSS range of 0-35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model includes terms for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction and treatment-by-region interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 4 Weeks, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Impact Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPH Impact Index (BII) is a 4-item, self-administered questionnaire evaluating impact of urinary problems on overall health and activity. Total scores range from 0 to 13; higher scores represent increased perceived impact of benign prostatic hyperplasia-lower urinary tract symptoms on overall health. LS mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an ANCOVA. The model includes terms for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction and treatment-by-region interaction.</description>

LS mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an ANCOVA. The model includes terms for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction and treatment-by-region interaction.</description>

Scores range from 0 (few obstructive symptoms) to 5 (frequent obstructive symptoms), thus the 4 questions of the obstructive score range from 0 to 20. LS mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an ANCOVA. The model includes terms for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction and treatment-by-region interaction.</description>

          <title>Baseline Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Severity</title>
          <description>Baseline LUTS severity was assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The IPSS Total Score is obtained by combining the scores of the responses to 1 through 7 component questions. Each question is scored from 0-5 for an IPSS range of 0-35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. Moderate was considered an IPSS score &lt;20. Severe was considered an IPSS&gt;=20.</description>

          <description>Participants were categorized by Qmax: defined as the peak urine flow rate (measured in mL/second using standard calibrated flowmeter). Based on measurements from 305 randomized participants with a valid uroflowmetry assessment. Uroflowmetry assessments were considered valid and the data were included in statistical analyses only if the prevoid total bladder volume (assessed by ultrasound) was &gt;=150 mL to &lt;=550 mL and the volume of voided urine (Vcomp) was &gt;=125 mL.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</title>
        <description>The IPSS Total Score is obtained by combining the scores of the responses to Question 1 through Question 7. Each question is scored from 0-5 for a total IPSS range of 0-35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. Least squares (LS) mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model includes terms for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction and treatment-by-region interaction.</description>

        <description>The IPSS Total Score is obtained by combining the scores of the responses to Question 1 through Question 7. Each question is scored from 0-5 for a total IPSS range of 0-35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represent greater severity of symptoms. LS mean of change from baseline to endpoint is from an ANCOVA. The model includes terms for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction and treatment-by-region interaction.</description>
