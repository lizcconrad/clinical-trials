      The study hypothesis is that the implementation of a plan for quality improvement at the
      primary care health teams taking care of hypertensive patients, will increase the level of
      blood pressure control among those patients.

      The study is to compare the results on the hypertension control between two groups of primary
      health care teams. The intervention group will undertake a quality improvement plan for
      hypertension control, in which the following aspects will be included in the intervention:

      Specific training programme on how to diagnose hypertension , and measure blood pressure
      correctly To send feed back information to primary care health professionals about poorly
      controlled hypertensive patients An audit will be performed, every 6 months, to see the
      adhesion to the recommended clinical guidelines , and the information will be diffused among
      the participant primary health care professionals Each participant primary health care team
      will have a designated reference person, that will provide support on any doubts on the
      programme implementation.

      The non intervention group will follow hypertensive patients following the same clinical
      practice guide as the intervention group, with no intervention on the primary health care
      professionals
