  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 1, non-randomised, non-controlled trial, carried out in two
      centres on patients with advanced cancer expressing EGFR. Primary objective is the
      determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of the
      combination of intravenous Cetuximab and oral Gefitinib.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 36 and 66 patients will be enrolled depending on the number of dose levels which can
      be completed. Patients will have histologically confirmed EFGR-expressing solid malignant
      tumours (colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and NSCLC), which did not respond to
      standard therapy or for which no suitable therapy exists.
