  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the treatment of coronary heart disease which is the major cause of heart attack, direct
      mechanical treatment with catheters such as the coronary angiography, coronary balloon
      intervention and stenting intervention are the mainstay of therapy in recent years. In that
      procedures, the investigators should use the contrast media, and it may cause kidney toxicity
      especially in the patients with underlying kidney disease and decreased kidney function. The
      investigators intended to find out which contrast agent has less kidney toxicity in the
      catheter based treatment of coronary arterial diseases in patients with underlying decreased
      kidney function

  <detailed_description>

      Iodixanol, a nonionic, dimeric, iso-osmolar contrast medium (IOCM), may be less nephrotoxic
      than nonionic, monomeric, low-osmolar contrast media (LOCMs) in high-risk patients. We
      compared the nephrotoxicity of iodixanol with that of iopromide, an nonionic, monomeric LOCM,
      in patients with renal impairment.
