  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to investigate the effect of anaesthesia, on the ability to maintain
      upright posture immediately after surgery in mamma cancer patients.

      The investigators hypothesis is, that a standard anaesthesia does not effect the ability to
      maintain upright posture right after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known, that patients undergoing major surgery have problems maintaining upright posture
      after major surgery. This can be due to fall in bloodpressure, with symptoms like dizziness,
      nausea/vomiting and fainting.

      With this investigation, we want to prove that anaesthesia is not the decisive factor, in
      patients ability to maintain upright posture after surgery.
