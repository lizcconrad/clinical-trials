  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, phase Ib study will assess the safety and efficacy of
      obinutuzumab given in combination with FC (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) or CHOP
      (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) or bendamustine induction
      chemotherapy in participants with Cluster of Differentiation (CD) 20+ B-cell Follicular
      Lymphoma (FL). Participants with complete response or partial response after induction
      therapy may receive maintenance therapy every 3 months for 2 years or until disease
      progression, whichever comes first. All participants in the induction period of the study
      will have a safety follow-up visit 28 days after completing the last dose of obinutuzumab +
      chemotherapy, and will be followed for at least 2 years, unless they are being treated in
      maintenance or discontinue from the study prior to this time point. Participants who
      complete/discontinue maintenance therapy will also be followed for a period of 2 years after
      receiving the last dose of obinutuzumab or until progression/new antilymphoma treatment.
