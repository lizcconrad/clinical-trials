  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examined the effects of adding the sleep aid eszopiclone to Lexapro on mood and
      levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate, glutamine, and GABA in women with depression,
      anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, the objective was to determine the role of glutamate,
      glutamine, and GABA in mediating the response the to the combined treatment. The hypothesis
      was that levels of glutamine and glutamate will be increased in women receiving eszopiclone
      compared to those receiving placebo. The antidepressant effect of the medication combination
      and its effect on sleep status was also assessed.

    <measure>Change in Anterior Cingulate Cortex Glutamine From Baseline to Week 1.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Glutamine levels were measured by single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In order to normalize the data, the glutamine values were expressed as a ratio to levels of creatine, since creatine levels are not expected to vary significantly.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Glutamine levels were measured by single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the left thalamus. In order to normalize the data, the glutamine values were expressed as a ratio to levels of creatine, since creatine levels are not expected to vary significantly.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score From Baseline to Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is a 21 item scale that assesses symptoms of depression with items rated on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2. The total score range is 0 to 65. A score of 7 or lower is generally considered to be an absence of depressive symptoms. A score of 18 was considered to be the cut-off for enrollment in this study, as this indicates clinically significant depression. A higher score represents greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale Score From Baseline to Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is a 14 item ordinal scale that assesses symptoms of anxiety with ratings from 0-4. The score range is 0 to 56, with a higher score indicating higher levels of anxiety. A score of 15 was designated as the cut-off for enrollment in the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index Score From Baseline to Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Insomnia Severity Index is a 7 item scale that assesses difficulty sleeping and effect on quality of life with item scores from 0-4. The total score range is 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating higher levels of impairment and distress.</description>

        <title>Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score From Baseline to Week 10</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale is a 21 item scale that assesses symptoms of depression with items rated on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2. The total score range is 0 to 65. A score of 7 or lower is generally considered to be an absence of depressive symptoms. A score of 18 was considered to be the cut-off for enrollment in this study, as this indicates clinically significant depression. A higher score represents greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Withdrawal of support by the funding sponsor due to other priorities resulted in a very small sample size with a small placebo group. Participant withdrawal and unusable data explains discrepancies in subject numbers in some analyses.</limitations_and_caveats>
