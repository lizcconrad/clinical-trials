      Primary objective: To examine whether the switch to paliperidone ER from risperidone improves
      cognitive function in stabilized patients with schizophrenia.

      Secondary objectives: To compare the general clinical outcomes (efficacy and safety) after
      switching to paliperidone ER from risperidone

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, randomized, parallel-group, open labeled, flexible-dose study. The
      patients will be randomized to the risperidone-continuation group in which they continue to
      receive risperidone, or to the paliperidone-switch group in which they are switched from
      risperidone to paliperidone. In the paliperidone-switch group, risperidone will be tapered
      off during the first 4 weeks of the study, while paliperidone is titrated simultaneously. The
      doses of both drugs will be adjusted according to the clinical judgment of each research
      psychiatrist, within 6 mg/day of risperidone and 12 mg/day of paliperidone.
