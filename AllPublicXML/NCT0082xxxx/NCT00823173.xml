  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ESBA105, a topically applied TNF-alpha
      inhibitor, is safe and clinically active when applied to the eye of patients suffering from
      acute anterior uveitis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute anterior uveitis (AAU) is a common, recurrent disease characterized by inflammation of
      the iris and ciliary body. Though usually effectively treated by topical corticosteroids,
      novel treatment modalities are required to overcome the limitations and adverse effect
      problems associated with the use of corticosteroids. TNF-alpha has been recognized as a
      central disease mediator in AAU, as shown by preclinical models and clinical data with
      systemically applied TNF-alpha inhibitors.

      ESBA105 is a topically applied TNF-alpha inhibitor that is characterized by efficient
      penetration into the eye resulting in high intraocular drug levels. A recently completed
      Phase I trial confirmed that safety and tolerability of topical ESBA105 in healthy
      individuals is excellent and systemic exposure is low.

      In this pilot trial, the safety, local tolerability and clinical activity of topical ESBA105
      in the treatment of patients with acute anterior uveitis shall be explored.

          -  Start of the typical first symptoms of the current attack, defined as the point in
             time when the patient felt the first sensation of the attack, within the last 72 hours
             before initiation of treatment with the study medication.
