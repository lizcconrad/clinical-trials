  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to generate a preliminary analysis of this novel therapeutic
      approach and laboratory studies for patients with recurrent or refractory CLL. Further, this
      pilot trial will demonstrate the feasibility of the translational science methods proposed
      for this new collaboration of investigators. The investigators hypothesize that patients with
      relapsed CLL are recruitable to this study, that the methods for measuring simvastatin
      concentration and target protein translation are feasible, and that the investigators can
      efficiently apply the laboratory research methods to patient blood samples before and after
      patients have taken the study medication.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligibility Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed chronic lymphocytic
             leukemia (CLL). Criteria for diagnosis are as per the WHO classification of
             hematologic tumors (Jaffe 2001). As per the 1996 NCI guidelines for CLL &quot;[second-line
             or later] treatment of CLL is generally palliative in intent; therefore, patients who
             have relapsed may be followed without therapy until they experience disease-related
             symptoms or progressive disease, with deterioration of blood counts, discomfort from
             lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent infections, or associated autoimmune
             disorders&quot; (Cheson 1996).

          -  Age &gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of high-dose simvastatin in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from
             this study.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

          -  ECOG performance status #2 or better.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits unless resulting from
                  documented hemolysis

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine ≤ 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal OR

               -  creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal

               -  Creatine phosphokinase ≤ 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Patients with active infections requiring systemic antibiotics should be excluded
             until resolution of infection

          -  The effects simvastatin on the developing human fetus at the studied therapeutic dose
             are unknown. For this reason and because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may be
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain or nervous system disease should be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to simvastatin.

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP3A4 are ineligible. Lists including medications and substances known or with the
             potential to interact with the CYP3A4 isoenzymes are provided in the appendix.

          -  Patients may not take other anti-cholesterol treatments during this study. Patients
             who were previously taking anti-cholesterol treatment prior to study entry must be off
             the anti-cholesterol medications for 14 days before enrolling on this trial.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, diarrhea, myopathy, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are a
             drug class with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with simvastatin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with simvastatin.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with simvastatin.
