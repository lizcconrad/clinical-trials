  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment,
      specifically, reflex mediated calf muscle pump stimulation has the potential to significantly
      reduce the number and magnitude of hypotensive episodes thus enhancing the effectiveness of
      the dialysis process. Fewer hemodialysis complications during the patient's hemodialysis
      treatment, would allow treatment sessions to continue to the prescribed volume removal, with
      much reduced patient recovery time, and the costs associated with this recovery.

      Recruit individuals who consistently miss their dialysis goal. Maintain the goal over a six
      week period of time. Utilize exogenous calf muscle pump stimulation during each dialysis
      session to enhance fluid return from the lower limbs with the objective of assisting the
      patient in reaching ultrafiltration goal.

      Track number of hypotensive events during dialysis, as well as goal success.
