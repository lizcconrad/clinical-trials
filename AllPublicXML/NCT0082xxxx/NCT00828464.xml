  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted in order to obtain safety, efficacy and tolerability data for
      Clobetasol propionate foam in the treatment of chronic dermatitis. The subjects must have
      mild to moderate disease based on the Investigator's assessment at baseline.
