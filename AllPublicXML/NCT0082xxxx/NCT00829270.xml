  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondrial diseases are the most frequent metabolic diseases (2.5 persons among 10 000)
      and are clinically heterogeneous making diagnosis particularly challenging for clinicians.

      Molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a critical step in diagnosis and genetic
      counselling of respiratory chain defects. DNA sequencing remains the gold standard but it is
      time-consuming and fails to detect mutations that may be present at a low heteroplasmic level
      (20% or below); therefore the diagnosis is yet based on the detection of a few number of
      pathogenic mutations.

      The present study aims to evaluate the benefit and the cost of a diagnosis strategy based on
      the combined use of 2 techniques named &quot;Surveyor Nuclease&quot; and &quot;Mitochip&quot;. Surveyor nuclease
      is a mismatch-specific DNA endonuclease that will be used for screening the entire mtDNA in
      order to identify heteroplasmic mutations. In absence of any identified mutation, another
      technique based on the use an oligonucleotide sequencing microarray (MitoChip) will be
      performed for the identification of homoplasmic mutations. Mitochip is an array-based
      sequencing platform for rapid and high-throughput analysis of mitochondrial DNA.

      The economical study will compare the cost of these techniques to the standard diagnosis
      method in term of direct and indirect costs
