  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some leg ulcers do not seem to respond that well to the standard treatments that we currently
      use. One reason for this may be that there are high levels of bacteria in the ulcer which may
      be slowing down the rate of healing. Because we need to be careful about when we use
      antibiotics, this study will look at another way of killing bacteria in the ulcer. This new
      method involves putting a special gel on the ulcer and then shining a particular type of
      light (visible red light) onto the ulcer for a short period of time.

      In the first part of the study, a single treatment with the gel and light will be
      investigated. The second part of the study will compare whether or not using the treatment
      once a week for 12 weeks is better than placebo.

      Across the UK 57 people with chronic leg ulcers will be asked to take part in this study (9
      in part 1 and 48 in part 2). Up to 10 sites will be involved including Cardiff University and
      hospitals in Bradford, Harrogate, Dundee, Hull, Plymouth and the Wirral.

      The research is funded by Photopharmica Ltd.

          -  Subjects will be males or females of non-childbearing status over 18 years of age.

          -  Subjects will have a chronic leg ulcer with an ABPI ≥ 0.6 (measured at screening).

          -  Subjects will have an ulcer that has been present for at least 3 months and not more
             than 3 years.

          -  Subjects will have an ulcer with an area of 2 - 100cm2 and a maximum linear dimension
             of 10cm.

          -  Subjects will have an ulcer with a total bacterial load of ≥ 104 CFU / cm2, determined
             within 2 weeks before the first treatment.

          -  Subjects will have voluntarily signed and dated a subject Informed Consent Form (ICF).
