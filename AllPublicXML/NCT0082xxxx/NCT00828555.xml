      PURPOSE To develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of a program designed to assist
      community Ob/Gyns in vaccinating adolescent and adult women against vaccine-preventable
      diseases.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. Determine the feasibility of implementing a successful vaccination program for
           adolescent and adult women in Ob/Gyn offices by direct assessment of medical personnel &amp;
           office staff on their:

             -  Attitudes towards vaccination of women against preventable diseases

             -  Perceived barriers to implementing a program to vaccinate women in their offices

             -  Ideas on how to overcome barriers to successful program implementation

             -  Current vaccination practices and office-specific administrative processes

        2. Design &amp; implement a program for Ob/Gyns to vaccinate women against human
           papillomavirus, influenza, &amp; pertussis

        3. Determine the effectiveness of the vaccination program based on

             -  Pre- and post-program vaccination rates

             -  Program satisfaction amongst Ob/Gyn providers and office staff

             -  Willingness to continue and possibly extend the program to additional vaccines

        4. Quantify the level of support and resources needed to develop and implement the
           vaccination program
