      Hypothesis: systemic therapy with corticosteroid induces morphological changes (e.g., moon
      face, buffalo neck) called lipodystrophy (LD). We hypothesize that this LD is associated with
      variation of adipocytokines (e.g., adiponectin, leptine, IL6) levels

      Primary objective: To show a 50% decrease in adipocytes adiponectin's expression in patients
      who developed LD versus those who did not developed LD during the first 3 months of a
      systemic therapy with corticosteroids

      Secondary objectives: To look for differences in the mRNA expression of 11bHSD1, SREBP1c and
      PPARg in fat samples of patients before and after treatment with systemic corticosteroids and
      between LD+ and LD-patients To compare the fat morphology before and after treatment with
      glucosteroids

      Design: Monocentric, cross-sectional analytical study

      Subjects: 32 HIV-free and Cushing disease-free adult patients for whom a prolonged treatment
      (³3months) with glucosteroids (³ 0.5 mg/kg/day) is initiated

      Methods: At treatment initiation and 3 months after: comparison of fat sample mRNA expression
      of adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, IL6, TNFa), 11bHSD1, SREBP1c and PPARg, fat morphology
      and seric concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, IL6, sTNFR1 between patients LD+ and
      patients LD-. The diagnosis of LD will be performed by 3 experts using patients photographs

      Aims of this study:

        -  To gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of glucosteroids-induced LD

        -  To compare this pathophysiology to the one of HIV-associated LD for which the hypothesis
           of a local, cellular, hypercorticism has been put forward and for which related
           treatment have been prescribed.
