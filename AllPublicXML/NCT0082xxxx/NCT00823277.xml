      Definition:

      the overall objective is to examine childhood obesity with focus on NAFLD and its treatment.
      Further, we aimed to investigate the impact of genetic variation on obesity.

      The specific aims are to;

        -  describe the degree of NAFLD among overweight and obese, Danish children. (hypothesis;
           the degree for pediatric NAFLD among Danish Children was equal that found in other
           Caucasian paediatric study populations).

        -  investigate the effect of a multidisciplinary intervention treatment of 1 year on liver
           fat content.

      (hypothesis; the intervention could reduce the liver fat percentage and a reduction in BMI
      SDS would associate with a reduction in liver fat content) - Analyze changes in liver fat
      content in relation to changes in levels of fasting blood variables to see if any of them
      could be used as a clinical tool for monitoring hepatic steatosis in the clinic.

      (hypothesis; serum aminotransferases (separately and their ratio, respectively), serum
      insulin, and HOMA-IR could predict improvement in liver fat content

      - Investigate the association between genetic variants and obesity.
