  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce postoperative blood losses and transfusion
      requirements in a number of types of surgery. Most trials in orthopedic surgery have been
      conducted in arthroplasty, hip fracture and spine surgeries. This study would aim to see the
      effect of tranexamic acid in reduction of blood loss and transfusions for long bone fracture
      surgery, primarily fracture shaft of femur.

    <measure>Total Blood Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Day 7 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Total blood loss was defined as the sum of intra-operative and post-operative blood loss. It was measured by weighing the drapes/ dressings or swabs prior to soaking to measure difference in weight and checking drain collectors until drains were removed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intra-operative Blood Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (End of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-operative blood loss was measured by weighing the drapes/ dressings or swabs prior to soaking to measure difference in weight and checking drain collectors until drains were removed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative Blood Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 4, 8 and 24 hours post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative blood loss was defined as the sum of the drainage volumes measured over post-operative days 1, 2, and at drain removal. It was measured by weighing the drapes/ dressings or swabs prior to soaking to measure difference in weight and checking drain collectors until drains were removed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Blood Loss Assessed by Gross' Formula</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Gross's formula for estimating total blood loss: Estimated blood volume*[(Hematocrit initial - Hematocrit final)/ Hematocrit average]; where estimated blood volume equals body weight in kilograms (kg) *70 mL/kg.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Receiving Transfusions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 7 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A uniform transfusion protocol was maintained for all participants in the study. Transfusion to be triggered at 8.0 milligram/deciliter (mg/dl) hemoglobin or haematocrit value of 24 percent.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Post Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>DVT was defined if a segment of the deep vein of the lower limb was not compressible or a previous compressive vein became non compressive or there was no flow in the underlying vessel. Symptoms of DVT included pain in the lower limb, localized tenderness, swelling and warmth.</description>
