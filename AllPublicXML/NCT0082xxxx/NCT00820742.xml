      An open label, non-comparative, multicenter, non-interventional, post marketing surveillance
      study to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of pegaptanib sodium(Macugen) in the
      treatment of Filipino patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration based on
      incidence of adverse events and to evaluate the efficacy based on visual acuity, and the
      patient's and physician's overall satisfaction with tolerability and efficacy.
