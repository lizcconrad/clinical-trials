      The trial is a 12-week phase 2 study. Subjects will be given subcutaneous injections at weeks
      0 (160mg), 2 (80mg), and then every other week (40mg) until week 12 in subjects with moderate
      to severe hidradenitis suppurativa.

          1. HS &gt;1 year duration with multiple ER or doctors visits related to HS

          2. Intralesional kenalog injection &gt;5/year, however none within 2 weeks of entry

          3. Failed systemic retinoids, but not within 3 months of entry

          4. Failed at least one prior course of antibiotic therapy, which must not have been
             administered within 2 weeks of entry to the study (excluding the recommended

             enrollment)

          5. History of surgery (reconstructive), but not within 3 months of entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

             injection (this includes father's who plan on fathering a child within 6 months after
             their last injection).

          2. Use of other systemic anti-inflammatory medication except NSAIDs and low dose systemic
             steroids (equal or less than 10 mg daily prednisolone or equivalent).

          3. If found to have an active infection, patients must have completed topical or oral
             antibiotic therapy at least 7 days before first injection.

          4. Have a known history of serious infections (e.g., hepatitis, pneumonia or
             pyelonephritis) in the previous 3 months.

          5. Have or have had an opportunistic infection (e.g., herpes zoster [shingles],
             cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, or mycobacteria
             other than TB) within 6 months prior to screening.

          6. Have a history of lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphoma or signs suggestive
             of possible lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or
             location (e.g., nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck, infraclavicular,
