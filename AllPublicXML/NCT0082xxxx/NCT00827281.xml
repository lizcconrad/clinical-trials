    <textblock>
      This study examines whether isolated doses of D-cycloserine enhance the efficacy of CBT for
      smoking cessation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In comparison to placebo-augmented cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
      D-cycloserine-augmented CBT will lead to a greater reduction in both short-and long-term
      point prevalence abstinence as well as time to first smoking lapse and time to smoking
      relapse.
