    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and the effect of treatment by PulseHaler™
      on patients with COPD, as measured by the change from baseline in full pulmonary functions,
      oxygen saturation, exercise tolerance and health related quality of life; and to assess the
      ease of use of PulseHaler™ by the patients.
