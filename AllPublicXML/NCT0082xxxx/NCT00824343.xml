    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial to study the efficacy and safety of a Cdk inhibitor
      P276-00 in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck. Patients with recurrent
      or metastatic disease that is unresectable and incurable by radiation will be enrolled.
      Thirty eight evaluable patients need to be enrolled in the study. All patients will receive
      protocol treatment i.e. P276-00 as an intravenous infusion from day 1 to day 5 and from day 8
      to day 12 in each 21 day cycle till progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Safety
      evaluations by means of recording vitals, physical examination and lab investigations like
      hematology and clinical chemistry will be undertaken at regular intervals in each cycle.
      Tumor measurements by spiral CT scan will be undertaken at baseline and at the end of every 2
      cycles for response evaluation by RECIST criteria. All patients will be followed up for
      survival status till one year of cycle 1 day 1.

      P276-00 was administered at a dose of 185mg/m2/day from day 1 to day 5 in each 21 day cycle.
      The protocol was amended in July 2009. As per the amendment P276-00 will be administered at a
      dose of 144 mg/m2/day from day 1 to day 5 and from day 8 to day 12 in each 21 day cycle till
      progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.33 patients have been recruited in version 1
      protocol, 38 more evaluable patients need to be recruited in version 2 protocol. Allowing for
      approximately 30% drop-outs, it is estimated that, for enrolling 38 evaluable subjects in the
      study, approximately 54 subjects would be enrolled. As the study has already enrolled 33
      subjects, the sample size for the study to accommodate for same number of subjects (38
      evaluable) in the revised protocol is estimated as approximately 87 (33 + 54) subjects. Hence
      the total sample size (accounting for drop-outs) is 87 patients.
