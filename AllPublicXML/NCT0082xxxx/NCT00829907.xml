      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of ORM-12741 on receptor occupancy by
      positron emission tomography with different doses and plasma concentrations. The
      pharmacokinetic profile and safety will also be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Good general health ascertained by detailed medical history and physical examination

          -  Males between 18 and 45 years

          -  Body mass index (BMI; weight/height2) between 18-30 kg/m2

          -  Weight 55-95 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastro-intestinal, pulmonary, metabolic-endocrine, neurological, urogenital or
             psychiatric disease as judged by the investigator

          -  Any condition requiring regular concomitant medication including herbal products or
             likely to need any concomitant medication during the study

          -  Regular consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = 4 cl spirits,
             about 13 g of alcohol).

          -  Current use of nicotine-containing products more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day

          -  Inability to refrain from using nicotine-containing products during the stay at the
             study centre

          -  Inability to refrain from consuming caffeine-containing beverages during the stay at
             the study centre e.g. propensity for headache when refraining from caffeine-containing
             beverages

          -  Blood donation or loss of significant amount of blood within 3 months prior to the
             screening visit

          -  Abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) finding of clinical relevance

          -  Any abnormal value of laboratory, vital signs, or physical examination, which may in
             the opinion of the investigator interfere with the interpretation of the test results
             or cause a health risk for the subject if he takes part into the study

          -  Anatomical abnormality in brain MRI which may in the opinion of the investigator
             interfere with the interpretation of the PET results

          -  Participation in another clinical drug study within 3 months prior to the start of
             this study or earlier participation in a clinical study with ORM-12741

          -  Participation in a prior PET study

          -  Any contraindication to MRI of the brain
