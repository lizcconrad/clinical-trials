  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anatomical resection is the gold standard approach for liver resection in patients with HCC.
      A new method for that by means of IOUS-guided finger compression has been devised.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We herein describe a novel technique for the demarcation of the resection area by means of
      IOUS-guided finger compression to systematically accomplish anatomical segmental and
      subsegmental resections.

      Using the IOUS, the tumor and the level targeted for compression are identified. Than, under
      the IOUS guidance, the surgeon compresses bilaterally the liver at the targeted position
      resulting in the compression of the portal pedicle feeding the tumor previously identified.
      This maneuver is constantly monitored in real-time just using the same microconvex probe, and
      it is maintained until the surface of the targeted liver area begins to discolor, at that
      time the first assistant marks the discolored area with the electrocautery, and the
      compression is released. Once the area is demarcated, liver dissection is started under
      intermittent Pringle's maneuver.

    <description>According with the investigators previously reported selection flow-chart , patients suitable for surgical approach were those with HCC without ascites, without or with esophageal varices for which preoperative endoscopic eradication could be carried out successfully, and with serum bilirubin level lower than 1.5 mg/dl. Potential candidates to systematic segmental or subsegmental resection by IOUS-guided finger compression were considered patients with single HCC located in one or 2 adjacent segments without portal thrombosis, and anyway not demanding for its complete removal a sectional resection or wider.</description>
