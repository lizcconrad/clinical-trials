  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated levels of immunoglobuline E in blood are said to promote the occurence of atopic
      dermatitis; in fact, many patients with atopic dermatitis have high IgE levels. This study
      tried to explore whether the depletion of IgE from blood and skin might result in a change of
      immunological parameters and might alter the clinical course of the disease.

          -  signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnant or nursing females or women of childbearing potential who did not use a

          -  treatment with omalizumab within the last 12 months before study treatment

          -  known hypersensitivity to any ingredients of omalizumab or omalizumab- related drugs

          -  elevated serum IgE levels for reasons other than atopy

          -  ongoing immunotherapy

          -  use of long-acting antihistamine astemizol within 3 months prior to visit1

          -  use of medium-acting antihistamines (e.g. loratadine, cetirizine) within 5 days prior
             to visit 1

          -  use of short-acting antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramin, terfenadine) within 3 days
             prior to visit 1

          -  use of zafirlukast or other leukotriene receptor inhibitors and zileuton or other
             5-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitors within 3 days prior to visit 1

          -  use of phototherapy or systemic therapy that is known or suspected to have had an
             effect on AD within 1 month prior to first application of study medication

          -  treatment with topical therapy (other than hydrocortisone 1%) that is known or
             suspected to have had an effect on AD within 14 days prior to first application of
             study medication

          -  use of systemic steroids (oral, intravenous, including intraarticular and rectal)
             within one month prior to first application of study medication. (Patients on a stable
             maintenance dose of inhaled steroids were allowed to participate)

          -  use of systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to first application of study
             medication

          -  use of tranquilizers, hypnotic agents or tricyclic antidepressants within 2 weeks

          -  concurrent skin diseases

          -  active bacterial, viral or fungal infections that required treatment with a prohibited
             medication

          -  a history of recurrent herpes simplex infection having active lesions at baseline

          -  tinea corporis / tinea cruris

          -  clinically significant laboratory abnormalities

          -  a history of noncompliance to medical regimens and patients who were considered
             potentially unreliable

          -  evidence of drug or alcohol abuse or other factors limiting ability to fully cooperate

          -  any condition or prior/continuing treatment which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             should have rendered the patient ineligible for the study.
