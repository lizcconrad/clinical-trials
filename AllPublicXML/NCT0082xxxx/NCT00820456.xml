      The objectives for this study include:

        -  Testing a unique way of imaging people with colorectal cancer and other cancers that has
           spread to the liver using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);

        -  Seeing if the MRI process can be used across multiple imaging platforms;

        -  Determining whether the results of the imaging can be reproduced;

        -  Reviewing how MRI results relate to cancer response to combination therapy and to
           clinical endpoints.

      This study will investigate the use of projection reconstruction dynamic contrast-enhanced
      MRI (DCE-MRI) as a surrogate marker of tumor vascularity in patients treated with the
      antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. DCE-MRI is gaining popularity as a method to assess the
      functional response of tumors to agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VGEF) pathways. DCE-MRI measurements have been proposed as a non-invasive measure of both
      tumor biologic activity and (in the case of antivascular therapy) early response to
      treatment. A number of phase I and II studies demonstrate the ability for DCE-MRI to detect
      perfusion changes associated with tumor biologic response to vascularly targeted agents. It
      has been suggested that pre-treatment DCE-MRI might identify tumors with high intrinsic
      perfusion and that these tumors will be more likely to respond to antivascular-based
      therapies. However, the current use of DCE-MRI in clinical settings is challenging.
      Trade-offs between spatial coverage, time, and spatial resolution make this technique
      difficult to implement in human studies and may limit its reliability. The use of projection
      reconstruction-based acquisition can mitigate the need for these trade-offs and can
      simultaneously provide high temporal and spatial resolution data for DCE-MRI analysis.

        At each participating site, at least one oncologist treating patients with adenocarcinoma
        of the colon and rectum must agree to serve as a co-investigator on the study. However, all
        oncologists directly or indirectly affiliated with the participating institution may serve
        as a source of participants for this trial. Patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon or
        rectum metastatic to the liver who are present candidates for FOLFOX plus bevacizumab are
        eligible to enroll in this imaging trial in Arm A. Patients with any primary carcinoma with
        metastatic disease to the liver who are in stable treatment condition prior to and between
        scnas are eligible to enroll in this imaging trial in Arm B.
