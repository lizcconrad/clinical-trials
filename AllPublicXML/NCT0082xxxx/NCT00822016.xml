      The purpose of this study is to establish a listing (database) of patients diagnosed with
      lung cancer and treated with best supportive care and standard and investigational
      chemotherapy regimens, surgery, and radiation therapy at the UNM CRTC and other NMCCA sites.
      The information will be used to determine the results of various treatments for lung cancer
      subjects and to find where improvements can be made in safety, effectiveness, supportive
      care, treatment that eases tumors without curing them, treatments that cure tumors,
      prevention, and follow-up efforts. The database information will be compared to clinical
      trial data published in peer-reviewed journals and SEER outcome data. Patients will be
      acquired both before and after they are treated for lung cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Those who are eligible for this treatment protocol will consist of:

               1. Patients with histologically diagnosed lung cancer.

               2. Patients receiving therapy should have an ECOG/Zubrod/SWOG performance status of
                  &lt;3 at the time of the initiation of therapy.

               3. All newly diagnosed patients referred to an NMCC Alliance site will be eligible,
                  as will patients with recurrent disease that are now referred to an NMCCA for
                  their next therapy (such as those who move from out of state, or are referred for
                  protocol therapy), though efforts will be made to obtain records of prior therapy
                  administered elsewhere).

          -  Patients not falling under any of the above criteria are not eligible for the study.
