  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers investigated the effectiveness and safety of BoNT/A injected into the
      detrusor muscle in patients with PD and MSA all of whom had detrusor muscle overactivity
      unresponsive to conventional medical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included will have overactive bladder symptoms refractory to medical therapy. Other
      causes of overactive bladder symptoms including urogenital prolapse and recurrent urinary
      tract infections were excluded. None of the patients will be under anticoagulant therapy or
      drugs interfering with neuromuscular transmission. The study was approved by the local
      ethical committee and patients gave their informed consent. Patients will be informed about
      the possible need for intermittent catheterization after BoNT/A treatment.

      As outcome measures we assessed clinical and urodynamic variables.
