      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending single oral
      doses of GAP-134 in healthy subjects, to provide the initial pharmacokinetic profile of the
      oral formulation of GAP-134 in healthy subjects, and to evaluate the effect on the
      pharmacokinetic profile of a high-fat meal of 450 mg of GAP-134 administered to healthy
      subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Men or women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP) aged 18 to 50 years inclusive at
             screening.

          -  WONCBP may be included if they are either surgically sterile (hysterectomy and/or
             oophorectomy) or postmenopausal for ≥1 year (with follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
             level ≥38 mIU/mL) and must have a negative pregnancy test result within 24 hours
             before administration of the study drug or placebo.

          -  Women who are surgically sterile must provide documentation of the procedure by an
             operative report or by an ultrasound scan report.

          -  Sexually active men must agree to use a medically acceptable form of contraception
             during the study and continue using it for 12 weeks after study drug or placebo
             administration.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) in the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 and body weight ≥50 kg.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history, physical
             examination, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  Serum creatinine level must be less than 1.30 mg/dL. (Normal range: 0.44 to 1.24
             mg/dL.)

          -  Nonsmoker or smoker of fewer than 10 cigarettes per day as determined by history. Must
             be able to abstain from smoking during the inpatient stay.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Presence or history of any disorder that may prevent the successful completion of the
             study.

          -  Any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition that may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study drug or placebo.

          -  Acute disease state (eg, nausea, vomiting, fever, or diarrhea) within 7 days before
             administration of study drug or placebo.

          -  Any history of clinically important cardiac arrhythmias.

          -  Familial history of long QT syndrome or unexpected cardiac death.

          -  History of drug abuse within 1 year before before administration of study drug or
             placebo.
