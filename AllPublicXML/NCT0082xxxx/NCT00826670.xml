  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (hereafter
      called ESBLs) have emerged as an important cause of bloodstream infection in hospitalized
      patients and urinary tract infections in the community. As is the case with other
      multidrug-resistant organisms chronic colonization is frequent, in the case of ESBLs mostly
      intestinal and urinary carriage.

      To the investigators knowledge no randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial has been
      performed to study the efficacy of a systematic ESBL eradication strategy. Eradication of
      ESBL carriage would cause benefits for the individual patient - by reducing the risk of
      infection - and for the community - by reducing transmission. Even if eradication turns out
      to be impossible, transient suppression of ESBL might reduce the likelihood of transmission
      and thus still be beneficial from an ecologic perspective.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the hypothesis that the administration of a 10
      day course of oral antibiotics active against ESBLs can lead to decolonization of ESBL
      carriage in hospitalized patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients can be enrolled into the study provided that all of the following criteria are
        met:

          1. Microbiologically documented rectal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae,
             without signs and symptoms of active infection with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae
             at any body site

          2. Patient must give written informed consent to participate in the study. The informed
             consent can be given by the legal representative if necessary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant or nursing

          2. Active infection

          3. Treatment with antimicrobial agents with activity against ESBL-producing
             Enterobacteriaceae

          4. Contraindication to the use of one of the study drugs (e.g. renal insufficiency with
             creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min)

          5. Patient already enrolled in another study, or in the present study for a previous
             episode

          6. Psychiatric disorder or unable to understand or to follow the protocol directions

          7. Permanent indwelling urinary catheter that can not be changed

          8. Resistance of the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae to one of the study drugs

          9. Known hypersensitivity to one of the study drugs
