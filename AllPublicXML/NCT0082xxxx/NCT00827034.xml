    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction of Dimebon with the
      FDA-recommended CYP2C9 substrate warfarin in healthy subjects. Conformance with the guidance
      includes general study design using a randomized, open label, single-dose warfarin,
      steady-state Dimebon, 2-sequence, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover design with a minimum 7-day
      washout period between treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female (non-childbearing potential) subjects between the ages of
             18 and 55 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Prothrombin time (PT)/INR, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

          -  Plasma Protein C and Protein S activity (functional) within the normal reference
             range.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A known sensitivity or previous intolerance to Dimebon or warfarin.

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal
             allergies at time of dosing) disease or clinical findings at Screening.

          -  Subjects receiving warfarin for treatment of active thromboembolic events (ie,
             pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis), as well as subjects anticoagulated with
             prosthetic heart valves.
