  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is associated with vulnerability against infections leading to increased morbidity
      with risk of death. Innate and adaptive immunities are altered with ageing responsible of
      deficits in immune response against pathogens and after vaccination, and favouring the
      elderly vulnerability against a new pathogen with increased bacterial, viral, and fungal
      infections.

      If immunity has been widely studied in immunosenescence, there are few prospective,
      comparative studies with elderly ill patients. Moreover among these studies, pathologies are
      not well defined.

      The main objective of our project is to compare the immune state of elderly hospitalised
      subjects in an acute geriatric unit to the immune state of elderly healthy subjects selected
      with strict criteria, in order to precise the impact of polypathology and of various
      pathologies on immunity state.
