      Estimate the efficiency of a strategy of premature screening of the maternal anaemia during
      the first quarter of pregnancy versus the usual strategy of screening of the anaemia during
      the sixth month.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A part of the patient will have a NFS and dosage of the cast-iron, during the results of the
      beginning of the pregnancy at the first quarter.

      The other part of the patients will have a NFS and at the first quater of the pregnancy.

      All the patient will have a NFS at the results of the sixth month of the pregnancy.

      A NFS will be done during the results at the end of the pregnancy like we do now.

      Then a NFS at 48 hours after the birth. A treatment with iron will be done and according to
      the results
