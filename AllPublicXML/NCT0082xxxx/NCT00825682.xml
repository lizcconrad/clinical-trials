  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oncologic patients often report increased fatigue during and after radiation therapy.
      Reflexology treatment has been demonstrated to alleviate symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and
      anxiety in oncologic patients treated with chemotherapy. The aim of the study is to evaluate
      the effect of reflexology on fatigue, quality of life, and quality of sleep of breast cancer
      patients during and after radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reflexology (foot massage) is a complementary medicine technique which is performed by manual
      pressure on specific areas of the feet. Reflexology is based on a system of zones and reflex
      areas that are believed to reflect an image of the body on the feet with a premise that such
      work effects a physical change to the body.

      The effect of reflexology on fatigue, quality of life, and quality of sleep of 20 breast
      cancer patients during and after radiation therapy will be compared to age-matched control
      group of 20 breast cancer patients treated by radiation therapy.

    <measure>The Lee Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning of study (initiation of radiation therapy and reflexology), 5 weeks after start (end of radiation therapy), 10 weeks after start</time_frame>
    <description>The Lee Fatigue Scale consists of 18 items related to fatigue and energy: 13 items in the fatigue subscale and 5 items in the energy subscale. The mean of the 13 items in the fatigue subscale (range from 0-10) and the mean of the 5 items in the energy subscale (range from 0-10) are calculated. Higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived fatigue and energy . Items in the energy subscale were recoded, and a Lee fatigue total score was calculated as the average of all 18 items (ranging between 0 and 10), higher scores indicating higher levels of fatigue.
The Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient of the English version of the questionnaire is 0.77 . The questionnaire's validity and reliability have been established in cancer patients.</description>

    <measure>The Multidimensional Quality of Life Scale Cancer MQOLS-CA Was Written by Padilla (1992) and Translated Into Hebrew by Dorit Pud (2007).</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning of study (initiation of radiation therapy and reflexology), 5 weeks after start (end of radiation therapy), 10 weeks after start</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire includes 33 items describing different forms in which the disease may affect patient's quality of life. For each item, subjects are asked to mark the number that best describes their feelings right now, in a Likert scale ranging between 0 and 10. Items include happiness feelings, anxiety levels, how affected are the social ties because of the disease, etc.
A total quality of life score was calculated as the average of all 33 items (ranging between 0 and 10), higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>The General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), Compiled by Lee (1992) and Translated Into Hebrew by Dr. Dorit Pud (2007)</measure>
    <time_frame>Beginning of study (initiation of radiation therapy and reflexology), 5 weeks after start (end of radiation therapy), 10 weeks after start</time_frame>
    <description>examines several aspects of sleep disorders and includes 21 items that describe feelings and behaviors associated with sleep during the last week. It uses a 0 (never) to 7 (every day) Likert scale on questions like feeling nervous during the day; falling asleep while unplanned and using sleeping pills.
A total sleep disturbance score was calculated as the average of all 21 items (ranging between 0 and 7), higher scores indicating a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>The Lee Fatigue Scale</title>
        <description>The Lee Fatigue Scale consists of 18 items related to fatigue and energy: 13 items in the fatigue subscale and 5 items in the energy subscale. The mean of the 13 items in the fatigue subscale (range from 0-10) and the mean of the 5 items in the energy subscale (range from 0-10) are calculated. Higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived fatigue and energy . Items in the energy subscale were recoded, and a Lee fatigue total score was calculated as the average of all 18 items (ranging between 0 and 10), higher scores indicating higher levels of fatigue.
The Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficient of the English version of the questionnaire is 0.77 . The questionnaire's validity and reliability have been established in cancer patients.</description>

        <title>The Multidimensional Quality of Life Scale Cancer MQOLS-CA Was Written by Padilla (1992) and Translated Into Hebrew by Dorit Pud (2007).</title>
        <description>The questionnaire includes 33 items describing different forms in which the disease may affect patient's quality of life. For each item, subjects are asked to mark the number that best describes their feelings right now, in a Likert scale ranging between 0 and 10. Items include happiness feelings, anxiety levels, how affected are the social ties because of the disease, etc.
A total quality of life score was calculated as the average of all 33 items (ranging between 0 and 10), higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

        <description>examines several aspects of sleep disorders and includes 21 items that describe feelings and behaviors associated with sleep during the last week.
