  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials are lacking in patients with
      advanced gastric cancer (AGC), and because randomly allocating patients to treatments that do
      not accord with their preferences may influence trial validity, the investigators employed a
      patient preference randomized trial design to compare the efficacy of second-line
      chemotherapy and best supportive care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluoropyrimidine and/or platinum-based chemotherapy is now regarded as a standard first-line
      treatment in AGC patients because it has shown superiority in terms of response rate and time
      to disease progression compared with 5-FU monotherapy and other combinations in phase III
      trials. Despite the lack of evidence for benefit associated with administering salvage
      chemotherapy, it is a common practice to offer further chemotherapy for AGC patients after
      first-line failure. For patients who failed after fluoropyrimidine and platinum, taxanes
      (paclitaxel or docetaxel) and irinotecan have been evaluated extensively in the second-line
      setting.

      Currently, there is no evidence that SLC in patients with AGC will result in substantial
      prolongation of survival and there is potential for toxicity from the treatment.
