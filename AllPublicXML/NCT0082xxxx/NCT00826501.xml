  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreatitis can develop inflammatory fluid collection around the pancreas
      called pseudocysts. Pseudocysts may cause abdominal pain when they are more than 6cm in size.
      These pseudocysts can be treated (drained) by surgery or by endoscopy. Both treatment options
      are the current standard-of-care at all institutions around the World. The aim of this study
      is to identify the better of the two techniques, surgery versus endoscopy, for treatment of
      patients with pancreatic pseudocysts. This will be done by comparing a) the rates of
      pseudocyst recurrence b) quality of life of patients following treatment and c) cost
      associated with treatment, between both treatment modalities.

      The purpose of this study is to examine endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus neurolysis
      (CPN) with analgesic therapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer will decrease
      the severity of abdominal pain when compared to analgesic therapy alone. The specific primary
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of EUS-CPN + analgesic therapy (Group 1) in
      pain relief of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer when compared with analgesic
      therapy (Group 2). The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the changes in reported pain
      severity between those who receive EUS-CPN in addition to analgesic therapy as compared to
      analgesic therapy alone.
