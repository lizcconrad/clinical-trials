  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to examine the safety of gene therapy for Lebers
      Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) caused by RPE65 mutations using a recombinant adeno-associated
      virus serotype 2 (rAAV2) vector carrying the human RPE65 (hRPE65) gene. Recently, three
      independent short-term gene therapy studies in humans with LCA due to RPE65 mutations were
      published, suggesting that subretinal delivery of rAAV virus carrying the RPE65 gene is safe.
      As a secondary outcome, improvement in visual function was observed in seven of the first
      nine treated patients. The proposed study is a similar open label, Phase I clinical trial of
      uniocular subretinal rAAV2-hRPE65 administration to individuals with RPE65-associated retinal
      disease. Two cohorts of three subjects each and one cohort of four subjects will be included
      in this trial. Cohort 1 and 2 will consist of individuals 18 years of age and older and
      Cohorts 3 will consist of individuals 8 years of age and older. In cohort 2, a larger volume
      of vector will be administered. Enrollment in Cohort 3 will begin only after confirming the
      safety of rAAV2-hRPE65 administration in the older group of participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Retinal disease caused by homozygous or compound heterozygote RPE65 mutations;

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) with severely impaired visual
             and retinal function, and best corrected visual acuity of 20/50 or worse in the study
             eye;

          -  Ability to perform tests of visual and retinal function;

          -  Good general health;

          -  Ability to comply with research procedures;

          -  Specific for Cohort 1 and 2: 18 years of age and older;

          -  Specific for Cohort 3: Over 8 years of age;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Immune deficiency or use of immunosuppressive medications;

          -  Pre-existing eye conditions that would preclude the planned surgery or interfere with
             the interpretation of study endpoints (for example, glaucoma or ocular media
             opacities);

          -  Complicating systemic diseases;

          -  Impaired coagulation or use of anti-platelet agents within 7 days prior to study agent
             administration;

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding;

          -  Individuals (males and females) of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use
             effective contraception for 1 year following agent administration and barrier
             contraception for 3 months following agent administration;

          -  Any other condition that would prevent a subject from completing follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study;

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the subject
             unsuitable for the study;

          -  Current or recent participation in any other research protocol involving
             investigational agents or therapies, including recent (within past 6 months) receipt
             of an investigational biologic therapeutic agent.

        Subjects will not be excluded based on their gender, race or ethnicity.
