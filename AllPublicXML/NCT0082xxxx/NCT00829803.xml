             within the past 7 days

          -  Subjects requiring TIVA

          -  Subjects requiring prolonged use of NMBA beyond dose required for intubation

          -  Subjects requiring ketamine

          -  Subjects receiving spinal, epidural, or other nerve blocks

          -  Subjects having any condition or severe illness that to the Principal Investigator's
             discretion would interfere with study assessments OR other severe acute or chronic
             medical or psychiatric condition that may interfere with the interpretation of study
             results and, in the judgment of the investigator, and would make the subject
