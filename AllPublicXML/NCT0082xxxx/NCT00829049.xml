    <measure>Median Percent Change From Baseline in the Non-Inflammatory Lesion Counts (Open and Closed Comedones) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Median percent change from baseline in the non-inflammatory lesion counts (open and closed comedones) at Week 12. Comedones are small bumps on the skin (lesions) caused by acne and found at the opening of a skin pore. Open comedones (also known as blackheads) have a microscopic opening to the skin surface, while closed comedones (also known as whiteheads or pimples) lack the opening to the skin. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts(improvement).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With &gt;= 1 Grade Improvement in the Investigator Global Assessment at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients with &gt;= 1 grade improvement (decrease in score) in the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) at Week 16. The IGA is a 5-point scale used by the investigator to assess overall acne severity, where 0 equals clear skin (no evidence of acne) and 4 equals severe acne.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With &gt;= 2 Grade Improvement in the Overall Disease Severity Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients with &gt;= 2 grade improvement (decrease in score) in the overall disease severity score at Week 12. The overall disease severity score was evaluated by the investigator using a 7-point scale to rate the overall acne severity (lesions, inflammation, facial redness, and skin condition), where 0=no acne lesions and 6=most severe acne.</description>

    <measure>Median Percent Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion Counts (Papules/Pustules, Nodules) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Median percent change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts (papules/pustules, nodules) at Week 16. Papules and nodules are round, solid elevations of the skin with no visible fluid; papules are smaller (less than 5 to 10 millimeters in width and depth) and nodules are larger (greater than 5 to 10 millimeters in width and depth). Pustules are small elevations of the skin containing cloudy material. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>

        <description>Percentage of patients with &gt;= 2 grade improvement (decrease in score) in the overall disease severity score at Week 12. The overall disease severity score was evaluated by the investigator using a 7-point scale to rate the overall acne severity (lesions, inflammation, facial redness, and skin condition), where 0=no acne lesions and 6=most severe acne.</description>

        <title>Median Percent Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Lesion Counts (Papules/Pustules, Nodules) at Week 16</title>
        <description>Median percent change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts (papules/pustules, nodules) at Week 16. Papules and nodules are round, solid elevations of the skin with no visible fluid; papules are smaller (less than 5 to 10 millimeters in width and depth) and nodules are larger (greater than 5 to 10 millimeters in width and depth). Pustules are small elevations of the skin containing cloudy material. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in lesion counts (improvement).</description>
