  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This preliminary study will investigate the use of Acupuncture and Moxibustion (Acu/Moxa) for
      distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DSP) associated with HIV applying traditional Chinese
      medicine (TCM) evaluations conducted by a diagnostic acupuncturist. The investigators will
      evaluate the role of Acu/Moxa in reducing the symptoms of DSP related to HIV/AIDS and
      treatment side effects. The effects of symptom reduction on quality of life will also be
      examined. This application will establish a proof of principle for the role of Acu/Moxa in
      the treatment of DSP and provide data that will serve as a foundation for establishing a
      future larger clinical trial.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, sham/placebo controlled, blinded (subject and
      evaluator), parallel groups clinical trial. This preliminary study will investigate the use
      of Acupuncture and Moxibustion (Acu/Moxa) for DSP associated with HIV applying TCM
      evaluations conducted by a diagnostic acupuncturist. The investigators will evaluate the role
      of Acu/Moxa in reducing the symptoms of DSP related to HIV/AIDS and treatment side effects.
      The effects of symptom reduction on quality of life will also be examined. Data from daily
      symptom diaries and questionnaires will be analyzed with mixed model analysis of variance for
      between group difference in the temporal pattern of symptom reduction at baseline, after 6
      weeks of twice weekly treatment, and after a no-treatment follow-up session. In addition,
      exploratory analyses will assess the logistics of a CAM clinical trial for HIV/AIDS related
      DSP in preparation of a larger clinical trial.
