      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      preliminary efficacy of DTA-H19 administered intraperitoneally (IP) in subjects with advanced
      stage ovarian cancer, or primary peritoneal carcinoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open label, dose escalation, repeat dose study in 11 subjects with
      recurrent, platinum resistant advanced stage ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma
      designed to determine the tolerability, safety, quality of life, PK, and preliminary efficacy
      of DTA-H19 administered intraperitoneally(IP).

      Primary Objective: The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IP DTA-H19; and,

        -  To identify any dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).

      Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To determine quality of life of subjects with advanced ovarian cancer, primary
           peritoneal carcinoma treated with IP DTA-H19;

        -  To determine the the reduction in malignant ascites as measured by Ultrasound and change
           in frequency of parecenteses necessary.

        -  To determine the overall survival distribution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written informed consent and be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Have histopathologically documented epithelial ovarian carcinoma or primary peritoneal
             carcinoma with evidence of ascites.

          -  Have either a) platinum-refractory disease (i.e. persistent disease following
             completion of platinum-based primary chemotherapy) and have failed at least primary
             platinum-based chemotherapy; or b) platinum-resistant recurrent disease and have
             failed at least one regimen of second line chemotherapy.

          -  Be able to tolerate placement of IP catheter.

          -  Be at least 2 weeks from last treatment to allow recovery from prior toxicity but in
             the judgment of the investigator with sufficient time to ensure that the effects of
             prior treatments will not confound safety evaluations.

          -  Have a Karnofsky performance status score of ≥ 70%.
