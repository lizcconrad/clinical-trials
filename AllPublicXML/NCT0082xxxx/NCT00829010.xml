      The purposes of this study:

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of pneumococcal vaccine
           GSK1024850A in HIV infected infants, HIV exposed uninfected infants and HIV unexposed
           uninfected infants following a 3-dose primary vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age
           and following booster vaccination at 9-10 months of age.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of pneumococcal vaccine
           GSK1024850A in HIV unexposed uninfected infants receiving either a 3-dose primary
           vaccination according to the EPI vaccination schedule at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age with
           or without booster vaccination at 9-10 months of age or a 2-dose primary vaccination at
           6 and 14 weeks of age followed by booster vaccination at 9-10 months of age.

        -  This study also aims to assess the impact of the pneumococcal vaccine GSK1024850A on
           nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae up to 24 months of age in all
           study participants.

Subjects in the group also received 3 primary vaccine doses (at 6, 10 &amp; 14 weeks of age, at study Months 0, 1 and 2) and 1 booster vaccine dose (at 15-18 months of age, at study Month 14) of Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, 2 vaccine doses of Rotarix™ (at 10 &amp; 14 weeks of age, at study Months 1 and 2), and 2 doses of measles vaccine (9-10 months of age &amp; 15-18 months of age, at study Months 8 and 14). Measles vaccine was not considered as a study vaccine. The Synflorix™ vaccine was administered IM in the right thigh, the Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib vaccine was administered IM in the left anterolateral thigh during the primary vaccination and in the left anterolateral thigh or left deltoid region during booster vaccination. Rotarix™ was given orally.</description>

        <description>Concentrations were given in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL) and were expressed in geometric mean antibody concentrations. Pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Data were collected post-Dose 3 at Month 3 and post-Dose 4 at Month 9 for the HIV+/+, HIV+/- and HIV- (3+1) groups, post-Dose 3 at Month 3 and at Month 9 for HIV- (3+0) group, and post-Dose 2 at Month 3 and post-Dose 3 at Month 9 for the HIV- (2+1) Group. The cut-off of the assay is 0.05 µg/mL.</description>

        <description>Concentrations were given in microgram per millilitre (µg/mL) and were expressed in geometric mean antibody concentrations. Pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Data were collected post-Dose 4 at Month 23 for the HIV+/+, HIV+/- and HIV- (3+1) groups and post-Dose 3 at Month 23 for HIV- (3+0) and HIV- (2+1) groups. The cut-off of the assay is 0.05 µg/mL.</description>

        <population>The According-To-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity included evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available. This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least 1 study vaccine antigen component post dose II or III, as applicable, or after booster vaccination.</population>

        <description>Pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Data were collected post-Dose 3 at Month 3 and post-Dose 4 at Month 9 for the HIV+/+, HIV+/- and HIV- (3+1) groups,post-Dose 3 at Month 3 and at Month 9 for HIV- (3+0) group, and post-Dose 2 at Month 3 and post-Dose 3 at Month 9 for the HIV- (2+1) Group. Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was measured by a killing-assay using a HL 60 cell line. The results are presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titer) able to sustain 50% killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions. The cut-off of the assay is an opsonic titer of 8.</description>

        <population>The According-To-Protocol cohort for immunogenicity included evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available. This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least 1 study vaccine antigen component post dose II or III, as applicable, or after booster vaccination.</population>

        <title>Opsonophagocytic Titers Against Vaccine Pneumococcal Serotypes.</title>
        <description>Pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Data were collected post-Dose 4 at Month 23 for the HIV+/+, HIV+/- and HIV- (3+1) groups and post-Dose 3 at Month 23 for HIV- (3+0) and HIV- (2+1) groups. Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was measured by a killing-assay using a HL 60 cell line. The results are presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titer) able to sustain 50% killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions. The cut-off of the assay is an opsonic titer of 8.</description>

This included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least 1 study vaccine antigen component post dose II or III, as applicable, or after booster vaccination.</population>

        <title>Opsonophagocytic Titers Against Cross-reactive Pneumococcal Serotypes 6A and 19A.</title>
        <description>Cross-reactive pneumococcal vaccine serotypes assessed were 6A and 19A. Data were collected post-Dose 4 at Month 23 for the HIV+/+, HIV+/- and HIV- (3+1) groups and post-Dose 3 at Month 23 for HIV- (3+0) and HIV- (2+1) groups. Streptococcus pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity was measured by a killing-assay using a HL 60 cell line. The results are presented as the dilution of serum (opsonic titer) able to sustain 50% killing of live pneumococci under the assay conditions. The cut-off of the assay is an opsonic titer of 8.</description>

Salivary samples (1.0 mL) were collected by using an Oracol™ device consisting of a sponge (2 cm3) placed on a stick that was used to brush the teeth and gums to absorb the saliva. Salivary samples were sent to RMPRU (or GSK Biologicals’ designated validated laboratory) where the sponge was centrifuged to extract the saliva and that was immediately stored at -70°C. The cut-off of the assay was 2.3 U/mL for anti-LytC IgA and 2.2 U/mL for anti PhtD IgA.</description>

Subjects in the group also received 3 primary vaccine doses (at 6, 10 &amp; 14 weeks of age, at study Months 0, 1 and 2) and 1 booster vaccine dose (at 15-18 months of age, at study Month 14) of Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib, 2 vaccine doses of Rotarix™ (at 10 &amp; 14 weeks of age, at study Months 1 and 2), and 2 doses of measles vaccine (9-10 months of age &amp; 15-18 months of age, at study Months 8 and 14). Measles vaccine was not considered as a study vaccine. The Synflorix™ vaccine was administered IM in the right thigh, the Tritanrix™-HepB/Hib vaccine was administered IM in the left anterolateral thigh during the primary vaccination and in the left anterolateral thigh or left deltoid region during booster vaccination. Rotarix™ was given orally.</description>
