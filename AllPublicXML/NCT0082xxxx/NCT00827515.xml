    <textblock>
      Initial studies have used a powder in capsule formulation of PH797804. In future studies an
      immediate release tablet will be used. The purpose of this study is to compare blood levels
      of PH797804 following an oral dose of the powder in capsule formulation and the tablet
      formulation. In addition the effect of food blood levels of PH797804 will be investigated
