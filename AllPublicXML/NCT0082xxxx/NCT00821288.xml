  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the post-treatment care of breast cancer
      survivors and to understand the barriers to optimal post-treatment care in Latina and
      Non-Hispanic women.

    <textblock>
      The proposed investigation is a randomized prospective evaluation of a Survivorship
      Intervention in improving the quality of care, treatment satisfaction and understanding of
      care in Latina and Caucasian breast cancer survivors treated in an urban academic medical
      center. Patients will be recruited within 6 weeks of completing their last definitive breast
      cancer therapy (radiation or chemotherapy). Patients will complete self administered baseline
      and follow-up questionnaires. Following baseline evaluation patients will be randomized to
      receiving either written information for follow-up care of cancer survivors published by the
      National Cancer Institute (Facing Forward), or the Survivorship Intervention. Patients will
      not be aware that they are participating in a randomized intervention. After verbally
      agreeing to participate they will be randomized to group A or B and will receive the
      corresponding consent. Patients will be re-assessed 3 and 6 months after enrollment.

    <description>Survivorship Consultation is a one hour consultation in a survivorship clinic. The consultation will be performed by a nurse practitioner under the supervision of a medical oncologist. The consultation will result in a detailed written document outlining the individuals &quot;Survivorship Prescription&quot; including treatment summary, surveillance recommendations, risk for late-effects, cancer screening recommendations, genetic risk, and life style recommendations. This written document will be provided to the patient and her treating physician. In addition, referrals will be made to appropriate adjunct services as needed (e.g. psychologist, nutritionist, social worker).</description>

    <description>Facing Forward: Life after Cancer Treatment is a guide for people who were treated for cancer published by the NCI. It is a 24-page manual that summarized many key issues of interest to cancer survivors during the re-entry phase, and contains sections on medical care after treatment, symptoms after treatment, feelings after treatment, social relationships after cancer treatment, and dealing with practical matters such as insurance and employment. The manual is available in English and Spanish. This will be given at the time of registration and the table of contents will be reviewed with the patient.</description>
