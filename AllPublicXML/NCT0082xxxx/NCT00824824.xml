  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have completed a study in which we examined the response of the retinal circulation to
      changes in posture from sitting to lying down in patients with primary open angle glaucoma
      (POAG). This alteration in position produces changes in the local blood pressure at the
      entrance to the retinal vasculature. In a healthy retina, the vasculature adapts by dilating
      and constricting in order to maintain a steady blood flow rate. In an eye with POAG, this
      often does not occur. As a result, there are large fluctuations in blood flow which may
      produce the retinal neuronal damage associated with glaucoma.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that topical anti-glaucoma treatments with agents
      that have vasoactive as well as IOP-lowering effects can have a beneficial effect on
      maintaining a steady retinal blood flow rate even when there are changes in local blood
      pressure.

    <time_frame>6 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>We determined whether RVD was present in the following way. The difference between the retinal blood flow measured while reclining for 30 minutes and the baseline retinal blood flow measured while seated was calculated. In a previous study, we found that among healthy subjects the change in the blood flow while reclining compared to baseline was +6.5% ± 12%. For this study, we defined the normal range of blood flow autoregulation as ± 2 standard deviations about the mean percentage change found in the control group in the initial study (6.5% ± 24.0%); that is, as -17.5% to +30.5%. Participants with a change in retinal blood flow induced by posture change outside this range were randomized to either dorzolamide-timolol fixed combination BID OU or brimonidine-timolol fixed combination BID OU for 6 weeks.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 21 primary open angle glaucoma patients were recruited for the study from the practices of Douglas J. Rhee, Angela V. Turalba, and Louis R. Pasquale at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston. Recruitment took place between February 13, 2009 and December 21, 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to the initial testing visit, subjects ceased using their current IOP-lowering medications and were run in for 6 weeks on timolol 0.5% BID OU. After this 6 week period baseline measurements were taken and 7 were identified with retinal vascular dysregulation. These 7 patients were then randomized into one of two treatment arms.</pre_assignment_details>

All eligible subjects had open angles on gonioscopy with the filtering portion of the trabecular meshwork visible for 360° in both eyes. All subjects also had at least two reliable Humphrey 24-2 full threshold visual fields that showed reproducible loss in the left eye on tests with fixation loss ≤33%, false positives ≤ 20% and false negatives ≤ 20%. Patients with evidence of exfoliation or pigment dispersion syndrome in either eye were excluded.

        <title>Presence of Retinal Vascular Dysregulation (RVD)</title>
        <description>We determined whether RVD was present in the following way. The difference between the retinal blood flow measured while reclining for 30 minutes and the baseline retinal blood flow measured while seated was calculated. In a previous study, we found that among healthy subjects the change in the blood flow while reclining compared to baseline was +6.5% ± 12%. For this study, we defined the normal range of blood flow autoregulation as ± 2 standard deviations about the mean percentage change found in the control group in the initial study (6.5% ± 24.0%); that is, as -17.5% to +30.5%. Participants with a change in retinal blood flow induced by posture change outside this range were randomized to either dorzolamide-timolol fixed combination BID OU or brimonidine-timolol fixed combination BID OU for 6 weeks.</description>
        <time_frame>6 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
        <population>21 participants were tested for RVD after 6 weeks of timolol treatment. Of the 21 participants who were tested, 7 had RVD and were randomized to Dorzolamide-Timolol and Brimonidine-Timolol; 14 had normal autoregulation. One participant was removed from the analysis in the Brimonidine-Timolol arm due to technical difficulties with equipment.</population>

Of the 6 that were tested, 4 patients had retinal vascular autoregulation that was in the normal range. Two patients continued to show RVD.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A potential limitation of this study is that no washout period occurred because the 6-week treatment periods extended beyond the typical 2-week washout period for dorzolamide and the 3-week washout period for brimonidine.</limitations_and_caveats>
