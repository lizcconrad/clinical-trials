  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ESBA105, a single-chain (scFv) antibody
      against TNF-alpha, efficiently penetrates into the anterior chamber and the vitreous body
      upon topical administration to the eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESBA105 is a topically administered tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor that
      has significant therapeutic potential in various inflammatory intraocular diseases. In animal
      experiments, ESBA105 was shown to efficiently penetrate into the inner of the eye upon
      topical administration, associated with very low systemic exposure. A recently completed
      Phase I trial with topical ESBA105 has confirmed the safety of topical administration to the
      human eye and the low systemic exposure using this route of administration.

      This study is designed to determine the intraocular levels and the specific intraocular
      distribution pattern of ESBA105 following topical administration to the human eye. In
      addition it shall be explored whether topical administration of ESBA105 reduces intraocular
      inflammation following cataract surgery.

      Three different dose regimens will be applied to four different patient cohorts. Three
      patient cohorts will be conducted in an open label design and one in a double-masked, placebo
      controlled design.
