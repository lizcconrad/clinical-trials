  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the equivalence of two homeopathic capsaicin
      containing nasal sprays (Sinol-M™ and Sinol) in patients with nasal congestion due to
      allergic rhinitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sinol is an FDA registered, capsaicin-based, over-the-counter homeopathic nasal spray used
      for the relief of allergy and sinus conditions. It is an all-natural product that the patient
      uses on an as-needed basis for up to 12 times daily.

      Sinol has been available in the US since 2004. In 2009 a second generation product, Sinol-M
      will be launched. Sinol-M is identical to the original formula but also contains MucoAd
      MucoAd™ is a patented non-toxic, non-irritating, liquid polymer mucoadhesive carrier that
      prolongs the contact time between drug and mucosa, thus increasing bioavailability. It can be
      loaded with nearly any pharmaceutical preparation and delivered a variety of mucosal tissues.
      Reduced mucociliary clearance of intranasally-applied drugs is desirable to reduce the
      naturally-occurring washing out of topically applied medications.

      The objective of the current Phase IV, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, was to
      evaluate the frequency of use and efficacy of SINOL and SINOL + MucoAd™ (Sinol-M) and to
      demonstrate non-inferiority of Sinol-M versus the existing product Sinol.

      Additionally, as most homeopathic drugs are not supported by prospective clinical data there
      is a belief among many mainstream healthcare practitioners, and some consumers that these
      products do not work. This study therefore provides an opportunity to demonstrate improved
      efficacy versus no treatment (during the run-in and washout phases).
