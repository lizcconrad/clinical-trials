      RATIONALE: Gathering information about prostate cancer, treatment, and quality of life from
      gay men with prostate cancer may help doctors plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is collecting information about health-related quality of life
      from gay men with localized prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To enroll 200 gay men with localized prostate cancer in a cross-sectional study of
           prostate cancer outcomes.

        -  To complete an R01 application using pilot data collected from these patients.

        -  To complete manuscripts describing the factors that influence quality of life and
           treatment satisfaction in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete a web-based survey about their disease (biopsy Gleason score, PSA
      at diagnosis, and T-stage), treatment (treatment type, time since treatment, and use of
      healthcare services [e.g., oral medications for erectile dysfunction]), symptom distress, and
      psychosocial factors (ethnicity, health literacy, level of social support, communication with
      provider, relationship status, and communication with partner) that affect their
      health-related quality of life. The data will be used to provide the information necessary to
      tailor an existing prostate cancer survivorship intervention to address the specific needs of
      gay men with prostate cancer.
