      Randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccination versus referral for vaccination in the
      Emergency department. Is the Emergency Department an effective venue for vaccination for
      influenza? Does vaccination for influenza in the Emergency Department change the rates of
      influenza, influenza-like-illness or medical provider visits when compared with patient
      referred for vaccination in the community?

      This study is a prospective randomized, controlled trial of influenza vaccination vs referral
      for influenza vaccination in the Emergency Department. Subjects are either offered
      vaccination or education regarding vaccination and a list of community providers. At a
      four-month follow up, rates of influenza, influenza-like illness and number of medical
      provider visits are determined.
