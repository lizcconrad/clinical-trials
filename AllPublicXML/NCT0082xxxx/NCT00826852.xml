      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to assess the efficacy of the combination in terms of Objective (clinical and
           radiological) Response Rate

        -  to assess the time to progression of the disease; assess the safety profile of the
           combination, and assess the survival time.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically/cytologically confirmed inoperable locally advanced or metastatic
             non-small cell lung cancer

          -  ECOG Performance Status is 0-2

          -  At least one measurable lesion in two dimensions by means of CT scan

          -  No brain metastases

          -  No prior chemotherapy for this malignancy,

          -  Acceptable hematological profile (as defined by a leukocyte count ≥ 3000/mm3, a
             platelet count ≥ 100.000mm3 and Hb ≥ 9g/100mL), and adequate renal function (as
             defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5mg/dl or creatinine clearance measured in 24 hours
             urine ≥ 60 mL/min), and hepatic function (as defined by bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x maximum
             normal value even with hepatic metastasis; transaminases (ALT, AST) ≤ 2.5 x maximum
             normal value; alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x maximum normal value, except in case of a
             bone metastasis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant use of another anti-cancer therapy

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or curative surgery

          -  Evidence of intracerebral metastasis

          -  Unstable medical condition that makes the patient to take part in a clinical study
             (congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus),
             history of myocardial infarction within last 3 months, massive pleural or peritoneal
             effusion; or presence of serious uncontrolled infection, diarrhea, ileus, interstitial
             pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  Presence of other tumours different from basal cell carcinoma of the skin, with
             disease free survival less then 3 years.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding. In women of childbearing potential and in men, an adequate
             contraceptive method must be used

          -  Social or psychological condition that render the patient inadequate for the follow-up
             of the study

          -  Contraindication for any of the study drugs (e.g. history of hypersensitivity to any
             of the ingredients of the study drugs)

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
