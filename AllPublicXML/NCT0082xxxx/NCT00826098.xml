      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the effect of platelet rich plasma (PRP), a
      derivative of a patient's whole blood, on short-term patient outcomes following total knee
      replacement (TKR). The hypothesis is that change in short-term hemoglobin (Hgb) levels is
      less dramatic in patients who undergo TKR with the addition of PRP when compared to patients
      who undergo TKR without PRP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is a male or female who is undergoing primary unilateral surgery or the first
             surgery of a staged bilateral total knee replacement where the second stage will be at
             least 6 weeks later PRP in Total Knee.

          2. Patient agrees to be blinded to their treatment group assignment.

          3. Patient is willing and able to return for follow-up over at least a six (6) week
             post-operative period although longer follow-up is desired

          4. Patient agrees to participate by signing an IRB approved Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient will have a staged bilateral total knee replacement with the second stage to
             be performed less than 6 weeks after the first stage surgery

          2. Patient has had previous surgery on the operative knee that will necessitate the
             removal of existing hardware (e.g. previous osteotomy)

          3. Patient has a known adverse reaction or sensitivity to bovine (cow) thrombin (used as
             part of the platelet rich plasma system) or other bovine-derived products

          4. Patient has hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 (males), &lt; 11.0 (females)

          5. Patient clinically significant anxiety disorder

          6. Patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation medication and has an INR &gt; 1.3

          7. Patient has a severe bleeding disorder

          8. Patient has a known addiction to drugs or alcohol, including, but not limited to:
             chronic daily use of narcotic medications for more than 90 days prior to surgery

          9. Patient is pregnant

         10. Patient is a prisoner

         11. Patient is involved in a personal litigation (e.g. Worker's Compensation) that relates
             to their knee surgery

         12. Patient is actively participating in an investigational medical device, drug, or
             biologic clinical trial (active defined as having treatment within the last 30 days)
