    <textblock>
      Hundreds of thousands of couples in the United States experience infertility each year. When
      initial measures do not help, some couples require a process called ovarian stimulation and
      in vitro fertilization (IVF). Usually, a woman produces at most one egg each month. Ovarian
      stimulation helps these women make more than one egg per month. However, this involves taking
      hormones that stimulate the ovary to produce many eggs at one time. The stimulatory hormones
      injected with a small needle. The eggs are removed from the ovary through a surgical
      procedure and then placed in a dish for fertilization by sperm to form embryos. The embryos
      are grown in the laboratory then replaced into the woman's uterus 3-5 days later.

      The stimulation of the ovaries is important. Some patients undergo ovarian stimulation for
      IVF but do not respond to the treatment. This is a very difficult situation because even
      though several ovarian stimulation protocols have been used for poor responder patients, it
      is not clear which protocol works best. In fact, two of the most commonly used protocols have
      not been directly compared.

      This study will randomize (like flipping a coin) couples with a history of low response who
      are going to start IVF treatment into two groups. In one group the female partner will use a
      protocol called &quot;E2 patch/antagonist&quot;. These women will use an estrogen patch and injected
      antagonist for several days before starting injectable fertility medications. The other group
      will use a protocol called &quot;OCP/microdose&quot;. This group of women will use oral contraceptive
      pills (OCPs) and small doses of lupron along with the other injectable fertility medications.
      We will then follow their progress to see how many eggs they produce and how many women get
      pregnant.

    <textblock>
      Patients who have difficulty conceiving naturally often seek medical advice. These patients
      often undergo initial treatment with insemination using oral or injectable medications.
      However, if this fails to achieve a pregnancy, patients often undergo in vitro fertilization
      (IVF). IVF is a process which involves a protocol of injectable medications to stimulate the
      ovary to produce several eggs at once. These eggs are retrieved under ultrasound guidance and
      fertilized in the laboratory. After 3-5 days of growth in the laboratory, the appropriate
      number of embryos is then transferred back to the patient's uterus.

      Sometimes, patients who go through ovarian stimulation and IVF do not respond well. These
      patients have low estrogen levels, few eggs retrieved, and fewer embryos to transfer back to
      the uterus. Overall, they have lower pregnancy rates than other patients. It is not clear
      which medication protocol would give them the highest chance of pregnancy. Two protocols, one
      called the &quot;E2/antagonist&quot; protocol and the other called the &quot;OCP/microdose&quot; protocol, are
      routinely used in poor responder patients. But, they have never been prospectively compared
      so it is not possible to say whether one approach is better.

      In order to determine which medication protocol results in more pregnancies, we propose to
      randomize poor responder patients who are scheduled to undergo treatment with IVF to one of
      these two protocols. These two protocols are already standard care in IVF centers around the
      world. Following randomization, the clinical care of study participants will be the same as
      all other IVF patients. Specifically, the adjustment of medication, egg retrieval, and embryo
      transfer procedures will be identical to non-study patients undergoing IVF.

      HYPOTHESIS We hypothesize that the poor responder patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for
      IVF with the E2/antagonist protocol will have a higher pregnancy rate than those in the
      OCP/microdose group.
