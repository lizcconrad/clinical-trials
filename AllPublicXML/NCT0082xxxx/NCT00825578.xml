      Hypothesis: Patients with advanced emphysema with predominance of the disease in areas other
      than the upper lobes, as determined by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), could have
      a positive response to valve treatment.

    <intervention_name>Intra-bronchial valve (Spiration IBV)</intervention_name>
    <description>Device: Intra-bronchial valve (Spiration IBV) The IBV is comprised of a Nitnol frame and a polymer membrane, which is held against the airway mucosa by six elastic struts and will expand and contract with airway movement during breathing. The valve is designed to conform to the size and shape of the airways. The frame has 5 flexible anchors that gently secure to the mucosal wall at a controlled depth. Valves are available in 5, 6 and 7mm diameters appropriate for different airways. During a minimally invasive procedure, a catheter is passed through a bronchoscope (a flexible tube passed into the airways through the mouth) to deploy the umbrella-shaped valves into the airways. Only flexible bronchoscopy equipment is required. The valves are designed to be removed if indicated.</description>
