    <textblock>
      To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of INCB007839 given as multiple doses for 28
      days and to determine if a higher MTD can be established when INCB007839 is administered in
      combination with prophylactic anticoagulation and with a 2 and a half day (5 doses) treatment
      interruption every two weeks.
