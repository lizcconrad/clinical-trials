    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the genetic causes of diabetes.
      Specifically, we are interested in the mitochondrial genome and how variants in the
      mitochondrial genome influence a person's risk to develop diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

    <textblock>
      Since our laboratory's initial linkage of Type 2 diabetes to a mtDNA rearrangement in a three
      generation maternal pedigree 13 years ago, there has been increasing support for our
      hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in the etiology of Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and the overlapping Metabolic Syndrome (MS). With this study we are
      planning an extensive investigation of defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
      (OXPHOS) caused potentially by deleterious sequence variants in the mitochondrial DNA
      (mtDNA). As the primary objective we are trying to further substantiate 2 hypotheses: 1) that
      these diabetogenic mtDNA variants, which are proposed to range from recent, relatively
      severe, mutations will result in substantial OXPHOS defects with familial DM &amp; MS and 2) that
      ancient, relatively mild polymorphisms result in partial OXPHOS defects and an increase in
      the risk to develop DM &amp; MS.

        We are currently recruiting Chinese Americans living in Southern California, espcially in
        Orange and Los Angeles Counties. We are particularly in need of Chinese American men and
        women with diabetes as well as healthy male controls. We can arrange for offsite weekend
        trips to cities within LA or Orange Counties for eligible groups of 10 or more people.
