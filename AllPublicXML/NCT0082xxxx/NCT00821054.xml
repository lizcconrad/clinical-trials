                  oophorectomy (ovariectomy); has had a bilateral tubal ligation, or is
                  post-menopausal (a demonstration of total cessation of menses for ≥ 1 year) or in
                  questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone
                  (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is confirmatory.

               2. Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and
                  agrees to one of the following: double-barrier contraception (condom with
                  spermicidal jelly, foam, suppository, or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male
                  condom and diaphragm); complete abstinence from sexual intercourse from two weeks
                  prior to administration of the study drug, throughout the active study treatment
                  period; vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry
                  and is the sole sexual partner for that female.

             disease per investigator assessment).

          -  Has evidence of symptomatic or uncontrolled brain metastases or leptomeningeal
             disease. Subjects with brain metastases treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy are
             eligible if neurologically stable and do not require steroids or anticonvulsants.

          -  Is considered medically unfit for the study by the investigator as a result of the
             medical interview, physical exam, or screening investigations.

          -  Has a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to the investigational product such as gefitinib [Iressa] and
