      Use 24hr Holter ECG, ultrasound and cardiac fibrosis markers in the chronic kidney disease
      patients

      24hr Holter examination is a non-invasive tool in detecting and diagnosing cardiac
      arrhythmia. Moreover, Heart rate variability has been proven to been an important prognostic
      factor in many cardiovascular diseases. The traditional linear analysis of heart rate
      variability proved to predict clinical outcome in myocardial infarction patients. The more
      delicate non-linear analysis in heart rate variability is one of the hot topics in the world.

      Despite some biochemical values like WBC counts, platelet counts, BUN, creatinine, lactate,
      clinical vital parameters like blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygenation have been used to
      predict clinical outcome in chronic renal disease(CKD) patients, the application is still
      limited. It is an international interest to find a more safe and simple technique to identify
      important prognostic factors in CKD patients. Our project aimed to recruit these CKD patients
      from our hospital and conduct a cross-sectional study. Cardiac ultrasonography and 24hrs
      Holter will be arranged. Linear and non-linear analysis of heart rate variability will be
      performed and serum marker that influence prognosis like WBC count, platelet count, lactate,
      BUN, creatinine, fibrosis marker and adiponectin will be checked. Short term and long term
      outcome was followed and identify important prognostic factors to improve and detect clinical
      prognosis.
