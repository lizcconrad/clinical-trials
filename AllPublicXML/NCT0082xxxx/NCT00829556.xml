  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to investigate the potential benefits of using a special type
      of fluid that can be applied to the skin (Integuseal) in addition to standard surgical skin
      preparation in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THA) or total knee replacement
      (TKA). Integuseal is supposed to lock down the skin bacteria and reduce skin infection and
      other problems. This study will investigate whether Integuseal is effective in reducing
      persistent wound drainage when used in addition to standard surgical skin preparation for
      total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee replacement (TKA).
