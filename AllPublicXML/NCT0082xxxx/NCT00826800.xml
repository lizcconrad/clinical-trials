  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving chemo-therapy for colon cancer before surgery
      can shrink the cancer and lead to a higher rate of cure than operating first and then giving
      chemotherapy. Standard treatment for colon cancer is to first operate, and then, if the tumor
      is advanced, give chemotherapy for about 6 months. However, surgery delays the time until
      chemotherapy can start, since the body needs time to heal from the operation. During this
      time any cancer cells that remain in the body that were not removed by the operation may be
      allowed to grow. Giving chemotherapy first could attack the cancer cells right from the
      start, not only at the tumor site that we know of, but also at the site of any cancer cells
      that may have spread to other parts of the body. Another possible reason why giving chemo
      therapy first might work better is that the blood vessels that feed the cancer cells are
      intact before surgery and thus chemotherapy can travel directly to the cancer.

      This study will also use the drug bevacizumab, in addition to the standard chemotherapy.
      Bevacizumab has been on the market since 2004 for colon cancer that has spread to other
      organs, but its use in earlier stage colon cancer, as planned in this trial, is still under
      study.

    <description>FOLFOX and bevacizumab will be given to colon cancer patients for 4 cycles over 8 weeks; an additional 2 cycles of FOLFOX without bevacizumab will be given for a total of 12 weeks of pre-operative chemotherapy.Restaging will be performed within 3 weeks of the 6th chemotherapy cycle. Colon surgery will be performed between weeks 3 and 6 subsequent to the 6th cycle of FOLFOX. Patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy without radiation will wait a minimum of 3 weeks from their last dose of chemotherapy, and 6 weeks from their last dose of bevacizumab, before proceeding to surgery. Specifically, it is intended that patients will undergo surgery between 3-6 weeks from completion of their neoadjuvant therapy as deemed clinically appropriate by their surgeon and medical oncologist. This permits a 7-10 week interval between the 4th bevacizumab administration and colon surgery.</description>

    <description>The patient will receive six treatments, two weeks apart. On each treatment day you will get Oxaliplatin, 5-FU,Leucovorin. On the first four treatments you will also get Bevacizumab (Avastin). These drugs are given through a Mediport. They will be given in an outpatient chemotherapy unit. Each tx will take about 4 hours. A pump for the 5-FU is worn around your waist. This drug is given over 2 days. Part II: Colon Cancer Surgery is standard practice, and is not a research procedure.Part III: Post-operative Re-Evaluation and Recovery The doctor will decide on the type of chemotherapy based on how the patient responded to the first chemotherapy. The plan will be for the patient to get 6 more doses of FOLFOX, without any further bevacizumab, unless your doctor finds a reason to do otherwise.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  NOTE: Patients may sign consent and be registered for this protocol prior to
             completion of assessment of criteria 6.1.1 and 6.1.2, (assuming all other eligibility
             criteria are met) so that endocolonic ultrasound and biopsy may be performed on study;
             as these procedures may be necessary to determine TNM staging and/or histopathology;
             however criteria 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 must be successfully met prior to patient receiving
             chemotherapy on this trial.

          -  6.1.1 Clinical T1N1-2/T2N1-2/T3N0/T3N1-2/T4Ni-N2 adenocarcinomas of the colon
             determined by endocolonic ultrasound (ECUS) performed at MSKCC.

          -  6.1.2 Colonoscopy with endoscopic biopsy of tumor at MSKCC for disease confirmation
             and correlative studies. Pathological confirmation of adenocarcinoma or poorly
             differentiated carcinoma as the primary histology.

             considered for protocol participation provided that they are on stable doses of
             anticoagulant therapy. Similarly, patients anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation or
             other conditions may participate provided that they are on stable dose of
             anticoagulant therapy. Clinicians must note the higher risk of bevacizumab therapy
             amongst patients with history of thromboembolic disorders and consideration for
             participation is at the discretion of the treating physician.

          -  No other experimental therapies (including chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal
