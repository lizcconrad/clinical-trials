      This is a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial comparing induction chemotherapy with
      Docetaxel, Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (TPF) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (Arm
      A) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone (Arm B), in nasopharyngeal cancers staged as T2b,
      T3, T4 and/or with lymph node involvement (≥ N1. The main end point is the event free
      survival.

      The treatments are :

      Arm A:

      induction chemotherapy: Docetaxel (75 mg/m² administered on D1 of each course, every 3 weeks
      via one-hour IV infusion) + Cisplatin(75 mg/m² administered on D1 via one-hour infusion )+
      5-FU (750 mg/m²/d administered as a continuous infusion from D1 to D5. The cycles will be
      repeated every 3 weeks up to a total of 3 courses.

      followed by chemoradiotherapy with Cisplatin (40 mg/m2 starting on D1 of the radiation
      therapy) during 7 weeks

      Arm B: Chemoradiotherapy with Cisplatin alone (40 mg/m2 starting on D1 of the radiation
      therapy) during 7 weeks
