  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers are being invited to take part in a research study about insulin therapy of
      diabetes. They are being invited to take part in this research study because they have
      diabetes and have an illness requiring hospitalization. If they volunteer to take part in
      this study, they will be one of about 120 people to do so. The investigators hope to answer
      the following research questions:

        -  To show that insulin aspart protamine 70/30 mix taken twice daily is as good as insulin
           NPH/Reg 70/30 mix taken twice a day for treatment of diabetes after discharge from the
           hospital.

        -  To show how safe the two medicines are (insulin aspart 70/30 mix vs. insulin NPH/Reg
           70/30 mix) and how well they work for the treatment of diabetes when transitioning from
           inpatient therapy to outpatient care.

      By doing this study, we hope to learn the optimal way to use insulin therapy to treat
      individuals during a hospitalization for an illness as well as during the recovery phase of
      the illness for twenty-four weeks after discharge from the hospital.
