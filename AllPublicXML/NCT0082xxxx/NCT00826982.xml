    <textblock>
      The major goal of this project is to reduce unnecessary pancreatic resections, namely
      resection in those patients with non-regional lymph node metastatses that cannot be cured
      with surgical resection. By combined minimally invasive methods for non-surgical biopsy and
      highly sensitive molecular assays for cancer cells, we believe we can increase the ability to
      detect distant lymph node metastases prior to surgical resection, and direct those patients
      for more appropriate therapy (including possible neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with or without
      surgery). We hypothesize that the combination of EUS-FNA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      of a multimarker panel will increase the sensitivity for malignant lymph nodes compared with
      EUS-FNA cytology in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
