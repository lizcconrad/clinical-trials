    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) to last dose of eltrombopag/early withdrawal visit (up to 981 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medical product, whether or not related to the product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or its prolongation, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is another event considered serious. A drug-related AE is any AE that was judged to have a relationship with the study medication by the investigator. The severity of an AE is based on the investigator's clinical judgment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE) and/or Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Within the Indicated Category</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medical product, whether or not related to the product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or its prolongation, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is another event considered serious. A drug-related AE is any AE that was judged to have a relationship with the study medication by the investigator. The severity of an AE is based on the investigator's clinical judgment.</description>

            <description>Participants took eltrombopag orally once daily in the fasted state at an individualized dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg; the starting dose was the last dose in the prior eltrombopag study, TRA108109 (NCT00540423). Depending on the participant's platelet count at each visit, a dose modification guideline allowed participants to increase/reduce the dose or interrupt the eltrombopag treatment.</description>

Depending on the participant's platelet count at each visit, a dose modification guideline allowed participants to increase/reduce the dose or interrupt the eltrombopag treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants took eltrombopag orally once daily in the fasted state at an individualized dose of 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg; the starting dose was the last dose in the prior eltrombopag study, TRA108109 (NCT00540423). Depending on the participant's platelet count at each visit, a dose modification guideline allowed participants to increase/reduce the dose or interrupt the eltrombopag treatment.</description>
