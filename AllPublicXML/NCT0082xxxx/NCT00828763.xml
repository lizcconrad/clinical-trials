      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation

             monitoring.

          -  Male subjects between 30 and 55 years of age.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 84 days after the dose of study medication.

          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2
             (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Available to complete the study (minimum of 6 and a maximum of 11 nights confinement
             in the clinical research unit).

          -  A history of regular bowel movements (averaging one or more bowel movements per day).

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). A single repeat is
             allowed for eligibility determination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof, or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including antacids, vitamins, herbal
             and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the
             drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the
             first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK
             Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety.

          -  If heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to
             heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks/week. One drink is equivalent to (12 g alcohol) =
             5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80
             proof distilled spirits.

          -  Has a history or regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3
             months prior to screening.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Subjects who have received a total body radiation dose of greater than 5.0 mSv (upper
             limit of WHO category II) or exposure to significant radiation (e.g. serial x-ray or
             CT scans, barium meal etc) in the 12 months prior to this study.

          -  Any condition that could interfere with the accurate assessment and recovery of
             radiocarbon [14C].

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             45-100 bpm. A single repeat is allowed to determine eligibility

          -  ECG within protocol criteria
