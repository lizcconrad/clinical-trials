  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the overall effectiveness of short-time
      anti-arrhythmic drug treatment with amiodarone (to control heart rhythm) to prevent short-and
      long-term atrial fibrillation following an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and it is associated with
      increased mortality and morbidity due to increased risk of stroke, poor quality of life and
      risk of developing heart failure.

      Today, catheter ablation has become a standard procedure in the treatment of symptomatic
      atrial fibrillation, but so far there is no official recommendations regarding the use of
      antiarrythmic drugs after the procedure. Nevertheless, it is common standard practice to
      prescribe antiarrhythmic drugs for the first 2-3 months after the intervention to prevent
      early recurrences. To our knowledge, the effect of antiarrythmic drugs following ablation for
      atrial fibrillation has only been evaluated in a few recent studies. None of these have
      evaluated the long term effect of short term antiarrythmic drug treatment. In addition, none
      of the trials have been conducted placebo-controlled.

      In this study patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation will be considered
      for randomisation. Following the ablation procedure, patients will be randomized to receive
      either amiodarone or placebo for a period of 8 weeks. Clinical visits including a physical
      exam, 12 lead ECG recording and blood samples, will be scheduled during the follow-up time.
      Furthermore patients will be evaluated with Quality of Life questionaires and Holter
      monitoring.

      The primary endpoint of the study is freedom from atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or
      atrial tachycardia at 6 months follow-up.
