      Background: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are often reported in
      institutions for the elderly.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a staff education intervention to manage BPSD in
      older people with a diagnosis of dementia.

      Methods: The trial was conducted in 16 nursing homes; 306 patients with a diagnosis of
      dementia and presenting BPSD were selected. Nursing homes were randomly allocated to an
      intervention group or a control group. An eight-week staff education and training programme
      was conducted in the nursing homes in the intervention group. The main outcome measures were
      the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and an observation scale score. Assessments
      were done at baseline (W0), at the end of the 'intervention' period (W8) and 12 weeks after
      (W20).
