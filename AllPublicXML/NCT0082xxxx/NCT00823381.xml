  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the antioxidant &quot;resveratrol&quot; to a
      diet intervention (Calorie Restriction) to determine how each of them affects the following:
      gene expression profile, cholesterol (lipids), how well the hormone insulin works to control
      your blood sugar, and other blood and tissue markers of metabolic and cardiovascular health.

      Resveratrol is found in grape skin, wine, peanuts, and mulberries and is thought to have
      health benefits such as improving fat metabolism, insulin action, and possibly extending
      lifespan. Resvida™ is the name for the dietary supplement containing the natural antioxidant
      &quot;resveratrol&quot;. Resvida™ will be supplied by DSM Nutritional Products, Ltd.

      Resvida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is regulated like a food. The U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and dietary supplements. The makers of
      Resvida™ make no claim that this supplement is meant to treat any ailment.

      Calorie restriction (CR) is a low calorie diet (about 30% fewer calories than the American
      Dietetic Association (ADA) recommends). Calorie restriction has also been linked to health
      benefits (enhanced cardiovascular and metabolic health) and an extended lifespan.

      This study is designed to compare the health benefits of both resveratrol and CR and to
      determine if resveratrol mimics some of the health benefits shown with CR.
