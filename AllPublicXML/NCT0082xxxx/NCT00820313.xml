    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the proposed research is to examine the relationship of lifestyle changes
      to new dietary, biomedical, and cellular parameters among new enrollees entering the &quot;Dr.
      Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease program&quot; at 5 selected sites. Specifically,
      the investigators will add assessments of emerging cardiac risk factors (e.g., high
      sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], fibrinogen, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], small, dense LDL,
      apolipoprotein B [apoB], apolipoprotein A-I [apo A1], the apoB/apoA1 ratio, homocysteine
      [Hcy], B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP], oxidized LDL, fasting insulin and waist-to-hip ratio
      [WHR]), protective and pathogenic dietary markers (e.g., folate, carotenoids, trans fatty
      acids), and measures of social support and cognitive functioning to the already existing
      assessment variables in the Multisite Cardiac Lifestyle Intervention Program (MCLIP).

      Hypothesis 1: Participation in the lifestyle program will not only be associated with
      favorable changes in standard coronary risk factors and quality of life, but also with
      improvements in emerging cardiac risk factors [hsCRP, Hcy, BNP, fibrinogen, Lp(a), small,
      dense LDL, apoB, apoA1, oxidized LDL, fasting insulin, and abdominal obesity] and
      psychosocial well-being (i.e., social support, and cognitive functioning).

      Hypothesis 2: High intake of emerging protective dietary factors and low intake of emerging
      pathogenic dietary factors will be associated with improvements in both standard and emerging
      cardiac risk factors (e.g. Hcy, oxidized LDL).

      Hypothesis 3: Degree of adherence to the lifestyle change program will be associated with
      differential improvement in standard coronary risk factors, emerging risk factors, cellular
      aging, and psychosocial variables.

    <description>Exercise: At least 3 hours of aerobic exercise per week, 30 minutes per session. Additionally, patients are asked to perform a minimum of 2 strength training sessions per week.
Stress Management: Integrates stretching, relaxation, breathing techniques, meditation and guided imagery. Patients are asked to practice these techniques at least 1 hour per day.
Diet: Approximately 10% daily calories from fat, 15% protein and 75% complex carbohydrates (low-fat, whole foods, primarily plant-based).
Group Support: Weekly group support sessions provide social support to help patients adhere to and sustain the lifestyle-change program.</description>
