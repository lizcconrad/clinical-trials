  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of dasatinib that can be safely given
      to a patient when the drug is given in combination with the known anticancer drug paclitaxel.
      Paclitaxel is an established anti-cancer drug, used in the treatment of many cancers, and it
      is an approved treatment for breast cancer. Dasatinib has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for use as a single therapy in another kind of cancer, but its use in breast
      cancer patients, and in combination with paclitaxel is investigational.

      In this study, we will test the safety of dasatinib when given at different dose levels in
      combination with paclitaxel. We want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on the
      patient and on metastatic breast cancer.

    <description>The phase I portion is a standard, three-patient per cohort, dose escalation schedule will be used. Between 6 and 54 patients will likely be necessary to determine the MTD of dasatinib in combination with weekly paclitaxel.
The phase II portion of this trial has a Simon two-stage design to determine the efficacy of dasatinib when administered in combination with paclitaxel.</description>

    <description>A treatment cycle will consist of 28 days, according to the following schedule:
Dasatinib 120MG PO once daily, Weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 hour on day 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle.
The trial will initially test the combination of weekly paclitaxel and dasatinib given PO, once daily , continuously. In case of 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in the first cohort (0), the next cohort will test dasatinib given with a different schedule, 5 days on and 2 days off, omitting dasatinib the day prior and the day of administration of paclitaxel.</description>

             chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with or without
             stress test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule out QTc
             prolongation. The patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the discretion of the
