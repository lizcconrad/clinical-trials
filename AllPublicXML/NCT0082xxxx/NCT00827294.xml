  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the study are to determine whether self-delivered, home-based mirror therapy
      decreases the frequency and intensity of phantom limb pain and improves mood and physical
      function in persons with phantom limb pain.

      The investigators hypothesize that self-delivered home-based mirror therapy will
      significantly decrease phantom pain intensity, will improve mood, and will improve function
      at one-month follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in phantom pain intensity (from baseline to one month; also measured at 2 months and 3 months to see if treatment gains are sustained). Pain intensity is measured with the Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf)at all time points</measure>
    <time_frame>Months: 1, 2, 3; our primary outcome is pain change at month 1</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome will be determined by measuring change in depressive symptoms (using the Center for Epidemiology Depression Scale (CES-D) (comparing baseline levels of depressive symptoms to one month)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at months 1, 2, 3; Our main interest is outcome for depression at month 1</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome will be determined by measuring changes in pain-related anxiety levels (baseline to one month) as measured by the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at months 1-3; primary interest in outcome at month 1</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep quality. Outcome for sleep quality will be measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome will be measured at months 1-3 with our main interest being outcome at month 1</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing. We will measure outcome for pain catastrophizing with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome will be measured at months 1-3 with our main interest being outcome at month 1</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain medication usage. We will measure whether mirror therapy decreases pain medication usage.</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome will be measured at months 1-3 with our main interest being month 1</time_frame>

    <description>The study is designed as a single group trial comparing pre- and post-treatment measures. Up to 40 subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will receive instruction in performing mirror therapy at home, either in person or by viewing a DVD. Subjects will be asked to practice mirror therapy 20-30 minutes daily. Prior to beginning treatment, subjects will complete standard questionnaires designed to measure phantom pain level, function, depressive symptoms, pain-related anxiety, catastrophizing, and sleep quality. Subjects will also be asked about current use of pain medications and demographic data will be collected. Subjects will complete the same questionnaires 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months after beginning treatment. Subjects will also be asked to keep a daily diary to record the frequency of their home treatment sessions. Study staff will check in with the study subjects weekly for the first month after beginning treatment, and monthly thereafter.</description>
