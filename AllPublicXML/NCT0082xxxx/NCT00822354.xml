  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that tadalafil will increase digital blood flow and improve the
      symptoms and signs of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of our study is to decrease the frequency, duration and severity of
      vasospastic attacks in patients with secondary Raynaud's. The secondary goal is to document
      increased blood flow and lessened capillary dysfunction in these patients. Both of these
      goals are to be achieved using a course of treatment with Tadalafil.We anticipate a decrease
      in the frequency, duration and severity of Raynaud's attacks. Improved digital blood flow and
      digital blood pressures, and a decrease in digital capillary dysfunction.

    <measure>Number of Raynaud's Phenomenon Attacks Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects kept a daily record of the number of Raynaud's phenomenon attacks they experienced per day. Results are reported from data collected at Baseline/Week 0, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 9 visits. In subjects receiving tadalafil followed by placebo: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-treatment, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment, Week 5 data is Pre-placebo, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo. In subjects receiving placebo followed by tadalafil: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-placebo, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo, Week 5 data is Pre-treatment, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Raynaud's Phenomenon Attacks</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects kept a daily record of the number of Raynaud's phenomenon attacks they experienced per day and the duration of each attack. Results are reported from data collected at Baseline/Week 0, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 9 visits. In subjects receiving tadalafil followed by placebo: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-treatment, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment, Week 5 data is Pre-placebo, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo. In subjects receiving placebo followed by tadalafil: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-placebo, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo, Week 5 data is Pre-treatment, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Raynaud Severity Visual Analog Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a 100 millimeter (mm) line where 0 mm (left boundary) represents Raynaud's disease of low severity, and 100 mm (right boundary) represents extremely severe Raynaud's disease. The subject makes a vertical mark on the VAS to indicate the severity of Raynaud's disease over the past two weeks. The Raynaud's severity score is the distance from the left boundary to the vertical mark in mm. Results are reported from data collected at Baseline/Week 0, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 9 visits. In subjects receiving tadalafil followed by placebo: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-treatment, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment, Week 5 data is Pre-placebo, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo. In subjects receiving placebo followed by tadalafil: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-placebo, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo, Week 5 data is Pre-treatment, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Raynaud's Condition Score (RCS) Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a 100 millimeter (mm) line where 0 mm (left boundary) represents no difficulty with Raynaud's disease, and 100 mm (right boundary) represents extreme difficulty with Raynaud's disease. The subject makes a vertical mark on the VAS to indicate difficulty experienced that day with Raynaud's disease. The RCS is the distance from the left boundary to the vertical mark in mm. Results are reported from data collected at Baseline/Week 0, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 9 visits. In subjects receiving tadalafil followed by placebo: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-treatment, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment, Week 5 data is Pre-placebo, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo. In subjects receiving placebo followed by tadalafil: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-placebo, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo, Week 5 data is Pre-treatment, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment.</description>

        <description>The VAS is a 100 millimeter (mm) line where 0 mm (left boundary) represents Raynaud's disease of low severity, and 100 mm (right boundary) represents extremely severe Raynaud's disease. The subject makes a vertical mark on the VAS to indicate the severity of Raynaud's disease over the past two weeks. The Raynaud's severity score is the distance from the left boundary to the vertical mark in mm. Results are reported from data collected at Baseline/Week 0, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 9 visits. In subjects receiving tadalafil followed by placebo: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-treatment, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment, Week 5 data is Pre-placebo, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo.

          <description>Results are reported from data collected at Baseline/Week 0, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 9 visits. In subjects receiving tadalafil followed by placebo: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-treatment, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment, Week 5 data is Pre-placebo, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo. In subjects receiving placebo followed by tadalafil: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-placebo, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo, Week 5 data is Pre-treatment, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment.</description>
          <population>Two of the ten enrolled subjects were excluded from analysis: one subject due to early withdrawal, and a second subject to avoid bias due to bilateral subclavian stent placement midway through the study. For subject 8, Baseline/Week 0 data was used for both Pre-treatment and Pre-placebo, and Week 2 data was used for Week 4 of placebo.</population>

        <title>Raynaud's Condition Score (RCS) Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>The VAS is a 100 millimeter (mm) line where 0 mm (left boundary) represents no difficulty with Raynaud's disease, and 100 mm (right boundary) represents extreme difficulty with Raynaud's disease. The subject makes a vertical mark on the VAS to indicate difficulty experienced that day with Raynaud's disease. The RCS is the distance from the left boundary to the vertical mark in mm. Results are reported from data collected at Baseline/Week 0, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 9 visits. In subjects receiving tadalafil followed by placebo: Baseline/Week 0 data is Pre-treatment, Week 4 data corresponds to Week 4 of treatment, Week 5 data is Pre-placebo, and Week 9 data corresponds to Week 4 of placebo.
