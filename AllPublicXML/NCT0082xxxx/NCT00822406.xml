  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 41 adults with perennial allergic rhinitis were enrolled in a first double-blind
      placebo-controlled phase for six months, and treated on a weekly basis with sublingual doses
      of single individualized homeopathic medicines or placebo. After this closed initial phase,
      all patients were invited to participate in an long-term open-label controlled phase, in that
      they would receive homeopathic treatment for the maximum period of 36 months, and the results
      were compared with the improvement of initial phase. Signs and symptoms scores, rescue
      medication requirements and quality of life were assessed by questionnaires and personal
      clinical evaluation by a same independent researcher, before and after each phase. Primary
      and secondary clinical outcome were, respectively, specific and general allergic signs and
      symptoms scores. Total IgE titles were performed before and after each phase.
