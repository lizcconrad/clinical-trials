      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a novel non-invasive method for
      swallowing disorders detection in geriatrics.

      Interest: swallowing disorders exist at any age. More common among the elderly, their
      prevalence is estimated at between 15 and 50% of more than 60 years. Recognized today as a
      health problem of particular concern within this population, their pathological consequences
      are multiple and severe: inhalation pneumonia, often a complication of &quot;the wrong track&quot;, was
      recognized in the USA in 1989, as 5th cause of death among patients aged 65, and the 3rd
      leading cause of death of patients over 85 years. Malnutrition facilitates infections by
      depression of the immune system and promotes the development of bedsores. The swallowing
      disorders resulting in an increase in the prevalence of dehydration, social isolation, but
      also an increase in mortality. Faced with such consequences, it is therefore necessary to
      have a reliable, non-invasive approach adapted to the fragility of the elderly to detect
      these disorders in order to promote preventive strategies and / or curative justified.

      Originality: This work, which is part of a clinical approach uses a new method of swallowing
      study, described in A. Moreau-Gaudry's Medicine thesis : &quot;Assets of the respiratory
      inductance plethysmography to the study of swallowing in geriatrics.&quot; The originality of this
      lies in the combination of Respiratory Plethysmography by inductance (RPI) to the informatic
      tool. The PRI allows continuous recording, thanks to a vest connected to a laptop, the
      patient's breathing rate. Readily available at the patient's bedside, it is non-invasive and
      perfectly suited to the fragility of the study population. The tool, by its automatic
      guarantees objectivity and reproducibility of the analysis of deglutitions from respiratory
      signal provided by the RPI.
