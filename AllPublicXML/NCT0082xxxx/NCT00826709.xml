      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the fluID Rapid Influenza Test's ability
      in detecting influenza A and influenza B from individuals presenting with signs and symptoms
      of influenza-like illness (ILI).

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity
      of the fluID Rapid Influenza Test in detecting influenza A and influenza B, as evaluated with
      respect to fresh samples collected prospectively from individuals presenting with signs and
      symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI). Test results will be compared with those obtained
      from viral culture testing of samples using the same specimen types, obtained from the same
      subjects. The specimen types under evaluation in this study will be nasal swab,
      nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash and aspirate specimens.

      A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the fluID Rapid Influenza
      Test in detecting each of the H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A, in nasal swab,
      nasopharyngeal swab, nasal wash and aspirate specimens.

    <description>The fluID™ Rapid Influenza Test is an in vitro diagnostic assay designed to be used with a reader for the qualitative detection of influenza type A and type B nucleoprotein antigens, and the differentiation of influenza type A subtypes A/H1 and A/H3 antigens associated with the seasonal influenza H1N1 and H3N2, in nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs and nasal wash/aspirate specimens. The test is intended as an aid in the rapid, qualitative diagnosis of influenza type A and type B viral infections in patients symptomatic with influenza-like illness. The fluID™ Rapid Influenza Test is intended for use by a healthcare professional in a laboratory or Point-of-Care (POC).</description>

                  rectally; or a self-reported history of fever or feeling feverish (includes fever
                  controlled by medication) in the absence of documented fever;

               -  One or more respiratory symptoms of influenza-like illness which may include the
                  following:

               -  Sore throat;

               -  Runny or stuffy nose;
