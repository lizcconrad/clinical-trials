      Objective: Randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, clinical trial to examine
      the effects of the food additive glutamate (in the form of MSG) on IBS and fibromyalgia.

      Setting and Subjects: The Fibromyalgia Research Database at OHSU will be utilized to identify
      and recruit fibromyalgia patients who also have IBS to OHSU study centers.

      Intervention: Approximately 60 male and female subjects aged 18-75 will be placed on a
      1-month glutamate-free elimination diet. Those that respond positively to the diet (we are
      estimating 30-40 subjects), will then be randomized to receive either a citrus drink
      containing 5 grams of MSG; or placebo (the citrus drink alone)on three consecutive days one
      week apart.

      The investigators are hypothesizing that those who react positively to the elimination diet
      will have symptom occurrence statistically more frequently when given the glutamate
      challenge, than when given placebo.
