    <textblock>
      Internet plays a more and more important role in many applications of healthcare. Many
      researches on the integrations of internet and mental health care have been proposed in
      recent years. This project aims at the development of an online treatment system which
      combines the biofeedback therapy and the web technologies to treat the patients suffering
      from panic disorder with partial response to medications. This project also evaluates the
      efficacy of a new- designed wireless temperature biofeedback ring.

      The participants should be chronic panic patients. They login an web-based server and
      practice muscle relaxation on-line every day. There will be two two parallel groups: one
      group practicing muscle relaxation only and the other practicing muscle relaxation with
      finger surface temperature monitor through a wireless biofeedback ring.
