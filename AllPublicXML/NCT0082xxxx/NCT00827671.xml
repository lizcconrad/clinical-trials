  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of the combination between
      cetuximab and radiotherapy to the standard chemotherapy for resectable oesophageal cancer is
      safe and adds efficacy.

      This study aims at developing a novel strategy to optimize the treatment of oesophageal
      adenocarcinoma and gastro-oesophageal junctional tumors with curative intent. Surgery in
      combination with peri-operative chemotherapy, using the combination epirubicin, cisplatin and
      5-FU, as defined by the recent MAGIC trial, results in 13% increase in 5-yr survival. To
      improve the outcome of patients with this disease we hypothesize that the addition of
      pre-operative combined cetuximab-radiotherapy (cetux-RT) treatment could improve the outcome
      of this patient category through better local control.
