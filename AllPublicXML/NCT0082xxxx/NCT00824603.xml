  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a continuing medical education (CME) program can
      change primary care providers' use of insulin therapy - their confidence in selecting doses
      and engagement of patients in the decision making as to whether to initiate insulin therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will determine whether attendees' self-reported confidence and use of insulin with persons
      with type 2 diabetes changes after they attend the CME program. Specifically, we will address
      the following questions:

      Question 1. Clinical guidelines. Is insulin initiated earlier (at a lower A1C)?

      Question 2. Decision-making. Does confidence in selecting a starting insulin regimen change?
      Does confidence in selecting a starting insulin dose change? Does confidence in adjusting
      insulin change? Does confidence in discussion nutrition guidelines change?

      Question 3. Application. Do more patients start using insulin? Who usually selects starting
      dose? How is starting dose selected? How often is insulin adjusted?

      Question 4. Resources. How available are protocols for insulin use? How available is adequate
      time to monitor insulin therapy? How available is staff to teach insulin injections? How
      available is staff to help adjust insulin?
