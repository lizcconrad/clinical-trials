      The aim of the study is to compare the hospitalisation period in ORL surgery for two groups
      of patients. One of them will be treated for alcohol addiction to weaning them before the
      surgery ORL. The other group will be treated with usual methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol, associated or not associated with tobacco, is known to increase the incidence of ORL
      cancer. So, in fact many patients perform their ORL surgery operation in spite of their
      alcohol addiction.

      Many studies showed that a post surgery weaning syndrome increases morbidity and mortality.

      So our study will focuses on the benefits of pre surgery medical weaning program.

      The protocol is an open randomised, prospective study. The patient will be divided in two
      groups. In one hand, the first group is designed as &quot;treated&quot; will get alcohol weaning in the
      hospital alcohol department. The patient will be hospitalized during one week before the ORL
      surgery.

      During this hospitalisation, the patient will receive medicinal treatment, medical follow-up
      and psychological counselling.

      In the other hand, the second group designed as &quot;control group&quot; will be hospitalized directly
      in ORL surgery department. The patient will be received a treatment for alcohol weaning
      according to their symptom.

      After their hospitalisation, the treated group will be followed-up regularly for their
      alcohol addiction either in support group or in individual counselling. The control group
      will be followed-up with the usual method in the ORL surgery department.

      The expected result is to improve the care for patients with alcohol addiction and who must
      have an ORL surgery reducing the hospitalisation duration, the level of post operative
      complication and increasing the abstinence level. 115 patients will be included in this
      study.
