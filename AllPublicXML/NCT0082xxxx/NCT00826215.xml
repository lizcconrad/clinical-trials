      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of
      electroacupuncture for chronic neck pain. The secondary objective is to document any possible
      side effects of acupuncture.

      Design and Subjects: Prospective, randomised controlled trial comparing the outcomes of
      treatment and placebo interventions. Subjects are 200 adult patients with chronic mechanical
      neck pain.

      Setting: Outpatient clinics.

      Interventions: Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups receiving either:
      electroacupuncture (real treatment) or placebo (sham laser acupuncture). Each treatment will
      last for 45 minutes. Each patient will receive a total of nine treatments (three times per
      week for three weeks).

      Main outcome measures:

      Primary outcome measures: Neck pain disability index (Northwick Park Neck Pain
      Questionnaire).

      Secondary outcome measures: Maximum pain related to motion on visual analogue scale. Quality
      of life (SF-36). Use of medication. Sick leave because of neck pain. Treatment-related
      adverse effects, such as pain, skin irritation, bleeding and dizziness, will also be
      assessed.

      Assessments will be made before treatment, one month, three months and six months after the
      treatment course. The credibility of placebo treatment will also be assessed.

      Expected results: We expect that patients in the treatment group will have significant
      improvements on primary and secondary outcome measures, when compared with patients in the
      inert placebo group.

      Conclusion: This study will provide credible evidence regarding whether electroacupuncture is
      effective in reducing chronic neck pain. Patients, healthcare professionals, and government
      policy makers can make use of this information to improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs
