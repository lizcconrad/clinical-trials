      The purpose of this research study is to find out what Moffitt and Lifetime patients think of
      the electronic medical records process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient will complete a questionnaire about their knowledge of computers and how long they
      think it will take them to finish the patient health history using a computer.

      Patient will complete the electronic record carefully and tell us if they had any
      difficulties, questions or comments about the format.

      Patient will answer a questionnaire about how well they liked or did not like using the
      electronic system to give their health history.

      Participation in this study will take approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The breakdown of patients recruited by stratified dimensional sampling. Overall, we
             will attempt to equally recruit patients from the unique strata for each domain
             evaluation in this study. Patients health status will be determined by the ECOG
             Performance status . We assume that all patients being seen at the Lifetime Cancer
             Screening and Prevention center will be of good to fair health, while patients seen at
             the Cancer hospital will range from good- to- fair to poor health status. Gender is
             also used as a sampling factor because there are modules within this web-based health
             history forms that are specific for each gender.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Respondents who refuse to participate or who become too ill at any point in the
             assessment, will be excluded. Non-English speaking patients will be excluded. Names
             and other identifying information will not be collected and all data will be reported
             in aggregate form. Due to the nature of our stratified samples strategy, some patients
             will be excluded if they meet the criteria for a recruitment stata, but that stata is
             full.
