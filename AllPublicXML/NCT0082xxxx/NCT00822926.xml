  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Superficial injection of Botulinum toxin has been advocated for cosmetic purposes but has
      also been reported to be helpful for some pain conditions. The investigators have observed
      prolonged profound analgesia following subcutaneous superficial injection of Botulinum Toxin
      Type A (BTA) in patients with certain types of neuropathic pain. the investigators propose to
      study if addition of BTA extends pain relief compared to placebo when injected subcutaneously
      into areas of cutaneous allodynia (the property that a normally non-noxious stimulus is
      perceived as painful).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with post-herpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, and post-surgical
      neuromatous pain patients have marked cutaneous allodynia. Touching their skin with normally
      non-painful stimuli results in pain. Injected local anesthetics are often effective in
      providing temporary relief. In the course of clinical practice the investigators have
      observed that a number of patients with cutaneous allodynia have had marked persistent
      benefit from subcutaneous injection of Botulinum toxin Type A.

      Rather than killing targeted neurons, Botulinum toxin type A inhibits release of
      acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve terminals in a prolonged but ultimately reversible
      manner. Neuropathic pain and its hallmark allodynia are classically difficult to treat.
      Standard treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, anti-epileptic drugs, opiates and spinal
      cord stimulation is frequently disappointing leaving patients with refractory pain. Surgical
      or percutaneous ablation of involved nerves has fallen out of favor among many due to
      disappointing results.

      A pilot study is needed to assess the efficacy of superficially injected Botulinum Toxin type
      A for treatment of cutaneous allodynia and spontaneous pain among patients with neuropathic
      pain.
