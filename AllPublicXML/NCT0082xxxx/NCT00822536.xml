      To compare treatment with aspirin alone versus the combined antiplatelet treatment aspirin
      and clopidogrel after 12 months of combined antiplatelet treatment following drug-eluting
      stent (DES) implantation.

      Drug-eluting stents (DES) substantially reduce restenosis compared with bare metal stents and
      represent a significant advance in percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). Accordingly,
      DES have been rapidly adopted into practice and are currently used in the majority of PCI
      procedures. Despite their rapid acceptance, DES are not without limitations. In particular,
      patients who receive DES (like those who receive conventional bare metal stents) remain at
      risk of a 1% to 2% incidence of stent thrombosis, which is often associated with devastating
      consequences like death or myocardial infarction. Understanding and eliminating mediators of
      stent thrombosis are thus important goals for optimizing the clinical benefits of DES.
      Delayed endothelial coverage after DES implantation has been demonstrated and is thought to
      prolong the window of vulnerability to stent thrombosis. Consequently, current
      recommendations for DES are: dual antiplatelet therapy for at least 12 months in patients at
      low risk of bleeding, especially with &quot; off-label &quot; use. Because of rare but severe very late
      stent thrombosis, the dual antiplatelet therapy is more and more prescribed in clinical
      practice for several years.But it has been clearly demonstrated that the combination of
      aspirin and clopidogrel (the thienopyridine the most used) significantly increase the rate of
      severe and moderate bleedings when compared to aspirin alone. This is important if we
      consider the possibility or the necessity to prolong the combined antiplatelet therapy after
      stent implantation.ProposalTo compare treatment with aspirin alone versus the combined
      antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel after 12 months of combined antiplatelet
      treatment after DES implantation
