    <textblock>
      According to radiology imaging, the patients of HCC are divided into two groups(hypovascular
      tumor group and moderately vascular tumor group). Every group is divided into TACE therapy
      with balloon catheter subgroup and regular TACE therapy subgroup. Patients take the TACE
      therapy each 45 days, and have MRI diffusion examine or CT one week before next therapy. All
      objects are observed until the end event happening or in the group for 6 months.
