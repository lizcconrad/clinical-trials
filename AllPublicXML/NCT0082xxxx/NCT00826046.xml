  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a treatment protocol to provide patients who have failed steroid treatment for acute
      GVHD expanded access of Prochymal. It is anticipated that a maximum of 10 patients per month
      for a total of 120 patients per year will be treated according to this protocol.

      Patients will be treated with Prochymal twice per week at a dose of 2 x 106 hMSC/kg (actual
      body weight) for each of 4 consecutive weeks. Infusions will be administered at least 3 days
      apart.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be 18 years to 70 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Biopsy confirmation of GVHD is strongly recommended, to exclude patients presenting
             with diarrhea or abnormal liver function tests caused by infection.

          -  Patients must have failed to respond to steroid treatment (methylprednisolone
             [≥1mg/kg/day] or equivalent) for Grades C-D acute GVHD.

          -  Prochymal must be administered not longer than 14 days after the initiation of
             systemic steroid therapy for acute GVHD.

          -  Prochymal must be administered either before or at the same time any additional GVHD
             therapy is administered

          -  Patients must have an adequate renal function as defined by Cockroft-Gault
             equation:Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 30mL/min

          -  Patients who are women of childbearing potential, must be non-pregnant, not
             breast-feeding, and use adequate contraception. Male patients must use adequate
             contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has stage 3 or 4 liver GVHD, bilirubin &gt;6 mg/dl.

          -  Patient has stage 4 GI-GVHD.

          -  Patient has any underlying or current medical condition that would interfere with the
             evaluation of the patient including uncontrolled infection, sepsis, organ failure, etc
             or any medical condition that has a high probability of causing death in less than 30
             days.

          -  Patient may not receive any other investigational agent (not approved by the FDA for
             any indication) concurrently for the duration of the protocol.

          -  Patient has evidence of a pulmonary infiltrate or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and must
             not be likely to require more than 2L of oxygen via face mask or an estimated FiO2of
             28% via other delivery methods in order to sustain an O2 saturation of 92% during the
             next 3 days.

          -  Patient has a known allergy to bovine or porcine products

          -  Patient has a medical history of a solid tumor disease.
