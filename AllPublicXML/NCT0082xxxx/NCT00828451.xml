      This proposal will test the hypothesis that synthesis and catabolism of epidermal growth
      factor (EGF), the genotype of the EGF gene, and the microbiome interact to influence EGF
      expression in infants at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Preterm infants will receive a six hour intravenous infusion of [5,5,5-2H3]leucine (2H3)
           through an existing intravenous line (IV) to measure EGF synthesis rate.

        -  Two blood samples will be obtained, one prior to the start of infusion, and one during
           the infusion. The enrichment of the stable isotope labeled leucine will be measured in
           the plasma from these samples; DNA will be extracted from the residual cell pellets. The
           EGF and EGF receptor genes will be sequenced.

        -  Saliva and urine will be obtained for 5 days following infusion to measure EGF and the
           rate of incorporation of leucine into EGF using liquid chromatography (LC)/mass
           spectroscopy (MS)/MS technology, as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) .
           Saliva will be obtained by a Q tip swab and urine and stool obtained from the diaper.

        -  Stool will be obtained every 3 to 7 days through 5 weeks to evaluate inflammatory
           markers and the microbiome.

        -  If breastfeeding, a single sample of mother's milk will be obtained for measurement of
           EGF after adequate volumes for infant feeds are achieved.

      <recruitment_details>Subjects admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Louis Children's Hospital were screened and enrolled from 5/1/2008 to 12/31/2009. Infants born at &lt; 32 weeks and 7 days old or less were eligible for enrollment which occurred in the neonatal intensive care unit or postpartum floor.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After enrollment 11 of 29 enrolled subjects did not complete the study due to removal of the intravenous line required for infusion, significant deterioration in clinical status resulting in unstable condition as identified by the attending physician, parental withdrawal, and death.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Urinary EGF protein levels obtained from free flowing urine samples retrieved from subject diaper were analyzed by commercially available EGF ELISA kit (R &amp;D systems Inc). EGF protein levels were normalized to milligrams of creatinine in urine, and expressed as nanograms of EGF protein per milligram of urinary creatinine.</description>
