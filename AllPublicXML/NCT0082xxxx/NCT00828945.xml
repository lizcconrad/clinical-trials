  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective observational study.

      Patients will be high risk patients (for developing cardiovascular events) that are treated
      with a statin. Patients will be enrolled at a normal clinic visit and provided with a small
      box containing info about the disease, a LDL self-test and two questionnaires. They will test
      themselves for LDL at home between normal clinic visits (normally 12 months interval) and
      note their value. In the end of the study all patients will fill out a questionnaire with
      questions if the tests and info have raised their awareness of the disease as well if their
      motivation to be compliant has increased.

      We want to look at the possibility to put more responsibility for treatment and for reaching
      treatment goals on the patients since there's a big problem with compliance in this group of
      patients.
