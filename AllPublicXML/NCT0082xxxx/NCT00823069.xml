      Safety study that compares Perlane to Perlane with Lidocaine while correcting wrinkles in the
      area around your nose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a split-face design. All 60 subjects receive Perlane on one side of their face, and
      Perlane-L on the other. Subjects and the investigator is blinded to which side of face
      receives which product. These are one time injections.

    <description>This measure was performed by the validated GAIS tool (Global Asthetic Improvement Scale). The GAIS was completed by the participant at day 14. The GAIS is a qualitative 5 point scale evaluating Aesthetic Improvement (0=worse, 1=no change, 2=Improved, 3=Much Improved, 4=very much improved). Treatment success is defined as at least a one grade improvement (2, 3, or 4) from pre-treatment.</description>

Least pain on VAS is at the 0 mm mark, and worst pain is at the 100 mm mark. Objective is to calculate the proportion of subjects that had a within-subject difference in the VAS (Perlane minus Perlan-L) of at least 10 mm at injection together with a 95% confidence interval.

          <description>Split face design with each subject receiving Perlane on one side of the face and Perlane-L on the other. After treatments the patient scores pain experienced on a 2 VAS scales. One VAS represents pain on the left side of face, and the other VAS for the right side of the face. Least pain on VAS is at the 0 mm mark, and worst pain is at the 100 mm mark. Objective is to calculate the proportion of subjects that had a within-subject difference in the VAS (Perlane minus Perlan-L) of at least 10 mm at injection together with a 95% confidence interval. The objective was to show that the confidence interval lay above 50%.</description>
