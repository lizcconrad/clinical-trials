    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the gum response to three different dental implant
      designs when placed in the front region of the upper jaw. The changes from baseline to one
      year after will be compared. The null-hypothesis is that the buccal soft tissue (gum) changes
      from baseline to one year after are equal for all three implant-abutment interface settings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of informed consent

          -  At least 18 years

          -  In need of one or more single implants replacing missing or non-restorable teeth in
             the maxilla within region 14 to 24

        The following should be considered at inclusion but can not be fulfilled until at Visit 2:

          -  Edentulous for at least 5 months at study site

          -  A buccal-lingual bone width at study site of at least 5.5 mm

          -  A mesial-distal bone level distance between adjacent teeth at study site of at least
             5.5 mm

          -  A keratinized mid-buccal mucosal height of at least 2 mm at study site

          -  Teeth adjacent (mesial and distal) to study site must consist of two stable teeth on
             natural roots without signs of periodontal bone loss (&gt;1 mm) and/or significant soft
             tissue loss

          -  Teeth adjacent (mesial and distal) to study site must demonstrate a stable occlusal
             guidance that will allow non-functional disclusion in all eccentric positions

          -  An opposing dentition with teeth, implants or prosthesis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Insufficient interocclusal distance for implant placement and restoration at study
             site

          -  Tooth adjacent (mesial and/or distal) to study site is ankylosed

          -  More than 2 mm vertical bone loss at study site as measured from the mid-buccal crest
             of bone on the adjacent teeth

          -  Site development (bone tissue) performed at less than 5 months before Visit 2 at study
             site

          -  Untreated rampant caries and/or uncontrolled periodontal disease

          -  Class II division 2 malocclusion (Edward Hartley Angle)

          -  Use of tobacco within last 6 months

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes (subjects history does not reveal the absence of control of
             insulin-dependent/non-insulin dependent Diabetes Mellitus)

          -  Current alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Systemic or local disease or condition that would compromise post-operative healing
             and/or osseointegration

          -  Use of any substance that will influence bone metabolism

          -  Need for systemic corticosteroids or any other medication that would influence
             post-operative healing and/or osseointegration

          -  History of radiation in the head and neck region

          -  Known pregnancy, pregnancy tests will be performed as per local requirements.

          -  Unable or unwilling to return for follow-up visits for a period of 5 years

          -  Unlikely to be able to comply with study procedures according to Investigators
             judgement

          -  Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both Astra Tech staff
             or staff at the study center)

          -  Previous enrollment or randomization of treatment in the present study.
