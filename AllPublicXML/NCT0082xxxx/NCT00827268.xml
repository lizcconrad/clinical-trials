    <textblock>
      This study offers 90-120 hours of 1:1 training to improve reading skills in adults who have
      poor reading skills following a stroke. Specifically, this study is designed to improve skill
      in sounding out words for reading and spelling. The overall time commitment for participation
      in this study is approximately 11-30 weeks.

      The proposed study is a mixed-effects (single-subject ABA repeated-probe and small group
      elements) design with 90-120 hours of a modified multi-modal treatment of alexia replicated
      across up to 18 adults with post-stroke phonological alexia. The short-term goals of this
      research proposal includes the following: 1) determine if a modified multimodal treatment of
      phonological alexia can improve pseudoword reading skills (providing a basis from which
      training will also treat real word reading skills), 2) determine if a modified multimodal
      treatment of phonological alexia can improve real word reading skills, 3) determine how brain
      lesion extent and location relate to participants' response to treatment, and 4) identify
      relationships between changes in functional brain activity in specified regions of interest
      and participants' response to treatment.
