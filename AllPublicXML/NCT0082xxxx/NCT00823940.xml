  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate whether GSK1362885 is safe and well-tolerated when administered to
      normal healthy subjects. The study will also measure blood levels of the study drug to
      determine how the body processes the drug (pharmacokinetics) and what effects the drug has on
      the body (pharmacodynamics).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK1362885 is a glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor that is targeted as a treatment for Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus by reducing hepatic glucose output. This study will investigate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics when single doses of GSK1362885 are
      administered to healthy volunteers. A glucagon challenge test will be used to stimulate
      hepatic glucose output in order to evaluate liver glycogen phosphorylase inhibition by
      GSK1362885.
