    <textblock>
      This phase I Healthy Volunteer study will evaluate the pressure interface between the devices
      (a compression device and Profore®) and the skin, using the PicoPress(TM) pressure transducer
      at specified time intervals in three distinct locations on the leg, in both the sitting and
      standing position. It will also assess the variability of interface pressure following
      application under each test device for each subject over a period of three days (three
      separate applications).
