    <textblock>
      L-[3-18F]-α-methyltyrosine (18F-FMT) is an amino-acid tracer for positron emission tomography
      (PET). The investigators evaluated the value of 18F-FMT PET for the assessment of therapy
      response in patients with lung cancer as compared with that of
      2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET.

      The patients with lung cancer underwent PET studies with 18F-FDG and 18F-FMT before and after
      radio-/chemotherapy. The investigators used the ratio of the SUVmax of the mediastinal (N2)
      lymph node to the SUVmax of the primary tumor (N/P ratio ). All patients were divided into
      two groups of N/P ratio&lt;1 and N/P ratio≥1, and the survival time was estimated by
      Kaplan-Meier method.
