      Title: Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Dose-Escalation Phase I Study of the
      Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of a Single Intravenous Dose of ETI-204 (AnthimTM)

      Population: This study will determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a
      single iv dose of ETI-204 in subjects 18 to 50 years of age. Three cohorts will be studied
      sequentially: subjects receiving 120 mg, 240 mg and 360 mg of ETI-204. The study will be
      randomized, double-blind, and stratified by gender. Each cohort will contain 15 subjects
      (including at least four females), twelve who will receive ETI-204 and three who will receive
      placebo.

      Study Objectives: To determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ETI-204
      following a single intravenous administration.

      Study Duration: Maximum 70 days for each subject (from enrollment to end of follow-up
      period), unless the Day 70 HAHA (human anti-humanized antibodies) is positive, in which case
      subjects will be followed until HAHA test results are negative. This does not represent the
      total study duration, which is determined by the screening period and enrollment rate.

      Description of Agent: ETI-204 is a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to protective antigen (PA) from
      Bacillus anthracis.

      Schedule of Evaluations: Blood for pharmacokinetics (antibody concentration): Predose and at
      the following times after the start of infusion: 60 minutes (i.e., at the completion of the
      infusion), 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours and on Days 7, 14, 21, 42, 56 and 70.

      Blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis (referred to as safety laboratory assessments in
      the schedule of events), and urine drug screen (including ethanol and cotinine at all
      visits): Screening, Day 0, immediately pre-dose and on the following days after the start of
      infusion: 7, 14, 21, and 42. Urine pregnancy tests for all females will be performed at
      screening, baseline, immediately pre-dose and at 42 days. Tests of coagulation and viral
      serology tests will be done at screening only.

      ECG: A 12-lead ECG will be done at screening. In subjects with acceptable ECG parameters,
      continuous 24-h Holter monitoring. will be then performed. After enrollment, a standard
      12-lead ECG recording will be performed on study Day 1 (predose, 1.5h, 2h, 4h, 8h and 12h ±20
      min) and continuous ECG telemetry monitoring beginning approximately 2 hours prior to the
      start of infusion and continuing at least 14 hours after the start of infusion. ECG is also
      recorded at the following study Days: 2, 7, 14, 21, and 42.

      Measurement of product specific human anti-humanized antibodies (HAHA): Pre-dose and 42 days
      after dosing. HAHA positive subjects on Day 42 will be followed bi-weekly until study Day 70
      and then monthly until HAHA test results are negative.

      Vital signs (BP, P, T, RR): Screening, Day 0, before and at the following times after the
      start of the infusion on study day 1: 15, 30, 45, 60, 90±3 minutes; 2h,4h,8h, 12h and 24h±10
      minutes (Day 2); Days 7, 14, 21 and 42.

      Screening for Local and Systemic Adverse Events: The infusion site and proximal areas will be
      inspected for evidence of erythema, edema, visible or palpable cord, etc. on study days 1, 2,
      7, 14, 21 and 42.

             must be within 10% of the normal range. BUN, creatinine, and total and direct
             bilirubin may be up to 10% above the upper limits of normal. AST, ALT and alkaline
             phosphatase must be within normal limits. Urinalysis must be within generally accepted
             normal limits.

          3. The values for the following tests at screening are to be:

             G-6-P dehydrogenase - normal HBsAg - negative HBV - negative (except immunized
             subjects may have positive anti-HBs) Anti-HCV - negative Anti-HIV (HIV antibody test)

             device, Depo-Provera®, skin patch, vaginal ring, or cervical cap) for at least 30 days
             prior to enrollment and for the duration of the study, including the follow-up period.
             Females using hormonal contraceptives must agree to use at least one other method for
