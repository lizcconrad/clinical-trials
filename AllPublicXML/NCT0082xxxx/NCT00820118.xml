  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to assess the ability of an early and intermittent
      antiretroviral therapy in maintaining an immunological stability in antiretroviral naive HIV
      infected adults, to offer a potential alternative strategy to differed and continuous
      antiretroviral treatment.This is a 2-year phase II, open-label, multicentric &quot;proof of
      concept&quot; trial. The patients included are treated following a pulse-therapy scheme, i.e.
      6-month periods with once daily boosted-PI based therapy in alternance with 6-month periods
      without antiretroviral therapy. The preferentially recommended treatment of the study is
      atazanavir boosted with ritonavir, associated with a fixed combination of abacavir and
      lamivudine or emtricitabine + tenofovir.The patients are closely followed to assess the
      efficacy and the tolerance of the strategy, with clinical, biochemical, immunological,
      virological and pharmacokinetic evaluations.
