    <textblock>
      This study is being done to examine lung function changes in individuals with HIV infection
      and to understand why individuals with HIV have increased risk of lung damage from cigarette
      smoking.

      To delineate the natural history of HIV associated emphysema in the HAART era. To compare the
      alveolar macrophage proteomes from HIV-seropositive smokers with emphysema to the alveolar
      macrophages proteomes of both HIV+ smokers without emphysema and HIV- smokers.

      To establish whether coinfection with HIV and Hepatitis C results in accelerated lung disease
      manifested by decrements in forced expiratory volume and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity.

    <description>HIV-Seropositive individuals are at increased risk of developing pulmonary emphysema (1,2). With improved therapy for HIV, and increased life expectancy in this population with a high smoking prevalence, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may assume an increasingly important role with respect to health related quality of life and medical complications. This research will provide a unique opportunity to examine the natural history of smoking related lung damage in patients with HIV infection. In addition, this research will involve sampling of lung cells to determine if there are unique proteins present that may be related to the increased risk of emphysema in this population. This may shed important insight into how the lung responds to injury and how it repairs itself. If critical proteins can be identified, treatment strategies may eventually be developed to either decrease proteins causing injury or increase protective proteins.</description>
