      The purpose of this Phase I, open-label, randomized crossover trial is to investigate the
      pharmacokinetic interaction between steady-state lopinavir/ritonavir and single-dose TMC207
      in healthy volunteers.

      TMC207 is being investigated for the treatment of MDR-TB infection. This is a Phase I,
      open-label, randomized crossover trial in healthy volunteers to investigate the potential
      interaction between steady-state lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/rtv) 400/100 mg twice daily and a
      single dose of 400 mg TMC207. The trial population will consist of 16 healthy volunteers.
      During 2 sessions, each participant will receive 2 treatments (Treatments A and B) in a
      randomized order. This means it will be decided by chance if subjects will receive first
      treatment A, then B or first treatment B, then A.

      In Treatment A, participants will receive a single dose of TMC207 400 mg on Day 1. In
      Treatment B, participants will receive LPV/rtv 400/100 mg twice daily on Days 1 to 24, while
      on Day 11 a single dose of TMC207 400 mg will be co-administered. The two single doses of
      TMC207 will be administered 4 weeks apart. Consequently, Treatment B should start 4 days
      after completion of Treatment A, and Treatment A should start 14 days after completion of
      Treatment B (counting from the day the last PK sample has been collected). Pharmacokinetic
      profiles over 336 hours will be determined for TMC207 and its N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2)
      after administration of TMC207 400 mg alone (Day 1 of Treatment A), and in combination with
      steady-state LPV/rtv (Day 11 of Treatment B). Morning predose concentrations of lopinavir and
      ritonavir will be determined at several time points. Safety and tolerability will be
      evaluated throughout the trial. Day 1 of Treatment A and on Day 11 of Treatment B, 400 mg
      TMC207 (1 tablet) will be taken orally in the morning within 10 mins. after completion of a
      meal. Days 1 to 24 of Treatment B, 2 tablets of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/rtv = 400 mg
      lopinavir and 100 mg ritonavir) will be taken in the morning and evening. When LPV/rtv is
      administered alone, it can be taken with or without food. When co-administered simultaneously
      with TMC207, LPV/rtv intake will be within 10 mins. after completion of a meal.
