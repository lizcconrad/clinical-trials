  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to see if a course of injections containing the NY-ESO-1 protein (a
      tumor antigen, marker expressed by tumors); in combination with an immune stimulant
      (adjuvant) Montanide, with or without resiquimod (another adjuvant) is well tolerated and
      safe in patients with surgically resected Stage IIB, IIC, Stage III or Stage IV (AJCC
      criteria) melanoma, a tumor that expresses NY-ESO-1. In addition, this study is designed to
      see if the patient's body's defense (immune) system can be boosted (strengthened) by this
      vaccine and if the addition of resiquimod to the vaccine makes this more likely.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no published data on the application of topical resiquimod in combination with an
      antigen in Montanide, therefore, this study includes a 2-part design where Part I represents
      a dose-escalation part with topical resiquimod in an open-label fashion. Part II represents
      the randomized part.

      In Part I, 2 cohorts are planned: If no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs by day 8 of the
      last vaccination cycle in the last patient enrolled the first cohort, 3 additional patients
      (cohort 2) will be enrolled. If no DLT occurs by day 8 of the last vaccination cycle in the
      last patient enrolled the second cohort in Part I, the trial will proceed to Part II where
      patients will be randomized.

         11. Women of childbearing potential not using a medically acceptable means of
             contraception.

         12. Patients with known history of inflammatory skin disorders (e.g.,psoriasis, lupus)
