      This study will provide information regarding dopamine D2/D3 occupancy related with
      clinical/adverse effects in older people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The
      results of this study will also show an appropriate dose range in order to evade undesirable
      adverse effects while deriving therapeutic effects, which will directly serve to guide
      physicians in clinical practice. Furthermore, the findings of this study will elucidate
      mechanisms underlying older people's increased sensitivity to antipsychotic drugs. In
      addition, the contribution of D2 and D3 in mediating antipsychotic response will be
      contrasted, using 2 radiotracers, which has never been tested in an older population.

      The hypotheses are as follows: First, clinical response (i.e., a â‰¥ 20% decrease in the Brief
      Psychiatric Rating Scale total score) will be achieved in older patients with occupancy that
      is lower than the threshold of 60% in historical young controls. Second, prolactin elevation
      and EPS will be detected in older patients with occupancies that are lower than the
      thresholds of 72 and 78% reported in historical young controls. Third, dopamine D2 receptor
      occupancy will be inversely correlated with subjective well-beings. Fourth, the binding
      potential and receptor occupancy will be at least 20% lower with [11C]-(+)-PHNO than with
      [11C]-raclopride in the caudate/putamen. Fifth, the binding of [11C]-(+)-PHNO in the globus
      pallidus will be higher than that of [11C]-raclopride.

      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated that a therapeutic window of
      dopamine D2/3 receptor occupancy (60-80%) is associated with clinical response in younger
      patients with schizophrenia. This observation has been used to predict the therapeutic dose
      range and contributed to current recommended antipsychotic doses. To date, there is no
      published report to examine D2/3 receptor occupancy associated with clinical response in
      older individuals with primary psychotic disorders. This has has impeded the implementation
      of treatment guidelines.

      The investigators therefore propose a prospective study to assess dopamine D2 and D3 receptor
      occupancy following acute antipsychotic treatment in patients aged 50 and older with
      schizophrenia who do not currently receive antipsychotic treatment, using both [11C]-(+)-PHNO
      and [11C]-raclopride PET scans. Dopamine D2/3 receptor occupancy of risperidone that are
      associated with clinical effects will be measured, using PET, in older patients with
      schizophrenia. The investigators will also try to contrast the contribution of D2 and D3 in
      mediating antipsychotic response, using 2 radiotracers.

      Our primary goal is to relate changes in clinical outcome, including subjective and objective
      clinical ratings, to dopamine D2 and D3 receptor occupancy in older patients with
      schizophrenia, and compare these results with the data for younger patients in the
      literature.

    <description>Following the baseline clinical and cognitive assessments, risperidone will be initiated at 0.5-1.0 mg/day and subsequently increased by 0.25 - 1.0 mg on a weekly basis with the target of clinical stabilization (i.e. 20 or more % reduction in the total BPRS score) until a maximum dose of 4.0 mg/day is reached. To achieve this, a weekly assessment with BPRS will be performed. Physicians-of-record will be closely liaised with investigators. Dosage modification will be performed following this dosing schedule, however, this can be changed by treating physicians to meet clinical necessity. For example, in case psychotic symptoms are not controlled by this dosing schedule, facilitated dose increment will be allowed.</description>
