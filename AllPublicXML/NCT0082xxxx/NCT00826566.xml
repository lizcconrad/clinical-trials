  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays it has become evident that a chronic systemic inflammation is present in patients
      suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      The role of the nuclear enzyme poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase (PARP) as a key
      mediator within these systemic inflammatory processes as well as in COPD associated exercise
      intolerance and muscle weakness could recently been identified. The attenuating effect of
      dietary ingredients with PARP inhibiting activity on systemic inflammation was supported by
      data from in vitro and in vivo studies, from other groups as well as from our own lab. We
      identified several caffeine metabolites as potent inhibitors of the most abundant
      PARP-isoform PARP-1 in-vitro, in animal models as well as in ex-vivo experiments with whole
      blood from COPD patients.

      However, clinical data with respect to their anti-inflammatory effects in COPD patients are
      currently not available for none of these substances. Therefore, the current clinical pilot
      study is intended to establish for the first time clinical data (proof of principle) on the
      anti-inflammatory potential of caffeine metabolites.
