  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine if temporary weakness of a small foot
      muscle caused by local injection of botulinum toxin into that muscle can be measured with a
      strain gauge in addition to the previously known valid measurements via nerve conduction
      studies and surface electromyogram.

      Purpose/Hypothesis:

      Verify the validity and reliability of strain gauge assessment of strength of extensor
      digitorum brevis (EDB) muscle compared to compound muscle action potential (CMAP) size from
      EDB and surface electromyography (SEMG) data from EDB after injection of botulinum toxin into
      EDB

        1. Primary Outcome Measure:

           Change in measured strength (using strain gauges) of dorsiflexion of digits 3 and 4
           (&quot;strength of EDB&quot;) after vs. before botulinum toxin injection into EDB

        2. Secondary Outcome Measures:

             1. Change in CMAP (with standard reference electrode location and with an &quot;inactive&quot;
                reference electrode location) from EDB after vs. before botulinum toxin injection
                into EDB;

             2. Change in SEMG parameters from EDB, tibialis anterior (TA), and extensor digitorum
                longus (EDL) after vs. before botulinum toxin injection into EDB

      STUDY DESIGN:

        1. Overview:

           Single intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin or placebo (placebo or BOTOX 2 units
           or BOTOX 20 units, each with a total volume of 0.1 ml) intramuscular into right EDB on
           Day 0. Strain gauge data and SEMG data from TA and EDL are obtained at each evaluation
           time: Baseline (3 separate times prior to Day 0 after at least 5 separate training
           sessions for the strain gauges); Day 1; Day 2; Day 4 (during anticipated rapid change);
           Day 14 (+/-1 day) (at clinical nadir); Day 21 (+/-1 day) (another day at clinical
           nadir); and Month 4 (when clinical recovery from the effect of BOTOX should have
           occurred); CMAP &amp; SEMG data from EDB are obtained at Baseline; Day 4 (close to nadir of
           CAMP); Day 14 (at nadir of CAMP) and/or Day 21 (at nadir of CAMP); and Month 4 (when
           clinical recovery from the effect of BOTOX should have occurred but CMAP should not have
           recovered).

        2. Protocol:

      Single-center, Double-Blind, Randomized, Pilot Trial Total Sample Size: 12-15

      Treatment Groups:

      BOTOX Single Dose 20 units IM in EDB in 0.1 ml BOTOX Single Dose 2 units IM in EDB in 0.1 ml
      Placebo (Saline) Single Dose IM in EDB in 0.1 ml

      Estimated Time to Enroll:

      0-3 months

      Estimated Study Duration:

      4-6 months

             study, or females of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use a
             reliable form of contraception during the study.

          -  Concurrent participation in another investigational drug or device study or
             participation within 3 months prior to study.

          -  Treatment with botulinum toxin of any serotype prior to enrollment in study or prior
             clinical botulism.

          -  Any medical condition that may put the subject at increased risk with exposure to
             BOTOX including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome,
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other disorder that might interfere with
             neuromuscular function.

          -  Evidence of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or other relevant neuropsychiatric condition.

          -  Infection or skin disorder at an anticipated injection site.

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at
             significant risk, confound the study results (e.g. variable strength on serial testing
             during screening examination; or foot, toe, or ankle pain that may limit full
             participation in muscle strength testing), or interfere significantly with the
             subject's participation in the study.

          <description>Measure the percent change of the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) Amplitude from extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) with the reference electrode in the standard location at the base of the ipsilateral 5th toe after injection of BoNT/A into EDB compared with before injection of BoNT/A. Each CMAP represents the mean of 3 individual measurements of the CMAP at that timepoint. In order to facilitate comparison from one subject to the next, the CMAP is then converted into percent change from baseline for that subject. CMAP percent change is then correlated with the percent change in the Surface Electromyography as measured by the Root Mean Squared with 500 millisecond window at the same time points after injection.

        <title>Correlation in Percent Change of the CMAP (With Standard Reference Electrode Location) From EDB After vs. Before Botulinum Toxin Injection Into EDB vs. Percent Change Surface Electromyography (as Measured by Mean Rectified Voltage With 500 ms Window).</title>
        <description>Measure the percent change of the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) Amplitude from extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) with the reference electrode in the standard location at the base of the ipsilateral 5th toe after injection of BoNT/A into EDB compared with before injection of BoNT/A. Each CMAP represents the mean of 3 individual measurements of the CMAP at that timepoint. In order to facilitate comparison from one subject to the next, the CMAP is then converted into percent change from baseline for that subject. CMAP percent change is then correlated with the percent change in the Surface Electromyography as measured by the Mean Rectified Voltage with 500 millisecond window at the same time points after injection. Group with injection of 20 units BoNT/A is used.</description>

          <title>Correlation in Percent Change of the CMAP (With &quot;Inactive&quot; Reference Electrode Location) From EDB After vs. Before Botulinum Toxin Injection Into EDB vs. Percent Change Surface Electromyography (as Measured by Root Mean Squared With 1000 ms Window).</title>
          <description>Measure the percent change of the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) Amplitude from extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) with the reference electrode in an &quot;inactive&quot; location at the ipsilateral medial malleolus after injection of BoNT/A into EDB compared with before injection of BoNT/A. Each CMAP represents the mean of 3 individual measurements of the CMAP at that timepoint. In order to facilitate comparison from one subject to the next, the CMAP is then converted into percent change from baseline for that subject. CMAP percent change is then correlated with the percent change in the Surface Electromyography as measured by the Root Mean Squared with 1000 millisecond window at the same time points after injection. Group with injection of 20 units BoNT/A is used.</description>

        <title>Correlation in Percent Change of the CMAP (With &quot;Inactive&quot; Reference Electrode Location) From EDB After vs. Before Botulinum Toxin Injection Into EDB vs. Percent Change Surface Electromyography (as Measured by Mean Rectified Voltage With 1000 ms Window).</title>
        <description>Measure the percent change of the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) Amplitude from extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) with the reference electrode in an &quot;inactive&quot; location at the ipsilateral medial malleolus after injection of BoNT/A into EDB compared with before injection of BoNT/A. Each CMAP represents the mean of 3 individual measurements of the CMAP at that timepoint. In order to facilitate comparison from one subject to the next, the CMAP is then converted into percent change from baseline for that subject. CMAP percent change is then correlated with the percent change in the Surface Electromyography as measured by the Mean Rectified Voltage with 1000 millisecond window at the same time points after injection. Group with injection of 20 units BoNT/A is used.</description>

          <title>Correlation in Percent Change of the CMAP (With &quot;Inactive&quot; Reference Electrode Location) From EDB After vs. Before Botulinum Toxin Injection Into EDB vs. Percent Change Surface Electromyography (as Measured by Mean Rectified Voltage With 200 ms Window).</title>
          <description>Measure the percent change of the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP) Amplitude from extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) with the reference electrode in an &quot;inactive&quot; location at the ipsilateral medial malleolus after injection of BoNT/A into EDB compared with before injection of BoNT/A. Each CMAP represents the mean of 3 individual measurements of the CMAP at that timepoint. In order to facilitate comparison from one subject to the next, the CMAP is then converted into percent change from baseline for that subject. CMAP percent change is then correlated with the percent change in the Surface Electromyography as measured by the Mean Rectified Voltage with 200 millisecond window at the same time points after injection. Group with injection of 20 units BoNT/A is used.</description>
