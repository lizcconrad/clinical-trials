    <textblock>
      Dasatinib and lenalidomide are both prescribed for use in patients with different cancers of
      the blood. This study is experimental because neither drug has been approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. There are few standard
      treatments when fludarabine is no longer effective in patients with CLL. Some patients have
      received additional combination therapy with fludarabine, Campath, bone marrow transplants or
      supportive care. Dasatinib and lenalidomide have been effective in high-risk CLL patients in
      other pilot mono therapy studies. The combination of dasatinib and lenalidomide has not been
      studied in humans before and this study is designed to test whether this combination is safe
      to use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLL is an incurable disease with current therapies. Modern chemoimmunotherapies, including
      combinations of rituximab and purine nucleoside analogues (fludarabine, cladribine, and
      pentostatin), offer the possibility for improved survival, but all patients will eventually
      relapse. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease will only experience diminishing
      benefits with additional lines of therapy. In addition, patients with high-risk CLL have poor
      responses to even first-line therapies. Lenalidomide and dasatinib have non-overlapping
      proposed mechanisms of action. Single agent phase II studies with lenalidomide and dasatinib
      have demonstrated responses in heavily pretreated and high-risk patients. For these reasons,
      we propose to treat patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL to purine nucleoside
      analogue therapy with combination lenalidomide and dasatinib.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent including a HIPAA form
             according to institutional guidelines

          2. Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          4. Immunophenotypically confirmed diagnosis of B-CLL, who either have Rai stage III/IV
             disease or require treatment for Rai stage I/II disease as defined by criteria based
             on the NCI 1996 guidelines (Appendix VII and IX).

          5. Relapsed and/or refractory disease to a purine nucleoside analogue (pentostatin,
             fludarabine, or cladribine). Relapse is defined as a patient who has previously
             achieved the clinicopathologic criteria for a CR or PR, but after a period of ≥ 6
             months demonstrates evidence of disease progression. Refractory is defined as a
             patient progressing on therapy or who cannot maintain at least a PR for ≥ 6 months
             (Appendix IV). The patient may have had therapy subsequent to receiving a purine
             nucleoside analogue, but must also have relapsed or been refractory to this most
             recent therapy (Appendix IV).

          6. ECOG performance status of ≤ 2 at study entry (see Appendix X).

          7. Laboratory test results within these ranges:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm3

               -  Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm³

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL. Subjects with serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL may be
                  eligible if they have creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min by Cockroft-Gault
                  formula.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2 x ULN or ≤ 5 x ULN if hepatic metastases are
                  present.

          8. Disease free of prior malignancies for ≥ 5 years with exception of currently treated
             basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma &quot;insitu&quot; of the cervix
             or breast. Patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer who have had
             either local therapy (radiation or surgery) or are actively receiving hormonal therapy
             will also be allowed. Patients being observed with &quot;watchful waiting&quot; will be
             excluded. Low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer will be defined as PSA ≤ 20,
             Gleason score ≤ 7, and AJCC clinical stage of ≤ T2b.

          9. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to
             and again within 24 hours of starting lenalidomide and must either commit to continued
             abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth
             control, one highly effective method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME
             TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to
             ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact
             with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All patients must be
             counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal
             exposure. See Appendix I: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and
             Acceptable Birth Control Methods, AND also Appendix II: Education and Counseling
             Guidance Document.
