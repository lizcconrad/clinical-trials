  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 96 week study to determine if UK- 453,061 in combination with Truvada is as
      efficacious, safe and tolerable as efavirenz in combination with Truvada in HIV-1 infected
      patients who have not been previously treated with antiretroviral drugs.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Log 10 Transformed HIV-1 RNA Levels at Week 24, 48 and 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24, 48, 96</time_frame>
    <description>For the log 10 scale, all the HIV-1 RNA levels were log 10 transformed prior to the average calculations. Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time-Averaged Difference (TAD) in Log 10 Transformed HIV-1 RNA Levels at Week 24, 48 and 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 24, 48, 96</time_frame>
    <description>TAD was calculated as area under the curve of HIV-1 RNA levels (log10 copies/mL) from baseline to the time point of interest divided by time period in weeks minus baseline HIV-1 RNA level (log10 copies/mL). Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Response as Determined Using the Time-to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR50) Algorithm at Week 24, 48 and 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24, 48, 96</time_frame>
    <description>TLOVR50 response is compliment to TLOVR50 failure. TLOVR50 failure based on observed HIV-1 RNA levels and failure events (death; permanent discontinuation of drug; lost to follow-up; met treatment failure [TF] criteria). TF: an increase to at least 3 times baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level at Week 2 or thereafter; failure to achieve HIV-1 RNA level &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 24; starting at Week 2, an increase in HIV-1 RNA level to detectable levels (&gt;50 copies/mL). TF criteria's defined above were confirmed by second measurement at least 14 days after first. In 'TLOVR50', '50' denotes the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of assay (which is 50 copies/mL). Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With NRTI and NNRTI Resistance-Associated Mutations (RAMs) at Time of Treatment Failure Through Week 24, 48 and 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose) through Week 24, 48, 96</time_frame>
    <description>Phenotypic resistance and genotypic resistance was assessed for all participants at Day 1 predose, and was evaluated for nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) resistance-associated mutations at time of treatment failure using Monogram GenoSeq and/or PhenoSenseGT assays. This was then repeated for all participants with HIV-1 viral load more than 500 copies/mL at treatment failure, up to Week 96.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Laboratory Test Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 96 or early termination</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory analysis included hematology, blood chemistry, serum and urine pregnancy test, hepatitis testing and urinalysis. Laboratory values that met the criteria of the Division of Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) grade 1 (mild, symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional activities) or greater were considered as abnormal.</description>

        <title>Time-Averaged Difference (TAD) in Log 10 Transformed HIV-1 RNA Levels at Week 24, 48 and 96</title>
        <description>TAD was calculated as area under the curve of HIV-1 RNA levels (log10 copies/mL) from baseline to the time point of interest divided by time period in weeks minus baseline HIV-1 RNA level (log10 copies/mL). Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</description>

Participant discontinued before a visit of interest: value imputed as zero; not discontinued but observation was missing: value calculated to the last non-missing timepoint; not discontinued and missing values between baseline and visit: ignore missing values; missing baseline or no HIV-1 RNA level assessment: value imputed as zero.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Response as Determined Using the Time-to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR50) Algorithm at Week 24, 48 and 96</title>
        <description>TLOVR50 response is compliment to TLOVR50 failure. TLOVR50 failure based on observed HIV-1 RNA levels and failure events (death; permanent discontinuation of drug; lost to follow-up; met treatment failure [TF] criteria). TF: an increase to at least 3 times baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level at Week 2 or thereafter; failure to achieve HIV-1 RNA level &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 24; starting at Week 2, an increase in HIV-1 RNA level to detectable levels (&gt;50 copies/mL). TF criteria’s defined above were confirmed by second measurement at least 14 days after first. In 'TLOVR50', '50' denotes the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of assay (which is 50 copies/mL). Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</description>
