  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures mostly occur in elderly people with low bone strength. Bone strength is
      determined by bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover, microarchitectural and geometrical
      properties of the bone. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the standard technique to
      measure BMD. However, BMD just provides information regarding the quantity of mineral in
      bone, which is only one component of bone strength. To date there is no reliable method to
      assess bone strength in vivo. Therefore, a method to assess bone strength beyond BMD would
      provide additional information regarding the patients' risk of bone related fixation failure
      after fracture fixation.

      DensiProbe is a new diagnostic device that was developed for intra-operative assessment of
      mechanical stability of the bone in the proximal femur. It consists of a drill bit like tool
      and an electronic system to measure the peak torque to break-away of trabecular bone in the
      femoral head of patients undergoing DHS surgical treatment. In a cadaver study comparing bone
      mineral density measured by quantitative computed tomography with bone strength measured by
      DensiProbe a high correlation between these two parameters could be shown. In a clinical
      pilot study a significant correlation between DensiProbe measurements and BMD measured by DXA
      at the femoral neck in patients with hip fractures could be shown. However, no perfect
      correlation was expected because DensiProbe measures bone strength, which is only partly
      caused by BMD.

      Bone related fixation failure, such as secondary loss of reduction, is influenced by bone
      strength, bone mineral density, fracture type, fracture reduction and primary positioning of
      the implant. The predictive value of DensiProbe measurements for secondary loss of reduction
      needs to be investigated. If DensiProbe turned out to be an effective screening tool for
      patients with low bone strength that are on higher risk of the aforementioned complications
      these patients may in future benefit from alternative treatment methods (e.g. augmentation
      techniques) in order to reduce bone related fixation failure.

      The primary aim of the present study is to investigate if bone strength measured by
      DensiProbeTM Hip (DensiProbe) is an independent factor to predict secondary loss of reduction
      (screw migration of 5 mm or more and / or telescoping of 10 mm or more) in patients with hip
      fractures after fracture fixation with DHS.

    <description>DensiProbe (CE marked) is a mechanical probe, which is used intra-operatively to assess mechanical stability of the trabecular bone in the proximal femur. It consists of a drill bit like tool and an electronic system for measuring the peak torque to break-away of trabecular bone in the femoral head. DensiProbe measurements are designed to be integrated in the DHS surgical procedure.</description>
