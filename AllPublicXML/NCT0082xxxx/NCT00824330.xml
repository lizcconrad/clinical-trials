      Older persons with diabetes have a harder time maintaining blood pressure when standing up.
      When blood pressure drops when standing up, fainting may occur. This study will see how
      regular exercise can improve the ability of the body to keep blood pressure up when standing.
      We want to see how this improvement varies with a home-based walking program.

      Detailed Summary

        1. PURPOSE: Older adults with diabetes faint frequently, due to an impairment in the
           cardiovascular control mechanisms (arterial baroreceptor function, autonomic nervous
           system function and cerebral autoregulation) that prevent syncope. The purpose of this
           study is to examine the ability of a home based walking program to reverse these
           impairments.

        2. HYPOTHESES: a) A home-based walking program will improve the compensatory cardiovascular
           responses that prevent syncope in older adults with Type 2 diabetes. A moderate, regular
           exercise program will:

             -  increase arterial baroreflex sensitivity

             -  increase heart rate variability (marker of autonomic nervous system function)

             -  decrease cerebrovascular resistance

             -  improve cerebral autoregulation during upright tilt. b) There will be relationship
                between the improvement in compensatory cardiovascular responses and regular
                exercise.

                c) Design of more practicable training prescriptions than that used in a research
                setting.

    <description>Participants act as their own control.
Control Phase:
Participants will not change their activity during the 3 month control phase (defined as no strength training and less than 30 minutes brisk walking/moderate exercise per week, no vigorous exercise) Baseline measures will be obtained.
Exercise Phase:
This phase will consist of a Titration phase followed by an Intervention Phase. During the Titration phase, under the guidance of a trainer, subjects will increase their number of steps by 20% per week until they have reached 10,000 steps or 3 months have passed. During the Intervention Phase subjects will continue to walk 10,000 steps (or the number of steps they reached in the Titration phase).</description>
