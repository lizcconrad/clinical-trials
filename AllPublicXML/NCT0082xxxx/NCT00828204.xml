  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safe and effective use of the
      single-use autoinjector for the intramuscular (IM) delivery of liquid Avonex® (interferon
      beta-1a) in participants with multiple sclerosis (MS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Main Study was a 4-week treatment period which consisted of 1 Avonex manual injection
      using a prefilled syringe, followed by 3 Avonex injections using the single-use autoinjector.
      The Extension Study was designed to provide continuation of treatment with the Avonex
      single-use autoinjector to eligible participants who completed the Main Study for up to an
      additional 12 weeks, and to obtain additional safety and preference data for the Avonex
      single-use autoinjector.

      Participants were enrolled under the initial study protocol (Initial Subject Subset); the
      study was subsequently suspended. Changes were made to the protocol (including modifications
      to the autoinjector needle), and additional participants were enrolled (Main Subject Subset).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants in the Main Subset With Overall Success Using the Avonex Single-Use Autoinjector</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>A trainer/observer documented the participant's ability to self-inject with the Avonex single-use autoinjector and completed an observation form. Overall success in using the device for each participant was defined as no failures occurring in any step (ie, device set-up, self-administration of injection, and capping/disposal of the device) during the participant's use of the single-use Avonex autoinjector.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Indicated No Difficulty With the Injection Procedure of the Manual Injection or the Avonex Single-use Autoinjector</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed whether they had experienced any difficulty with the procedure in preparing, injecting, removing, and disposing process after each injection with the Avonex single-use autoinjector by answering yes or no to the following question: &quot;Did you have any difficulty with your injection?&quot; The percentage of participants answering no to this question for both the manual injection on Day 1 and the autoinjector on Days 8. 15 and 22 are presented.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Indicated a Preference for the Avonex Single-use Autoinjector Over the Manual Avonex Prefilled Syringe</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 23</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked whether they preferred using the Avonex single-use autoinjector over the manual Avonex prefilled syringe. Preference was defined as participants answering yes to the following question: Do you prefer this single-use autoinjector over the manual injection?</description>
