    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of two standard of care sedative medications
      on sleep stages and total sleep time. The investigators hypothesize that the α2 agonist,
      dexmedetomidine, will improve sleep quality by increasing N2 and N3 sleep as well as total
      sleep time when compared to GABA agonists.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center randomized pilot study comparing the effects of an α2 agonist
      (dexmedetomidine) versus GABA agonists (propofol or a benzodiazepine) on total sleep time and
      sleep quality. For the purposes of enrollment and analysis all benzodiazepines used for
      sedation (mainly midazolam and lorazepam) will be considered equivalent. Patients who are
      mechanically ventilated and sedated will be enrolled. The initial sedative will be determined
      by the managing medical team and the medication will be active at the time of enrollment. The
      patients will then be randomized to either continue their current sedative or be switched to
      either propofol or dexmedetomidine. PSG data will be collected for up to 96 hours, beginning
      at enrollment for all patients. The analysis of PSG will not begin until after a 8 hour
      &quot;washout&quot; period has completed to minimize carryover effect of prior sedatives.
