  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent guidelines on pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) recommend upper extremity exercise
      training (UEET) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      The theory supporting the inclusion of upper extremity exercise training in the pulmonary
      rehabilitation for these patients, is based on the profound understanding of the activity of
      the accessory respiratory muscles, which are competitively involved in both the support of
      the upper extremities during activities and the ventilation. However, a systematic review of
      the literature carried out by our staff reveals that the clinical trials carried out up to
      now to verify the effectiveness of UEET are of poor methodological quality and the
      investigators cannot corroborate the recommendation recently made on the basis of the results
      of the investigators' review.

      Therefore the investigators began this randomized, parallel groups, controlled clinical trial
      with the purpose of determining the short-term effect of unsupported UEET on the performance
      of the upper extremities and on symptoms perceived during activities by patients with COPD.

      We recruited inpatients with stable, moderate or severe COPD referred to the PR program at
      the regional centre of Villa Pineta Hospital.

      Patients were randomized into two groups: control and intervention. Patients randomized to
      the control group undertook an inpatient comprehensive PR that complied with the
      recommendations made by the ATS/ERS and included a minimum of 15 daily sessions of specific
      training for lower extremities.

      Patients randomized to the intervention group undertook an experimental program consisting of
      15 additional daily sessions of unsupported UEET over and above the same PR program used for
      control patients.

      Measurements of upper extremity performance and symptoms perceived were taken in both groups
      at baseline (T0) and at the completion of the interventions (Tend) by one physiotherapist
      unaware to the patient's group allocation. To verify if the experimental training leads to
      long-term results on the functional arm exercise capacity, some measurements were repeated at
      6-months as the latest follow-up (T6months).
