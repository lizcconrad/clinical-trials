      The aim of this study is to analyze the therapeutic effect of adjuvant TACE after
      resection.Patients receiving curative resection (R0) were randomized to postoperative TACE
      group and no TACE group. The time to recurrence ,the overall survival as well as the
      incidence of complications after therapy was observed to confirm the role of adjuvant TACE.

      Although resection of hepatocellular carcinoma is potentially curative, local recurrence is
      common with the recurrence rate higher than 50% during 5 years. So to reduce the recurrence
      rate of HCC, some interventions had been tried in clinic, including transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE), immunotherapy, and interferon treatment etc. But few of these
      adjuvant therapies had been proved effective and their long term efficacy and clinical
      application remained further explored.

      TACE had been prove to be effective in patients with advanced stage of HCC in randomized
      controlled trials and meta-analysis, but the role of adjuvant TACE after liver resection is
      controversial. The results getting from different randomized control trials varied
      significantly because of the bias of patient selection, different study design，the small size
      of sample, different drug used in chemotherapy and lack of proper stratification…,so a big
      sample size, well patients selected and well designed randomized controlled trial is needed
      to further confirm the role of the postoperative TACE.

      Patients with HCC who received curative liver resection (R0) were randomly assigned 1:1 by
      the doctors to receive no adjuvant TACE(control group) or TACE(treatment group). All patients
      in the treatment group received adjuvant TACE 45 days after liver resection. The outcomes of
      patients were evaluated during the 3-years follow up.
