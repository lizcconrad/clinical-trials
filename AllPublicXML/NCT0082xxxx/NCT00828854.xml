  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The addition of SNDX-275 to an AI will result in a maximal abrogation of estrogen receptor-α
      mediated activity and inhibit mechanisms of resistance to the aromatase inhibitor.

      It is hypothesized that SNDX-275 with continued AI will increase the estimated AI clinical
      benefit rate (CBR) from 5% to 25% with an acceptable safety profile.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Postmenopausal female patients.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed ER+ breast cancer.

          3. Progressive disease (PD) after at least 3 months on treatment with a 3rd generation AI
             in the advanced disease setting as measured by RECIST criteria.

          4. At least 1 measurable lesion ≥ 20 mm by conventional techniques or ≥ 10 mm by spiral
             CT scan with the last imaging performed within 4 weeks prior to study entry. If there
             is only one measurable lesion and it is located in previously irradiated field, it
             must have demonstrated progression according to RECIST criteria.

          5. ECOG 0-1.

          6. Laboratory parameters:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL; platelets ≥ 100 x109/L; ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L without the use
                  of hematopoietic growth factors.

               2. Creatinine less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal for the institution.

               3. AST and ALT less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal for the institution.

          7. Able to understand and give written informed consent and comply with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Discontinuation of AI therapy prior to study entry.

          2. Less than 3 months treatment with most recent AI.

          3. Rapidly progressive, life-threatening metastases, including any of the following:

               1. Symptomatic lymphangitic metastases.

               2. Patients with known active brain or leptomeningeal involvement.

          4. More than one prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

          5. Any chemotherapy within 3 months prior to study.

          6. Radiotherapy to measurable lesion within 2 months prior to study.

          7. Bisphosphonates initiated within 4 weeks prior to study start.

          8. Allergy to benzamides or inactive components of study drug.

          9. Previous treatment with entinostat or any other HDAC inhibitor including valproic
             acid.

         10. Patient is currently receiving treatment with any agent listed on the prohibited
             medication list such as valproic acid or other systemic cancer agents

         11. Any concomitant medical condition that precludes adequate study treatment compliance
             or assessment, or increases patient risk in the opinion of the investigator:

               1. Myocardial infarction or arterial thromboembolic events within 6 months, or
                  experiencing severe or unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class
                  III or IV disease and a QTc interval &gt;0.47 second.

               2. Uncontrolled heart failure or hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
                  uncontrolled systemic infection,

               3. Other active malignancy within 5 years excluding basal cell carcinoma or cervical
                  intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN / cervical carcinoma in situ] or melanoma in
                  situ).

         12. Patient currently is enrolled in (or completed within 30 days before study drug
             administration) another investigational drug study.
