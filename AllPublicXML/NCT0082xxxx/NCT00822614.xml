          -  A medically documented diagnosis of cancer

          -  Use of a fixed round the clock dose of opioid as maintenance therapy with a dose
             equivalence of at least 60mg of oral morphine/ day, or at least 25 mcg of transdermal
             fentanyl/ hour, or at least 30 mg of oral oxycodone daily, or at least 8 mg of oral
             hydromorphone daily. Current opioid treatment for at least 7 days prior to
             randomization

          -  At least 4 episodes of BTP per week, with peak intensity of at least 4 on the NPS at
             pain onset. No more than 4 BTP episodes per day.

          -  PIFR of at least 20L/min

          -  Karofsky Performance Status of 40 or better

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

             randomization

          -  Any clinical condition or medical history which, in the opinion of the investigator
             would not allow for the safe completion of the study or the safe administration of the
