Participants firstly received matching PR/XR placebo tablets for 2 weeks and then received 2 milligram (mg) PR/XR tablets with a weekly dose increase to 4 mg at Week 4. Between Weeks 6 and 24, the dose was optionally increased at intervals of 2 weeks or longer up to 16 mg/day. In the PR/XR Switching Phase, administration of the PR/XR tablets was continued until Week 32 at the same dose level as that at the end of the Non-Inferiority Verification Phase. Participants who entered into the Long-term Phase continued to receive ropinirole PR/XR tablets until Week 54 at the same dose level as that at the end of the PR/XR Switching Phase. Participants who did not enter the Long-term Phase entered the Down-titration Phase after completion of the PR/XR Switching Phase.</description>

        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients objectively. Part III assesses motor examination on 27 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Mean change from Week 0 was calculated as the total score at FAP minus the total score at Week 0. Participants who withdrew before Week 2 and who had only one observation for the part III total score were not included in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Japanese UPDRS Part IV Total Score at Week 0 and FAP (up to Week 24) in the Non-inferiority Verification Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD patients objectively. Part IV assesses complications of therapy on 11 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 or 0-1 points per item depending on the item. The maximum total score is 23 points. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms of complications.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Week 0 in Awake Time Spent &quot;On&quot; With Troublesome Dyskinesias at FAP (up to Week 24) in the Non-Inferiority Verification Phase</title>
          <description>&quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. Troublesome dyskinesia is defined as dyskinesia that interferes with the participant's daily activity. Mean change from Week 0 in On time with troublesome dyskinesias (actual hours) was calculated as On time with troublesome dyskinesias (hours) at FAP minus On time with troublesome dyskinesias (hours) at Week 0. Participants who had only one observation for On time with troublesome dyskinesias were not included in the analysis.</description>
          <population>FAS. Participants who had 0 hour as On time with troublesome dyskinesias at Week 0 were excluded from the analysis. On-treatment last observations within the phase were carried forward as FAP values of the phase. FAP values do not include values of Weeks 0, 1, and 2; participants who withdrew before Week 2 were not included in the analysis.</population>

        <population>FAS. Only participants who had &quot;off&quot; state were included in the analysis. On-treatment last observations within the phase were carried forward as FAP values of the phase. FAP values do not include values of Weeks 0, 1, and 2; participants who withdrew before Week 2 were not included in the analysis for the FAP.</population>

            <description>Participants received ropinirole IR tablets three times daily at the initial dose of 0.75 mg/day with a weekly dose increase to 3 mg/day at Week 4. Between Weeks 6 and 24, the dose was optionally increased at intervals of 2 weeks or longer up to 15 mg/day. Ropinirole IR tablets were administered until the night of the Week 24 visit and were replaced by ropinirole PR/XR tablets on the following morning, the morning of the first day of the PR/XR Switching Phase, at the same dose level. Participants who entered the Long-term Phase continued to receive ropinirole PR/XR until Week 54 at the same dose level as that at the end of the PR/XR Switching Phase. Participants who did not enter into the Long-term Phase entered the Down-titration Phase after completion of the PR/XR Switching Phase.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Week 24 (Period Baseline) in the Japanese UPDRS Part I Total Score at FAP (From Week 26 up to Week 32) in the PR/XR Switching Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD patients objectively. Part I assesses mentation, behavior, and mood on 4 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 16 points. A higher score indicates more severe mental symptoms. Mean change from Week 24 was calculated as the total score at FAP minus the total score at Week 24. Participants whose observation could not be obtained after Week 24 because of their premature withdrawal or other reasons were not included.</description>

          <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD patients objectively. Part III assesses motor examination on 27 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Mean change from Week 24 was calculated as the total score at FAP minus the total score at Week 24.</description>

        <title>Japanese UPDRS Part III Total Score at Week 24 and FAP (From Week 26 up to Week 32) in the PR/XR Switching Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD patients objectively. Part III assesses motor examination on 27 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. One participant whose observation could not be obtained at Week 24 was not included in the analysis for Week 24.</description>

        <description>&quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. Troublesome dyskinesia is defined as dyskinesia that interferes with the participant's daily activity. Mean change from Week 24 on On time with troublesome dyskinesias (actual hours) was calculated as On time with troublesome dyskinesias (hours) at FAP minus On time with troublesome dyskinesias (hours) at Week 24. Participants who had 0 hour as On time with troublesome dyskinesias at Week 24 were excluded from the analysis.</description>

In the PR/XR Switching Phase, administration of the PR/XR tablets was continued until Week 32 at the same dose level as that at the end of the Non-Inferiority Verification Phase. Participants who entered into the Long-term Phase continued to receive ropinirole PR/XR tablets until Week 54 at the same dose level as that at the end of the PR/XR Switching Phase. Participants who did not enter the Long-term Phase entered the Down-titration Phase after completion of the PR/XR Switching Phase.</description>

          <description>The Modified Hoehn &amp; Yahr criteria are measured on the following 8-point scale for disease severity: 0, No signs of disease; 1, Unilateral disease; 1.5, Unilateral plus axial involvement; 2, Bilateral disease; 2.5, Mild bilateral disease; 3, Mild to moderate bilateral disease; 4, Severe disability; and 5, Wheelchair bound or bedridden unless aided. &quot;Off&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. Only participants who had &quot;off&quot; state were included in the analysis.</description>
          <population>Switching-FAS. On-treatment last observations within the phase were carried forward as FAP values of the phase. FAP values do not include Week 24 values. Participants whose observation could not be obtained after Week 24 because of their premature withdrawal or other reasons were not included in the analysis for the FAP.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Week 0 in the Japanese UPDRS Part IV Total Score at Week 54 in the Long-term Phase in the Ropinirole PR-Ropinirole PR Group</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD patients objectively. Part IV assesses complications of therapy on 11 items. Participants receive a score of 0-4 or 0-1 points per item depending on the item. The maximum total score is 23 points. A higher score indicates more severe symptoms of complications. Mean change from Week 0 was calculated as the total score at Week 54 minus the total score at Week 0.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Week 0 in Awake Time Spent “On” With Troublesome Dyskinesias at Week 54 in the Long-term Phase in the Ropinirole PR-Ropinirole PR Group</title>
          <description>&quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. Troublesome dyskinesia is defined as dyskinesia that interferes with the participant's daily activity. Mean change from Week 0 in On time with troublesome dyskinesias (actual hours) was calculated as On time with troublesome dyskinesias (hours) at Week 54 minus On time with troublesome dyskinesias (hours) at Week 0.</description>
          <population>Long-FAS. Participants who had 0 hour as On time with troublesome dyskinesias at Week 0 were excluded from the analysis. Data were evaluated only at the time point at which they had been collected; participants whose observation could not be obtained because of their premature withdrawal or other reasons were not included in the analysis.</population>

Participants firstly received matching PR/XR placebo tablets for 2 weeks and then received 2 mg PR/XR tablets with a weekly dose increase to 4 mg at Week 4. Between Weeks 6 and 24, the dose was optionally increased at intervals of 2 weeks or longer up to 16 mg/day. In the PR/XR Switching Phase, administration of the PR/XR tablets was continued until Week 32 at the same dose level as that at the end of the Non-Inferiority Verification Phase. Participants who entered into the Long-term Phase continued to receive ropinirole PR/XR tablets until Week 54 at the same dose level as that at the end of the PR/XR Switching Phase.
