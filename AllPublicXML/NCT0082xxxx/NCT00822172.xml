      The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective L carnitine taken with cilostazol
      is compared to placebo taken with cilostazol for people with intermittent claudication. A
      second purpose of the study is to see if L-carnitine is absorbed into the blood stream.

      Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the leg with
      blood. It is caused by atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).

      Muscles require oxygen carried by the blood. When the leg muscles do not get enough blood and
      oxygen, this can cause pain, cramping, fatigue, and/or discomfort in the leg muscles during
      walking or exercise. These symptoms are called intermittent claudication (IC). In more severe
      cases, tissues do not get enough blood and oxygen at rest, and pain may also be present when
      the legs are resting. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)is one of the most common causes of pain
      and disability in people between 55 and 75 years of age.

      Cilostazol is a medication currently available by prescription for intermittent claudication.
      L-carnitine is an over-the-counter supplement. It is a natural substance in the human body
      and is also in some red meats, nuts, and energy drinks.

      Some subjects in the study will take L-carnitine with cilostazol and others will take placebo
      with cilostazol. The purpose of this study is to see how safe and effective L carnitine taken
      with cilostazol is compared to placebo taken with cilostazol for people with intermittent
      claudication. A placebo is a tablet or pill that looks like regular medication, but it
      doesn't have any actual medicine in it. A second purpose of the study is to see if
      L-carnitine is absorbed into the blood stream.

             (e.g., shortness of breath (SOB), fatigue, angina, arthritis, etc.). If, in the
             opinion of the investigator, the subject were to improve their Peak Walking Time (PWT)
             from study therapy to the extent that his or her walking would then be limited by a
             symptom other than claudication, the subject should not be enrolled.

             study medication(s) (cilostazol or L-carnitine) to be administered.

          -  The subject has initiated an exercise training program within 3 months of Screening 1,
             has the inability to maintain his or her current level of physical activity throughout
             the study, or the subject plans on enrolling in an exercise training program during
             the study.

          -  The subject plans to change his/her smoking status during the planned duration of this
             study (subjects will be advised that stopping smoking is best for his/her health).

          -  The subject is currently pregnant or breastfeeding.

             during this study.

          -  The subject has any other clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition that
             in the opinion of the Investigator could impact the subject's ability to successfully
             complete this trial.

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, the subject experienced any Adverse Events (AEs) during
             the tolerance phase of the Screening period that present a potential ongoing safety

      <recruitment_details>The first participant was randomized on September 19th, 2008 and the last subject was randomized on May 7, 2010. Clinical study sites were a mixture of university/hospital settings, VA hospitals, professional research centers and medical clinics.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study included a cilostazol run in period. From the 164 participants who remained eligible at the end of the run in period, only 1 participant did not subsequently receive treatment. This was due to voluntary withdrawal by the participant.</pre_assignment_details>
