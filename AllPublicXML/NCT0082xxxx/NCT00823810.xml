  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measuring tumor response to treatment based on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) has been a widely debated issue (response criteria in solid tumors
      [RECIST] and World Health Organization criteria). Furthermore, early identification of
      nonresponding patients is of great importance because the rates of response of common
      malignant solid tumors to chemotherapy are in the range of only 20-30%. Therefore,
      quantitative imaging of tumor metabolism with 18F-FDG PET/CT may provide important advantages
      and thus reduce side effects and costs of ineffective therapy. However, the evidence to date
      for the use of 18F-FDG-PET/CT with this indication is limited.

      The purpose of the present trial is to determine the impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the
      management of advanced colorectal cancer. The aim is also to confirm whether a metabolic
      response can be used as a surrogate end point in monitoring treatment response in this cancer
      type.

      The study consists of 40 patients with advanced colorectal cancer patients. All patients will
      be studied with 18F-FDG PET/CT combined with diagnostic contrast enhanced abdominal CT before
      the start of chemotherapy and re-evaluated 4-5 weeks after the initiation of therapy. Effect
      of this metabolic and anatomic change in therapy are evaluated and correlated to survival,
      morbidity, and treatment -related costs. Histopathologic confirmation of response is
      evaluated whenever possible. The data will be collected between 2008 and 2012.
