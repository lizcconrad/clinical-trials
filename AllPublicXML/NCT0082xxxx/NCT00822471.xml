  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A concise diabetes self-management education (DSME) program on the &quot;ABCs of Diabetes&quot; will be
      placed in an urban public library to assess the feasibility of using this community setting
      for the delivery of health care education in an urban African American population. Impact on
      knowledge of, prescriptions for, and control of blood sugar (A1C), blood pressure (BP) and
      LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)before and after participation in the program will be assessed. We
      will also examine the frequency of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for
      uncontrolled diabetes at 6 months post-DSME intervention.

      A free, community-based Diabetes Learning Center was placed in a public library. Adults with
      diabetes (N=360) consented to participate in this prospective cohort study with historic
      self-controls. The small group, interactive DSME (two 2-1/2 hour classes) focused on
      improving CVD risk factors and enabling communication with the primary care physician.
      Knowledge, prescriptions, diabetes-related testing and clinical outcomes were assessed.
