    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to assess the efficacy and safety of live, attenuated measles
      vaccine as consolidation therapy in patients with measles-positive, non-small cell lung
      cancer with locally-advanced (stage 3B with pleural effusion) or metastatic (stage 4) tumors
      in remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-institution, non-randomized phase 1/2 study in patients with
      locally-advanced or metastatic NSCLC in remission after receiving standard systemic
      chemotherapy of four cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of
      cisplatin combined with vinorelbine.
