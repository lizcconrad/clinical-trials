      Primary Objectives

        1. To estimate the frequency of HFS following treatment with capecitabine as modulated by
           the unilateral local application of eniluracil containing ointment.

        2. To assess any eniluracil dose response relationship in prevention of HFS.

        3. To evaluate any potential toxicity of eniluracil ointment.

          4. Radiologically documented measurable disease

          5. Planned to receive capecitabine at 1000-1250 mg/m2 PO twice daily and has experienced
             grade 1 or greater HFS on a previous cycle of capecitabine.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 at study
             entry.

          7. Adequate liver function with SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2.5 times upper limits of normal.

          8. Adequate bone marrow function evidence by WBC &gt; 2500/mm3, PMN &gt;2000/mm3 and platelet
             count &gt; 100,000/mm3.

          9. Adequate renal function with serum creatinine &lt; 1.7 mg/dl.

         10. Recovery from relevant toxicity before study entry.

         11. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days before study entry for women of
             childbearing potential. Effective contraception throughout the course of the study for
             both male and female subjects if the risk of conception exists.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if ANY of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Known DPD deficiency

          2. Any other investigational drug, chronic corticosteroids or radiation therapy within 28
             days before study entry.

          3. History of brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless irradiated at least 28
             days before study entry and stable without steroid treatment for &gt;28 days.

          4. Stroke, major surgery, or other major tissue injury within 30 days before study entry.

          5. Myocardial infarction within 12 months or uncontrolled congestive heart failure,

          9. Other uncontrolled serious chronic disease or conditions that in the investigator's
             opinion could render compliance or follow-up in the protocol problematic.
