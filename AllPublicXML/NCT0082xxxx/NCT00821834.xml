      Primary objective:

        -  To evaluate whether 12 weeks of clopidogrel is superior to ticlopidine in terms of lower
           risk of the safety events of interest in patients with stable angina (SA) or old
           myocardial infarction (OMI) to which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is being
           planned.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the incidence of adverse events, adverse drug reactions and bleeding events
           in patients treated with clopidogrel versus ticlopidine.

        -  To compare the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and major adverse
           cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients treated with clopidogrel versus
           ticlopidine.

        -  To evaluate the long-term safety (adverse drug reactions, adverse events, safety events
           of interest and bleeding events) of clopidogrel for a total of 52 weeks;

        -  To evaluate MACE and MACCE of clopidogrel for a total of 52 weeks.

      The study consisted of two periods:

        -  a double blind treatment period of 12 weeks followed by,

        -  an open label clopidogrel treatment period in a subset of patients.

      All patients should receive aspirin (81-100 mg once daily) as a background therapy during
      investigational product administration.
