  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Escitalopram (Lexapro) and citalopram (Celexa) are similar selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors that alter blood flow to the amygdala and other brain structures involved in
      regulating mood. Escitalopram consists of S-citalopram while citalopram contains both
      S-citalopram and R-citalopram (racemic citalopram). There is evidence that R-citalopram may
      block the effects of S-citalopram. The hypothesis being tested is that because of the
      antagonist effect of R-citalopram, S-citalopram will have a greater effect on the mood
      circuit than racemic citalopram when equal doses of S-citalopram are administered. The study
      design consists of a two week medication period followed by blood oxygen level dependent
      (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing affective visual stimuli.

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited by advertisement from April 2008 until January 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants had their serotonin transporter genotyped. Individuals with a genotype of SS or SLg were not randomized. A total of 85 potential participants were screened.
