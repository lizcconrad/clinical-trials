      The objectives of this study are: to identify and develop techniques to minimize precision
      errors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of knee cartilage, and to determine if
      results from newly-identified MRI techniques in measuring cartilage changes and structure can
      be reproduced.

    <textblock>
      The development of a disease modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) is currently limited by
      the inability to detect and monitor early cartilage damage that would be amenable to
      treatment. There is growing interest within the pharmaceutical and research community to use
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify biochemical and structural changes in the
      cartilage extra cellular matrix that occur early in the disease process. Although these
      techniques have been validated in small studies at single sites, multi-center evaluation of
      accuracy and precision, needed to apply these techniques to clinical trials of DMOADs, has
      not been performed. To address this need, the primary objective for this protocol is to
      identify and develop techniques to minimize systematic errors that decrease precision of MRI
      evaluation of knee cartilage, and to assess the reproducibility of the newly identified MRI
      techniques in measuring the cartilage morphometry and structure. Successful completion of
      this project may establish a multi-center imaging network in Pennsylvania for MRI evaluation
      of potential disease modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) therapy.

        This multi-center trial comprises only facilities within Pennsylvania. Study participants
        for the normal cohorts will be recruited through print flyers. It is anticipated that the
        study participants with mild to moderate OA will be identified by the radiologists
        interpreting the knee x-rays.
