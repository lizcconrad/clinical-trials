      Background:

      Repetition rate after a suicide attempt and self harm is very high, about 12-30 percent.
      Studies, reviewed by Hawton, 1999 show a lack of evidence for psychosocial interventions.
      Compliance with aftercare is also often very poor.

      Objective:

      Inspired by the Norwegian Baerum project, the aim is to study if active, assertive outreach,
      seeking contact, talking about problem solution, motivate to comply to other appointments,
      will reduce repetition of suicidal acts in the following years.

      Methods:

      The design is a prospective randomized, controlled trial. The patients (immediately after a
      suicide attempt or deliberate self harm)) included are randomized to intervention or standard
      (treatment as usual), aiming at at least 60 persons in each arm. The intervention is carried
      out through research nurses with about 8 home visits, phone contact, phone messaging,
      e-mails.Included are persons 12 years of age and older, danish speaking without translator
      and without diagnoses of severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar illness, mania and
      severe/psychotic depression) or severe dementia.

      Results:

      Outcome is measured by repetition of suicidal act (suicide attempt, self harm or completed
      suicide)as recorded in medical records and by the Danish Cause of Death Register. Repetition
      measured by persons and by acts throughout 1 year, 2 and 3 years periods. Additional outcome
      is number and character of health system contacts.
