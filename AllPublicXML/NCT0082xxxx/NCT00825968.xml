      The purpose of the database is to complete outcomes research (risk factors, follow-up,
      procedural data) Perhaps the most important research for any busy clinical laboratory is to
      appreciate the tendencies and trends that are occurring in their own laboratory setting. This
      will have a tremendous impact on educating the OSU staff as well as perhaps other centers on
      best medical practices.
