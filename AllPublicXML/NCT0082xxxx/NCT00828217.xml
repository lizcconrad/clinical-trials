  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of adapted physical activity intervention on
      health-related quality of life and satisfaction with care in hospitalized children and
      adolescents.

      This is a randomized controlled study. The hypothesis is that children practicing adapted
      physical activity during their hospitalization present a higher health-related quality of
      life and satisfaction with care than those who do not.
