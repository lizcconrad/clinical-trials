    <textblock>
      For chronic HBV infection, an optimal pharmacological agent to promote recovery from chronic
      HBV infection would be one that inhibits HBV DNA polymerase, combined with the clearence from
      the liver of cccDNA to block HBV reactivation after the circulating viral burden has been
      eliminated by therapy. The activity of clevudine on cccDNA in combination with its potent
      antiviral activity on HBV polymerase makes it the optimal agent in combination with tenofovir
      for this protocol.

             entry on two additional occasions at most. If the parameter out of range for inclusion
             was ALT over 10 x ULN, the patient should be reassessed over 4 weeks after the date
