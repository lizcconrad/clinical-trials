  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone-marrow-derived progenitor cells (EPCS) play an important role in neovascularization and
      tumor growth. In lung cancer, angiogenesis is an important event in mechanisms of tumor
      proliferation and metastasis. Recent evidences suggest that EPCS can be recruited and
      differentiate in mature endothelial cells to form new blood vessels. The role of EPCs in
      NSCLC is unclear. In contrast, angiogenic drugs are proposed combined to systemic
      chemotherapy in NSCLC. The aim of this study is to identify EPCs in peripheral blood from
      patients with NSCLC, by comparison to Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD), an
      inflammatory disease.

      The aim of this study is to study blood circulating levels bone-marrow-derived progenitor
      cells (EPCS).

      In a first phase, EPCs will be detected in healthy non-smokers volunteers to validate flow
      cytometry method (n=25). In addition, EPC will e characterized by primary cultures to analyze
      EPC-specific markers.

      In a second phase, EPCs will detect in peripheral blood from 50 patients with Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and 50 patients with non-small cell lung cancers
      (NSCLC). Primary cultures will be made to confirm EPCS isolation.

      Methods: EPCs will be numerated by flow cytometry using CD133, CD146, CD34, CD45 and VEGFR2
      antibodies. Primary cultures will be used to identify EPCs at 5-days culture by the same
      markers. In addition, for BPCO et NSCLC patients, Vascular endothelial cell growth factor
      (VEGF) concentration will be measured in peripheral sera by ELISA commercial test.

      Overall survival will be analyzed for NSCLC in function of initial EPCs concentration.
      Correlation will be studied between initial VEGF serum concentration and EPCs level.

      This study focus on the possibility that EPC determination in peripheral blood could be used
      as a surrogate marker of standard or antiangiogenic treatment in NSCLC.
