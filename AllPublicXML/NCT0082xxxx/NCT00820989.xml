  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body's immune response to injury or infection is very complex.Endotoxin is a man-made
      substance, which causes the body to &quot;mimic&quot; sickness (fever,chills, and achiness)for a few
      hours. This study is designed to determine whether certain proteins, genetics, or heart rate
      variability change affects the body's response to endotoxin.

      The body's immune response to injury or infection is very complex.Immune cell activity, the
      release of specific mediators(such as proteins, genetics(Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA), the
      body's &quot;instructions&quot; for making proteins (Ribonucleic Acid or RNA) and heart rate
      variability (HRV,the intervals between heartbeats) may affect the body's clinical response to
      stress such as infection.Endotoxin is a man-made substance, which causes the body to &quot;mimic&quot;
      sickness (fever,chills, and achiness)for a few hours. This study is designed to determine
      whether any of the above (proteins,genetics,or HRV, etc.) correlate with or affect the body's
      response to endotoxin.This will enable the investigator to better understand the mechanisms
      involved in the immune response as well as potential therapeutic strategies to improve
      outcomes in patients.
