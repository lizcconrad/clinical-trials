    <description>The IlluminOssâ„¢ Bone Stabilization System is designed to deliver the device to the fracture site via the medullary canal of the bone using percutaneous techniques. Once the device is in place and has spanned the fracture site, the device is expanded and hardened to reduce and stabilize the fracture, to aid in the support and healing of the bone fracture by primary callous formation and remodeling.</description>
