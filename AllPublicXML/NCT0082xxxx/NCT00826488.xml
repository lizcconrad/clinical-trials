  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare conventional breast imaging and diagnostic work-up (2
      dimensional imaging) to digital breast tomosynthesis (3 dimensional imaging) in the
      appearance of non-calcified breast masses. It is thought that non-calcified breast masses
      will be better visualized with the new 3D technology.

    <measure>It is anticipated that out of 100 subjects recalled for additional breast imaging that 10 women will be recalled for biopsy. By adding 2D &amp; 3D imaging, it is anticipated that 30 subjects out of 100 will have needed no workup.</measure>

    <description>Women with a positive screening mammogram called back for additional views will be asked to undergo an additional Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (3D mammogram) on the affected breast. Radiation dose is somewhat less than that of a screening mammogram.</description>
