  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide a systemic, uniform and user-friendly tool for collection of data on prostate
      cancer salvage cryotherapy in a multicenter setting. The goal is to learn more about the
      short and long term efficacy and safety of this procedure. Ultimately the data analysis will
      serve as a robust guidance instrument for improving upon the utilization of this procedure
      for the treatment of patients with recurrent (LRD) prostate cancer.
