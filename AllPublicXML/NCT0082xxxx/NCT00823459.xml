    <textblock>
      A single-arm, one-stage phase II trial of RAD001 will be undertaken. Sixty patients will be
      enrolled. The target population will be patients with a diagnosis of low-grade glioma who
      experience a recurrence and who undergo a biopsy or subtotal resection at the time of
      recurrence with pathologic evidence of recurrent glioma. The purpose of this study is to
      accrue patients to evaluate a pharmacologic agent. The study drug RAD001 will be
      self-administered (by the patients themselves). RAD001 will be administered orally as once
      daily dose of 10 mg (two 5 mg tablets) continuously from study day 1 until progression of
      disease or unacceptable toxicity.

             be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication.

          -  Patients must have histologically proven intracranial low-grade glioma at initial
             diagnosis.

          -  Patients must have unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by
             histology as determined by review of pathology by an attending neuro-pathologist at
             UCSF

          -  If most recent histology shows progression to high grade glioma, patients must have
             had prior radiotherapy in order to be eligible

          -  Paraffin-embedded sections of tissue acquired from surgery at the time of suspected
             recurrence must be available for analysis

          -  Patients must have evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI as determined
             by radiographic review of images by an attending neuro-oncologist or neuro-radiologist
             at UCSF

          -  An MRI must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement

          -  Patients may have had treatment (including radiotherapy) for any number of relapses
             prior to this recurrence

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks from the completion of any radiation therapy

          -  Patients must be less than 4 months from the surgical procedure for this recurrence

               -  4 weeks from any investigational agent.

               -  4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy (except 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 3 weeks
                  from procarbazine, 3 weeks from vincristine)

                  thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients, who have not recovered from the side effects of a major surgery or
             significant traumatic injury or patients that may require major surgery during the
             course of the study

          -  Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another

          -  Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of
             the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.

          -  Other than surgery, patients may not have therapy for this recurrence (including
