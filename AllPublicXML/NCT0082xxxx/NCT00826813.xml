  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than half of patients with esophageal cancer are inoperable because of late stage cancer
      or metastasis and they have to undergo palliative treatments. Dysphagia is the major symptom
      of patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. To relieve the dysphagia and improve the
      quality of life of such patients, stent placement has been widely accepted to be an option
      for palliation of the symptoms. However, recurrence of the neoplastic stricture remains a
      challenge after stent placement. To combine the advantages of the immediate relief of the
      esophageal dysphagia with the stent placement and radiation therapy with brachytherapy, a
      novel esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds has been developed in the authors' institute.
      The preliminary clinical trial in a single institute has demonstrated better results than the
      conventional stent. This prospective multiple center trial is designed to further demonstrate
      the clinical outcomes with this irradiation, stent in patients compared to those using a
      conventional covered stent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer ranks as the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in China and sixth
      worldwide. Although the prognosis of surgical resection for esophageal cancer has been
      improved, more than 50% of such patients are inoperable and have to undergo palliative
      treatments because of late stage cancer or metastasis. Dysphagia is the predominate symptom
      of patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. To relieve the dysphagia and improve the
      quality of life of such patients, brachytherapy has previously been utilized. Recently, stent
      placement has been widely accepted to be an option for palliation of the symptoms due to the
      esophageal strictures. However, recurrence of the neoplastic stricture remains a challenge
      after stent placement. To combine the advantages of the immediate relief of the esophageal
      dysphagia with the stent placement and radiation therapy with brachytherapy, a novel
      esophageal stent loaded with 125I seeds has been developed in the authors' institute. The
      technical feasibility and safety with this new stent has been demonstrated to be adequate in
      a healthy rabbit model. The following preliminary clinical study in a single institute has
      demonstrated longer survival time, better quality of life and less restenosis of the stent
      than whose with the conventional stent. This prospective multiple center trial is designed to
      further demonstrate the clinical outcomes with this irradiation, stent in patients compared
      to those using a conventional covered stent.

    <description>The esophageal stent combined a self-expandable covered esophageal stent and 125I radioactive seeds. Sheathes were attached to the outer surface of the stent, containing 125I radioactive seeds of CIAE 6711. The seeds were loaded into the sheathes on the stent immediately before implantation of the stent. The numbers and dose of the radioactive stent seeds was determined by the treatment plan system based on the size of the individual tumor. To cover the entire lesion of the tumor by the sheaths containing 125I seeds, at least 2 cm exceeding the tumor margins was required. The distance between the two sheaths was 15mm. In the control group, conventional covered esophageal stents were used which provided by the same company as those attached with 125I seeds.</description>
