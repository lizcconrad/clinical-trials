  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a real-time continuous glucose monitoring
      system is able to improve HbA1c in patients suffering from type 1 diabetes compared to
      conventional finger prick glucose measurements. In addition it will investigate whether
      number of episodes with serious hypoglycemia is changed in those same patients, and whether
      quality of life (health status and treatment satisfaction) increases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 &gt; 3 years.

          2. For practical reasons patients should live in Trondheim, Malvik, Melhus or Kl√¶bu.

          3. Level of HbA1c (measured by DCA 2000) between 7 and 10 % and/or experience blood
             glucose &lt; 3 mmol/L (verified by finger-prick measurement) at least once a week and/or
             at least one episode with serious hypoglycemia the previous half a year.(Defined as
             need of help from others)

          4. Only patients who use insulin pumps or multi-injection regime (=3 daily injections
             with short term acting insulin or insulin analogue + at lest one daily injection with
             NPH-insulin or long term acting insulin analogue.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with other diseases such as untreated hypothyroidism, adrenal gland failure,
             celiac disease, renal failure, unstable coronary heart disease, serious psychiatric
             disorder, or mental retardation.

          2. Patients who are not able to learn how to use the continuous glucose monitoring system
             given a reasonable amount of effort.

          3. Patients who are not able to do the glucose measurements, insulin dose change and
             diary notes which the study demands.

          4. Unsuited for participating from any other cause.
