      The objective of this retrospective chart review is to evaluate the patient characteristics,
      treatment variations and efficacy of a second trial of Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion 0.05%
      therapy in chronic dry eye patients who were initially treated with Cyclosporine Ophthalmic
      Emulsion 0.05% but discontinued use after less than 12 weeks of treatment.
