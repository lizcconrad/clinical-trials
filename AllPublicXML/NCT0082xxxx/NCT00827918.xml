  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with MK-8998 as compared to placebo
      and olanzapine for acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia. The primary hypothesis is
      that in participants undergoing an acute psychotic episode of schizophrenia, MK-8998 6 to 8
      mg twice daily is superior to placebo in the treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia as
      measured by the mean change from baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      total score at Week 4.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. PANSS measure is composed of 3 scales: Positive scale, Negative scale, and General Psychopathology scale. Positive scale assesses hallucinations, delusions and related symptoms; Negative scale assesses emotional withdrawal, lack of motivation, and similar symptoms; and General Psychopathology scale addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, somatic concern and disorientation. The PANSS has 30 items in its 3 scales and an anchored Likert scale from 1 to 7 is used to score each item. Values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively more severe symptoms. The Positive scale has 7 items with a score from 7 to 49, the Negative scale has 7 items with a score from 7 to 49, and the General Psychopathology scale has 16 items with a score from 16 to 112. A total score is the sum of the 3 scores for the 3 scales.</description>

    <description>Responders were defined as participants who demonstrated ≥ 20% improvement from baseline on the PANSS total score. PANSS measure is composed of 3 scales: Positive scale, Negative scale, and General Psychopathology scale. Positive scale assesses hallucinations, delusions and related symptoms; Negative scale assesses emotional withdrawal, lack of motivation, and similar symptoms; and General Psychopathology scale addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, somatic concern and disorientation. The PANSS has 30 items in its 3 scales and an anchored Likert scale from 1 to 7 is used to score each item. Values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively more severe symptoms.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S is a commonly used measure of symptom severity in treatment studies of participants with mental disorders. CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a participant is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; or 7 = extremely ill.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at Week 4</title>
        <description>PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia. PANSS measure is composed of 3 scales: Positive scale, Negative scale, and General Psychopathology scale. Positive scale assesses hallucinations, delusions and related symptoms; Negative scale assesses emotional withdrawal, lack of motivation, and similar symptoms; and General Psychopathology scale addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, somatic concern and disorientation. The PANSS has 30 items in its 3 scales and an anchored Likert scale from 1 to 7 is used to score each item. Values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively more severe symptoms. The Positive scale has 7 items with a score from 7 to 49, the Negative scale has 7 items with a score from 7 to 49, and the General Psychopathology scale has 16 items with a score from 16 to 112. A total score is the sum of the 3 scores for the 3 scales.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) at Week 4</title>
        <description>CGI-S is a commonly used measure of symptom severity in treatment studies of participants with mental disorders. CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a participant is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; or 7 = extremely ill.</description>
