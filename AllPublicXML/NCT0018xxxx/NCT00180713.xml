      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of adding simvastatin to
      the current conventional treatment regimen for the management of pulmonary hypertension.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease that is characterised by progressive
      narrowing of the blood vessels of the lungs. This results in a pressure load on the heart and
      heart failure.

      The narrowing is in part due to constriction but mostly due to structural changes in affected
      vessels. The structural changes affect all cell components of the vessel wall (the
      endothelial lining, the muscle layer and fibrous tissue) and can lead to local clot
      formation. In addition there is evidence of inflammation of the vessels and what is known as
      oxidative stress. The disease may occur with no obvious cause, when it is known as
      idiopathic, but it can also be associated with a variety of other diseases, including
      congenital heart disease, collagen vascular disease and HIV infection.

      Current approaches to the treatment of pulmonary hypertension are unsatisfactory as they do
      not prevent disease progression and do not directly or adequately address many of the
      processes detailed above. Alternative or additional treatments are therefore required and an
      attrative approach is to use a statin (a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA, or HMG-CoA,
      reductase inhibitor). Statins are widely used for their ability to lower blood cholesterol
      but increasing evidence indicates that these drugs also have direct effects on cell
      components of the vessel wall - including inhibiting inflammation, clot formation and
      oxidative stress - that might be beneficial in pulmonary hypertension.
