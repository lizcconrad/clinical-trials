  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was assesment of splanchnic and systemic hemodynamic effects of chronic
      administration (2 month) of spironolactone or propranolol, alone or in association in
      alcoholic cirrhotic patients. The patients were randomized in 4 groups (aldactone 150 mg/day,
      propranolol 160 mg/day, aldactone 150 mg/day + propranolol 160 mg/day, placebo). Systemic and
      splanchnic hemodynamic effect were evaluated by hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements
      before and after 2 month of treatment.
