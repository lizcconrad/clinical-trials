    <textblock>
      This study is examining the effects of short daily hemodialysis on platelet function, fluid
      volume control, arterial stiffness and patient quality of life, as compared to conventional
      hemodialysis.

    <textblock>
      Bleeding is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end stage renal
      disease. A major cause of uremic bleeding is due to platelet dysfunction. It has been
      theorized that in renal failure, toxins accumulate, some of which inhibit primary hemostasis.
      All aspects of normal platelet function are affected. Platelet function has previously been
      difficult to quantify but recently a novel test, the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) has
      been determined to be both sensitive and specific in assessing platelet function.
      Conventional hemodialysis (CHD) has been shown to partially correct thrombocytopathy.
      Enhanced uremic clearance can now be attained through the use of short daily hemodialysis
      (SDHD). Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality in dialysis patients,
      accounting for 40% of deaths. Volume overload is associated with high blood pressure, left
      ventricular hypertrophy and elevated markers of inflammation and these factors have been
      associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. SDHD has been shown to control blood
      pressure and limit volume expansion. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) has been used to assess
      arterial compliance and reduction of arterial elasticity of large and small arteries which
      have been associated with cardiovascular outcomes.
