  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that bioenergetic failure in human sepsis, related to
      endocrine, metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction, is a major determinant of defective host
      immune responses, increasing disease severity and risk of death. The objectives of this study
      are to examine the relationship between the severity of illness, and temporal changes in the
      activity of endocrine, metabolic and bioenergetic pathways, and consequent immune dysfunction
      in critically ill patients with sepsis and multiple organ failure in the Intensive Care Unit.

      The objectives of this study are to examine the relationship between the severity of illness,
      and temporal changes in the activity of endocrine, metabolic and bioenergetic pathways, and
      consequent immune dysfunction in critically ill patients with sepsis and multiple organ
      failure in the Intensive Care Unit.

      This study will be undertaken using sequential blood sampling (until ICU discharge) and
      muscle biopsies (to a maximum of 5) in critically ill patients (a) with or (b) without sepsis
      plus a comparator group undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. A variety of hormonal,
      cytokine, immune and mitochondrial measures wil lbe then made to assess whether any
      relationship exists between alterations in these different pathways, and whether eventual
      survivors and non-survivors can be distinguished.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Group 1: healthy control patients Patients undergoing elective total hip replacement
             will be eligible for enrollment in Group 1 after written informed consent has been
             obtained. Only 1 blood sample and 1 fat and muscle biopsy will be taken
             intra-operatively

        Group 2: non-septic, critically ill patients Patients requiring intensive care within 48
        hours of admission to hospital from home, for a non-septic/non-inflammatory pathology will
        be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed agreement has been obtained from the
        closest family member (see Consent below). At enrolment, Group 2 patients must have
        received mechanical ventilation commencing within 48 hours of admission to intensive care,
        should be likely to require mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours, and must not
        fulfil the 2001 International Sepsis Definition Conference criteria for severe sepsis or
        septic shock

        Group 3: patients with severe sepsis or septic shock Patients requiring intensive care
        within 48 hours of admission to hospital from home, and evidence of severe sepsis (organ
        dysfunction due to infection) or septic shock as defined by the 2001 International Sepsis
        Definition Conference criteria, will be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed
        agreement has been obtained from their next-of-kin. Patients with underlying chronic liver
        disease are excluded from this group, and will be enrolled separately into Group 4.

        Group 4: patients with severe sepsis and underlying chronic liver disease Patients
        requiring intensive care admission, with underlying Child-Pugh Class A or B, biopsy-proven
        liver cirrhosis, within 24 h of the onset of severe sepsis (organ dysfunction due to
        infection) or septic shock as defined by the 2001 International Sepsis Definition
        Conference criteria), will be eligible for enrollment in the study after informed agreement
        has been obtained from their next-of-kin

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Age &lt;18 years

        Child-Pugh Class C liver disease

        Chronic dialysis-dependent renal failure

        Hepatitis B or C infection

        Immunosuppression (e.g. haematological malignancy, neutropenia, HIV infection)

        Immunosuppressive drug therapy within past 6 months

        Patient receiving oral or IV steroid therapy for greater than 1 week, within 6 months prior
        to ICU admission

        Muscle biopsy contraindicated in presence of coagulopathy (INR &gt;2, platelet count &lt;
        30,000)*

        Next-of-kin declines agreement / patient declines consent

        Patient receiving thyroid hormone therapy prior to ICU admission

        *This does not exclude enrolment into the study, particularly in the case of Group 4
        patients who frequently develop a coagulopathy as part of their underlying liver
        dysfunction
