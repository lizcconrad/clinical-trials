  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proof-of-concept study, forearm vulnerability to ischemic exercise is studied in
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus with and without prior ischemic preconditioning (short
      period of ischemia that protects against subsequent ischemic exercise). Annexin A5
      scintigraphy is used to quantify subtle signs of mild and reversible forearm injury that
      results from ischemic exercise.

      The following hypotheses are tested:

        1. Patients with type 1 diabetes are not more vulnerable to ischemic injury as compared
           with previously studied healthy volunteers.

        2. Ischemic preconidtioning is still present in patients with type 1 diabetes. Depending on
           the validity of hypothesis 2, the effect of short pharmacological interventions are
           studied on vulnerability to forearm ischemia/reperfusion injury in the absence or
           presence of local forearm ischemic preconditioning.

      All patients will be studied in supine position after an overnight fast, while plasma glucose
      levels are monitored. In the first 8 patients intravenous insulin is administered as needed,
      to reach target glucose levels between 5-7 mmol/l. Patients will be subjected to 10 minutes
      of forearm ischemia (non-dominant arm), combined with handgripping at 50% of maximal force
      until exhaustion. Upon reperfusion, Tc-99m-HYNIC-Annexin A5 will be injected intravenously.
      Targeting of annexin A5 to thenar muscle and forearm flexor muscle will be quantified as the
      percentage difference in radioactivity between experimental and control side. This procedure
      will be performed twice (randomized cross-over design), with at least 2 week interval, either
      with or without 10 minutes ischemia followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion prior to ischemic
      exercise.

      Depending on the results of this study, substudies will be performed to study the effect of
      diazoxide (K-ATP channel opener, may mimic ischemic preconditioning), glibenclamide (K-ATP
      channel blocker, may inhibit ischemic preconditioning) or adenosine (infusion into brachial
      artery of non-dominant arm as a substitute for ischemic preconditioning).
