      during pregnancy. The study also examines differential effects of study treatments on
      delivery outcome and post partum depression.

      Participants in this study are randomly assigned to one of the three experimental groups that
      include two types of acupuncture treatment and perinatal massage. The two acupuncture
      treatments are delivered in a double-blind fashion. Treatments consist of an acute phase
      during which participants receive 12 treatment sessions over a period of 8 weeks. Responders
      and partial responders enter a continuation phase during which they receive weekly treatments
      that end 10 weeks post delivery. At the end of the continuation phase, participants continue
      to be clinically assessed at 3 and 6 months after the end of treatment to detail the natural
      course of relapse to the index episode in the three treatment groups.
