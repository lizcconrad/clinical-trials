  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether additional task specific physiotherapy
      treatment and a self administrated home training program results in better balance compared
      to traditional follow up care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased risk of falling is a major problem after stroke and impaired balance is one of the
      main reasons for falling. Early and intensive physiotherapy seems to be beneficial for
      functional outcome after stroke although it is still unknown whether one specific
      physiotherapy technique is better than another.

      Comparison: Traditional follow up care by the community health care system with additional
      task specific physiotherapy three times a week and a daily self administrated home training
      program compared to traditional follow up care by the community health care system.
