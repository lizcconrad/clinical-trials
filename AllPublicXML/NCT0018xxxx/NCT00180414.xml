  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the correlation between ventricular rate regulation (VRR) and the
      percentage of biventricular pacing as well as subjective quality of life and level of
      physical ability in CRT patients with atrial fibrillation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether VRR can increase the amount of biventricular pacing in CRT patients
      with conducted atrial arrhythmias. Secondarily, an investigation will be carried out to
      determine whether this increase in biventricular pacing results in an improvement in quality
      of life, as well as an improvement in the symptoms caused by the atrial arrhythmia and an
      improvement in the level of physical ability.
