  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute and subchronic effects of amitriptyline were compared to placebo in a double-blind
      crossover randomized study on driving ability and driving-related skills in chronic
      neuropathic pain patients.It was hypothesized that nocturnally administered 25 mg
      amitriptyline might affect driving performance negatively after acute, but not after
      subchronic treatment.

      The present study was designed to determine the effects of nocturnally administered 25 mg
      amitriptyline, compared to placebo, after single (Day 1, acute effects) and repeated (Day 15,
      subchronic effects) administration on driving performance in neuropathic pain patients. In
      addition to the on-the-road driving test, laboratory tests measuring driving-related skills
      were administered. Moreover, effects of amitriptlyine on an attentional capacity task were
      tested using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). It was hypothesized that nocturnally
      administered 25 mg amitriptyline might affect driving performance negatively after acute, but
      not after subchronic treatment.
