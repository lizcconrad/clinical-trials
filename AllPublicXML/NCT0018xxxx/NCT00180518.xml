      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate equivalence in the safety and performance of the
      RX ACCUNET when used with the RX ACCULINK, to that of the ACCULINK and ACCUNET devices, in
      the treatment of high risk surgical patients and patients with anatomical risks who require
      treatment for carotid artery disease.

      Patients in ARCHeR RX will be followed after the index procedure at one, six and 12 months.
      Equivalence in safety will be demonstrated by comparing 30-day rates of DSMI for ARCHeR
      Amendment 2 and ARCHeR RX. Secondary analyses will be performed on the rate of ipsilateral
      stroke between 31 days and 12 months, target lesion revascularization at six and 12 months,
      acute device success for the RX ACCULINK and RX ACCUNET Systems, clinical success, and access
      site complications requiring treatment. Additionally, the stented segment will be evaluated
      by carotid duplex ultrasound at six and 12 months. Serious adverse events (SAE) of death or
      ipsilateral stroke that occur anytime during the follow-up period will be identified and
      reported, and will be adjudicated if indicated.

    <description>Two rapid exchange devices will be evaluated: the RX ACCUNET Embolic Protection System (&quot;RX ACCUNET&quot;) and the RX ACCULINK Carotid Stent System (&quot;RX ACCULINK&quot;).
The RX ACCUNET Embolic Protection System is intended to facilitate the placement of diagnostic and therapeutic devices during interventional procedures and to capture embolic material that may be present during carotid artery interventional procedures.
The RX ACCULINKâ„¢ Carotid Stent System is intended for the treatment of carotid artery stenosis in the internal carotid artery (ICA), with or without involvement of the contiguous common carotid artery (CCA), in asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients.</description>
