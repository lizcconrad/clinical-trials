    <textblock>
      This study will look at the efficacy and safety of weekly administration of paclitaxel
      (Taxol®) in monotherapy compared to paclitaxel in combination with topotecan or carboplatin
      in patients with ovarian cancer in early relapse.

      The main purpose of this research study is to find out if treatment of early relapse of
      ovarian or fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer with paclitaxel (Taxol*) weekly administered,
      in lower doses in combination with topotecan (Hycamtin*) or carboplatin will improve efficacy
      compared to weekly administration of paclitaxel in monotherapy. Tolerance in the three groups
      will be compared.
