  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the treatment process will be closely monitored using a novel imaging
      technology, a PET/CT scanner. PET stands for Positron Emission Tomography and in this case it
      will be combined with a conventional x-ray Computerized Tomography (CT) scan. This is not a
      study of any particular form of treatment. The treatment you receive will be the most
      appropriate standard treatment whether you are in the study or not.

      The goal of radiation therapy is to deliver a given amount of radiation dose to the area
      where there is a lymphoma tumour. We are doing this study to see which part of the tumour
      reacts to the radiation treatment, and which part does not react, by monitoring the progress
      of your treatment with a combined PET/CT scan. In particular, changes of the size and shape
      of the tumour that occur during the treatment can be detected and will be visible on the
      images. These images will be thoroughly analysed. The ability of the PET/CT scanner to detect
      these changes during a course of radiation treatment will be the subject of this study. We
      will also be able to see if this information will eventually relate to or predict whether
      lymphoma tumours will be completely eradicated by the treatment.
