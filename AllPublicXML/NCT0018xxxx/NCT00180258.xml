  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combined mortality and hospitalization in
      heart failure patients receiving optimal pharmacologic therapy can be reduced by combining
      optimal pharmacologic therapy and 1) biventricular pacing therapy alone or 2) biventricular
      pacing with defibrillation.

      Evaluation of new therapies for the treatment of heart failure should address mortality,
      morbidity, hospitalization, and cardiac symptoms and function when compared to standard
      pharmacologic therapy. The COMPANION trial is designed to address all of these objectives.
      This clinical investigation is an open-label, prospective, multi-center, randomized clinical
      trial. Every patient enrolled in the study is to be prescribed to optimal pharmacologic heart
      failure therapy, as tolerated, regardless of randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             six months with NYHA Class III or IV symptoms at the time of enrollment, AND at least
             one of the following events in the previous 12 months:

          -  Hospitalization for heart failure management

          -  Outpatient visit in which intravenous (IV) inotropes or vasoactive infusion were
             administered continuously for at least 4 hours

          -  Emergency room visit of at least twelve hours duration in which IV heart failure

             (within 60 days of randomization)

          -  Women who are pregnant or not using medically acceptable birth control

          -  Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy

          -  Amyloid disease

          -  Hospitalization for heart failure or IV inotropic or vasoactive therapy in excess of 4
             hours in the 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Have a tricuspid prosthesis

          -  Involved in any other investigational studies

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to any other medical conditions
