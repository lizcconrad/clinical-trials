  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of the postoperative inflammatory response on the central nervous system after
      cardiac surgery is uncertain.

      The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of complement activation on cellular brain
      injury and neurological functioning in patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. In
      addition, the effect of complement activation on the cerebral vasomotricity was assessed.

      Because receptors to activated complement are present on astrocytes, the heparin-coated
      cardiopulmonary bypass that reduces complement activation should minimize these postoperative
      neurological adverse events. Heparin-coating might also influence blood flow velocity in
      cerebral arteries postoperatively if complement activation mediates cardiopulmonary bypass
      induced cerebral vasomotor dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Closed cardiopulmonary bypass and controlled suctions of pericardial shed blood were
      standardized in all patients.

      Bedside transcranial Doppler examination served to evaluate the development of cerebral
      vasomotor dysfunction in a subgroup of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  men undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  clinical conditions expected to potentially influence the magnitude of the systemic
             inflammatory response after surgery such as open heart surgery, women because they
             show higher complement activation after surgery, redo cases, organ dysfunction as
             defined by the Euroscore such as chronic airway disease or renal dysfunction with
             creatinine level above 200 Âµmol/L, patients with left ventricular ejection fraction
             below 35%, diabetes mellitus under insulin therapy prior to the operation, presence of
             active inflammatory disease or patients taking anti-inflammatory drugs (except
             acetylsalicylic acid).

          -  significant carotid artery stenoses (&gt;70%) at the preoperative echo-doppler
             examination, evidence of preexisting neurologic or psychiatric disease, existence of
             preoperative neuropsychological impairment as defined by preoperative Mini-Mental
             State Examination (MMSE) below 27, and alcohol addiction.
