    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of permanent biventricular pacing
      using three ventricular leads, and its efficacy in terms of inter and intra-ventricular
      resynchronization, in patients with congestive heart failure and a non-functional atrium
      (chronic AF).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        • NYHA class III–IV congestive heart failure, in spite of optimal medical treatment for
        their congestive heart failure for 1 month.

        The medical treatment must include a 40 mg/day minimum dose of furosemide (or equivalent);

          -  Permanent atrial fibrillation (AF);

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%;

          -  Indication for a pacemaker implantation for a permanent and symptomatic bradycardia,
             or already implanted pacemaker under the condition that leads positioning corresponds
             to the criteria described in the protocol;

          -  Aortic pre-ejection delay at least equal to 140 ms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Indication for a cardiac defibrillator;

          -  Having presented a myocardial infarct within the previous 3 months;

          -  Having undergone cardiac surgery or coronary revascularization procedure within the
             previous 3 months, or being scheduled for such procedures;

          -  Presenting chronic pulmonary insufficiency;

          -  Patients whose congestive heart failure requires the use of an intravenous inotropic
             support;

          -  Presenting a dysthyreosis;

          -  Having a life expectancy of less than one year, for other reasons than the congestive
             heart failure;

          -  Unable to be followed-up in the scope of the study for geographical reasons;

          -  Having refused to give their consent;

          -  Minors (age &lt; 18 years) and pregnant women.
