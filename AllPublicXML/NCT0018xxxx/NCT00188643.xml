  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of venlafaxine XR and
      lamotrigine when each is added to mood stabilizer therapy in patients with acute depressive
      episodes of bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder. Efficacy of therapy will be evaluated using
      improvements in clinical symptomatology after 8 weeks of treatment as measured by reductions
      on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-29) total score &gt;50% from baseline. We also
      would like to assess the efficacy of venlafaxine XR and lamotrigine when each is added to
      mood stabilizer therapy in improving clinical symptomatology after 8 weeks of therapy as well
      as to evaluate the side effect profile, safety and tolerability of venlafaxine XR and
      lamotrigine.
