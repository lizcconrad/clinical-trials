      The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of the ABSOLUTE™ .035 peripheral
      self-expanding stent system in preventing restenosis of occluded or stenotic superficial
      femoral or proximal popliteal arteries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of stenosis in superficial femoral arteries and/or proximal popliteal arteries
      with stenting is associated with high restenosis rates, especially with the first generation
      stents (stainless steel). Currently, self-expandable nitinol stents are commercialized which
      lead to higher primary patency rates as compared to the first generation stents, even in
      longer lesions. However, until now most data available are retrospective and uni-center. The
      ASSESS study is a prospective multi-center study investigating the performance (restenosis
      rate, patency rates) of the ABSOLUTE™. 035 peripheral self-expandable stent in longer lesions
      (lesion length from 4.00 mm to 200.00 mm).

      Moreover, literature shows stent fracture in nitinol stents, with a possible clinical
      relationship. For this reason, the ASSESS study will analyze the stent fractures of the
      ABSOLUTE™ stent, and a possible relationship between stent fracture and restenosis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  De novo lesion of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) or proximal popliteal artery
             within the following parameters:

               -  10 mm distal to the origin of the profunda femoris (= 10 mm from the femoral
                  bifurcation in the SFA) and

               -  20 mm from the proximal margin of the intercondylar fossa.

          -  Patients must have symptomatic leg ischemia, requiring treatment of the superficial
             femoral/proximal popliteal vessel

          -  Target vessel reference diameter visually estimated to be &gt; 4.0 mm and &lt; 7.0 mm

          -  Target lesion length visually estimated to be &gt; 40 mm and &lt; 200 mm

          -  If the patient has a contralateral SFA or contralateral proximal popliteal lesion,
             this lesion can be treated as a non-target lesion. The time and way of treatment of
             the non-target lesion will be left up to the discretion of the investigator

          -  At least one-vessel run-off to the foot confirmed by baseline angiography

          -  Patent common iliac artery, common femoral artery and profunda confirmed by baseline
             angiography. The patent common iliac artery can be obtained during the index procedure
             by a successful treatment prior to the treatment of the target lesion. Successful
             treatment being defined as attainment of final residual diameter stenosis of &lt; 30%
             without death, stroke, bleeding requiring &gt; 2 units transfusion, or any other
             complication which was device or procedure related.

          -  Patient is acceptable candidate for femoral-popliteal artery bypass surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous ipsilateral femoro-popliteal or femoro-tibial surgery

          -  Presence of a stent in the target vessel

          -  Prescheduled staged procedures of multiple lesions within the ipsilateral iliac or
             ipsilateral popliteal arteries within 30 days after the index procedure

          -  Co-existing aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta or iliac or popliteal arteries

          -  Acute thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombus

          -  Any immunosuppressive disorders, groin infection, or acute systemic infection due to
             any cause or any viral or bacterial infection

          -  Significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed within the past month that would
             contraindicate the use of anti-platelet therapy

          -  Hemodynamic instability

          -  Target lesion is restenotic from previous intervention
