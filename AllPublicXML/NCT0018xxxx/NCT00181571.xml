  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study using daily doses of up to 1.3 mg/kg/day of
      Concerta in the treatment of adults with the DSM-IV diagnosis of attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (childhood onset). We hypothesize ADHD symptomatology in adults
      with DSM-IV ADHD will be responsive to Concerta treatment and Concerta-associated response of
      ADHD symptomatology in adults will be sustained over time.

    <textblock>
      Concerta was specially developed to replace three-times-a-day IR methylphenidate, making it
      an ideal option for patients with ADHD. Moreover, the once-a-day administration of Concerta
      secures a steady delivery of methylphenidate across the day, minimizing the well-known risks
      of peaks and valleys of IR methylphenidate, which could offer an added advantage to the
      pharmacokinetic advantage of once-a-day administration. Despite these putative advantages,
      whether this new delivery system will lead to the same results as those documented with
      immediate-response methylphenidate in the treatments of adults with ADHD requires empirical
      corroboration. To this end we are conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial to
      evaluate the short- and medium-term safety and efficacy of Concerta in the treatment of
      adults with ADHD with and without co-morbid psychiatric disorders. We also wish to examine
      the role of genetics in predicting ADHD treatment response to Concerta. There is growing
      literature that supports the role of genetic factors in treatment response in youth with
      ADHD, and we seek to further explore this relationship in adults.

      The proposed study includes the use of a 34-week design to document the response rate,
      assessment of the impact of Concerta on functional capacities (quality of life, psychosocial
      function) and cognition, and careful assessment of safety and tolerability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female outpatients older than 18 and younger than 55 years of age.

          2. Subjects with the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), by
             DSM-IV, as manifested in clinical evaluation and confirmed by structured interview.

          3. ADHD Symptom Checklist score &gt; 24.

          4. Patients with past history of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder
             (including OCD) without current disorder for &gt; 3 months as ascertained through
             structured diagnostic interview and clinical exam.

          5. Subjects treated for anxiety disorders and depression who are on a stable medication
             regimen for at least three months, and who have a disorder-specific CGI-Severity score
             â‰¤ 3 (mildly ill) and who have a score on the Hamilton-Depression and Hamilton-Anxiety
             rating scales below 15 (mild range).

          6. Subjects with a past history of tics but tic free for &gt; 1 year.

             months.

          8. Subjects receiving non-MAOI antidepressants (e.g., SSRI's, bupropion, venlafaxine) or
             benzodiazepines who have been on a stable regimen for &gt; 3 months for any of the
             conditions listed above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any clinically unstable psychiatric conditions including the following: acute
             psychosis, acute panic, acute OCD, acute mania, acute suicidality, bipolar disorder,
             acute substance use disorders (alcohol or drugs, sociopathy, criminality, or

          8. Subjects with current adequate treatment for ADHD or a history of a previous adequate
             trial of Concerta.

          9. Non-English speaking subjects will not be allowed into the study for the following
             reasons:

               1. the assessment instruments are unavailable and have not been adequately
                  standardized in other languages;

               2. our clinical trials facility is located in Cambridge and not at the MGH main
                  campus; thus translators are unavailable;

               3. even if such translation services were available, the assessments in the English
                  language conducted by English-speaking clinicians and raters with
                  English-speaking subjects are already extremely time-consuming, lasting many
                  hours, making it unfeasible, unrealistic, and of dubious clinical validity to
                  conduct them with a translator with non-English-speaking subjects;

               4. psychiatric questionnaires and evaluations are taxing, and adding the complexity
                  of a translator has the potential to make the patient experience even more
                  exhausting
