    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with prostate cancer that is metastatic, progressive, and
      resistant to hormonal manipulation and mitoxantrone chemotherapy.Patients have previously
      been treated with surgical removal of the testes or hormone therapy, and subsequently with
      chemotherapy that included the drug, mitoxantrone (Novantrone). Patients will have prostate
      cancer that has worsened despite these treatments.

      We hope to learn whether the combination chemotherapy decreases cancer symptoms and tests,
      and to determine how frequently serious side effects occur with acceptable toxicity from the
      chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have had a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of prostate and
             currently must have metastatic disease (stage TxNxM1) that is unresponsive or
             refractory to hormone therapy and mitoxantrone-based chemotherapeutic regimens.
             Patients must have metastatic prostate cancer deemed to be hormone- and mitoxantrone
             refractory by one or more of the following (despite androgen ablation, anti-androgen
             withdrawal and mitoxantrone therapy where applicable):

               1. Progression of measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior to registration.

               2. Progression of non-measurable (i.e. bone scan or PET scan) disease assessed
                  within 42 days prior to registration.

               3. Rising PSA - defined as at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA documented over a
                  reference value (measure 1). The first rising PSA (measure 2) should be taken at
                  least 7 days after the reference value. A third confirmatory PSA measure is
                  required (2nd beyond the reference level) to be greater then the second measure
                  and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure. Patient must have
                  a PSA concentration of at least 10 ng/ml in addition to increasing PSA to be
                  eligible based on PSA criteria alone. No minimum PSA is required for patients
                  with measurable disease or non-PSA evaluable disease.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Must have pre-study PSA (within 28 days prior to registration) Note: The PSA result
             (done within 28 days prior to registration) need not be elevated for inclusion
             provided other criteria for progression are met.

          -  Must have received prior hormonal therapy and have a castrate level of testosterone.
             Patients treated with orchiectomy are eligible. If they have been treated with
             non-steroidal anti-androgens, the patients must have ceased taking flutamide or
             nilutamide at least 28 days prior to enrollment and at least 42 days prior to
             enrollment for bicalutamide, and patients must have demonstrated disease progression.
             Either method of castration can have been supplemented with nonsteroidal antiandrogen
             (e.g. flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide).

          -  Must have received prior mitoxantrone therapy

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed but it must have been to less than 25% of total
             body bone marrow (see Appendix 5). This includes prior use of samarium, but patients
             cannot have received strontium. (&gt;28 days must have elapsed since completion of RT
             with recovery from side effects. Soft tissue disease irradiated in the prior 2 months
             is not and may not be designated as measurable disease).

          -  May have received prior surgery (21 days must have elapsed since completion of surgery
             with recovery from side effects)

          -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5x the institutional upper limit of normal (within

             upper limit of normal (ULN), then AST and ALT must be less than or equal to 2.0 x ULN.

             ALT must be &lt; 1.25 x ULN.
