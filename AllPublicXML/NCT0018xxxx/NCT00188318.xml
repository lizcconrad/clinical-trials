  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is examining the effects of increasing the dose of radiation given to treat head
      and neck cancer. Radiation doses to the primary cancer are higher than usually given; lymph
      glands of the neck will also be treated at a lower dose. Surgery on the lymph glands my be
      necessary in the future. Radiation treatments given in small fractions twice a day allows a
      higher dose to be delivered than if the treatment was given once a day. This study will
      enroll patients at three sequential increasing dose levels. Approximately 40 patients will be
      enrolled at each dose level.
