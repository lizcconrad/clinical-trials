      The purpose of this study is to investigate gene expression profiles and biologic features of
      prostate tissue and how they relate to prostate cancer development and growth.

    <description>The Tissue Bank will store all &quot;Tissue Bank&quot; consents. The patients will be given a unique identifier by the tissue bank. However, patients will need to be identified to link to clinical data and possible followup (if they have consented) via chart or tumor registries.</description>

        Research Medical Stanford University Title: Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression in
        Prostatic Tissues (SQL 76528) Approval Period: 07/31/2010 - 06/30/2011 specimens will be
        collected from the Stanford University Department of Pathology (Tissue Bank) for patients
        treated at Stanford. Patients will be followed up via chart or tumor registries. Data will
        be used strictly for research purposes. Gene expression arrays are done in Dr. Brook's
        laboratory.
