  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the use of activated T cells can effectively
      treat relapsed disease following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation without
      causing GVHD.

    <description>CIK cell dose escalation will be performed in cohorts of three patients per group. The initial dose utilized will be 1x107 expanded cells/kg. Previously, unmanipulated donor lymphocytes administered at this dose did not result in significant GVHD 7. The expansion of the CIK cell population is expected to diminish the T cell subsets responsible for GVHD further reducing the risk of GVHD to recipients. The dose will be increased to 5x107 expanded cells/kg and 1x108 expanded cells/kg in successive escalations based on no significant infusional toxicity or GVHD in the recipients</description>
