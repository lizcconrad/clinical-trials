      Randomised Comparison with regards to complication rate and electrical measurements of atrial
      leads with different fixation mechnism

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will study and compare 3 types of electrically identical, commercially
      available FineLine II Sterox leads with different fixation mechanisms. This trial has been
      designed to primarily study the difference in repositioning rate between active and passive
      fixation (straight and J-shaped) leads, if any. It will also monitor and document the
      behavior of the study leads, with special reference to electrical parameters and handling.
      Normal measurements are taken at pre-dicharge, 1-month 3-month and 12-month follow-up

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients selected for participation in this investigation should be candidates for
             permanent pacemaker implantation chosen from the investigator's general patient
             population without regard for race or sex. Furthermore, these patients should, in the
             physician's general opinion, benefit from permanent pacemaker implantation with one of
             the study leads. Patients should be geographically stable and available for routine
             follow-up visits throughout the duration of the study. Patients must also be able and
             willing to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who previously went through heart surgery should be excluded from the study.
