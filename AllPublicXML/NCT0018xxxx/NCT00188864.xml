  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur when cancer cells from the initial tumour site (for example, lung or
      breast) spread to the brain. This develops in approximately 10% - 30% of adults with cancer.
      They can produce different complaints related to their effect on brain functioning, decrease
      in a person's ability to carry on with their usual activities, a reduction in the quality of
      life and shortened life expectancy.

      The standard treatment particularly for people with more than one brain metastasis consists
      of palliative radiation therapy to the brain and steroids. Steroids (such as Decadron or
      Dexamethasone) are medication used to reduce swelling around the tumour, and thus symptoms
      improve. Steroids could be very helpful but have a number of potential side effects,
      particularly if used for longer periods of time. There is no standard dose of Decadron used
      in treating brain metastases patients. The most commonly dose used is 4 mg four times/day.

      This study will assess if lower doses of Decadron - 8 mg every morning for symptomatic
      patients and 4 mg every morning for asymptomatic patients - are effective in maintaining
      symptom control in patients with brain metastases, without neurological deterioration that
      necessitates the patient to go back or to a higher dose at any time. This information will
      help also in understanding how to decrease the side effects associated with higher doses of
      steroids in people with your condition.
