  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal/perennial allergic rhinitis (SAR/PAR) is a common childhood illness. One of the
      leading therapies for the treatment of SAR/PAR is intranasally inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).
      One of the major long-term safety concerns is whether ICS interferes with normal growth in
      allergic rhinitis children. Recent evidence suggests that nasal ICS may cause decreased
      growth. However, the effect of nasal ICS on long-term growth and the attainment of final
      adult height is unknown. Another potential systemic adverse effect of ICS use is suppression
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. The primary hypothesis of this study is
      that triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray (TAA) will have no effect on measured adult
      height in relation to target adult height in children with allergic rhinitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male/Female aged 6-13 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of SAR/PAR, with symptoms within the past 3 months

          -  Positive skin test to inhalant allergen with negative saline control

          -  No previous use of intranasal inhaled, oral, IV or topical steroid use within past 6
             months.

          -  If the subject has asthma, only mild intermittent (per NAPP) guidelines treated with
             PRN bronchodilator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  screening height outside the 5th and 95th percentiles

          -  History of abnormal growth

          -  Any other chronic condition beside allergic rhinitis or mild intermittent asthma

          -  Subject who has insufficient allergic rhinitis symptoms to require daily therapy
             during the trial.

          -  Subject with a known hypersensitivity to any active ingredients or excipents in the
             study medications

          -  Subject with nasal candidiasis, acute or chronic sinusitis, significant nasal
             polyposis (impairs nasal breathing), or other gross anatomical deformity of the nose
             sufficient to impair nasal breathing (e.g., deviated septum)

          -  Subjects with a history of substance abuse, mental illness or retardation

          -  Subjects with a history or presence of glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataract
