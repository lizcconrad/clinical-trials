  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an internet based program for children
      and families (CF.DOC) with Cystic Fibrosis on health outcomes. The program provides for
      virtual visits, a personal health record, messaging with clinicians and several tools for
      monitoring self-care behaviors. We anticipate that this intervention will provide for more
      intensive monitoring and feedback of self-care behaviors and will lead to improved health
      status and in particular nutritional status

      Subjects will be drawn from the pool of children who receive their care at the LPCH/Stanford
      Cystic Fibrosis Center. A letter will be sent to all eligible patients inviting them to
      participate in the study. This letter will also be available in the CF clinic. All subjects
      who agree to participate in the study will have the study described to them by a research
      assistant either in person or over the phone. Informed consent will be obtained all on
      subjects. Subject who elect to participate will be randomized into either an intervention
      group or a control group . Subjects in the intervention group will be given Internet Access
      to the program CF.DOC. They will also be given training in how to use the program for
      communication with their clinicians, participating in a virtual visit and using online forms
      and surveys. Subjects in the control group will be advised that they will receive usual care
      and will have access to CF.DOC at the completion of the study. At the beginning of the study
      and at 3 month intervals subjects will be asked to complete a cystic fibrosis Quality of life
      survey. At the beginning and end of the study all subjects will complete a patient experience
      questionnaire (CAPHS 2.0 CCC supplement ) and an CF.DOC evaluation survey. As part of their
      regular care all subjects will also have their nutritional status measured and pulmonary
      function assessed. subjects in the intervention group will asked to define treatment goals
      that are important to them (e.g. attending camp or participating in sports) and to define
      health measures that will help monitor progress in meeting these goals e.g. weekly weights or
      pulmonary function. Subjects in the intervention group will be asked to log onto CF.DOC at
      least one time per month.
