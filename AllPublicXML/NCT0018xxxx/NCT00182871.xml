      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of testosterone replacement on bone
      density, muscle strength, physical performance, quality of life and prostate symptoms in men
      selected for low bone mineral density or fracture and some aspect of frailty.

      The hypothesis being tested is that testosterone supplementation can increase bone mineral
      density and specific parameters of frailty in older men with osteoporosis and characteristics
      of frailty. One hundred and eighty men, age 60 years and older, who have sustained a hip
      fracture or other fragility fracture following mild to moderate trauma (such as a fall from
      standing height) in the previous 5 years or who have low femoral neck bone mineral density
      plus a component of frailty (weight loss, perception of exhaustion, physical strength,
      physical activity level and walking time) will be randomly assigned to receive either
      testosterone or placebo, delivered by topical gel applied daily, in a two year double-blind
      study.

      Bone mineral density (BMD) by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), will be performed at baseline
      and yearly to assess changes in BMD. Blood and urine samples will be collected at baseline
      and yearly; these tests will be correlated to changes in BMD.

      To determine the effects of testosterone on frailty, strength of the upper and lower
      extremities will be measured every 6 months using the hand-held dynamometer and sitting leg
      press, respectively. Changes in lean body mass and percent body fat will be measured by total
      body DXA at baseline, 6 months and then annually. In addition, physical performance,
      emotional and sexual function, and disability will be assessed also.

      The safety of testosterone supplementation on prostate and cardiovascular parameters will
      also be monitored; participants will be screened for prostate cancer at baseline, 6 months
      then yearly for 2 years. Fasting lipoprotein levels will be measured yearly while on
      testosterone replacement, and cardiovascular specific adverse effects such as angina,
      myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden death will be tracked.
