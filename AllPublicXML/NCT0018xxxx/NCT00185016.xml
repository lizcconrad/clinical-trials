      The study tested a training to improve recognition of abused female patients in family
      practice.Effect measures of the training were: number of reported cases wherein the doctor
      suspected and discussed partner abuse and the number of non-obviuos reasons to suspect
      partner abuse.We assumed that following a training would improve the recognition of abused
      women.

      Secondary to this trial we explored gender differences of family doctors in discussing
      partner abuse and we interviewed women recently identified by their family doctor. Medical
      histories of recently identified abused women were studied to assess health problems and
      health-care utilisation.
