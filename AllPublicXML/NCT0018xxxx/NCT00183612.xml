      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine in
      children and adolescents with bipolar disorder or psychosis.

      Numerous advancements in mental health treatment have been made over the past decade.
      Unfortunately, these advancements have focused on adults and have not been fully extended to
      children and adolescents. With limited pediatric information on the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics for drugs used to treat mental health problems, psychiatrists are
      prescribing drugs for children using data extrapolated from adults, which may lead to
      potentially life-threatening results. Olanzapine is widely prescribed to treat both children
      and adults. This study will determine the safety and effectiveness of olanzapine in children
      and adolescents with mental health disorders. The study will also compare the effects of
      gender, development, body composition, and metabolic genotype and phenotype on how olanzapine
      works.

      All participants will receive olanzapine for up to 8 weeks. Blood collection will occur at
      each weekly study visit. On Visit 1, participants will receive their first dose of olanzapine
      and repeated blood collection will occur every hour for 24 hours. Blood collection will be
      used to determine the time it takes for olanzapine to be absorbed into the body, its duration
      of action, the extent of its distribution in the body, the manner in which it is excreted
      from the body, and its effects on organs of the body.
