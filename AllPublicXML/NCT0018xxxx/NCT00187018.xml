    <textblock>
      Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease for which there is currently no known cure.
      OI causes the osteoblasts (bone-forming cells in the body) to grow poorly, which slows the
      growth of children with the disease and causes their bones to bend and break easily. Some
      forms of osteogenesis imperfecta may cause severe disability and even death. In previous
      research studies performed at St. Jude, it was found that children treated with bone marrow
      transplant (infusion of healthy immature blood-forming cells) began to grow faster, had more
      minerals (material that helps make the bones strong) in their bones, and broke their bones
      less often than before the bone marrow transplant. Several months after the bone marrow
      transplant however, body growth once again began to slow down. In this research study,
      children with osteogenesis imperfecta will receive another infusion of bone marrow cells but
      without any chemotherapy. The marrow cells will come from the same bone marrow donor as their
      previous bone marrow transplant. It is hoped that by removing the CD3+ cells (a type of white
      blood cells that attack other cells that are not like themselves) from the donated bone
      marrow, the subject's body will be infused quite safely and that body growth and bone
      strength will increase. The CD3+ cells will be removed from the donor bone marrow by use of a
      machine called the CliniMACS System. This machine has not been approved for use in the United
      States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The use of this device is considered
      experimental.
