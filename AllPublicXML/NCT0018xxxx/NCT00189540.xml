  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that AMG0001 treatment is safe and
      induces angiogenesis as detected by improved wound healing, reduction in amputation, improved
      pain at rest and hemodynamic measurement and to assess the effectiveness of the
      administrative method.

      The primary goals of this study evaluating AMG0001 administration in CLI subjects will be to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of AMG0001. Specifically, the objectives are:

        1. Assess efficacy of a dosing regimen of 4.0mg/3 mL AMG0001, administered on Days 0, 14,
           and 28 as measured by reduction in total wound area at Month 3.

        2. Assess potential effects of angiogenesis associated with a dosing regimen of 4.0mg/3 mL
           AMG0001, administered on Days 0, 14, and 28 as measured by reduction in total wound area
           at Months 6 and 12, along with reduction in major amputations and improved pain at rest
           as measured on the VAS and hemodynamic measures (ABI/TBI) at Month 3 and Month 6.

        3. Assess overall safety of AMG0001 in the Critical Limb Ischemia subject population as
           determined by physical examination, blood and urine analyses, electrocardiogram, vital
           signs, and by evaluation of adverse experiences during and after the course of
           treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will have an appropriately sized peripheral ischemic ulcer(s).

          2. Subjects will have one or both of the following hemodynamic indicators of severe
             peripheral arterial occlusive disease:

               1. Ankle systolic pressure (in either the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial
                  arteries) of &lt; 70 mmHg

               2. Toe systolic pressure &lt; 50 mmHg

          3. The subject is a poor candidate for standard revascularization treatment options for
             peripheral arterial disease, based on inadequate bypass conduit, unfavorable anatomy,
             or poor operative risk.

          4. Subjects 40 years or older of either sex who have signed an informed consent form
             either directly or through a legally authorized representative.

          5. Subjects will be on a statin and an anti-platelet agent (e.g., clopidogrel,
             ticlopidine, aspirin, etc.) as part of their standard of care, unless contraindicated.
             Subjects for which these agents are contraindicated will have this restriction
             recorded in their case report form (CRF). Subjects must be stable on these medical
             regimens for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment.

          6. If female, the subjects must be:

               1. at least one year post-menopausal, or

               2. surgically sterile, or

               3. if the subject is of child-bearing potential, she must have been practicing
                  adequate contraception for at least 12 weeks prior to entering the study and have
                  a negative urine pregnancy test result prior to study enrollment and agree to
                  periodic pregnancy screening tests during the study.

               4. If female, the subject must not be breastfeeding for 30 days following
                  administration of HGF.

          7. If subject is of reproductive potential, he or she must be using an accepted and
             effective (barrier) form of birth control during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, have a vascular disease prognosis
             that indicates they would require a major amputation (at or above the ankle) within 4
             weeks of start of treatment.

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans).

          3. Subjects with hemodynamically significant aorto-iliac occlusive disease.

          4. Subjects who have had a revascularization procedure within 12 weeks prior to treatment
             initiation that remains patent. Revascularization procedures that are evidenced to
             have failed (completely occluded) for &gt;2 weeks prior to treatment initiation are
             acceptable.

          5. Subjects who require a change in their hypertension medication (other than dosage
             change) as part of their standard of care within 4 weeks prior to treatment
             initiation.

          6. Subjects with deep ulcerations with bone or tendon exposure, or clinical evidence of
             invasive infection (e.g., cellulitis, osteomyelitis, etc.) uncontrollable by
             antibiotics.

          7. Subjects currently receiving immuno-suppressive medication, chemo or radiation
             therapy.

          8. Evidence or history of malignant neoplasm (clinical, laboratory or imaging), except
             for fully resolved basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Patient's who had successful
             tumor resection or radio-chemotherapy of breast cancer more than 10 years prior to
             inclusion in the study, and with no recurrence, may be enrolled in the study.
             Patient's who had successful tumor resection or radio-chemotherapy of all other tumor
             types more than 5 years prior to inclusion in the study, and with no recurrence, may
             be enrolled in the study.

             retinopathy, recent (within 6 months) retinal vein occlusion, macular degeneration
             with choroidal neovascularization, macular edema on fundus evaluation by
             ophthalmologist, or intraocular surgery within 3 months.

             growth factor product not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration
             (FDA) or received any investigational Drug Product in another clinical trial in the 30
             days prior to administration of HGF.

         16. Unreliable or uncooperative subject or other severe concomitant disease(s), which the
             clinical investigator feels constitute(s) criteria for exclusion of a particular
