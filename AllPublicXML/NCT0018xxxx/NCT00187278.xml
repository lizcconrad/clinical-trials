  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate if patients with a standard indication for
      permanent ventricular pacing, left ventricular ejection fraction without limit, or any QRS
      duration will profit from the prevention of ventricular desynchronisation.

      The study will be performed as a controlled, single-blind, international, multicenter,
      prospective, randomized, parallel group design.

      In order to pragmatically examine the effectiveness of biventricular pacing in patients with
      an indication for ventricular pacing, the study group with biventricular pacing is compared
      to a control group with standard pacemakers which only allow univentricular (right
      ventricular) stimulation, as it has been the standard outside of clinical studies until so
      far.
