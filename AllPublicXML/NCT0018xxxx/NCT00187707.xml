  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is part of a large multi-investigator grant to look at the pharmacogenetics
      of a number of membrane transporters. Previously, we have recruited a cohort of healthy
      volunteers (Studies of Pharmacogenetics in Ethnically-diverse Populations, or SOPHIE) and
      have resequenced the coding region of a number of membrane transporter genes to identify
      genetic polymorphisms in these genes. We plan to take a genotype-to-phenotype approach to
      study the influence of specific polymorphisms in the intestinal transporters, such as the
      novel organic cation transporters 1 and 2 (OCTN1 and OCTN2) genes on the bioavailability of
      gabapentin in healthy subjects. Eligible subjects will have a single inpatient study visit,
      during which they will take a single dose of gabapentin, and provide blood and urine samples
      over the course of 36 hours (5 terminal elimination gabapentin half-lives) for
      pharmacokinetic analysis.
