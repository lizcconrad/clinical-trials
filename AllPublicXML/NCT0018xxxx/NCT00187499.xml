  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone)
      alters the expression of any gene expressed in the lining of the airways of asthmatics. The
      study uses high density gene chips which allow the study investigators to measures all gene
      in the human genome. We hypothesize that this approach will identify novel genes that are
      affected by steroids in asthmatics.

      This is a 10 week, randomized, double blind, prospective study comparing the effects of
      inhaled fluticasone or inhaled placebo on measures of airway function, airway remodeling and
      airway gene expression in asthmatic subjects. Enrollment has been completed as have all study
      visits. We are now in the data analysis phase. The study design was as follows: Following a
      one-week run-in/characterization period, subjects were randomized to receive 2 puffs BID of
      fluticasone (250µg/puff) or matching placebo for 8 weeks. Beginning with the run-in period,
      subjects recordes in a daily diary their peak flow measurements twice daily, (symptoms of
      cough, sputum production, wheeze, dyspnea, and chest tightness. They visited the laboratory
      for an interval diary review and spirometry and for medication dispensing. Bronchoscopy was
      performed at baseline (week 1 of the run-in), and 1 week after starting the study drug Weekly
      telephone contact will be made during the treatment period to monitor subject well being and
      to ensure compliance with study medication. There was a one-week run-out to allow monitoring
      of subjects after discontinuation of the study drug.
