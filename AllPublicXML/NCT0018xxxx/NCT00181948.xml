    <textblock>
      This will be a 6-week, unblinded study using the medication Strattera for children and
      adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who failed to respond to an
      adequate trial of stimulant treatment. Specific hypotheses are as follows:

      Hypothesis 1: ADHD symptomatology in youth with ADHD will be responsive to Strattera
      treatment in the short term.

      Hypothesis 2: Strattera treatment (in doses of up to 120 mg/day or 1.2 mg/kg/day) in children
      and adolescents with ADHD will be safe and well tolerated.

      Strattera (atomoxetine) is a non-stimulant presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
      recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in child, adolescent and adult
      patients with ADHD. Atomoxetine is a potent inhibitor of the presynaptic norepinephrine
      transporter with minimal affinity for other noradrenergic receptors or for other
      neurotransmitter transporters or receptors. Thus, Strattera could be a viable alternative
      treatment for ADHD individuals who do not respond to stimulants.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of
      Strattera in youth, ages 6-17 years with ADHD who failed to respond to an adequate trial of
      stimulant treatment. If this initial study shows proof of the concept, we will follow-up the
      study with a randomized clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female outpatients 6-17 years of age.

          -  Subjects with the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), by the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), as
             manifested in clinical evaluation and confirmed by structured interview.

          -  ADHD rating scale-symptom checklist &gt; 24

          -  Subjects with a past history of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder
             (including obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]) without current disorder for &gt; 3
             months as ascertained through structured diagnostic interview and clinical exam.

          -  Subjects treated for anxiety disorders and depression (with non-MAOI antidepressants
             [e.g., SSRIs, bupropion, venlafaxine] or benzodiazepines) who are on a stable
             medication regimen for at least three months, and who have a disorder specific
             Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-severity score â‰¤ 3 (mildly ill) and who have a score
             on the Hamilton-Depression and Hamilton-Anxiety Rating Scale below 15 (mild range)
             will be included in the study.

          -  Subjects with a past or present history of tics will be eligible.

          -  Subjects with a past history of substance use disorders but drug and alcohol free for
             &gt; 6 months.

          -  Subjects with mild cases of asthma and allergy will be included.

          -  Potential subjects will have failed an adequate trial of a stimulant as defined by:

               -  Subjects who had intolerable side effects on a stimulant, or

               -  Poor response (an ADHD CGI-I of &gt; 3) on at least 4 weeks of &gt; 1.0 mg/kg/day of a
                  methylphenidate product; or &gt; 0.5 mg/kg/day of an amphetamine product.

          -  Only English-speaking subjects will be allowed into the study for the following
             reasons:

               1. the assessment instruments are not available and have not been adequately
                  standardized in other languages;

               2. the clinical trials facility is located in Cambridge and not in the Massachusetts
                  General Hospital (MGH) main campus without the availability of translators;

               3. psychiatric questionnaires and evaluations are taxing and adding the complexity
                  of a translator has the potential to make the patient experience even more
                  exhausting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically unstable psychiatric conditions including the following:

               -  acute psychosis,

               -  sociopathy,

               -  criminality.

          -  Any metabolic, neurological, hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, hematological,
             ophthalmic, or endocrine disease.

             following:

               -  Values which deviate greater than 20% from the normal ranges of the laboratory
                  standard for a basic metabolic screen and complete blood count.
