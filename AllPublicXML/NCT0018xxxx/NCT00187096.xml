    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of infusing natural killer
      cells from a donor as treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia in remission or who
      have experienced relapse.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Natural killer (NK) cells extracted from a [parental] donor are infused intravenously. Most
      patients are given a multi-agent chemotherapeutic conditioning regimen prior to the infusion.
      The conditioning regimen may be omitted for patients who have previously received traditional
      stem cell transplant.

      Details of Treatment Plan:

      Stratum 1 (AML in complete remission)

      Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg IV Day -7 Fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day IV Days -6 through -2 Donor
      pheresis Day -1 Start IL-2 on Day -1, then 3 times per week x 2 weeks NK Cell purification
      and infusion on Day 0

      Stratum 2 (AML that is refractory or relapsed or AML with increasing minimal residual
      disease)

      Clofarabine 40 mg/m2 IV, days -6 through -2 Etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV, days -6 through -2
      Cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2 IV, days -6 through 02 Donor pheresis Day -1 Start IL-2 Day -1,
      and then 3 times per week x 2 weeks NK Cell purification and infusion on Day 0.

      For patients who have received prior SCT, the conditioning regimen may be omitted if the NK
      cells are obtained from the original SCT donor.

      Cytokine regimen (stratum 1 and 2): 1 million units/m2 of IL-2 given subcutaneously three
      times per week for two weeks (6 doses) starting on the evening of day -1.

      NK Cell Transplantation (stratum 1 and 2): NK cells from haplo-identical family donor will be
      infused on day 0.

    <description>For Arm 1, the efficacy of NK cell transplantation will be reported as the proportion of participants who achieve complete or partial remission. Kaplan-Meier estimates of relapse-free survival and confidence interval was determined by binomial distribution because no events were observed. The binomial interval is based on the number of patients at risk.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years post NK cell transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time relapse from on study date to death with those alive at last follow up date censored. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compute survival probability estimates and confidence interval was determined by binomial distribution (for no events or all events) or by log hazard method. The binomial interval is based on the number of patients at risk.
The confidence intervals for Arm 1 and Arm 2a were determined by binomial distribution.
The confidence interval for Arm 2b was determined by log hazard method.</description>
