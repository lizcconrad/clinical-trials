      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of Risperidone,
      Olanzapine, and Quetiapine in the treatment of mania in children and adolescents with Bipolar
      disorder over 8 weeks and then over an extension phase. This is an exploratory, open-label
      study, which seeks to determine if there is evidence for efficacy. The results of this study
      will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger study.
