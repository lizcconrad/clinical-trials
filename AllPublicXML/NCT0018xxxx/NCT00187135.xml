  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is studying the best ways to prevent pain during and
      after procedures such as bone marrow aspiration and lumbar puncture with intrathecal (in the
      spinal fluid) chemotherapy. Researchers will study the effectiveness of combining anesthetics
      (medicines that help people sleep) and analgesics (medicines that relieve pain). Researchers
      believe that a combination of fentanyl (analgesic) and propofol (anesthetic), along with
      applying the skin-numbing-cream EMLA or L.M.X4™ on the area where the procedure is performed,
      will provide better pain control.

      Each patient enrolled on this study will have three different anesthetic combinations for
      three different procedures, in order to determine which combination worked best for each
      child.

      The study focusses on the following primary aims:

        -  To compare 0.5 mg/kg versus 1.0 mg/kg of fentanyl to control pain in patients who have a
           BMT/LPIT procedure in the context of propofol anesthesia and topical anesthesia with
           EMLA or L•M•X 4™cream (or when necessary, lidocaine for injection).

        -  To compare placebo versus fentanyl (0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg) in these same patients. The
           first BMT/LPIT for which patients receive any fentanyl will be used in this comparison.

      The study focusses on the following secondary aims:

        -  To determine which dose regimen ensures best conditions to perform bone marrow
           aspiration (lack of motion) and maintains hemodynamic and respiratory stability as
           indicators of adequate levels of analgesia during bone marrow aspiration.

        -  To evaluate the safety and complications for each dose regimen.

    <time_frame>The participant was monitored from the end of the procedure until sedation recovery, which lasted a maximum of 65 min. Discharge from the recovery area was determined by hospital standards of care.</time_frame>
    <description>During the sedation recovery period, pain was measured by one of three validated pediatric scales. Scales were applied according to the developmental ability of the participant: Numerical Pain Scale, FACES pain scale, and FLACC pain scale (a score based on behaviors observed: face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability). All three scales are scored from 0 - 10 units on a scale, and are interchangeable for comparison purposes. Any score &gt;0 was coded &quot;pain&quot;, and score of 0 was coded &quot;no pain&quot;, yielding one score for each participant's procedure.</description>

        <title>Pain(Yes/No)</title>
        <description>During the sedation recovery period, pain was measured by one of three validated pediatric scales. Scales were applied according to the developmental ability of the participant: Numerical Pain Scale, FACES pain scale, and FLACC pain scale (a score based on behaviors observed: face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability). All three scales are scored from 0 – 10 units on a scale, and are interchangeable for comparison purposes. Any score &gt;0 was coded “pain”, and score of 0 was coded “no pain”, yielding one score for each participant’s procedure.</description>
        <time_frame>The participant was monitored from the end of the procedure until sedation recovery, which lasted a maximum of 65 min. Discharge from the recovery area was determined by hospital standards of care.</time_frame>
        <population>Participants in this analysis are a subset of the 162 participants randomized since not all completed 3 visits on study. If a participant completed at least Visit 2 and received each of the 2 treatments compared they are included. Treatment on each visit was randomized; therefore these numbers cannot be derived directly from the participant flow.</population>

        <description>During the sedation recovery period, pain was measured by one of three validated pediatric scales. Scales were applied according to the developmental ability of the participant: Numerical Pain Scale, FACES pain scale, and FLACC pain scale (a score based on behaviors observed: face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability). All three scales are scored from 0 – 10 units on a scale, and are interchangeable for comparison purposes. Any score &gt;0 was coded “pain”, and score of 0 was coded “no pain”, yielding one score for each participant’s procedure.</description>
        <time_frame>The participant was monitored from the end of the procedure until sedation recovery, which lasted a maximum of 65 min. Discharge from the recovery area was determined by hospital standards of care.</time_frame>
        <population>Participants in this analysis are a subset of the 162 participants randomized since not all completed 3 visits on study. If a participant completed at least Visit 2 and received each of the 2 treatments compared they are included. Treatment on each visit was randomized; therefore these numbers cannot be derived directly from the participant flow.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>All 162 participants were expected to receive three treatments. Not all participants received all three treatments. Therefore, analysis required the identification of subsets of treated participants. The trial terminated early due to slow accrual.</limitations_and_caveats>
