    <textblock>
      There is much data in the literature regarding optimal treatment approaches for malignant
      pleural effusions as assessed by patient outcomes. However, data on quality of life and
      satisfaction with treatment from the patient's perspective is not available.

      This study will compare various treatment strategies in the management of malignant pleural
      effusions with respect to:

        1. Primary endpoint: the successful palliation of symptomatic pleural effusions as assessed
           by the London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale (LCADLS)

        2. Secondary endpoints:

           i) impact of treatment on patient quality of life as assessed by the Functional
           Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Palliative patient (FACIT-PAL) questionnaire ii)
           Assessment of patient satisfaction with treatment received via Functional Assessment of
           Chronic Illness Therapy-Treatment Satisfaction (FACIT-TS) questionnaire iii)Pleurodesis
           success rates assessed by 2 and 6-week effusion control rates on CXR iv) Requirement of
           further hospitalizations or procedures for the treatment of recurrent effusions v)
           Comparison of morbidity and mortality rates for differing treatment approaches vi)
           comparison of cost in a Canadian health care setting for differing treatment approaches
