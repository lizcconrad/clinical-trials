  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the effects (good and bad) Iressa plus
      anastrozole has on patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients will receive Iressa and anastrozole orally once daily until treatment is ended.
           Treatment will end if any of the following occur: Unacceptable adverse effects; bowel
           obstruction; initiation of systemic chemotherapy; development of new ascites or pleural
           effusions, development of co-morbid disease or disease progression.

        -  Patients will be given a drug log in which to record the date and time they take their
           pills, as well as any symptoms and concomitant medications.

        -  Patients will be seen monthly for the following tests and procedures; a physical
           examination and repeat blood work. Patients who remain free of clinical symptoms should
           have repeat abdominal/pelvic CT scans and chest x-rays on an every 3 month basis.
