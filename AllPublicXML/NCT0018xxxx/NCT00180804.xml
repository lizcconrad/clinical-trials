  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For implantation of developing conceptus, placental cells need to invade mother's uterus to
      access maternal blood supply in a control manner. We have found a combination of maternal
      immune genes (the KIR family) and fetal genes (HLA-C) strongly associated with pre-eclampsia
      where placenta does not implant adequately. The aim of this research is to investigate these
      two genes family in women suffering with recurrent miscarriages and find a possible link
      between them.

      Little is known about reasons for early pregnancy failures. It is believed that some
      pathology leading to defective implantation of fetus in maternal uterus may lead to recurrent
      early miscarriages. This project arises from previous work on pre-eclampsia where we found
      combination of maternal immune genes (KIR) with their ligand (HLA-C) in the fetus was
      strongly associated with the disease. We will tissue type the fetus, mother and father in
      cases of unexplained miscarriages. We hope that genetic findings in recurrent miscarriage
      will lead to new insights, prevention and treatment.
