  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was conducted with patients at a multi-disciplinary, multi-specialty health
      services organization serving 44,000 rostered patients in Northern Ontario. It investigated
      continuity of care for patients with diabetes in the areas of barriers and potential
      solutions to, and correlates of continuity; and variability in costs associated with
      continuity of care and patient outcomes.

      Continuity of care is a concept that has been garnering increased attention in the last few
      years. There have been multiple methods proposed by researchers for measuring continuity of
      care, most of which are based on proportions or ratios of visits to the same health care
      provider or centre. While a consistent method for measuring continuity of care is lacking,
      increased continuity of care using various definitions and measurement tools has been related
      to better well being, lower health care costs, better glucose control, and higher
      satisfaction but has also not been found to improve health outcomes in other scenarios.
      Whether a patient is better served by high sequential access to one provider or any provider
      within the same system or management team is controversial. Finally, patientsâ€™ perceptions of
      continuity of care have not been generally evaluated or correlated with current measurement
      methods. This project was conducted with patients at the Group Health Centre in Sault Ste
      Marie, Ontario, a multi-disciplinary, multi-specialty health services organization serving
      44,000 rostered patients
