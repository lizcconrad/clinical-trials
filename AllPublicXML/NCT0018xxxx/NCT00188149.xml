  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognosis of patients with Hodgkin´s lymphoma (HL) has been improved significantly over the
      last decade. Therefore, the impact of treatment associated long-term toxicities and late
      effects such as second cancers increased. The purpose of this prospective multicenter trial
      is to show the feasibility of the treatment with ABVD alone in patients with limited stage
      (HL1) and intermediate stage (HL2) disease and of an intensified etoposide-free chemotherapy
      regimen for patients with advanced disease (HL3) including 18F-FDG-PET evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim in limited and intermediate stages is to reduce the toxicity by omitting the
      subsequent radiotherapy in patients with complete remission after ABVD chemotherapy. Patients
      with limited disease receive four cycles, patients with intermediate disease (according to
      the criteria of the German Hodgkin Study group, GHSG) receice six cycles of ABVD. In case of
      residual mass (&gt; 1.5 cm), additional involved field irradiation is planned. The aim in
      advanced disease using BACOPP-D regimen which includes cyclophosphamide, adriamycin,
      dacarbazine, procarbazine, prednisolone, bleomycin and vincristine, is to reduce the
      hematological toxicity and the secondary leukemias by omitting etoposide (in comparison to
      the BEACOPP escalated regimen). All patients receive eight cycles of the BACOPP-D regimen. In
      case of residual mass (&gt; 1.5 cm), additional involved field irradiation is planned.
      Additionally, we want to evaluate the CT- and PET-based remission status after chemotherapy
      and at final staging.
