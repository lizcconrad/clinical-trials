      We hope to learn whether this stimulation of neurons in the front part of the brain may
      relieve depression.

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) -17 Item; Baseline to End of Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS - 17 is a scale that measures the severity of depression based on the patients response to 17 questions on the presence and severity of the symptoms found in depression. The severity of a symptom is scored from 0 (not present) to 4 (most severe); total scores range from 0 (no depressive symptoms), to 68 (very severe depression). A decrease in the HDRS score reflects a reduction in depression severity.The scores are Baseline and End of Week 4</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory Score; Baseline to End of Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory Scale (BDI) measures the severity of depression based on the patients response to 21 questions on the presence and severity of the symptoms found in depression. The severity of a symptom is scored from 0 (not present) to 3 (most severe); total scores range from 0 (no depressive symptoms), to 63 (very severe depression). A decrease in the score reflects a reduction of the severity of depression.The scores are from Baseline and End of Week 4</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Severity; Baseline to End of Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) is a measure of depression severity and disability based on the clinicians overall impression of the severity of depression based on the patients response to open ended questions and self report of the presence and severity of the symptoms and level of disability found in depression. The CGI-S assesses the severity of illness (depression) and is scored from 1 (well, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most severely ill patients); a decrease in the CGI-S score reflects a reduction of the symptoms and disability due to depression. The scores are from Baseline and End of Week 4</description>

The severity of a symptom is scored from 0 (not present) to 4 (most severe); total scores range from 0 (no depressive symptoms), to 68 (very severe depression). A decrease in the HDRS score reflects a reduction in depression severity.The scores are Baseline and End of Week 4</description>

The CGI-S assesses the severity of illness (depression) and is scored from 1 (well, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most severely ill patients); a decrease in the CGI-S score reflects a reduction of the symptoms and disability due to depression.
