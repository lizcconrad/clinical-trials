  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people with solid tumors cancer for which the standard chemotherapy drugs
      have not worked. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the side effects of Xeloda (also
      called capecitabine) in combination with a new anticancer agent called Gleevec (also called
      imatinib mesylate). Xeloda is an anticancer drug, and can be taken by mouth. The active
      ingredient is a well-studied cancer drug called 5-FU. Xeloda is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of colon cancer. Gleevec is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with a
      leukemia called CML (increase of white blood cells) after failure of standard therapy. It is
      also approved by the FDA for patients with Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (a rare tumor in
      the digestive tract).

      This study will test how much Gleevec we can safely give with Xeloda. Xeloda will be given at
      the recommended dose for colorectal cancer and Gleevec will be given in increasing amounts.
