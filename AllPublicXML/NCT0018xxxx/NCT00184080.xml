  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of an experimental drug called
      Elsamitrucin in people with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and to see if it can shrink their tumors.
      Elsamitrucin has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, the
      FDA is permitting the use of this drug for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed NHL both B and T-cell that is refractory to or has relapsed
             after standard therapy or for which there is no known effective treatment.

          -  CT or MRI scans confirming measurable tumor size (lymph node must be &gt;1.0 cm in its
             longest transverse diameter). Measurement by PE is acceptable, in the case of palpable
             and reproducibly measurable tumors. Patients with CLL/smal lymphocytic lymphoma are
             eligible without bidimensional measurable disease.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2

          -  Age greater or equal to 18 years of old

          -  AGC greater or equal to 1.0; platelets greater or equal to 75,000;Ggb greater or equal
             to 9.0. (Lower values may be accepted for cytopenias due to bone marrow involvement by
             lymphoma, after discussion with sponsor)

          -  Bilirubin less or equal to 2.0; SGOT and SGPT less of equal to 3 times upper limit of
             normal

          -  Creatinine &lt;1.5; BUN &lt;25

          -  Expected survival &gt;6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy with Elsamitrucin

          -  Any therapy for lymphoma, including chemotherapy, antibody therapy, RT, or any
             investigational therapy within 28 days prior to study drug administration

          -  Steroid therapy within the last 4 weeks prior to study drug administration

          -  Evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled condition/s and/or is considered by
             investigator to be unable to tolerate the required therapy or procedures

          -  Known AIDS syndrome or HIV-associated complex (severely depressed immune system)

          -  Prior or other current malignancy within 5 years, except for adequately treated
             cone-biopsied in-situ cervical cancer or resected basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer

          -  Any current medical or psychiatric disease that would prevent informed consent and
             expected cooperation of the patient for therapy and follow-up

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.
