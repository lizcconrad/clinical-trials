    <textblock>
      This study is to determine whether antibiotic therapy is needed for patients with non-life
      threatening soft tissue infections. Most patients with these soft tissue infections are
      presently treated with antibiotics. Many of these infections resolve without proper
      antibiotic treatment. Treatment of patients with antibiotics after surgical drainage of an
      abscess may not be necessary and indiscriminate use of antibiotics may lead to colonization
      by drug-resistant organisms. Subsequent infection by drug resistant organisms may limit the
      choice of antibiotics in more complicated infections. A comparison between antibiotic
      treatment and no antibiotic treatment in surgically treated, uncomplicated soft tissue
      infections is needed to address this very important question.

      The Integrated Soft Tissue Infection Service (ISIS) Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital
      treats a large number of patients with soft tissue infections, and our data suggest that
      antibiotics may be overused for these infections. Most of these infections are treated by
      surgical drainage of an abscess (77%). When microbiologic cultures were performed, 88% of the
      abscesses were infected with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and 55% of the abscesses
      contained methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Recently, the high prevalence
      of MRSA infection has been documented in San Francisco and throughout the country. Presently,
      most patients are treated with antibiotics after drainage of the abscess. Our retrospective
      analysis found that 60% of these infections resolved without appropriate antibiotic
      treatment. These were patients infected with MRSA who were treated with an antibiotic that
      was not active against that organism. This implies that surgical drainage of these abscesses
      was probably the important treatment and antibiotic treatment was probably not necessary.

      Unnecessary use of antibiotics has adverse consequences. Some patients have allergic
      reactions to antibiotics. Patients can develop serious gastrointestinal infections from
      antibiotic use. Antibiotics are costly. But most importantly, overuse of antibiotics may be
      the significant factor in the spread of antibiotic resistant organisms. The increased
      prevalence of MRSA has made it extremely difficult to treat patients with appropriate
      antibiotics in life threatening infections (i.e. bacterial endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and
      necrotizing soft tissue infections).

      The experience in the ISIS Clinic has brought into question our present practice of
      antibiotic use in patients with surgically managed abscesses. Many surgeons practicing in the
      ISIS clinic believe that antibiotics have little or no effect on the clinical course of these
      uncomplicated infections. Elimination of antibiotic use for these uncomplicated infections
      would certainly simplify care for these patients. It is even possible that decreased
      antibiotic use may decrease the prevalence of MRSA colonization in this population. However,
      decreased prevalence of MRSA colonization will not be specifically addressed in this limited
      study. A randomized, prospective and blinded trial comparing standard antibiotic treatment
      with no treatment should help determine whether antibiotics are really needed for these
      infections.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients must have a complicated skin or skin-structure infection that meets
             disease diagnostic criteria (severity, definition of complicated, and disease).

        SEVERITY: Complicated soft tissue infections must be of sufficient severity to anticipate
        five or more days of antibiotic therapy.

        DEFINITION OF COMPLICATED (one or more of the following criteria must be met): Infection
        requires(ed) significant surgical intervention (such as debridement of devitalized tissue,
        drainage of abscess, removal of foreign body implicated in infection) at the time of
        enrollment.

        DISEASE: Major Abscess (no open wound). The patient must have all of the following: i)
        Acute onset within seven days prior to enrollment. ii) Purulent drainage or purulent
        aspirate. iii) Erythema, induration, or tenderness. iv) Evidence of loculated fluid by
        physical examination, blind aspiration, or ultrasound that requires intervention (such as
        aspiration, incision and drainage, excision) at the time of enrollment.

        2. A culture must be obtained at the time of enrollment. 3. Patients must be at least 18
        years of age. 4. The patient must sign and date a Committee on Human Research-approved
        informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any of the following conditions:

               1. Patients unlikely to survive through the treatment period and evaluations.

               2. Conditions such as toxic shock syndrome or toxic-like syndrome (Mandell et al.

                  to fluid or short course pressor challenge (four hours or less) or oliguria
                  (urine output &lt;20 mL/hr) not responsive to fluid challenge.

               3. Incisional wound that extends into visceral compartments.

               4. Suspected or proven contiguous bony or joint involvement.

                  gangrene.

               7. Infection of prosthetic materials or venous catheters that cannot be removed as
                  part of the treatment of the current infection.

               8. Infection of a full-thickness burn wound or burn wound that is &gt;20% total body
