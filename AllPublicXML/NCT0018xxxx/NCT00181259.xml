  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolism of the heart provides the chemical energy needed to fuel ongoing normal heart
      contraction. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a technique used in a MRI scanner that can be
      used to measure and study heart metabolism directly but without blood sampling or obtaining
      tissue biopsies. One of the hypotheses this study aims to investigate is whether energy
      metabolism is reduced in heart failure and whether that contributes to the poor heart
      function.

      This study uses magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy to study heart metabolism and function
      in normal subjects and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy,
      and those with coronary artery disease.
