  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction is a common manifestation of heart disease that
      is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.It is present when the ventricular
      filling is impaired as a result of delayed relaxation or decreased compliance. During
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, LV diastolic dysfunction is a frequent
      occurrence. Failure of the left ventricle to dilate normally causes an increase in LV filling
      pressure. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication after cardiac surgery affecting
      20-30% of patients undergoing coronary revascularization procedures. AF is associated with
      significant morbidity and mortality and has been identified as a causative factor of
      increased length of both hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay after CABG surgery,
      resulting in increased resource utilization and medical care costs.The primary aim of this
      study is to determine if patients with preoperative diastolic dysfunction are exposed to
      higher risk of AF after coronary revascularization surgery.
