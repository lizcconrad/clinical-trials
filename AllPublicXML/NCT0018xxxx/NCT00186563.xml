  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish a novel approach assisting the rational development of analgesic
      and anti-inflammatory drugs. In a first step we will test in healthy human volunteers whether
      proteins mediating inflammation and pain can be detected in an experimentally induced
      inflammatory skin lesion. Fluids that will be used to detect such proteins will be collected
      from the inflamed skin site via small porous catheters. We wish to establish the expression
      pattern of different proteins and correlate it with various tests assessing pain.
