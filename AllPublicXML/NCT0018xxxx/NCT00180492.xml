      This purpose of this study is to collect data on the FDA-approved ACCULINK(TM) Carotid Stent
      System and FDA 510(k)-cleared ACCUNET(TM) Embolic Protection System for the treatment of
      patients with atherosclerotic disease, when used by physicians under commercial use
      conditions.

      CAPTURE is a post-approval study to collect information on the safety and effectiveness of
      the ACCULINK and ACCUNET since the approval/clearance of these devices by the FDA. The
      ACCULINK stent is an elastic-like metal tube that is used to hold open a narrow part of a
      blood vessel. The ACCUNET is a wire mesh basket that is placed in the vessel to catch
      material (blood clots, fatty material) that could break off from the narrowed area of the
      blood vessel and block blood flow downstream during the stent procedure.

      Another goal of the CAPTURE study is to confirm that the ACCULINK and ACCUNET can be used
      safely by physicians with varying levels of experience in stenting procedures.

      The basis for FDA's approval/clearance of the ACCULINK and ACCUNET was the ARCHeR trials
      (ACCULINK/ACCUNET for Revascularization of Carotids in High-Risk Patients). The ARCHeR trials
      were conducted to collect data on the safety and effectiveness of the ACCULINK and ACCUNET
      when used in the treatment of carotid artery disease in patients at high risk for surgical
      treatment (carotid endarterectomy) because of medical or surgical comorbidities. The ARCHeR
      trials showed that the ACCULINK, used with or without the ACCUNET, is a safe and effective
      treatment option based on the rate of death, stroke, and myocardial infarction at 30 days,
      and stroke at one year.
