      Does the addition of steroids during the first trimester to the standard aspirin + heparin
      treatment reduce the miscarriage rates in women with antiphospholipid antibodies and
      recurrent first trimester miscarriage in those who had an unsuccessful pregnancy with aspirin
      + heparin?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, the APS has emerged as most important treatable cause of recurrent
      miscarriages. The pathogenesis of fetal loss in this condition is still remains obscure.
      Despite the success of aspirin + heparin treatment, some pregnant women with APS repeatedly
      miscarry even on treatment. The trial is designed to determine if addition of steroids has an
      success in these women. This is in view of recent in vitro data from our unit reporting that
      there is an increase decidual cytokine response in APS positive women.
