      &quot;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of the rate response function of
      implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) on the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias in
      patients with an ICD.&quot;

      &quot;Background: Studies have shown that bradycardia and irregular heart rates may increase the
      incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Regularizing the heart rate and avoiding bradycardias
      by rate responsive pacing may be a way to reduce these arrhythmias.

      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized multicenter study. Inclusion criteria: Patients
      with an indication for an ICD according to the AHA/ACC-guidelines who get a rate response
      system and have more than 5 % rate adaptive pacing during a one month screening phase may be
      included if they have given written informed consent. Rate adaptive pacing must not be
      contraindicated, patients must be able to perform a 6 min walk test, must not be NYHA IV and
      should have a life expectancy of more than 18 months.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to 6 months of rate responsive pacing followed by 6 months
      of no rate responsive pacing, vice versa respectively. At 6 and 12 months follow ups, ICD
      stored data, arrhythmic episodes, medication, anamnesis, quality of life, 6 min walktest,
      echocardiographic parameters and optionally spiroergomatry will be evaluated and compared.&quot;
