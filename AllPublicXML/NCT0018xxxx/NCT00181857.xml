      The researchers plan to explore the validity of the category of ADHD NOS by identifying the
      risk for ADHD in the children of ADHD NOS adult probands and identifying common correlates of
      ADHD in these children. The researchers hypothesize that the rate of ADHD will be higher in
      the children of the ADHD NOS probands than the rate of ADHD previously published for siblings
      of proband children with ADHD; and ADHD children of ADHD NOS adults will have higher rates of
      school failure (as measured by their rate of repeated grades, need for tutoring, and
      placement in special classes) than their non-ADHD siblings.

      We plan to explore the validity of the category of ADHD NOS by identifying the risk for ADHD
      in the children of ADHD NOS adult probands and identifying common correlates of ADHD in these
      children. We hypothesize the rate of ADHD will be higher in the children of the ADHD NOS
      probands than the rate of ADHD previously published for siblings of proband children with
      ADHD; and ADHD children of ADHD NOS adults will have higher rates of school failure (as
      measured by their rate of repeated grades, need for tutoring, and placement in special
      classes) than their non-ADHD siblings.

      The proposed study includes a one-time fifteen minute survey derived from the ADHD module of
      the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders - Epidemiological Version (KSADS-E) with the
      proband of an ADHD NOS study regarding his/her children, in order to assess possible ADHD
      symptoms of that child. We also ask &quot;school questions&quot; regarding certain aspects of a child's
      educational experience.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Must be a biological child of an ADHD NOS proband. The proband must meet the following
        criterion:

          1. Age: above 18 years

          2. Sex: male or female

          3. Intelligence quotient (IQ) above 80

          4. Met criteria for the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder not
             otherwise specified (ADHD NOS), by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), as manifested in clinical evaluation and confirmed
             by structured interview. This is operationalized by either:

               -  having at least 6 out of 9 current DSM-IV items of either inattention or
                  hyperactivity/impulsivity but &lt; 5 items from either list in childhood, or

               -  having 5 out of 9 current DSM-IV items of either inattention or
                  hyperactivity/impulsivity, but not having the 6 current symptoms in either
                  category. This second category will be included independent of the presence or
                  absence of ADHD symptoms in childhood.

          5. Had a Clinical Global Impression: ADHD score of 4 (moderately ill) or higher illness
             severity at a clinical evaluation.

          6. Has at least one biological offspring

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No adequate informant is available to answer the survey questions.

          2. Sensorimotor deficits. (These include deficits that would impede the survey process,
             e.g. profound deafness, blindness, inadequate command of the English language, or
             profound disorders of language.)

          3. Psychosis, autism, schizophrenia.
