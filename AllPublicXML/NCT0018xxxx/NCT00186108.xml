      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of oral triamcinalone given
      twice a day to patients with androgen independent prostate cancer to produce a sustained
      biochemical response. Secondary goals are to describe the safety and tolerability at this
      dose and schedule, to determine the time to sustained biochemical response, to determine the
      duration of biochemical response, to determine the time to disease progression.
