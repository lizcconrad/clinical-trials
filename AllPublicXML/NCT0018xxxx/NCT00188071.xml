      -  To compare postoperative analgesia by paracetamol 1gr or ketoprofen 100 mg or the
           combination of these two analgesics

        -  each treatment beeing allocated by randomization

      -  240 pregnant women who undewent a medical abortion by aspiration, under local
           anesthesia, (day case surgery) were enrolled after informed consent and signed approval

        -  according to randomization, they received one hour before medical abortion procedure
           performed under local anesthesia of the cervix, one of these three diffrente analgesics
           :

             -  paracetamol 1 gr

             -  ketoprofen 100 mg

             -  the association of both Postprocedure pain was recorded, by nurse, using a visual
                analog scale (VAS), 7 times before and after the procedure, until the discharge of
                the patient.

        -  if VAS was above 40 on two consecutive measurements a morphine injection was given.

        -  the number and total amount of morphine was recorded.

        -  satisfaction was recorded within the 3 postoperative day by a telephone inquiry.
