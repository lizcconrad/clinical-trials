  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that one form of mechanical airway clearance techniques,
      High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO)using a pneumatic vest, will diminish
      exacerbations of COPD which will improve respiratory health status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 to 70% of people with COPD have chronic cough and phlegm, the cardinal
      symptoms of chronic bronchitis or chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH). Once thought to be a
      relatively benign condition, recent evidence shows that CMH in patients with established COPD
      is associated with greater decline in lung function, more frequent respiratory infections,
      more frequent exacerbations and increased mortality.Using mechanical airway clearance
      techniques (The Vest) will diminish exacerbations of COPD which will improve respiratory
      health status.

      Comparison: Patients randomly assigned to the vest will have fewer exacerbations of
      COPD,better quality of life and less health care use compared to patients assigned to a sham
      vest.
