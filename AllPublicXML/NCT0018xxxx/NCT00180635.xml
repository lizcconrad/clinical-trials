  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of oral and inhaled
      administration of L-arginine and of inhaled aminoguanidine on bronchial and alveolar exhaled
      NO and NO metabolites in exhaled breath condensate, induced sputum, nasal lavage and mouth
      wash fluid in healthy non-smokers, current smokers and patients with COPD.
