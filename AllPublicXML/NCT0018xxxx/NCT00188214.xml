  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the lung is treated with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy, depending on the stage
      or extent of the disease. Some patients are treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation
      therapy before surgery to improve the results of surgery. After these treatments, we do not
      know whether the residual tumour tissue is still alive or dead, which is why some physicians
      feel that surgery is required to remove it.

      This study is designed to assess if computed tomography (CT, CAT-scan) enhanced with
      intravenous contrast agent (dye) can characterize a lung cancer, and say whether it is alive
      or dead. The researchers hope that in the future such a contrast-enhanced CAT-scan will make
      surgery less often necessary or improve the results of chemotherapy and/or radiation given
      before surgery.

      The proposed study will be performed in patients with a proven lung cancer for whom induction
      therapy and subsequent surgical resection of any kind is planned. Kinetic analysis of dynamic
      contrast-enhanced CT will performed using the CT Perfusion 3 software (General Electric
      Medical Systems), yielding parameters characterizing tumor microvasculature in terms of the
      vascularity, or the blood volume (BV), the tumor perfusion or blood flow (BF), and the
      immaturity of the vascular wall, in terms of the microvascular permeability (permeability
      surface area, PS).

      To test the assumption that dynamic CT-assessed tumor microvascular characteristics represent
      reliable, user-independent and reproducible parameters, microvascular values and parameter
      maps will be derived from two independent observers. To address the interobserver
      variability, each study will be analyzed by the PI and by a second researcher (blinded to the
      results of the PI). Kappa-statistics will be used to assess inter-rater concordance.

      To test the hypothesis that the microvascular parameters obtained from dynamic
      contrast-enhanced CT predict the response to induction therapy, the parameters BV, BF and PS
      obtained prior to any treatment will be correlated with the histological result from the
      resected specimen (path CR or path non-CR). Spearman correlation will be used to compare
      non-parametric histology results with quantitative CT microvascular parameters.

      To test the hypothesis that the microvascular parameters obtained from dynamic
      contrast-enhanced CT reflect the response to induction therapy, the parameters BV, BF and PS
      obtained after completion of induction treatment will be correlated with the histological
      result from the resected specimen (path CR or path non-CR). Spearman correlation will be used
      to compare non-parametric histology results with quantitative CT microvascular parameters.
