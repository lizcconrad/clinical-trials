    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. Objective(s): To evaluate the effect of human growth
      hormone on infants aged 1 to 2 years with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and growth
      retardation despite an adequate dietary intake.

      Trial Design: This is an open, parallel group clinical trial with a duration of one year, in
      which period 50% of patients will receive GH treatment and the other 50% will act as a
      control group, without treatment.

      Trial Population: The trial will involve a total of 16 infants aged from 12±3 to 24 months
      suffering chronic renal insufficiency (Glomerular Filtration Rate less than 60 ml/min/1.73
      m2), and growth failure and undergoing conservative treatment or peritoneal dialysis. Include
      the key inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be infants of both sexes aged 12 ± 3 months with chronic renal
             insufficiency and growth retardation.

          -  To be included in the trial, patients must meet all of the following inclusion
             criteria a.)-c.):

          -  b.) Chronic renal insufficiency with Glomerular Filtration Rate less than 60
             ml/min./1.73m2, according to the method used routinely in each participating center

          -  c.) Growth retardation documented at the start of the trial, according to the
             following criteria: Length less than -2 SDS by chronological age and sex and linear
