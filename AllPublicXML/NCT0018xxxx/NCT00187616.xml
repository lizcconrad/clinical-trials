    <textblock>
      214 patients involved in a larger randomized controlled trial of the herb, saw palmetto, for
      benign prostatic hyperplaisa were randomly assigned to 3 different methods of adverse event
      ascertainment after a 1-month placebo run-in visit. Two methods of ascertainment were open
      ended questions, and 1 was a checklist. Patients were blinded to group assignment, but
      investigators were aware (single blind). All patients had taken placebo for one month, but
      had been told it was a study drug (single blind).
