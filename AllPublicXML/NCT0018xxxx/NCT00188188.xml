  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is a relatively common autoimmune disease that affects mainly
      women.Cardiovascular disease as a result of accelerated atherosclerosis is a major cause of
      mortality and morbidity in SLE.Previous research has shown that 35-40% of patients with SLE
      have abnormalities of myocardial perfusion even when they have no coronary stenoses on
      coronary angiography. The reason for these frequent perfusion abnormalities in the absence of
      angiographically significant CAD remains uncertain, but could conceivably result from
      endothelial dysfunction. In SLE, coronary endothelial dysfunction could result from the
      inflammatory process involved in the SLE disease itself, a finding that could explain the
      correlation between disease activity and the development of CAD in these patients.As such
      endothelial dysfunction may account for accelerated atherosclerosis and cardiac perfusion
      defects (without angiographically significant coronary lesions). We propose to first evaluate
      whether endothelial dysfunction occurs in these patients and is more frequent in patients
      with myocardial perfusion abnormalities. Endothelial function will be assessed by measuring
      flow-mediated brachial artery dilatation. In the 250 patients included in the study we will
      correlate endothelial function and myocardial perfusion abnormalities to SLE disease
      activity, to its treatment and to the presence of CAD risk factors In a subgroup of patients
      (estimated 5 patients) in whom it is clinically indicated, coronary angiography will be
      performed in order to assess the presence of significant coronary stenoses (&gt;50%),coronary
      artery reserve and coronary endothelial dysfunction. We will then attempt to reverse
      abnormalities in endothelial function and myocardial perfusion by therapy with an ACE
      inhibitor(Quinapril).Patients with myocardial perfusion abnormalities will be randomised to
      receive Medication A(oral Quinapril or Placebo) for 8 weeks, will have all baseline
      investigations repeated and then will switch over and receive medication B(Quinapril or
      placebo) for a further 8 weeks followed by repeat investigations.
