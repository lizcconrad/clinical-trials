  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether or not a new contrast agent called Combidex, a
      contrast agent formulated from ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) improves the
      ability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to see lymph nodes in the pelvis. It might also
      help doctors tell whether or not cancer has spread to these lymph nodes. It might allow
      radiotherapy to be delivered more accurately.
