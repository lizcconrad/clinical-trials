  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children receiving IFT (intensive family therapy) were assessed for symptom profile and
      global functioning before admission, 3 months after discharge and 1 year after discharge.
      Children were assessed by parents, children, their teachers and themselves. Parents were
      assessed by themselves at the same points in time through psychological self-report
      questionnaires.

      The study is intended to explore covariates to change in children as well as in parents
      during (pre-treatment) the treatment and follow-up periods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IFT is an intensive combinatory family treatment which is child-oriented, and traditionally
      used in an inpatient family treatment unit in child and adolescent psychiatry.

      Measures include ones on bonding (PBI), personality traits (NEO-PI), anxiety and depressive
      symptoms (HADS), attributional tendencies (PAT) and social desirable responding (BIDR). A
      subgroup was also assessed before a waiting period (pre-treatment).
