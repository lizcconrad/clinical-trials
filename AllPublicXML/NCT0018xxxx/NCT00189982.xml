  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether rAHF-PFM is safe and effective in the
      treatment of children with hemophilia A. The study is open to pediatric patients in Canada
      who completed Baxter Study 060101.

    <description>Treatment regimens were determined by the investigator, and may have been any combination of standard prophylaxis (25 to 50 IU/kg body weight, 3 to 4 times per week), investigator-determined prophylaxis, and/or on-demand treatment (dose selected by investigator). Once the treatment regimen was established, the regimen was to be maintained for the duration of the study, unless clinical reasons necessitated a change.
The treatment of bleeding episodes and perioperative management was at the discretion of the investigator and consistent with the institution's standard of care.</description>
