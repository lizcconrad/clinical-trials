  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the toxicity and feasibility of non-myeloablative
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants for multiple myeloma from unrelated donors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the protocol is to evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of this
      mixed chimerism matched unrelated donor allogeneic transplant approach for patients with
      multiple myeloma. Response, toxicity, survival and graft-versus-host disease will be
      evaluated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:a) Multiple myeloma which is responsive to therapy. Eligible patients
        may have early or relapsed disease. Patients must have Stage II-III disease or have
        progression after initial treatment of Stage I disease. Patients who have relapsed
        following autologous transplantation may be eligible for this protocol.

        b) Age &lt;= 60 years. c) No prior therapy which would preclude the use of low-dose total body
        irradiation.

        d) Patients must have their pathology reviewed and the diagnosis confirmed at Stanford
        University Medical Center. Patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy
        of unknown significance, or amyloidosis will be excluded from this study.

        e) Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70%. f) DLCO &gt;= 60% predicted. g)
        ALT and AST must be &lt; 2X normal. Total bilirubin less than 2 mg/dl. h) Serum creatinine &lt;
        2.0 or 24-hour creatinine clearance &gt;= 50 ml/min. i) Patients must be HIV negative. j)
        Pregnant or lactating women will not be eligible to participate. k) Patients must provide
        signed, informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:a) Severe psychological or medical illness b) Patients who have
        undergone prior allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation will not be eligible for this
        study.

        c) Patients who have an HLA-identical sibling donor will be excluded
