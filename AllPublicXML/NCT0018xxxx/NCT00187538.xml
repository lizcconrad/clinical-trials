    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a major health concern worldwide. While there are drugs available for the
      treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, they are not practical for population-wide
      prevention efforts. Demonstrating the effectiveness of safe and widely available dietary
      interventions to prevent osteoporosis could have important public health ramifications.
      Different food sources of dietary protein may have different effects on bone metabolism.
      Animal foods provide a dietary acid load that may lead to negative calcium balance and
      increased bone resorption. In contrast, vegetable sources of protein, while providing some
      acid due to their protein content, provide proportionally more base that counters the dietary
      acid load. The effect of dairy products, which are rich in animal protein but also contain
      potential base precursors not found in vegetable foods, has not been established. Finally,
      soy protein sources may have a dual benefit: soy foods provide base precursors as well as
      plant estrogens that may have a beneficial effect on bone. We are resubmitting this proposal
      to randomize postmenopausal women to one of four diets equal in calories, protein, calcium,
      and sodium. The diets will differ by having 80 percent of the protein from one of four
      sources: non-dairy animal, vegetable, dairy, or soy foods, resulting in significant
      differences among the diets in acid, base, and isoflavone content. All food will be prepared
      and provided by the General Clinical Research Center. The subjects will consume the diets for
      6 weeks with measurements of acid-base status, isoflavone excretion, and calcium metabolism.
      This will be the first intervention study to examine the effect of different sources of
      dietary protein in whole foods on calcium metabolism. Eventually our findings could have
      substantial public health implications and provide a widely available and low risk means to
      help prevent osteoporosis.
