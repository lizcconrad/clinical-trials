  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine breast cancers that express the protein (NIS) that
      may be found in malignant breast tissues and to evaluate proteins found in blood and their
      relationship to NIS, to test whether iodide can be concentrated by breast cells to possibly
      treat some breast cancers with radioactive iodine, and to calculate the amount of radioactive
      iodine entering breast cancer cells, how long your cancer retains the agent as well as how
      much is taken up by other organs, particularly the thyroid gland.

      To demonstrate iodide uptake capacity of breast cancer metastases by imaging women with
      iodide radioisotope (123I) and calculating potential ablative dose of radioactive iodide
      (131I).
