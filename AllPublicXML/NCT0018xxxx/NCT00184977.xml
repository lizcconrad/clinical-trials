  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this family practice based study is to determine the long-term treatment effects
      of two drugs that are presumed to modify the course and progression of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD), oral N-acetylcysteine and inhaled corticosteroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disorder characterised by symptoms and
      abnormal tests of expiratory flow that do not change markedly over periods of several months
      observation. COPD includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is not fully clear which
      medication is the most efficacious in the long-term treatment of COPD. In contrast to asthma,
      the efficacy and therefore the precise role of inhaled corticosteroids is less clear in the
      treatment of patients with COPD. The same applies to another (much less investigated)
      possibility in the treatment of COPD, the anti-oxidant agent N-acetylcysteine.
      N-acetylcysteine is used as a mucolytic agent in a variety of clinical conditions, such as
      acute and chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. The aim of this study, which is performed
      in family practices, is to determine the 3-year treatment effects and cost-effectiveness of
      oral N-acetylcysteine versus an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticason propionate) in modifying
      the course and progression of COPD.

      Comparisons: N-acetylcysteine (oral, 600 mg o.d.) and fluticason propionate (dry powder
      inhalation, 500 mcg b.i.d.) are compared with placebo
