      Aims: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions aimed at improving the management
      of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism: Written guidelines and Computer-Assisted
      Decision Support (CADS). 2) To evaluate the impact of electronic reminders on the
      appropriateness of the treatment of patients with suspected PE

      Design: Pragmatic, unblinded, cluster randomised controlled study.

      Setting: 20 French Emergency Departments

      Patients: Out patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism

      Methods: Emergency physicians will prospectively complete a standardized electronic form on
      Personal Data Assistant (PDA), including patients' characteristics, the clinical probability
      if assessed, the diagnostic tests performed, the treatments initiated and the final
      diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Patients will be interviewed at the end of a 3-month
      follow-up period using a standardized questionnaire.

      The reference rate of appropriateness of the diagnostic management before intervention will
      be assessed in each centre. At the end of this preliminary period, the centres will be
      randomized in two fold two groups according to a factorial design with stratification on
      their reference level of appropriateness. Half of the centres will have written guidelines
      and half a Computer-Assisted Decision Support for the diagnosis of PE on the PDA. In each of
      these two main groups, half of the centres will have electronic reminders on their PDA
      concerning the treatment of PE.

      Judgment criteria

      Main : Rate of strategies considered as validated according to the results of the systematic
      review and meta-analysis.3

      Secondary judgment criteria (diagnosis):

        -  Rate of strategies considered as validated or acceptable according to the opinion of
           international advisors.

        -  Rate of thromboembolic-events during a 3-month follow-up period in patients for whom
           pulmonary embolism will be ruled out

        -  Costs of the diagnostic management

      Secondary judgment criteria (treatment):

        -  Delay between Emergency Department admission and the first dose of antithrombotic
           treatment in patients with high clinical probability of PE according to the Revised
           Geneva Score

        -  Rate of inappropriate treatment according to international recommendations for patients
           with confirmed PE.

      Number of patients: By estimating that the rate of appropriateness would be 55% in the
      &quot;written guidelines&quot; group, 1331 patients are necessary to highlight an absolute superiority
      of 15% in the &quot;CADS&quot; group (rate of conformity of 70%).

      The number of patients will be adjusted at the end of the preliminary period according to the
      level of appropriateness before interventions considering that it will improve less than 5%
      in the &quot;written guidelines&quot; group.

      Background: The management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) represents an
      important medical and economic issue. In French Emergency Departments, more than 100 000
      suspicions of PE are dealt with per year. In a previous work, we found that the routine
      diagnostic practice differs to a large extent from international guidelines and that
      excluding PE on the basis of inappropriate criteria exposes patients to a six-fold increased
      risk of venous thromboembolism during 3-months follow-up.1 Passive interventions to improve
      quality are generally ineffective but Computer-Assisted Decision Support and reminders appear
      as promising.2

      Interventions:

      At the end of the preliminary period, we will perform for all the investigators, an
      interactive oral presentation of the strategies considered as validated on the basis of a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.3 A strategy end up to exclude PE is considered as
      validated if the probability of PE is below 5% and a strategy end up to confirm PE is
      considered as validated if the probability of PE is upper than 85%. The strategies that do
      not achieve these criteria but considered as acceptable by international advisors will be
      presented too as well as the recommendations for the treatment of PE.4 In the group &quot;written
      guidelines&quot;, emergency physicians will be provided with cards presenting the list of the
      validated and acceptable strategies as well as the Geneva diagnostic algorithm.5 The
      algorithm will be mention as a way to follow appropriate diagnostic criteria.

      In the &quot;CADS&quot; group, the recommendations will be integrated into the electronic form allowing
      calculation of the pre-test probability according to revised Geneva Score 6, calculation of
      the post-test probabilities according to the likelihood ratios of the tests 3 and
      contextualized reminders as which test perform or when stop investigations.

      In the groups &quot;treatment help&quot;, reminders concerning the treatment (indications and
      contraindications, dosage) will be integrated into the electronic form on the PDA.
