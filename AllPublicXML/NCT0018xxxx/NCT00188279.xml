  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to help decide whether a CAT scan performed at a very low dose of
      radiation (Minimum dose CT scan) is better than a Chest X-Ray in detecting recurrence of lung
      cancer in the chest (after surgery).

    <textblock>
      Lung Carcinoma is expected to kill 18,900 men and women in Canada in 2004. This is more than
      the combined total for the next three common cancers. The most important factor that
      determines patient survival is the stage of disease at presentation. Surgical resection is
      the best chance of cure. However, patients who undergo lung resection with curative intent
      have a significant incidence of a second lung cancer at 2% per year and a recurrence rate of
      38% at 5 years. The current follow-up of these patients relies on periodic physical
      examination and chest radiography(CXR). However, CXR is insensitive in the detection of lung
      nodules when compared to standard Computed Tomography of the thorax (SDCT). Computed
      Tomography detects smaller lung nodules than CXR however, the radiation dose from a SDCT is
      roughly equivalent to 20 CXR examinations. Screening studies using Low Dose CT of the Thorax
      (LDCT) in subjects at high risk for lung cancer have demonstrated that LDCT detects three
      times as many nodules as CXR and four times as many primary lung cancers at one-third the
      dose of SDCT. Phantom and clinical work with LDCT performed at UHN/MSH suggests that a
      further reduction in radiation dose (Minimum Dose CT -MnDCT) is possible for nodule
      detection. Minimum dose CT is performed at a dose one sixth of a SDCT.In addition, if MnDCT
      is confirmed to be a more sensitive nodule detection technique, it could be used to

      1. Increase the interval between repeat out-patient assessment and thereby 2. Reduce the
      overall cost of surveillance and inconvenience to the patient and 3. Free up clinic time for
      the surgeon to review more patients and reduce waiting lists
