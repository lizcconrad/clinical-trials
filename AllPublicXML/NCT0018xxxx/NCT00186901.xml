  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research studies have shown that children who are long-term survivors of childhood leukemia
      may be at greater risk for early bone loss called osteoporosis. This bone loss may lead to a
      greater risk of broken bones and other spine and bone problems. However, researchers still do
      not know much about how frequently this long-term side effect may occur and how severe the
      problem is.

      St. Jude Children's Research Hospital researchers want to determine the frequency and
      severity of this side effect. They are also studying whether taking calcium and Vitamin D
      supplements can help children at risk for osteoporosis and if certain factors can be
      identified -- such as age at diagnosis, cancer treatments, or family history -- that may
      increase the chances of having osteoporosis. Researchers will take an x-ray study called
      quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to measure bone mineral density (BMD). The BMD is a
      measure of bone strength. If a subject's BMD falls below the average, he/she will be assigned
      to one of two groups. Subjects will be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin) to receive
      calcium and vitamin D pills. The other half will receive placebo pills that look like the
      calcium and vitamin D pills.

      The main objectives of the study are:

        -  To estimate, using quantitative computed tomography (QCT), the prevalence of diminished
           bone mineral density (BMD) in patients treated with contemporary, protocol-based
           multiagent chemotherapy (+cranial irradiation) for childhood acute lymphoblastic
           leukemia (ALL).

        -  To investigate possible risk factors for the development of diminished BMD in patients
           treated with contemporary protocol-based therapy for childhood ALL. Factors to be
           examined include patient characteristics (age at the time of treatment, gender, race,
           body mass index, physical activity and nutritional status, menarchal status, oral
           contraceptive use, growth hormone therapy, smoking and alcohol intake, birth weight,
           fracture history); treatment effects (intensity of treatment with antimetabolites and
           glucocorticoids; history of cranial irradiation); and genetic predisposition (i.e.,
           vitamin D and CYP3A4 receptor polymorphism and family history of osteoporosis).

        -  To evaluate, in a prospective placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized trial, the
           effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in addition to nutritional counseling
           on BMD in patients with BMD scores below the mean for age- and gender-matched controls,
           compared to an educational program of nutritional counseling alone.

      Secondary Aim

        -  To evaluate, in a prospective randomized trial, the correlation between BMD as
           determined by QCT and BMD as determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in
           patients with BMD more than one standard deviation (SD) below the mean for age- and
           gender-matched controls.

    <description>The effect of taking calcium and vitamin D supplements was measured using Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) to calculate a QTC Z score. A standardized Z-score was calculated to indicate the difference between the patient's Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and the mean value for age and gender-appropriate controls. Z-scores from 0 to +2 are considered normal, above +2 are considered to be elevated, from 0 to -1 are considered to represent a mild BMD deficit, between -1 and -2 are considered to represent moderate deficits, and below -2 are considered to represent severe deficits.</description>

        <title>Effect of Taking Calcium and Vitamin D Supplements on Bone Mineral Density (BMD)</title>
        <description>The effect of taking calcium and vitamin D supplements was measured using Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) to calculate a QTC Z score. A standardized Z-score was calculated to indicate the difference between the patient’s Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and the mean value for age and gender-appropriate controls. Z-scores from 0 to +2 are considered normal, above +2 are considered to be elevated, from 0 to -1 are considered to represent a mild BMD deficit, between -1 and -2 are considered to represent moderate deficits, and below -2 are considered to represent severe deficits.</description>
