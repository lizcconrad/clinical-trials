      This study will determine the effectiveness of medical case management in improving the
      medical care of people with mental disorders or substance abuse problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor quality of care may contribute to impaired health status and increased mortality in
      individuals with serious mental disorders and substance abuse problems; interventions
      designed to improve medical care for this population need to be developed. This study will
      develop a population-based medical case management model for improving the primary medical
      care of patients at an inner city community mental health center.

      This study will last 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive medical case
      management or standard of care (typically drug and behavioral therapy) for 2 years.
      Participants in the case management group will receive help in overcoming barriers to
      receiving primary care. Participants will also undergo 5 interviews over the 2-year study
      duration, and have annual chart reviews. Results of the interviews will be used to assess
      quality of primary care, service use, health outcomes, psychiatric symptoms, and substance
      use.

    <description>Nurse case management is a population-based medical case management program to improve the delivery of primary medical care to patients with serious mental illness in a Community Mental Health Center (CMHC) in Atlanta GA. The treatment draws on elements from the primary care, nursing case management, chronic disease, health behavior change literature, and from the study team's experience in integrating primary care services for patients with serious mental illnesses.</description>
