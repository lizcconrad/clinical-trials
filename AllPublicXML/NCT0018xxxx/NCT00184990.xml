  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis or endotoxemia is manifested by hypotension, resistance to vasopressors, myocardial
      depression,and altered organ blood flow distribution. The mechanisms underlying the
      cardiovascular dysfunction during sepsis are complex; however, they are partially mediated by
      an uncontrolled production of NO by inducible NO synthase (iNOS).Control subjects received 2
      ng/kg E. coli endotoxin, whereas the active intervention group received endotoxin in the
      presence of selective iNOS-inhibitor aminoguanidine. Hemodynamics, vascular responses to
      norepinephrine, acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, as well as circulating cytokines and
      other mediators of inflammation were measured. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of
      NO-synthesis prevented the LPS-mediated insensitivity to noradrenalin and
      endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation. Furthermore, we tested whether NO participates in
      occurrence of the endotoxin tolerance in humans by using the iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine on
      healthy volunteers with endotoxemia. At 0; 2 and 4 hours after the LPS challenge whole blood
      was stimulated with five TLR agonists in vitro and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were
      measured.
