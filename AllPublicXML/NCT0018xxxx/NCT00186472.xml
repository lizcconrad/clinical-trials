  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants born premature face numerous medical problems, causing significant anxiety for their
      parents. Parents experience a range of negative emotions including concern for the health and
      well being of their fragile infant, guilt, and disappointment. Research has indicated that
      having an infant in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is highly stressful for parents
      and multiple studies have demonstrated that parents can develop significant psychological
      reactions to this experience. Specifically, many parents develop clinically significant
      anxiety disorders such as acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). This not only impacts the mental well-being of the parents, but also can lead to
      problems with the parent-infant relationship, and, in turn, negatively impact the infant and
      the family as a whole. Despite the reported negative effects parents experience due to the
      stress of having an infant on the NICU, surprisingly little research has examined how to
      reduce parents' symptoms of anxiety. Because parents play an essential role in the care of
      their infant after discharge from the NICU, treating the parent's emotional distress is
      highly important. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a
      cognitive-behaviorally based intervention in reducing parents' symptoms of anxiety associated
      with having an infant on the NICU. This treatment is modeled after treatments that have
      proven effective with parents of children with other types of medical problems, for example,
      parents of children with cancer. It is the hope of the investigators that this intervention
      will effectively reduce symptoms of anxiety of NICU parents as well as the likelihood of
      developing subsequent psychological disorders.
