  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of a
      nurse-directed, home-based walking exercise program to mitigate fatigue and maintain physical
      functioning during adjuvant therapy for cancer. The sample will be randomized into exercise
      (EX) or usual care (UC) groups. The independent study variable is participation in a walking
      exercise program. Outcomes include: fatigue, sleep disturbance, emotional distress, physical
      functioning and quality of life. The effects of the walking exercise program will be
      evaluated using self-report questionnaires administered pre- and post-treatment, patient
      diaries, and symptoms assessments at defined intervals during adjuvant therapy
