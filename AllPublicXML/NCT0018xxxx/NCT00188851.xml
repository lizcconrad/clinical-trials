  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the virologic impact of switching
      treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with virologic failure to a salvage regimen with
      or without a 12 week STI prior to the switch.

      Hypothesis: A STI prior to starting a salvage regimen will result in an improved virologic
      response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively determine the virologic impact of switching treatment-experienced
      HIV-infected patients with virologic failure to a salvage regimen with or without a 12 week
      STI prior to the switch.

      Hypothesis: By withdrawing ARV drug pressure, resistant HIV virus will revert to wild-type.
      In treatment-experienced HIV patients who experience virologic failure, a STI prior to
      starting a salvage regimen will result in an improved virologic response and more prolonged
      vral suppression compared to immediate switching to a new regime.

      Interventions:

      Immediate Switch to Salvage Therapy: Patients randomized to the control arm will be switched
      immediately to a salvage regimen using the information from the treatment history and
      genotype results.

      Structured Treatment Interruption: Patients randomized to the STI arm will have their present
      regimen stopped for 12 weeks and will have a genotype repeated in the 12th week. A salvage
      regimen will be started at week 12 using the information from the treatment history and
      baseline genotype results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  On therapy with a triple ARV that includes a protease inhibitor and/or non-nucleoside
             reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the past 3 months with no changes in any agent of
             the combination in the past 14 days.

          -  Virologic failure while on the combination as defined by a plasma HIV RNA &gt; 1000

             requiring treatment within the preceding 30 days.

          -  The patient has at least two new ARV available based on history, and at least two of
             these new agents will be included in the new salvage regimen.
