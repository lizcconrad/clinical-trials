  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or brain tumors that are unresponsive to
      conventional therapy, or with no known effective therapy, will be treated. Experiments in the
      laboratory have shown the experimental drug RAD001C (RAD001, Everolimus) can prevent cells
      from multiplying. RAD001 is now being tested in diseases such as cancer, in which excessive
      cell multiplication needs to be stopped. The drug has been tested in adult cancer patients
      and has been well tolerated by subjects in these studies. It is experimental and, therefore,
      available in clinical trials.
