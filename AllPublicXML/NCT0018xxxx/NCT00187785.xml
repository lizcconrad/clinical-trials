  <brief_summary>

      Does use of a translator or use of less than perfect Spanish diminish provider-patient
      communication compared to a native speaker.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spanish speaking drop-in patients will be consented then randomized to receive care by a
      native Spanish speaker, an English speaker using a translator, or an English speaker with
      intermediate Spanish skills using Spanish. After the visit, the researcher will enquire about
      patient satisfaction, when the next appointment is, whether medication has been changed, and
      what instructions their provider gave them. Each provider will do a similar questionnaire. A
      blinded researcher will score a concordance of plans between provider and patient to see if
      there is a significant difference in retained information between the groups.
