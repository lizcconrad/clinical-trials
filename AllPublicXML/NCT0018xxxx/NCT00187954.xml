      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To correlate the severity of retinal arteriolar narrowing and other microvascular
           changes, as determined from retinal photographs and video imaging, to measures of
           coronary microvascular function in women evaluated for chest pain.

        -  To evaluate measures of vascular compliance with applanation tonometry and
           photoplethysmography using a nasal alar probe.

      Women who meet study eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent will have a
      baseline physical exam, including measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, weight. Medical
      history will be updated, specifically cardiovascular events (hospitalizations, procedures)
      since last contact and current medications. Patients will be scheduled for retinal
      photography. Those who are currently being screened and qualify for EWISE or other ancillary
      studies will have retinal photography scheduled as close to the index CFR as possible and
      prior to receiving randomized therapy.

      The retinal photography will follow a standardized written protocol.

      For the second protocol, 100 patients will be scheduled for an appointment in the Eye clinic
      where they will meet the Women's Ischemic Syndrome Evaluation (WISE)/Atherosclerosis Risk in
      Communities (ARIC) staff and complete the baseline information and have a brief physical
      examination. They will then have provocative testing completed with retinal imaging.
