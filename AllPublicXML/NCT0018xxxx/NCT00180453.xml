      Prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded, parallel two-arm, multicenter trial.

      Test arm: XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System(stent length: 18mm, diameter:
      3.0mm) Control arm: Metallic stent (MULTI-LINK VISION® metallic stent(stent length: 18mm,
      diameter: 3.0mm) Follow-up angiographic imaging and intra vascular ultra sound (IVUS) at 180
      days and 1 year

      The SPIRIT FIRST clinical trial will enroll approximately 60 patients and will assess the
      feasibility and performance of the XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System in the
      treatment of patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions. In this trial, the XIENCE
      V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System will be compared to the MULTI-LINK VISION®
      metallic stent which is CE marked and FDA approved and is available for commercial use in
      Europe and in the United States. The SPIRIT FIRST Clinical trial will enroll approximately 60
      patients (30 patients in the test arm and 30 patients in the control arm) with de novo native
      coronary artery lesions in 4 clinical sites in The Netherlands and Germany

                  brachytherapy

               8. Located in a major epicardial vessel that has been previously treated with any
                  type of PCI (e.g., POBA, stent, cutting balloon, atherectomy), except if previous
                  treatment occurred in a side branch distal to target lesion at least 180 days
                  preceding the index procedure

               9. Involves jailing of side branches &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter

          2. The target vessel contains thrombus.

          3. Another significant lesion (≥ 40 %DS) is located in the same major epicardial vessel
             as the target lesion.

          4. Patient has a high probability that a procedure other than pre-dilatation and stenting
             will be required for treatment of the target vessel (e.g. atherectomy, cutting
             balloon).

          5. Patient has additional lesion(s) for which an intervention within 180 days (prior to
             or after) of the index procedure would be required or has been performed.
