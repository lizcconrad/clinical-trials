  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of basiliximab Vs placebo as induction
      therapy combined with standard triple immunosuppression therapy, in the prevention of acute
      rejection episodes and prevention of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of basiluximab for the
      prevention of acute allograft lung rejection when used in addition to Neoral, corticosteroids
      and azathioprine. Acute rejection episodes will be evaluated during the first 6 months
      post-transplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) will be evaluated at the end of 1
      year after transplant and at additional follow-up visits at 2 and 3 years after transplant.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Male or female recipients of a first bilateral or single lung or lobar allograft who
             are suitable to receive Neoral/ corticosteroids/ azathioprine/ and Basiliximab
             (Simulect).

          -  Patients greater than 18 years of age.
