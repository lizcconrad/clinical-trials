  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life-threatening thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and neutropenia (low white blood
      count) remain the major dose-limiting toxicities following chemotherapy treatment for cancer.
      The only remedy for thrombocytopenia at present is platelet transfusion, which is effective
      in preventing life-threatening hemorrhage, but may lead to other complications. Preclinical
      studies and studies in adults have shown recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) to be
      effective in stimulating platelet production. The initial phase of this trial will evaluate
      the safety of rhTPO use immediately after chemotherapy with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and
      etoposide in children with solid tumors and lymphomas. The second phase of the study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of rhTPO in decreasing the duration of low platelet count after
      chemotherapy.
