      Purpose of the study:

      One bothering feature of atopic dermatitis is its relapsing nature. Hence, it is worthwhile
      to test modes how to efficiently prevent relapses or at least increase the time until the
      disease recurs. In order to give recommendations to other patients, this study is to
      scientifically describe efficacy and safety of a given regimen, namely a maintenance therapy
      with two days a week Advantan.
