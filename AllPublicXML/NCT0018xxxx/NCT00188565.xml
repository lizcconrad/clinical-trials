  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal carcinoma is the third most common cause of death from cancer. Approximately, 30%
      of colorectal carcinomas involve the rectum. Optimizing local control in the pelvis while
      reducing treatment toxicity remains one of the principal goals of therapy for patients with
      locally advanced rectal carcinoma. Treatment strategies that achieve this goal will have a
      significant impact on our society.C linical trials have shown that this type of cancer is
      less likely to come back if chemotherapy and radiotherapy are added to surgery. A combination
      of all three types of therapy is now standard.

      Celecoxib (CelebrexÂ®) is a drug that lessens the action of an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX-2) also known as a &quot;COX-2 inhibitor&quot;. It is an anti-inflammatory capsule (drug that
      reduces irritation) that is commonly used to treat arthritis. It is not a chemotherapy drug.
      Laboratory experiments have shown that such COX-2 inhibitors may increase the anti-cancer
      effect of radiotherapy, without increasing radiation side effects. This has not yet been
      confirmed in humans.The main purpose of this study is to confirm that celecoxib does not
      increase the side effects when given with radiotherapy and chemotherapy for rectal cancer. We
      shall also be looking at how effective the combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and
      celecoxib is in shrinking rectal cancer.
