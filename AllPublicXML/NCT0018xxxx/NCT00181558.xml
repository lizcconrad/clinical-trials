  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to look at the effects (good or bad) that Atrasentan given
      alone and Atrasentan given with Zometa has on levels of bone formation and bone destruction
      in men with prostate cancer that has spread to the bones.

      -  Patients will be randomized to either receive Atrasentan alone or Atrasentan plus
           Zometa.

        -  Patients receiving Atrasentan alone will receive this drug in pill form once daily for
           12 weeks. Patients will have a physical exam, blood work, and a urine sample performed
           once every other week during the first four weeks of medication administration. After
           those two initial visits, they will return to the clinic once every 4 weeks to have the
           same tests repeated. A bone scan and abdominal-pelvic CT Scan will be done every 12
           weeks.

        -  After the patient has been taking Atrasentan for 12 weeks, if the disease has not
           progressed, they will begin combination treatment of Atrasentan and Zometa.

        -  Patients receiving Atrasentan plus Zometa, receive Zometa intravenously and then
           immediately start Atrasentan orally once daily as long as they remain on the study.
           Patients will return to the clinic twice over the first 4 weeks (once every other week)
           to have a physical exam, blood work and urine test performed. After these two initial
           visits, they will return to the clinic once every 4 weeks to have the tests repeated and
           to receive another treatment of zometa. A bone scan and an abdominal-pelvic CT Scan will
           be done once every 12 weeks.

        -  Patients participation in this study will last as long as the disease does not progress
           and they are not experiencing any serious side effects.
