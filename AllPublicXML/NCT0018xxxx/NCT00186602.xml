  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women indicate the greatest needs for counseling at the time of initial diagnosis for primary
      breast cancer. The time of initial diagnosis is also often the time of greatest need for
      information for women and their families. However, this is the time when a woman, overwhelmed
      by shock and trauma, is least likely to absorb information provided or seek new sources of
      information. An informed peer navigator with carefully trained communication skills can judge
      the level of information to disclose and pace that information in a way that can be easily
      absorbed and understood. She will also provide support. WomenCARE, a well-established Santa
      Cruz agency providing free support services for women with cancer, and the Psychosocial
      Treatment Lab at Stanford therefore ask whether women newly diagnosed with breast cancer will
      improve their quality of life by participating in a peer navigator program. WomenCARE's peer
      navigators provide emotional support, good listening skills, and information on resources for
      women just diagnosed with breast cancer. Having a peer counselor while a woman goes through
      treatment may reduce the magnitude of distress or shorten its time course. It may also reduce
      distress in family members, and improve relationships with medical personnel.

      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer navigator program where a
      woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer is carefully matched for 3 to 6 months after
      diagnosis with a trained volunteer who is herself a breast cancer survivor. Navigators and
      Sojourners (newly diagnosed women) are matched on things that are important to them. Women
      often want to be matched on the type of surgery or treatment they have received. We assign
      half of the women (by a process similar to a coin toss) to our peer navigator program and
      half to a group that receives standard medical care but no peer navigator. In this way we can
      compare the groups to see whether those matched with a peer navigator have better quality of
      life over the 3 to 6 month period. All women who join our study, regardless of the group to
      which they are assigned, get an extra consultation with a nurse specialist at a local
      hospital. In this consultation, the nurse reviews the cancer resources available to the woman
      in Santa Cruz County. This meeting is tailored to the womanâ€™s individual diagnosis and
      situation.
