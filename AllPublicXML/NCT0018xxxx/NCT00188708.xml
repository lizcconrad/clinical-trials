  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancers, in common with many other tumours, are often hypoxic; that is, they have
      low levels of oxygen. It is thought that tumour hypoxia may hasten the progression of cancers
      and make them more resistant to treatment. One previous study has suggested that hormone
      therapy, such as Casodex, may improve the prostate oxygen level. This study is designed to
      test that finding.
