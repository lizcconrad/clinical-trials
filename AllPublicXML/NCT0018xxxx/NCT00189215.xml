  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass surgery is associated with postoperative cognitive decline, which has
      largely been attributed to the use of the heart lung machine. We hypothesized that long-term
      cognitive outcome may improve by avoiding the heart lung machine. The objective of the
      present study is to compare the effect of coronary bypass surgery with and without heart lung
      machine on cognitive and clinical outcome, five years after surgery.

      Background:

      Coronary artery bypass surgery is associated with postoperative cognitive decline, which has
      largely been attributed to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A large recent study by
      Newman et al demonstrated that the incidence of cognitive decline was 24% at six months after
      surgery, but it increased to 42% at five years. In the recently conducted Octopus Randomized
      Trial, cognitive decline at three months after surgery was present in 29% of the patients
      operated with CPB. In the patients operated without CPB, the incidence was 21%, i.e. only
      slightly better.

      Hypothesis:

      Improvement of cognitive outcome by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass will become more apparent
      five years after surgery, compared to three months after surgery.

      Study objectives:

      The objective of the present study is to compare the effect of coronary bypass surgery with
      and without cardiopulmonary bypass on cognitive and clinical outcome, five years after
      surgery.

      Methods:

      The 281 participants of the Octopus Study, who were operated on between March 1998 and August
      2000 and randomized to off-pump or on-pump coronary bypass surgery, will be invited for an
      additional assessment of their cognitive and clinical status and quality of life, five years
      after surgery. Patients will undergo a battery of ten neuropsychologic tests to determine
      their cognitive status. Clinical status will be assessed by an interview. Questionnaires will
      be used to measure quality of life.
