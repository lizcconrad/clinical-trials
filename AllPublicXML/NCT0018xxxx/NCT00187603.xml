  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among all racial/ethnic groups, African Americans have the greatest risk of becoming ill or
      dying from tobacco-related diseases. Because of this disproportionate disease burden, it is
      particularly urgent that researchers focusing on tobacco control partner with African
      American communities. Intervention strategies which hold the tobacco industry accountable for
      its behavior are effective in changing views of tobacco use. In earlier work, the
      investigators found that information from internal tobacco industry documents, when shown to
      African American smokers, stimulated reflection about quitting and interest in disseminating
      information about industry targeting behaviors to others. However, to date there have been no
      attempts to utilize the information in industry documents as part of a smoking cessation
      intervention. In this project, the investigators will test whether a community co-developed,
      tailored quit-smoking program featuring exposures to African American-specific tobacco
      industry documents and media exercises in addition to proven individual quitting strategies
      can increase the number of people who quit smoking at six months and one year, as compared
      with usual care.

      The specific aims of the project are to:

        1. test, using statistics, how well an innovative community-based, culturally tailored
           quit-smoking program for African Americans works at 6 and 12 months;

        2. test selected variables for how well they predict who will return to smoking;

        3. use interviews to identify additional individual and/or community factors associated
           with successful quitting or relapse; and

        4. collect information to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the CARA project
           collaborative efforts in developing and sustaining the project over time, enhancing
           community awareness of tobacco issues, and creation or enhancement of community tobacco
           control resources.
