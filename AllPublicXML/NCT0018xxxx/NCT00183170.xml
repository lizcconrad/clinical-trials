  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to assess the residual effects of heavy drinking on academic
      performance. The investigators will also explore whether these effects differ by family
      history of alcohol abuse and hangover symptoms, as well as compare males and females with
      respect to these effects. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that intoxication (0.10g%
      blood alcohol concentration [BAC]) with an alcoholic beverage impairs next-day academic
      performance, as measured by scores on quizzes, standardized academic achievement tests, and
      standardized neurobehavioral assessments. Their secondary hypothesis is that
      family-history-positive individuals will show a greater performance decrement the day after
      heavy drinking than family-history-negative individuals.

      The primary goal of the study is to assess the effect of heavy drinking on next day academic
      performance. We are using a placebo-controlled 2-period crossover design to compare the
      effects of dosing status on academic performance, with participants serving as their own
      controls. Participants are dosed on two separate occasions, once with non- alcoholic beverage
      and the other time with alcoholic beverage sufficient to raise blood alcohol to 0.10 g%. The
      morning after dosing, participants' academic performance is measured using a standardized
      achievement test (Graduate Record Exam) and a quiz on material presented in the video lecture
      the prior afternoon before dosing. Participants' cognition is also tested using the
      Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (NES3) and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT). We are
      collecting data on participants' demographics, family history of drinking problems and
      alcohol use. We are also collecting information on hangover symptoms and sleep quality the
      morning after dosing, in addition to participants' self ratings of academic performance. The
      procedure is conducted twice with one week in between, switching the individuals' dosing
      status, presenting a different, but comparable lecture and reading, and administering a
      different quiz based on the new lecture and reading and a different, but comparable
      standardized achievement exam. This design is intended to test the hypothesis that
      intoxication (0.10 g% BAC) with alcoholic beverage impairs next-day academic performance.

      Participation involves a total of five sessions over a two week period. Participants are
      undergraduates who volunteer and meet inclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, volunteers are
      screened to ensure they meet initial eligibility criteria. Eligible volunteers receive
      written instructions regarding participation and are scheduled for the study sessions.
      Participants report to the study site on the first session for an additional screening by the
      study physician and go through the informed consent process. Eligible participants report
      back the next week for their first dosing night where they receive several drinks (alcohol or
      placebo) sufficient to raise their BAC to 0.10g%; the amount of beverage administered is
      based on their body weight. Those receiving placebo receive the same total quantity of
      beverage as those receiving alcohol. Both alcohol-dosed and placebo-dosed participants are
      breath-tested after they have completed their required dose. Participants sleep at the study
      site and are monitored overnight. The next morning they are awakened and are escorted to the
      exam room for the performance trial, which includes a quiz on the lecture and reading
      material, a GRE examination, the NES3 battery and the PVT. They return the next week for the
      second dosing night/dosing morning, and receive either alcohol or placebo, depending on what
      was administered the previous week, and take different but comparable performance tests.
