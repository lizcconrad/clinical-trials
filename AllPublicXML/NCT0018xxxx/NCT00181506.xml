  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we try to increase the radiation dose, while reducing or keeping the radiation
      schedule below 4 weeks.

      The study hypothesis is that it is feasible to administer hyperfractionated accelerated
      radiotherapy to patients with inoperable or locally advanced non small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer is still the most common cancer and the main cause of cancer
      death. Treatment of choice for these patients is often radiotherapy, which results in an
      overall 5-year survival rate between 5 and 10%. The addition of chemotherapy improves
      survival by a few percentages and is therefore considered standard treatment for patients
      with stage III disease.

      However, several factors have been identified that have an impact on the local control but
      also on survival.

        1. There is a dose-effect relationship. A higher dose results in a better survival rate.
           However, higher radiation doses are currently not delivered with conventional radiation
           due to the tolerance of normal tissue.

        2. The time factor plays an important role in radiotherapy. Prolonging the overall
           treatment time decreases the outcome of radiotherapy. Radiobiological modelling of data
           shows that the overall treatmetn time (OTT) should be kept below 4 weeks. Results from
           studies support this conclusion.

      So, probably the best results will be achieved when a very high radiation dose can be
      delivered within 4 weeks, without severally damaging normal tissue.

      In order to achieve this goal, an hyperfractionated accelerated treatment regimen together
      with a technically very advanced radiation technique to avoid as much normal tissue as
      possible, will be used in this study.
