  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a brief motivational interview in the context of
      an emergency health care visit will reduce high-risk drinking and drug-taking and associated
      health consequences among adolescents ages 14-21 years old.

      Many studies have shown that a brief motivational interview in the context of a routine or
      emergency health care visit may assist adults to reduce high-risk drinking and drug-taking.
      Center researchers are conducting a 1,400-person, randomized clinical trial involving teen
      patients at the Boston Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department in order to determine if
      a similar approach will be effective with youth. All patients aged 14 to 21 get a brief
      alcohol and drug screen, and those whose scores indicate they drink or use marijuana are
      invited to participate in the study. One-third of the enrollees will receive an assessment, a
      brief motivational interview performed by a trained peer counselor, direct referrals to
      community-based resources for adolescents, and a 10-day follow-up phone call. One-third will
      receive only the assessment and a list of community resources; and the final third will
      receive only the list of resources. All participants will be followed over time and
      re-screened to measure the impact of the initial brief intervention on their drinking and
      drug-taking. The key hypothesis is that individuals who receive the brief motivational
      interview in the emergency department setting will have lower rates of alcohol and illicit
      drug use and fewer health consequences over time.
