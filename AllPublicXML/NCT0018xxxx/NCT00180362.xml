  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the strategy of implanting an ICD with or without
      EPS before, during and after ICD-implantation in a randomised controlled trial, using a
      combined endpoint of major ICD-related adverse events as the primary outcome measure.

    <textblock>
      Usually, EPS before and during ICD-implantation is performed to allow risk stratification, to
      test serial antiarrhythmic drugs, to find suitable ablation sites in patients with
      hemo-dynamically stable monomorphic VTs, to exclude supraventricular tachycardias as a cause
      of cardiac arrest and to help programming detection rate and enhancement criteria in the ICD.
      However, routine EPS preceeding ICD-implantation exposes the patient to some risk and the
      health care system to considerable costs. So the question has been raised, whether such
      testing is still necessary and costseffective, if the indiaction for ICD-implantation is
      clear on a clinical ground.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the strategy of
      implanting an ICD with or without EPS before during and after ICD-implantation in a
      randomised controlled trial, using a combined endpoint of major ICD-related adverse events as
      the primary outcome measure (see details under &quot;Endpoints&quot;). The results will be viewed
      against the extra costs and patientsÂ´ quality of life both study arms.Secondary outcomes are
      considered as differences in decisions between the groups and difference of events in the two
      groups.
