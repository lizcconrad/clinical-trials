  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      What is the difference between the use of one drug (Oral Metronidazole) versus the use of
      this same drug combined with another drug (Rifampin) in treatment of bacteria and
      infection-associated diarrhea in patients? This infection is an important cause of morbidity
      and mortality in both the community and hospitals, and the leading cause of hospital and
      chronic facility-acquired diarrhea. Research is important for the treatment of this
      infection. Patient care with use of two medication treatment regimens will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile infection contributes to both community and hospital acquired morbidity
      and mortality. Metronidazole alone is usually considered the drug of choice, however,
      frequent relapses occur at a rate of 10-40%. The purpose of this study is to address the use
      of a combined drug regimen treatment (Metronidazole and Rifampin) for the treatment of CDAD.
      These drugs used together have been successful. Objectives are to determine the time (days)
      to resolution of symptoms in each treatment arm; to measure clinical relapse rates; and to
      assess adverse reactions related to treatment.
