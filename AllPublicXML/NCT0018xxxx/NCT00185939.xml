    <textblock>
      This double blinded RCT will help to ascertain the usefulness of prophylactic antibiotics in
      the management of uncomplicated dog bites, utilizing currently best available antibiotics
      (Augmentin) and an important clinical outcome of infection.

      By enrolling 100-150 patients in this pilot trial as part of a k-award the investigators plan
      to utilize the point estimates of infection, side effects and other important outcomes and
      incorporate these into a cost most to determine the most cost effective management of these
      wounds and to determine if further study is warranted based on the findings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients including all children and English speaking/reading persons who present with a
        full thickness dog bite to participating emergency departments will be considered.
        Non-English speaking/reading subjects for whom we can provide translation for will also be
        considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  allergy to penicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid

          -  wounds presenting with an active infection (require antibiotics) or greater than 12
             hours old.

          -  patients with underlying fracture, joint or neurovascular injury, or multiple trauma
             requiring specialty referral. Specifically any broken skin over a joint will need
             treatment and be excluded from the study and randomization.

          -  patients on immunosuppressive agents, prolonged chronic steroid use (defined as
             continuous use for &gt; 14 days, 3 times a year) active HIV disease (determined by
             treating physician on history) or splenectomized. (could skew one group and at risk
             for overwhelming sepsis and death if infected)

          -  patients unwilling or unable to complete the required follow-up, and those unable to
             provide a contact phone number
