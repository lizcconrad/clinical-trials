    <textblock>
      St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is studying ways to make ultrasound images clearer - to
      be able to see blood vessels, body structures, and tumors better. Ultrasound uses sound waves
      to create pictures, allowing doctors and other medical professionals to &quot;see&quot; inside the
      body.

      Researchers are studying a contrast agent (like a dye) called Optison™. St. Jude Children's
      Research Hospital researchers want to learn the best and safest dose of this ultrasound
      &quot;dye.&quot;

    <description>Intervention description:
Based on recommendation by the FDA, we began with a dose of 0.125ml/m^2 and escalated at 0.15 ml/m^2 increments, to 0.275 ml/m^2 and 0.425ml/m^2 and 0.500ml/m^2. We will now continue to escalate the dose of Optison at 0.300ml/m^2 increments to a maximum single dose of 4ml or a total cumulative dose of 8.7 ml as recommended by the manufacturer.</description>
