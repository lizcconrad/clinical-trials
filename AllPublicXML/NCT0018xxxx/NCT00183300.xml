      This study will determine the effectiveness of immediate treatment with prolonged exposure
      therapy (PE) versus delaying treatment with PE in altering neuroendocrine-related symptoms of
      post-traumatic stress disorder in women.

    <textblock>
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can occur following
      exposure to a traumatic incident in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened.
      PTSD is marked by clear biological changes as well as psychological symptoms. Many people
      with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in the form of flashback episodes, memories,
      nightmares, or frightening thoughts. Chronic PTSD can also affect the neuroendocrine system
      by altering functionality of some chemicals in the brain, including cortisol and
      catecholamines (e.g., norepinephrine). This study will determine the effectiveness of
      immediate treatment with prolonged exposure therapy (PE) versus delaying treatment with PE in
      altering neuroendocrine-related symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in women.

      This single-blind study will randomly assign two thirds of participants to PE therapy
      immediately following a traumatic event and one third to a waitlist condition (WL), in which
      they will receive no treatment until a later date. Participants assigned to receive PE will
      do so once weekly for 10 weeks. Participants assigned to the WL condition will receive no
      treatment for 10 weeks, and then will begin PE therapy once weekly for an additional 10
      weeks. Study visits will occur at baseline, Week 10, and 6 months post-treatment for those in
      both conditions, with additional visits 10 weeks and 6 months post-PE therapy for those in
      the WL condition. Psychological measurements to be assessed at these visits will include PTSD
      symptoms, anxiety, depression, and PTSD-related cognitions. Physical assessments will include
      urine and saliva tests, as well as a dexamethasone-suppression test. Participants in the PE
      condition will also provide saliva samples at points throughout the study to monitor changes
      in cortisol and catecholamines.
