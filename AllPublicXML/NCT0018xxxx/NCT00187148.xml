  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine EnvDNA in healthy
      adults. DNA-based vaccines are being studied for the prevention of human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV), malaria and hepatitis. DNA vaccines have been well tolerated in human studies to
      date. The vaccine that will be tested in this study was made from the information that the
      virus uses to make a small part of the HIV. This small part is called the envelope or coating
      around the virus. We hope the body will make an immune response against the HIV envelope
      coat. Our potential HIV DNA envelope vaccine is called EnvDNA.

      This is a research (investigational) study to find out about the safety of a new potential
      vaccine for HIV. This potential vaccine may eventually become a part of a sequence of three
      experimental vaccines that will be studied to see if they can help to protect people from
      HIV. HIV infection is the cause of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). AIDS is one of
      the most serious viral infections we know. This study is being done to help us find an HIV
      vaccine that works.

      The vaccine that will be tested in this study was made from the information that the virus
      uses to make a small part of the HIV. This small part is called the envelope or coating
      around the virus. Because only the information for this one part of the virus is used in the
      vaccine, the vaccine cannot cause HIV infection. We make the vaccine in a test tube. The
      vaccine is made up of DNA. DNA is like an instruction manual that cells use to make basic
      building blocks called proteins. This DNA has the information that cells will use to make the
      envelope coat of HIV. Once the DNA is injected intramuscularly, it should tell cells to make
      the envelope protein. We hope the body will make an immune response against the HIV envelope
      coat. Our potential HIV DNA envelope vaccine is called EnvDNA.

          -  Normal history and physical exam

          -  Normal complete blood count and differential obtained within 60 days prior to
             immunization, and defined as:

               -  hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12.0 gm/dl for females and greater than or
