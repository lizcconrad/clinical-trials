  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypopituitary adults with all the hormonal deficiencies are well subsituted excepted for the
      growth hormone (GH) and died earlier than the rest of the population. GH deficiency involves
      a fat mass increase with regard to lean mass, an atherogenic lipidic profile and
      participating to osteopenia mechanism and decrease the life quality. All these dysfunctions
      are partially or totally corrected by the GH prescription with patient deficient since
      adulthood.

      However, for patients deficient since childhood, no study have demonstrated that GH treatment
      during childhood present these same benefit when they are treated during adulthood.

      Primary objective of this study is to examine that fat mass significantly decrease due to GH
      treatment in adulthood for patient GH deficient since childhood, treated by GH during
      childhood but stopped since the end of adolescence.

      We compare the body composition and others energetic metabolism parameters in two patient
      groups, one treated by GH during 18 months, and the other with no treatment. Body composition
      and bone density are measured by pletysmography (DEXA). Metabolic parameters are : energetic
      balance (energy intake evaluation by questionnaire, energetic expenditure evaluated by doubly
      labelled water) and biologic parameters (lipidic profile, thyroid hormones).

      This study will evaluate if the GH treatment of young GH deficient adults since childhood can
      be a benefit for body composition, lipidic profile and bone density.
