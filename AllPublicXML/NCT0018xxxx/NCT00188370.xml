  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A group of researchers at the Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital have
      discovered that a very specific form of cell death 'apoptosis' can be detected using
      high-frequency ultrasound imaging. This type of cell death is recognized to occur in tumours
      in response to various different chemotherapeutic drugs and in response to radiation therapy.
      This group of researchers has confirmed that high-frequency ultrasound can detect apoptosis
      in response to tumour treatments experimentally using cell culture and experimental animal
      systems. The ultrasound approach is now being evaluated clinically in a 3-year clinical trial
      enrolling a target of 200 patients including Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's disease
      lymphoma patients, melanoma patients and patients with basal cell carcinoma. Our hope is to
      be able to use this type of imaging system in the future to clinically monitor the effects of
      therapy on tumours and rapidly detect tumours which are not responding so that changes in
      therapy can be made much quicker than presently possible.
