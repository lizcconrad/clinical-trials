  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Concerta in the
      treatment of children (ages 5 to 17 years old) and adults (ages 18 to 55 years old) with
      Bipolar I, Bipolar II and Bipolar Spectrum Disorder and comorbid ADHD over 8 weeks. This
      study seeks to study the short-term effectiveness of a long acting formulation of
      methylphenidate (Concerta) in the treatment of children and adults with bipolar disorder and
      comorbid ADHD adequately stabilized on an acceptable and stable regimen of anti-mania agents.

    <textblock>
      A leading source of difficulty in treating youth with Bipolar Disorder is its comorbidity
      with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Systematic studies of children and
      adolescents show that rates of ADHD range from 60% to 90% in pediatric study participants
      with mania. These findings could not be accounted for by the overlapping symptoms of
      distractibility, talkativeness, and physical hyperactivity, suggesting that affected children
      may suffer from both disorders, which was also consistent with findings of familial
      co-transmission of these two conditions. Considering the well-documented morbidity and
      dysfunction associated with ADHD, a comprehensive treatment approach to the management of the
      bipolar child with comorbid ADHD requires the development of appropriate therapeutic
      strategies for the treatment ADHD symptoms.
