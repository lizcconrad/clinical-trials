  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a collaborative model of team care
      as compared to usual care in improving functional outcomes among community-dwelling
      low-income older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This collaborative model of care, Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders
      (GRACE), involves a geriatric nurse practitioner and a geriatric social worker caring for the
      vulnerable older adult in collaboration with the patient’s primary care physician to improve
      coordination and quality of care. The specific components of GRACE mirror those recommended
      in recent reviews: a) specific targeting of elders at risk; b) availability of collaborative
      expertise in geriatrics; c) integration of the program into primary care; d) coordination of
      care across all sites of care; e) integration of data systems that support physician’s
      practice and facilitate monitoring of pertinent clinical parameters; and f) institutionally
      endorsed clinical practice guidelines. To our knowledge, there are no prior studies
      investigating the effectiveness of such a comprehensive approach among vulnerable older
      adults.

      We are hypothesizing that, compared to usual care, patients enrolled in the intervention will
      have:

        1. greater independence in activities of daily living over 2 years of follow-up;

        2. better health status scores as assessed by the HEDIS® 2000 Health Outcomes Survey

        3. fewer nursing home days over 2 years of follow-up; and

        4. fewer hospitalizations over the 2 years of follow-up.
