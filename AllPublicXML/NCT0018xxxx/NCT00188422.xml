  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of this study is the detection of lung metastases comparing Low dose CT
      (LDCT) and Minimum dose CT (MnDCT) with CXR.

      Hypothesis

        1. LDCT and MnDCT have similar sensitivity for the detection of lung nodules (metastases).

        2. MnDCT of the thorax detects a larger number of nodules (metastases) than CXR.

      A 3-year prospective phase II non-randomized study commenced May 2003 enrolling 60 high-risk
      patients with Intermediate and High Grade STS. Each patient is kept under radiological
      surveillance for 3 years unless lung metastases are detected. Conventional thoracic imaging
      for staging and surveillance of STS patients is shown in Figure 1. In the trial, LDCT and
      MnDCT are added to each imaging visit (Figure 1). A 2-view CXR (CR) is performed (Direct
      View, Kodak, Rochester) followed by thoracic CT scans performed on a Siemens 16 row MDCT
      (Sensation 16, Siemens, Erlangen), CT acquisition; 120kVp, 5/2.5/2.5mm. Images are
      reconstructed with high and low spatial frequency filters and soft copy viewing is performed
      on a standalone PACS workstation using standard mediastinal (w 350, l 40) and lung (w 1500, l
      -600) settings. Examinations are performed with varying mAs; SDCT 120 mAs, LDCT 40 mAs and
      MnDCT 20 mAs. The examinations are evaluated, blinded to the results of the alternative and
      previous studies, for the presence of nodules (defined as a non-calcified focal opacity â‰¥3 mm
      &lt; 3 cm). Surveillance imaging is commenced 3 months post surgery.
