  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to suggest that red blood cell concentrate (RBC) transfusion may have
      immunomodulatory effects. The aim of this randomized single-center trial is to compare immune
      responses in patients undergoing cancer surgery and given either an unmodified RBC (UN-RBC)
      or a leuko-reduced RBC (LR-RBC) transfusion perioperatively.

      This single-center study is conducted to compare the effect of peroperative transfusion of
      allogeneic unmodified RBC (UN-RBC) versus leuko-reduced RBC (RED-RBC) on recipient immunity.
      Patients undergoing cancer surgery are randomly assigned peroperatively to receive UN-RBC or
      RED-RBC. Groups are stratified for age, sex, tumor characteristics, prior transfusion and
      prior cancer treatment. Blood sampless are collected before anesthesia (d0) and at days 3, 7,
      14 , 28 after transfusion/surgery and analyzed for complete cell blood count, lymphocyte
      subsets, cytokine production (IL4, IL10, IFNgamma, IL12), T-cells repertoire (TCR) analysis
      and detection of circulating donor cells. Main study endpoint is the influence of the
      treatment arm on IL4/IFNgamma ratio. The effect of transfusion type on any given biological
      parameters is also tested (peripheral blood mononuclear cell phenotyping (PBMC), cytokine
      production by stimulated PBMC, T cell repertoire analysis and microchimerism assessment).
