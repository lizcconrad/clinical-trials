  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of induced sputum cell counts
      could guide treatment of asthma more effectively than the use of symptoms and breathing
      tests. The main outcomes where the time to the first exacerbation and the number of
      exacerbations.

    <textblock>
      Airway inflammation is an important component of asthma. It influences other components which
      include symptoms and airway functional (physiological) measurements. It is the primary target
      of treatment. However, it does not correlate closely with symptoms, need for symptomatic
      bronchodilator relief, or the physiological abnormalities. Furthermore, it can be of
      different types. As a result, physicians are poor at recognizing its presence or type. This
      is important because eosinophilic inflammation is responsive to corticosteroid while
      non-eosinophilic is not responsive.

      The most comprehensive non-invasive or relatively non-invasive measurement of airway
      inflammation is by spontaneous or induced sputum cell counts. These are reliable, valid and
      responsive, the qualities of good measurements. They might therefore be clinically useful to
      guide individual treatment. In the present study we investigated this issue. We compared
      their use, in comparison with the use only of symptoms and spirometry, in preventing
      exacerbations of asthma. We chose prevention of exacerbations as the most important clinical
      outcome because these have the greatest impact on patientâ€™s quality of life, morbidity and
      healthcare utilization. The study comprised two Phases. In Phase 1, the minimum treatment to
      control sputum eosinophilia (as well as clinical criteria) in the Sputum Strategy, and
      clinical criteria in the Clinical Strategy, were established. In Phase 2, this minimum
      treatment was maintained and patients were seen every 3 momths and at exacerbations. The
      primary outcomes were the relative risk reduction for the occurrence of the first
      exacerbation and the length of time without exacerbation over 18-20 months in Phase 2 of the
      study.
