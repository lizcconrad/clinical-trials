  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma is a childhood cancer which affects the retina of the eye. The retina is the
      light sensitive layer of tissue that lines the back of the eyeball; sends visual messages
      through the optic nerve to the brain. When only one eye is affected, this is known as
      unilateral retinoblastoma and when both eyes are affected, it is called bilateral
      retinoblastoma. Treatment for retinoblastoma is individualized for each patient and is based
      on the form and the stage of the disease (inside the eye or has moved outside). The main goal
      is always to cure the cancer, and save the life of the child. Treatments are also designed
      with the hope of saving the vision, while completely destroying the tumor. Therapies may
      involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and other treatments called focal treatments. Focal
      treatments may be laser therapy, freezing, or heat treatments meant to shrink and kill the
      tumor.

      In this study, researchers want to investigate how different participants respond to
      different therapies that are individualized specifically for them. Participants will be
      divided into three main groups, depending on whether the disease is unilateral or bilateral,
      and the stage of the disease. One of the main objectives of the study is to investigate how
      advanced tumors in children with bilateral disease respond to a new combination of
      chemotherapy with topotecan and vincristine, with G-CSF support. In order to improve results,
      some children with very advanced disease may receive carboplatin chemotherapy given around
      the eye at the same time that they receive topotecan by vein. Also, because children with
      retinoblastoma are diagnosed so early in life and the vision may be significantly impaired,
      this study will investigate how children develop and how the brain adjusts and compensates
      for the visual deficits. Finally, this study also investigates the biology of retinoblastoma,
      in order to understand better how this cancer develops.

    <time_frame>Six weeks post window therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is to estimate the proportion of stratum B patients responding to 2 courses of window therapy consisting of vincristine and topotecan. Complete Response is the complete regression of all apparent tumor masses in the funduscopic examination and by MRI and ultrasound (US). Partial Response is defined as greater than 50% (but less than 100%) reduction of the tumor masses in the funduscopic examination and by US and MRI, without the appearance of any new lesions. The response must persist for at least 4 weeks. Stratum A and C did not receive window therapy.</description>

    <description>To describe the 5-year event-free survival of the eyes outcome of intraocular retinoblastoma with respect to the new International Classification (IC) for Intraocular Retinoblastoma and the AJCC.
Patients were re-classified into 2 groups of early (IC groups A and B) and advanced (IC groups C, D, and E) retinoblastoma. Analysis was done at eye level since each eye in the same patient could be a different group. Patients from stratum A and B were analyzed separately.
Three eyes (2 patients) in stratum B received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and were also coincident with enucleation surgery, so their event status was not changed. Although the 3 eyes had shorter EFS interval because EBRT occurred (less than 2 years) before the surgery, it did not change the 5-year survival probability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (at study entry) and at ages 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Early Learning Composite was assessed with Mullen Scales of Early Learning, a measure of developmental functioning appropriate for use with children from birth through age 5. It is an examiner-administered instrument that uses toys, games, pictures, and other objects to elicit information about a child's language, fine and gross motor skills, and overall early learning capabilities. Raw scores are converted to an age-normed standard score (normative mean = 100, SD = 15) for the overall Early Learning Composite. This measure was given at all time points. Higher scores are indicative of better functioning, with scores from 85-115 in the average range.</description>

    <measure>Change in Relevant Daily Living Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (at study entry), 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Adaptive Behavior composite was measured using the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior (VABS) which is an examiner-administered semi-structured interview that assesses adaptive functioning from birth through adulthood. Subscales including motor skills, communication, socialization, and daily living skills combine into an overall adaptive behavior composite which is an age-normed standard score (normative mean = 100, SD = 15). This measure was given at all time points. Higher scores are indicative of better functioning, with scores from 85-115 in the average range.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parent Report of Social-Emotional Factors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (at study entry), 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome was measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire which is a parent-completed measure of a child's social-emotional functioning. Raw scores are calculated and compared to cut-off points by age (6 months = 45; 1 year = 48; 2 years = 50; 3 years = 59; 5 years =70). Higher scores are indicative of more problems with scores above the cut-off indicating significant concerns warranting additional follow-up. Possible scores range from 0 to 200+, depending on the number of items administered, which varies by the age of the child (19 to 33 items). However, the primary use of this tool is as a screener. Thus, typically, scores are interpreted as they compare to the identified cut-offs, with children who score above the cut-off referred for further evaluation. This measure was given at all time points.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parenting Stress Index (PSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (at study entry), 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI is a commonly used measure of parenting stress. In 101 questions, the PSI delineates between stress as a function of child characteristics (e.g., adaptability, demandingness, mood; Child Domain) and stress as a function of parent characteristics (e.g., depression, sense of competence, social isolation; Parent Domain), as well as an overall stress score (Total Stress). Raw scores are calculated (normative means: Child Doman = 98.4; Parent Domain = 122.7; Total Stress Score = 221.1). This measure was given at all time points. Scores range from 131-320 for Total Stress, 69-188 for Parent Domain, and 50-145 for Child Domain, with higher scores indicative of greater stress (Total: &gt;260; Parent: &gt;153, Child: &gt;122).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of School Readiness</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients were assessed at 5 years of age</time_frame>
    <description>The Bracken Basic Concepts Scale was used to assess school readiness. It is an examiner-administered measure that assesses per-academic skills including letter and number recognition, shapes, colors, and understanding of sizes and comparisons. Raw scores are converted into age-normed scaled scores (normative mean = 10, SD = 3) for the School Readiness Composite. Higher scores are indicative of stronger pre-academic skills, with scores from 7 to 13 within the Average range.</description>

    <measure>Change in Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Diagnosis through 5 years after completion of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>For DP_amplitude to be considered valid, a baseline DP_SNR (Distortion Product for Signal-to-noise ratio) for each frequency (1000-8000 Hz) and for each ear (left and right) must be = 6 dB. Any ear with invalid amplitude at baseline for each frequency should be excluded. The DPOAEs amplitude levels were averaged across the right and left ears at each frequency in the patients exhibiting valid DPOAE amplitudes in both ears, resulting in mean DPOAE levels. Subsequently, comparisons between baseline and most recent evaluation (collapsed across ears) for each frequency were made to evaluate if a significant decrease in DPOAE amplitude exists between the two time points.</description>

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) was used to investigate primary visual cortex (V1) response to visual stimulation in 105 children being treated for intraocular retinoblastoma. Primary visual cortex activity was assessed in each subject using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. The BOLD signal was analyzed via a general linear model using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM, Wellcome Institute of Neuology, London).
Voxel volume/peak BOLD response is a measurement of the volume of activation of the cortex. There is no known association with visual outcome at this time.</description>

Complete Response is the complete regression of all apparent tumor masses in the funduscopic examination and by MRI and ultrasound (US). Partial Response is defined as greater than 50% (but less than 100%) reduction of the tumor masses in the funduscopic examination and by US and MRI, without the appearance of any new lesions. The response must persist for at least 4 weeks. Stratum A and C did not receive window therapy.</description>

        <description>To estimate the 5-year event-free (EFS) survival of bilateral disease patients with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma in either eye (R-E IV-V) responding to the vincristine/topotecan window, with alternating cycles of vincristine and carboplatin with vincristine, topotecan, and periocular carboplatin, with intensive focal treatments.
Event-free survival will be defined per patient as follows: for patients with one advanced stage eye, the time interval from date on study to date of first event (an event includes external beam radiation or enucleation) of advanced stage eyes, time to first event will be used for the analysis. Event-free survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier.</description>

Ocular survival will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier.</description>

        <title>Event-free Survival of Eyes in Stratum A and Stratum B Patients Based on IC Classification</title>
        <description>To describe the 5-year event-free survival of the eyes outcome of intraocular retinoblastoma with respect to the new International Classification (IC) for Intraocular Retinoblastoma and the AJCC.
Patients were re-classified into 2 groups of early (IC groups A and B) and advanced (IC groups C, D, and E) retinoblastoma. Analysis was done at eye level since each eye in the same patient could be a different group. Patients from stratum A and B were analyzed separately.
Three eyes (2 patients) in stratum B received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and were also coincident with enucleation surgery, so their event status was not changed. Although the 3 eyes had shorter EFS interval because EBRT occurred (less than 2 years) before the surgery, it did not change the 5-year survival probability.</description>

        <population>For the 23 stratum A patients, 35 eyes (12 bilateral patients, 11 unilateral patients) with IC grouping were analyzed. For 26 Stratum B patients, 1 eye with up-front surgery was excluded from analysis. 51 eyes with IC grouping were analyzed. Participants with bilateral disease may have one eye in each category.</population>

        <title>Ocular Survival Per Eye in Stratum A and Stratum B Patients Based on AJCC Classification</title>
        <description>To describe the 5-year ocular survival of eyes outcome of intraocular retinoblastoma with respect to the new classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).
For AJCC staging, the patients were classified into 2 groups of early (AJCC=1, 1a or 1b) and advanced (AJCC=2, 2a, 2b, 3, 3a, 3b) retinoblastoma . The analysis was done at eye level since each eye in the same patient could be a different group. Patients from stratum A and B were analyzed separately</description>
        <time_frame>From date on-study to an event or last follow-up</time_frame>
        <population>For the 23 stratum A patients, 35 eyes (12 bilateral patients, 11 unilateral patients) with IC grouping were analyzed. For 26 Stratum B patients, 1 eye with up-front surgery was excluded from analysis. Participants with bilateral disease may have one eye in each category.</population>

        <description>The Early Learning Composite was assessed with Mullen Scales of Early Learning, a measure of developmental functioning appropriate for use with children from birth through age 5. It is an examiner-administered instrument that uses toys, games, pictures, and other objects to elicit information about a child's language, fine and gross motor skills, and overall early learning capabilities. Raw scores are converted to an age-normed standard score (normative mean = 100, SD = 15) for the overall Early Learning Composite. This measure was given at all time points. Higher scores are indicative of better functioning, with scores from 85-115 in the average range.</description>

        <title>Change in Parent Report of Social-Emotional Factors</title>
        <description>This outcome was measured using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire which is a parent-completed measure of a child's social-emotional functioning. Raw scores are calculated and compared to cut-off points by age (6 months = 45; 1 year = 48; 2 years = 50; 3 years = 59; 5 years =70). Higher scores are indicative of more problems with scores above the cut-off indicating significant concerns warranting additional follow-up. Possible scores range from 0 to 200+, depending on the number of items administered, which varies by the age of the child (19 to 33 items). However, the primary use of this tool is as a screener. Thus, typically, scores are interpreted as they compare to the identified cut-offs, with children who score above the cut-off referred for further evaluation. This measure was given at all time points.</description>

Higher scores are indicative of more problems with scores above the cut-off indicating significant concerns warranting additional follow-up. Possible scores range from 0 to 200+, depending on the number of items administered, which varies by the age of the child (19 to 33 items). However, the primary use of this tool is as a screener. Thus, typically, scores are interpreted as they compare to the identified cut-offs, with children who score above the cut-off referred for further evaluation. This measure was given at all time points.</description>
          <population>Data was collected from 94 unique patients. All patients were included, regardless of treatment strata. If the patient age at study entry (baseline) was within the window of an identified time point, their information was included with that time point.</population>

        <title>Change in Parenting Stress Index (PSI)</title>
        <description>The PSI is a commonly used measure of parenting stress. In 101 questions, the PSI delineates between stress as a function of child characteristics (e.g., adaptability, demandingness, mood; Child Domain) and stress as a function of parent characteristics (e.g., depression, sense of competence, social isolation; Parent Domain), as well as an overall stress score (Total Stress). Raw scores are calculated (normative means: Child Doman = 98.4; Parent Domain = 122.7; Total Stress Score = 221.1). This measure was given at all time points. Scores range from 131-320 for Total Stress, 69-188 for Parent Domain, and 50-145 for Child Domain, with higher scores indicative of greater stress (Total: &gt;260; Parent: &gt;153, Child: &gt;122).</description>

        <title>Assessment of School Readiness</title>
        <description>The Bracken Basic Concepts Scale was used to assess school readiness. It is an examiner-administered measure that assesses per-academic skills including letter and number recognition, shapes, colors, and understanding of sizes and comparisons. Raw scores are converted into age-normed scaled scores (normative mean = 10, SD = 3) for the School Readiness Composite. Higher scores are indicative of stronger pre-academic skills, with scores from 7 to 13 within the Average range.</description>

        <title>Change in Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs)</title>
        <description>For DP_amplitude to be considered valid, a baseline DP_SNR (Distortion Product for Signal-to-noise ratio) for each frequency (1000-8000 Hz) and for each ear (left and right) must be = 6 dB. Any ear with invalid amplitude at baseline for each frequency should be excluded. The DPOAEs amplitude levels were averaged across the right and left ears at each frequency in the patients exhibiting valid DPOAE amplitudes in both ears, resulting in mean DPOAE levels. Subsequently, comparisons between baseline and most recent evaluation (collapsed across ears) for each frequency were made to evaluate if a significant decrease in DPOAE amplitude exists between the two time points.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients Recommended for and Utilizing Rehabilitation Services</title>
        <description>Participants were evaluated by Occupational Therapy at diagnosis, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from diagnosis with a battery of standardized and non-standardized measures. Assessments including the Battelle Developmental Inventory, the Sensory Profile, the Oregon Project for Visually Impaired Preschoolers, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, and the Greenspan Social Emotional Growth Scale were utilized for developing the participants plan of care and making referrals for services in the home community. Recommendations for rehabilitation services in the home community were made based on the results of the occupational therapists evaluation.
A subsequent review of February 2013 subgroup definitions resulted in the reclassification of evaluable participants and subgroups in May 2015. This reclassification applies to the data for this outcome only.</description>

        <population>Objective was added after the protocol started. Due to the late start, 33 of the 105 overall participants were eligible. Of the 33, 1 family declined to participate; 1 was removed from the protocol, 5 were lost to follow-up, and 4 patients were unable to complete the developmental assessment. In total, 22 have complete data sets.</population>

          <description>Participants were evaluated by Occupational Therapy at diagnosis, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from diagnosis with a battery of standardized and non-standardized measures. Assessments including the Battelle Developmental Inventory, the Sensory Profile, the Oregon Project for Visually Impaired Preschoolers, Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, and the Greenspan Social Emotional Growth Scale were utilized for developing the participants plan of care and making referrals for services in the home community. Recommendations for rehabilitation services in the home community were made based on the results of the occupational therapists evaluation.
A subsequent review of February 2013 subgroup definitions resulted in the reclassification of evaluable participants and subgroups in May 2015. This reclassification applies to the data for this outcome only.</description>
          <population>Objective was added after the protocol started. Due to the late start, 33 of the 105 overall participants were eligible. Of the 33, 1 family declined to participate; 1 was removed from the protocol, 5 were lost to follow-up, and 4 patients were unable to complete the developmental assessment. In total, 22 have complete data sets.</population>

        <title>Mean Primary Visual Cortex Function: Maximum T-value</title>
        <description>Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) was used to investigate primary visual cortex (V1) response to visual stimulation in 105 children being treated for intraocular retinoblastoma. Primary visual cortex activity was assessed in each subject using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. The BOLD signal was analyzed via a general linear model using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM, Wellcome Institute of Neurology, London). The maximum t-statistic in activated cluster (negative BOLD) is provided.
Voxel volume/peak BOLD response is a measurement of the volume of activation of the cortex. There is no known association with visual outcome at this time.</description>
