        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients indicated for dual chamber pulse generator implant, where the pulse generator
             is capable of meeting the requirements of this investigational protocol

          -  Patients selected must have the study lead as the initial implant of a permanent
             pacing lead in both the right atrium and the right ventricle

          -  Age 18 or above, or of legal age to give informed consent specific to state and
             national law

          -  Willing and capable of undergoing a device implant and participating in all testing
             associated with this clinical investigation

          -  Available for follow-up at an approved clinical investigational center, at the
             protocol-defined intervals

          -  A life expectancy of more than 180 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have or who are likely to receive a mechanical tricuspid valve during the course of
             the clinical investigation

          -  Have surgically uncorrected primary valvular heart disease

          -  Have an atrial tachyarrhythmia that is permanent (i.e., does not terminate
             spontaneously and cannot be terminated with medical intervention) or persistent (i.e.,
             can be terminated with medical intervention, but does not terminate spontaneously)

          -  Requiring ICD therapy

          -  Have a hypersensitivity to a nominal single dose of 1.0 mg (0.5 mg per electrode) of
             dexamethasone acetate drug

          -  Enrolled in any concurrent study, including drug investigation, without Guidant
             written approval, that may confound the results of this study

          -  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant
