  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks to describe the pharmacokinetics of curcumin delivered as a single oral dose
      in healthy female volunteers. The impact of piperine and silybin on the pharmacokinetics of
      curcumin is also studied.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers are seen on three separate visits and receive 4 gm of curcumin as a single
      oral dose either alone or with piperine or with silybin. Serial timed blood draws then are
      collected for pharmacokinetic analysis.
