      RATIONALE: American ginseng may help relieve cancer-related fatigue.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well American ginseng works in treating patients
      with cancer-related fatigue.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of American ginseng, administered at 3 different doses, vs placebo
           in patients with cancer-related fatigue.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects and tolerability of American ginseng in these patients.

        -  Determine the impact of American ginseng on quality of life-related variables (e.g.,
           sleep, vitality, and quality of life domains) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to disease stage (I or II vs III or IV vs unknown), gender (male vs
      female), baseline fatigue score (4-7 vs 8-10), concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), and
      concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

    <description>Patients receive oral American ginseng twice daily for 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
After 8 weeks of treatment, patients in arms I-III may continue to receive American ginseng on the optional continuation portion of the study for an additional 8 weeks. Patients in arm IV may begin oral American ginseng twice daily for 8 weeks on the optional continuation portion of the study.
Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 weeks during treatment, and at the end of treatment.
PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients (70 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 35 months.</description>
