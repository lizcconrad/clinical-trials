  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1991, the South West Oncology Group (SWOG) conducted a randomized study of adjuvant
      chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and folinic acid) with concurrent radiation (4500 cGy/25
      fractions) versus surgery alone for patients with completely resected gastric carcinoma.

      This landmark study showed the benefit of adjuvant treatment for gastric cancer and radically
      changed the treatment of this disease. However, the resulting standard treatment has severe
      acute toxicity, and despite this advance, 50% of patients still die of gastric cancer. The
      investigators hope to develop a modified protocol using active chemotherapy agents, but with
      reduced acute toxicity. Such an approach could ultimately be studied against the current SWOG
      approach to determine whether or not the addition of cisplatinum improves efficacy.

      Patients who decide to participate in the study will receive a chemotherapy drug called
      5-Fluorouracil (5FU)through an intravenous catheter continuously over 12 weeks. Patients will
      not be admitted to hospital to receive the chemotherapy but will need to wear a waist pack to
      carry a small pump that will deliver the medication. They will however need to make regular
      visits to have their medication bags changed. Patients will also receive Cisplatin
      intravenously every 2 weeks for 4 doses. In addition, patients will also receive radiation to
      their stomach, lymph nodes, and the area where they had their surgery. This study also
      comprise of a questionnaire for us to see how patient's cancer and treatment is affecting
      their quality of life. Patients will have regular follow-up by their physicians.
