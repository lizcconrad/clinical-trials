  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trichotillomania (TTM) or hair-pulling has been considered as part of the obsessive
      compulsive disorder (OCD) spectrum, although treatment with OCD medications has largely been
      unsuccessful. Tics/Tourrettes’ Syndrome (TS) is a disorder, which appears to be related to
      TTM, but is treated with a different class of medications than used in OCD, namely
      antipsychotics such as olanzapine. This is a study of the safety and efficacy of olanzapine
      in the treatment of hair pulling.
