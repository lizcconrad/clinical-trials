  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse is associated with injury, chronic illness, absenteeism from work, and social
      costs to families and communities. The goal of this project is to translate motivational
      interventions successful in the primary care setting to the Emergency Department (ED)
      environment by implementing screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT)
      in order to reduce at-risk drinking among ED patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of SBIRT in the emergency room setting, ED patients meeting
      NIAAA criteria for high risk drinking were recruited from 14 sites nationwide (control
      group-Spring, 2004; intervention group-Summer, 2004). 26% of screened ED patients met
      inclusion criteria. All enrollees received a list of local referral resources. Intervention
      group patients also participated in a 15 minute negotiated interview and ED staff referred
      them directly for treatment if indicated. Enrollees completed 3-month follow-up surveys with
      a telephone Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. A total of 1137 patients were enrolled
      across 14 sites (561 intervention, 576 control), with 62% male, 37% Black, and 38% White, and
      a mean age of 37. At baseline intervention-i and control-c groups were similar in demographic
      characteristics and number of drinks on a typical day (mean-i 5.00, mean-c 5.12) and maximum
      drinks on a given day in the past month (mean-i 7.51, mean-c 7.33). The 3 month follow-up
      rate was 62% (n=687); the 6 month follow-up rate was 52% (n=567). The 12 month follow up is
      currently underway.
