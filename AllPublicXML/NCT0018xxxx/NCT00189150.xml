  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a clinically significant PK drug
      interaction ( a 30% difference in the AUC of MPA) exists between mycophenolate mofetil (under
      steady state conditions) and VGCV in renal and cardiac transplant recipients.

      This study will provide clinically relevant information to the transplant community. It will
      more clearly delineate whether a clinically significant PK drug interaction exists between
      mycophenolate mofetil (under steady-state conditions)and VGCV. Given the established
      dose/efficacy relationship of both MMF and VGCV, this study will provide improved dosing
      guidelines and potentially avoid adverse outcomes due to empiric dosage adjustments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycophenolate mofetil (immunosuppressant, MMF) and valganciclovir (antiviral, VGCV) are
      commonly administered together in transplant patients. Following oral administration, both
      MMF and VGCV are metabolized to active forms, mycophenolic acid (MPA) and gancoclovir (GCV)
      respectively. Both MPA and GCV are eliminated through kidney and renal excretion, but there
      is no data on how MPA pharmacokinetic parameters are affected by GCV at steady state
      condition. Both MPA and GCV can cause neutropenia and although unsubstantiated, some
      clinicians have observed an increased occurrence of neutropenia when these agents are used in
      combination. In the presence of neutropenia, practitioners are often challenged when making
      decisions regarding whether the dosage of one or both agents should be reduced. It would be
      useful to know whether the neutropenia is due to increased drug concentration or whether it
      is due to direct effects of these agents on the bone marrow.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subject must be able to give informed consent for the study. Stable renal or cardiac
        transplant patients age 18 years and older. Patients must not have had an acute rejection
        episode within the previous 30 days of the 1st PK study.

        Renal transplant patients with serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL and with change in serum
        creatinine &lt; 25% within the 2 weeks prior to the 1st PK study.

        Renal and cardiac transplant patients receiving VGCV for prophylaxis of CMV while
        concomitantly receiving MMF.

        organs).

        Patients who have their MMF doses adjusted either &lt; 1 week before the 1st scheduled PK
        study or anytime during the study period.
