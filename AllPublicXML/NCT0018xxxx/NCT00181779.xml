  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled study of Aripiprazole, testing its efficacy in the treatment of mania
      in children and adolescents with Bipolar I, Bipolar II and Bipolar Spectrum Disorder over 8
      weeks. This is an exploratory, pilot study, seeking to determine whether Aripiprazole is
      efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of youth with pediatric bipolar and bipolar
      spectrum disorder. The study results will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger
      randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical
      power.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial clinical evidence suggests that atypical neuroleptics may play a unique therapeutic
      role in the management of pediatric bipolar disorder. Aripiprazole is a novel neuroleptic
      recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia, and it has a unique
      pharmacological profile believed to be fundamentally different from other available
      antipsychotics. Many previous studies have reported increased efficacy of Aripiprazole
      compared to placebo. Unfortunately, Aripiprazole has not been investigated in children and
      adolescents, and as such, safety and efficacy has not been established for these populations.

      This is an exploratory, pilot study, seeking to determine whether Aripiprazole is efficacious
      and well tolerated in the treatment of youth with pediatric bipolar and bipolar spectrum
      disorder. The study results, gathered from an 8 week open-label treatment period and
      subsequent 10 month extension period, will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger
      randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical
      power.

             intelligently with the investigator and study coordinator, and to cooperate with all
             tests and examinations required by the protocol.

          3. Patients and their legal representative must be considered reliable.

          4. Each patient and his/her authorized legal representative must understand the nature of
             the study. The patient's authorized legal representative must sign an informed consent
             document and the patient must sign an informed assent document.

          5. Patient must have a diagnosis of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder and currently

             structured diagnostic interview (Kidd Schedule of Affective Disorders). Eligible will
             also be children with bipolar spectrum disorder (or sub-threshold bipolar disorder)
             operationalized as having severe mood disturbance, which meets DSM-IV Criteria A for
             bipolar disorder but meet fewer elements in criteria B (only require 2 items for
             elation category and 3 for irritability).

          6. Patients must have an initial score on the Y-MRS total score of at least 15.

          7. Patient must be able to participate in mandatory blood draws.

          8. Patient must be able to swallow pills.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          8. Judged clinically to be at serious suicidal risk.

          9. Any other concomitant medication with primarily central nervous system activity other
             than specified in Concomitant Medication portion of the protocol.

         10. History of intolerance or a non-responder to Aripiprazole as determined by the
             clinician.

         11. Treatment with nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 2 weeks prior to
             Visit 2.
