  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether providing personalized diabetes self-management
      recommendations and feedback improves blood sugar control more than providing generalized
      diabetes educational material alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common chronic disease that is rapidly rising in prevalence,
      affecting upwards of 35,000 adults in the Hamilton, Ontario region (population 400,000). The
      magnitude and growth of the problem and its serious health consequences suggest that:

        1. diabetes is now a major public health problem; and

        2. interventions at the community level are needed to mitigate its health impact.

      During the last 5 years, Diabetes Hamilton was successfully piloted as a free community-based
      program available to anyone with diabetes. It promotes diabetes self-management,
      self-efficacy and awareness through the provision of generalized diabetes information (e.g.
      newsletters, workshops, forums, resource directories) to consumers, local physicians and
      other health professionals.

      This trial will determine if supplementing Diabetes Hamilton with an automated tailored
      feedback system that:

        1. provides information;

        2. generates and communicates specific evidence-based recommendations to users from a
           self-administered questionnaire;

        3. copies this communication to the patient's designated physician;

        4. facilitates access to community resources; and

        5. provides a simple way for the patient to track changes in indicators of health can
           improve A1c and other diabetes care indicators more than Diabetes Hamilton alone.
