      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of combining cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      and antidepressants in reducing HIV risk behavior and drug relapse rates in depressed
      intravenous drug users.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common among injection drug users (IDUs); it is estimated that up to 50% of
      IDUs meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, a severe form of depression.
      The combination of drug abuse and depression increases the likelihood of engaging in HIV
      high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex and the use of unhygienic needles to inject
      drugs. Research has shown that IDUs who receive treatment for depression have lower rates of
      drug relapse and are less likely to engage in high-risk sexual behavior compared to IDUs who
      have not received treatment for depression. Combination treatment, which includes cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication, has been shown to be the most
      effective treatment for depression. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of combination
      treatment in reducing HIV risk behaviors and drug relapse rates in cocaine or opiate addicted
      IDUs with a diagnosis of depression.

      In this 9-month study, participants will be randomly assigned to either a combination
      treatment group or an assessment only group that will receive no treatment. Participants
      assigned to combination treatment will receive the antidepressant Celexa, and will attend 8
      CBT sessions and 7 psychopharmacology sessions. Each CBT session will last about 60 minutes
      and each psychopharmacology session will last about 15 minutes. If a participant does not
      respond well to Celexa, Wellbutrin or Effexor may be taken instead. Participants in both
      groups will attend 4 study visits during which they will complete standardized psychological
      questionnaires and interviews to assess depression levels, drug use, and high-risk sexual
      behaviors. Blood will be drawn at baseline and Month 9 for HIV testing.
