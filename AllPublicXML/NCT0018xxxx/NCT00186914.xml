      Osteodysplasia or poorly formed bones, &quot;brittle bones&quot; is a genetic disease with no known
      proven treatments. Some forms of osteodysplasia may cause severe disability and even death.

      Eligible patients were limited to those children with Osteodysplasia who had undergone a
      previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant at St. Jude. The study intervention involved an
      infusion of a specified number of ex vivo expanded stromal cells obtained from the bone
      marrow of the same donor from whom they received their primary transplant procedure. These
      bone marrow stromal cells can become bone-forming cells, called osteoblasts. Participants
      then received 2 infusions of ex vivo expanded, gene marked cells not less than 6 months after
      bone marrow transplantation. The second cell infusion occurred between 14 to 21 days after
      the first infusion in the absence of toxicity. The goal of the study was to evaluate the
      safety and toxicity of these infusions.

      -  To determine whether these ex vivo expanded, gene marked marrow stromal cells will
           engraft in the recipient's bone, bone marrow, and/or skin.

        -  To begin to investigate whether high proliferative mesenchymal progenitor cells can be
           expanded ex vivo and retain their progenitor potential in vivo.

        -  To begin to investigate whether ex vivo expanded bone marrow stromal cells can
           ameliorate the skeletal dysplasias associated with various genetic disorders.

    <description>This is a pilot study of infusions of ex vivo expanded, gene marked donor bone marrow stromal cells following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The study is a within patient dose escalation safety evaluation. It is believed that this patient population may benefit from these donor stromal cell infusions.
As the stromal cells will be obtained from the original stem cell donor, no conditioning is required.
Patients will receive two infusions of mesenchymal cells (MSC) approximately 14 to 21 days apart unless there is unacceptable toxicity after the first infusion. The first dose of cells to be given will be 1x10^6 MSC/kg and the second dose of cells will be 5x10^6 MSC/kg. The patients will be followed for approximately 28 days following the second infusion for any toxicity. Only after all six patients have safely completed both infusions will we consider 5 x 10^6 MSC/kg a safe dose of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells for infusion.</description>
