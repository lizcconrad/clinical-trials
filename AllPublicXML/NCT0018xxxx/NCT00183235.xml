  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aripiprazole (marketed dopamine stabilizer)
      is effective in reducing of alcohol craving compared to placebo.

      Non-treatment seeking individuals meeting criteria for alcohol dependence (N=30) will be
      recruited through advertisement and paid for their participation. Alcoholics, after baseline
      evaluation, will be assigned through urn randomization to one of two experimental groups in
      which they will receive either aripiprazole (up to 15 mg/day) or an identical placebo.
      Subjects will take the study drug or placebo for 8 days (day 1-6 being the natural
      observation period). After a minimum of 24 hours of abstinence from alcohol (day 7-8) they
      will undergo an alcohol administration (priming dose) and motivated free choice drinking
      procedure (on day 8). Alcoholic subjects will receive a brief counseling session at the end
      of the study to enhance their awareness of problem drinking and to motivate them to seek
      treatment. Referral for treatment will be offered.

      Each subject will undergo a functional MRI brain scan with cue stimulation on day 7, on the
      evening before the alcohol administration paradigm. fMRI brain imaging technology will be
      used to determine if alcoholics treated with aripiprazole differ in alcohol cue-induced
      activity in the nucleus accumbens. It is hypothesized that aripiprazole will reduce nucleus
      accumbens activation to alcohol cues compared to placebo.
