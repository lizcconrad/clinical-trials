      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation
      during surgery may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works in treating older
      women who are undergoing surgery for invasive breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of intraoperative partial breast radiotherapy prior to
           surgical resection in older women with low-risk early stage primary invasive ductal
           carcinoma of the breast. Feasibility will be determined by the rate of good/excellent
           cosmesis, as measured by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) cosmetic rating
           scale, in patients treated with this regimen compared with that of patients treated with
           partial breast brachytherapy in clinical trial RTOG-9517.

        -  Determine the incidence of grade 3-4 toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of ipsilateral breast recurrence, including recurrence within the
           tumor bed as compared to elsewhere in the breast, in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the radiation-induced activation of receptors and signal transduction pathways
           involved in radiation response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

      Patients undergo intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy OR standard
      level I, II axillary dissection to evaluate the lymph nodes followed by intraoperative breast
      ultrasonography to define the tumor target volume. Patients then undergo intraoperative
      single-dose partial breast radiotherapy followed by segmental mastectomy (i.e., lumpectomy)
      of the tumor. Patients with 1 or 2 tumor-involved surgical margins may undergo repeat
      segmental mastectomy. Patients with &gt; 2 tumor-involved surgical margins undergo mastectomy.
      Patients determined to have a tumor size &gt; 3 cm or an extensive intraductal component on
      final pathology evaluation undergo standard external beam radiotherapy after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 to 3 years.

    <description>Rates of good/excellent cosmesis was evaluated using the following criteria:
Excellent - when compared to the untreated breast, there is minimal or no difference in the size, shape, or texture of the treated breast. There may be mild thickening or scar tissue within the breast or skin, but not enough to change the appearance.
Good - there is mild asymmetry in the size or shape of the treated breast as compared to the normal breast. The thickening or scar tissue within the breast causes only a mild change in the shape.</description>

    <description>Skin and subcutaneous toxicity were graded by a radiation oncologist according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events version 3.0.

          <title>Clinical Staging</title>
          <description>The TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours (TNM) is a cancer staging notation system that describes the stage of a cancer which originates from a solid tumor with alphanumeric codes. Higher numbers mean the cancer is more advanced.
T describes the size of the original (primary) tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N describes nearby (regional) lymph nodes that are involved, M describes distant metastasis (spread of cancer from one part of the body to another).</description>

          <title>Grade</title>
          <description>Tumor grade is the description of a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells and the tumor tissue look under a microscope. It is an indicator of how quickly a tumor is likely to grow and spread. The grading system is as follows: grade I â€“ cancer cells that resemble normal cells and aren't growing rapidly. grade II â€“ cancer cells that don't look like normal cells and are growing faster than normal cells. grade III â€“ cancer cells that look abnormal and may grow or spread more aggressively</description>

Excellent - when compared to the untreated breast, there is minimal or no difference in the size, shape, or texture of the treated breast. There may be mild thickening or scar tissue within the breast or skin, but not enough to change the appearance.
Good â€“ there is mild asymmetry in the size or shape of the treated breast as compared to the normal breast. The thickening or scar tissue within the breast causes only a mild change in the shape.</description>
