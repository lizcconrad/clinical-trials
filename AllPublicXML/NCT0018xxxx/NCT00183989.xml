      This study is being done in order to determine the effectiveness of the combination of
      fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and rituximab in patients with mantle cell lymphoma. All three
      drugs,fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and rituximab have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA)for the treatment of certain types of lymphoma. Rituximab is a drug
      (called a monoclonal antibody) which has anti-tumor activity on certain types of lymphoma.
      The combination of chemotherapy (fludarabine and mitoxantrone) with rituximab has not yet
      been investigated in patients with mantle cell lymphoma and therefore the combination in
      investigational.
