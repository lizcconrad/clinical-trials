  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with radiation induced injuries experience significant pain and negative effects on
      quality of life. Currently, no standard therapy for these patients exists, with some patients
      treated symptomatically, and others treated with hyperbaric oxygen or pentoxifylline/Vitamin
      E. This study will examine prospectively the safety and efficacy of using a regimen of
      pentoxifylline and vitamin E in patients with late radiation induced injuries.

             ulceration)

          -  Prior treatment with radiation therapy to the affected area - completed at least 3
             months prior to study entry

          -  Pain in irradiated volume after 3 months (not attributable to acute inflammation)

          -  ECOG performance status must be 0, 1 or 2

          -  Life expectancy is greater than 6 months

          -  Age 18 to 75 years; informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is still responding to other therapies for soft tissue injury

          -  Active malignant disease

          -  Any medical illness or condition judged likely by the local investigator to preclude
             safe administration of protocol treatment, including but not limited to, acute
             myocardial infarction, severe coronary artery disease, active internal bleeding or a
             history of hemorrhagic diathesis, peptic ulcer, impaired kidney or liver function

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  No contraindication to treatment with pentoxifylline. (i.e. previously exhibited
             intolerance to pentoxifylline or other xanthines such as caffeine, theophylline or
             theobromine, recent cerebral and/or retinal hemorrhage)

          -  Concurrent treatment with warfarin or other anticoagulant, or with erythromycin

          -  Concurrent treatment with other experimental agents or other treatment for fibrosis

          -  Patients treated with radiotherapy for breast cancer 3 months to 3 years prior to
             study entry
