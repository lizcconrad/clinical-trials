  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective is to test whether offering pregnant smokers a proactive telephone
      counseling program throughout pregnancy and for 2 months postpartum increases the rate of
      smoking cessation at end of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum, compared to a “best practice”
      control condition.

      A randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of a proactive pregnancy-tailored
      telephone-delivered smoking cessation counseling program with a “best practice” brief
      counseling control condition among pregnant women referred by prenatal care providers and a
      managed care plan in Massachusetts. Intervention group patients received up to 105 min of
      cognitive-behavioral counseling delivered in a motivational interviewing style by trained
      counselors throughout pregnancy and for 2 months postpartum. Control group patients received
      5 minutes of brief counseling at 1 telephone call. All participants were mailed written
      self-help smoking cessation material tailored to pregnancy. The primary outcome measure was
      cotinine-validated tobacco abstinence at the end of pregnancy. Secondary outcomes were
      cotinine-validated abstinence at 3 months postpartum and self-reported significant (&gt;50%)
      reduction in daily cigarette use.
