  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine the long-term health outcome of children diagnosed
      with gastroesophageal reflux (GER). We are inviting subjects that were previously followed in
      the Pediatric GI programs at Massachusetts General and Children's Hospital, Boston. We have
      compiled a database of more than 300 subjects that completed diagnostic testing for GER in
      the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's. Subjects are being contacted initially by mail using a
      previously approved recruitment letter. Subjects that fail to respond to this recruitment
      letter are called by phone. In each case, contact information has been abstracted from the
      Children's Hospital database. Subjects are then given the opportunity to complete a
      questionnaire either by phone or in hard copy. Subjects receive no compensation for their
      participation in this study. Subjects will be compared to controls. Controls will complete
      the same questionnaire as the subjects. Inclusion of potential controls will be determined by
      a lack of medical history of gastroenterological diseases before the age of 21 and whether
      the potential control was born within a year of a subject in the study. Controls will receive
      $25 to participate in the study.
