    <textblock>
      This is a multicentric phase II study of Mabthera (rituximab) in children and adolescents
      with relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL/L3ALL. The primary objective is to determine the
      response rate of Rituximab as single agent in relapsed or refractory Burkitt lymphoma, L3
      acute leukemia, large B-cell lymphoma and non subclassified aggressive B-cell NHL

      This is a multicentric phase II study of Mabthera (rituximab) in children and adolescents
      with relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL/L3ALL. The primary objective is to determine the
      response rate of Rituximab as single agent in relapsed or refractory Burkitt lymphoma, L3
      acute leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and non subclassified aggressive B-cell NHL.
      The secondary objectives are to assess the toxicity profile of Rituximab in children and
      adolescents as single agent, and when followed by chemotherapy, to study pharmacokinetics of
      Rituximab in serum and in CSF and to determine the overall duration of response, time to
      progression and survival in patients responders to antiCD20 initially alone and followed by
      chemotherapy.

      Patients will receive Rituximab (Mabthera) at 375 mg/m2, once a week during 4 weeks,
      administered in IV infusion starting at 50mg/h and increasing by steps of 50 mg/h every 30mn
      until the speed of 400 mg/h. Patients with combined CNS relapse will receive an intrathecal
      injection of MTX+HC+Ara-C 48 h after each injection of rituximab First assessment will be
      done prior to receiving the 3rd course of rituximab. Responding patients (CR, PR) and
      patients with objective effect (OE) will receive the 3rd and 4th injections of rituximab
      before starting the salvage chemotherapy (COPADM, CYVE/CC course or ICE, depending on
      previous chemotherapy regimen received by the patient, followed by HDCT+ hematopoietic stem
      cell rescue). A second evaluation will be done after the 4th course if performed.
