      The purpose of this study is to determine of the effectiveness of an Internet based Diabetes
      Self-Management workshop for people with type II diabetes. Half of the people who complete
      the workshop will be invited to continue their education by participating in a email
      discussion group. Thus, we will be able to learn both the efficacy of the original program as
      well as its efficacy when reinforced by the discussion group.

      Diabetes is a disease that must be managed day by day by the individual with the disease.
      Although we know a great deal about the self-management of type II diabetes, most
      self-management is less than optimal. In addition, most people with diabetes do not have an
      opportunity to participate in formal diabetes education. This study will determine if an
      Internet delivered educational workshop will help people with diabetes manage their disease.
      Thus we will be measuring changes in behaviors, changes in symptoms and changes in HbA1c,
      blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight. If successful the workshop will serve as a prototype
      for Internet diabetes education.
