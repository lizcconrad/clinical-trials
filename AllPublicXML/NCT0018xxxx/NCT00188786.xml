  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conformal dose escalated radiation therapy (CRT) is standard treatment for patients with low
      and intermediate risk prostate cancer. CRT requires accurate daily localization of the
      prostate prior to treatment to correct for prostate motion and set-up errors. Cone beam
      computed tomography (CT) can accurately localize fiducial markers within the prostate. Cone
      Beam CT also provides important information on daily position of organs within the pelvis.
      This study aims to assess the feasibility of cone beam CT for daily localization of the
      prostate as well as document changes in size and location of pelvic organs during an entire
      course of CRT.
