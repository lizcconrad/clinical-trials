  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive Delirium Abatement Program of care of
      delirious patients in the post acute care setting and to evaluate its impact on persistence
      and severity of delirium and on functional recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common, morbid, and costly, delirium affects one third of hospitalized elders, and plays a
      central role in the cascade of adverse events that leads to functional decline and loss of
      independence. Moreover, as acute care stays continue to shorten and evidence mounts that
      delirium may persist for many weeks, concern about delirium can no longer be confined to the
      hospital. It is believed that a Delirium Abatement Program may significantly reduce the
      persistence of delirium in post-acute settings, and thereby improve functional recovery both
      during the post-acute stay and after discharge.

      The Delirium Abatement Program (DAP) will be designed to assist facility staff to 1) detect
      delirium among new admissions, 2) evaluate common underlying causes of delirium, 3) prevent
      complications commonly associated with delirium, and 4) restore delirious patients'
      cognitive, behavioral, social and self care functioning to baseline status.

      This three year trial will enroll 500 delirious patients admitted to eight Boston area
      post-acute skilled nursing facilities. The DAP intervention will be carried out in four
      facilities. Four other facilities, matched to the intervention by demographic, facility, and
      clinical characteristics, will serve as controls. Patients will be recruited within 72 hours
      (maximum 120 hrs) of admission, assessed weekly while in the facility, and at one, three, and
      six months following admission.
