  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the adminstration of celecoxib, a
      cox2-inhibitor in patients with stage II-III non small cell lung cancer receiving radical
      radiotherapy.

      The hypothesis is that celecoxib will increase the remission rate of radiotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is difficult, even with the best classical
      radiation and chemotherapy schedule results remain disappointing. However, there is evidence
      that increasing the local control rate by delivering radiotherapy either in a short period of
      time or concomitantly with chemotherapy improves survival. Drawback of a higher radiation
      dose or addition of chemotherapy is a higher incidence of toxicity. So radiation dose
      escalation could lead to further improvements of prognosis, but the radiation dose is however
      limited by radiation-induced lung and esophageal damage.

      For NSCLC, non-toxic agents who both increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy and decrease
      radiation induced lung and esophageal damage are needed. The cox-2-inhibitors seem to be
      suitable for this purpose. In experimental mice tumor models, it was already shown that
      COX-2-inhibitors both inhibit tumor growth and enhance the radio-response of the tumor.
      Moreover, anti-inflammatory agents, such asCOX-2-inhibitors, also lowered the incidence of
      radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis.

      In this study the simultaneous favourable effects of COX-2 inhibitors on tumor response and
      radiation damage in human cancer patients will be investigated.

      Patients will be randomised to receive Celecoxib or placebo. All patients will receive the
      same radiotherapy treatment. Primary outcome measure is tumor response, assessed by a CT-scan
      of the thorax, three months after radiotherapy.

      The tumor response rate of the experimental group will be compared to the tumor response rate
      of the control group.
