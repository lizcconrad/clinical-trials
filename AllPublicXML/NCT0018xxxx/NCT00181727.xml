  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled study of Divalproex Sodium Extended Release (Depakote ER), testing
      its efficacy for the treatment of mania in children between the ages of 6-12 who have been
      diagnosed with Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Bipolar Spectrum Disorders. This is an exploratory,
      pilot study, seeking to determine whether Divalproex Sodium Extended Release is efficacious
      and well tolerated in the treatment of youth with pediatric bipolar and bipolar spectrum
      disorder, and the study results will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger randomized
      controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical power.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initial clinical evidence suggests that Divalproex Sodium may play a therapeutic role in the
      management of pediatric bipolar disorder. Its new Extended Release formulation offers the
      advantage of once a day dosing. Although the precise mechanisms by which Divalproex Sodium
      exerts its therapeutic effects remains unknown, it has been suggested that its activity may
      be related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the
      shorter acting formulation Divalproex Sodium is FDA approved for the treatment of adult
      bipolar disorder, its Extended Release formulation is currently only FDA approved for adults
      for the prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches and has not yet been studied in patients
      with mania. Three studies of Divalproex Sodium have documented safety and efficacy of this
      compound, as well as superiority over placebo, in the treatment of adults with bipolar
      disorder.

      This medication has not, however, been adequately investigated in children. The proposed
      study includes 1) an 8-week acute period, during which participants are observed during
      weekly visits, and up to an 8-month extension period, during which participants see a study
      clinician on a monthly basis, to document the response rate 2) assessment of the impact of
      Divalproex Sodium Extended Release on functional capacities (quality of life, psychosocial
      function) and cognition, 3) careful assessment of safety and tolerability.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, 6-12 years of age.

          2. Subjects must have a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I, bipolar II disorder or bipolar
             spectrum disorder and currently displaying manic, hypomanic, or mixed symptoms (with
             or without psychotic features) according to the DSM-IV based on clinical assessment
             and confirmed by structured diagnostic interview (Kidd Schedule of Affective Disorders
             and Schizophrenia Epidemiological Version)(Kaufman, Birmaher et al. 1997). Bipolar
             spectrum disorder (or sub-threshold bipolar disorder) is operationalized as having
             severe mood disturbance, which meets DSM-IV Criteria A for bipolar disorder but meet
             fewer elements in criteria B (only require 2 items for elation category and 3 for
             irritability).

          3. Subjects and their legal representative must have a level of understanding sufficient
             to communicate intelligently with the investigator and study coordinator, and to
             cooperate with all tests and examinations required by the protocol.

          4. Subjects and their legal representative must be considered reliable.

          5. Each subject and his/her authorized legal representative must understand the nature of
             the study. The subject's authorized legal representative must sign an informed consent
             document and the subject must sign an informed assent document.

          6. Subjects must have an initial score on the Y-MRS total score of at least 20.

          7. Subject must be able to participate in mandatory blood draws.

          8. Subject must be able to swallow pills.

          9. Subjects with comorbid ADHD, ODD, CD, anxiety and depressive disorders will be allowed
             to participate in the study provided they do not meet for any of the exclusionary
             criteria.

         10. For concomitant stimulant therapy used to treat ADHD, subjects must have been on a
             stable dose of the medication for 1 month prior to study enrollment. The dose of the
             stimulant therapy will not change throughout the duration of the initial phase of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Investigator and his/her immediate family; defined as the investigator's spouse,
             parent, child, grandparent, or grandchild.

          2. Serious, unstable illness including hepatic, renal, gastroenterological, respiratory,
             cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic, neurologic,
             immunologic, or hematologic disease.

          3. Uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.

          4. History of severe allergies or multiple adverse drug reactions.

          5. Non-febrile seizures without a clear and resolved etiology.

          6. Leukopenia or history of leukopenia without a clear and resolved etiology.

          7. DSM-IV substance (except nicotine or caffeine) dependence within past 6 months.

          8. Judged clinically to be at serious suicidal risk.

          9. Any other concomitant medication with primarily central nervous system activity other
             than specified in Concomitant Medication portion of the protocol.

         10. A non-responder or a history of intolerance to Divalproex Sodium Extended Release to
             an adequate trial (2 months or more at an adequate dose) as determined by the
             clinician.

         11. Receiving treatment with Strattera.

         12. Current diagnosis of schizophrenia.

         13. Pregnant or nursing females.

         14. Non English speaking subjects will not be allowed into the study for the following
             reasons: a) the assessment instruments are not available and have not been adequately
             standardized in other languages; b) our clinical trials facility is located in
             Cambridge and not in the MGH main campus without the availability of translators; c)
             psychiatric questionnaires and evaluations are taxing and adding the complexity of a
             translator has the potential to make the patient experience even more exhausting.
