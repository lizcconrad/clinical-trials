  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability and efficacy in treating patients
      aged 51-60 with acute leukemia and in treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or
      myeloproliferative disorders (MPD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To learn whether a new preparative regimen to prepare patients for bone marrow
      transplantation is useful in patients above 50 years of age and whether it is useful in
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

        Inclusion Criteria:1) Patients aged 51-60 with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia in first or
        subsequent remission and acute lymphocytic leukemia in first remission with high risk
        features which include elevated white blood cell count at presentation, cytogenetic
        abnormalities, extramedullary leukemia, ALL in greater than first remission and patients
        with chronic myelogenous leukemia at any stage who have a histocompatible sibling donor.

        2) Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome including patients with refractory anemia with
        excess blasts or refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation.

        3) Patients with myeloproliferative disorders which give them poor long-term disease-free
        survival, such as myeloid metaplasia or myeloid fibrosis.

        4) Patients with secondary myelodysplasia following cytotoxic chemotherapy.
