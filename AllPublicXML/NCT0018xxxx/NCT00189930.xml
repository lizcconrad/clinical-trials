             restricted to intrauterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptives; diaphragm or
             condom in combination with contraceptive jelly, cream or foam; Norplant® or
             DepoProvera®) with use of method for a minimum of 30 days prior to vaccination).

          -  ALT/SGPT, AST/SGOT, and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3 times institutional upper limit of
             normal (ULN).

          -  History of any serious medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator
             would compromise the safety of the subject.

          -  History of or active autoimmune disease. Persons with vitiligo or thyroid disease on
             thyroid replacement are not excluded.
