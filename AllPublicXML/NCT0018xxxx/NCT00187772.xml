      This study examines the efficacy of Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) for the treatment of
      preschoolers exposed to marital violence. Multi-ethnic preschool-mother dyads from diverse
      socioeconomic backgrounds were randomly assigned to CPP or to a case management plus
      community referral for individual treatment comparison group. It was hypothesized the
      children who received CPP treatment would show significantly greater improvement in general
      symptomatology and in traumatic stress symptoms than those in the comparison group.

      There is growing recognition that, contrary to the long-standing assumption that young
      children are impervious to environmental stresses, preschoolers exposed to violence show
      increased rates of disturbances in self-regulation and in emotional, social and cognitive
      functioning (Osofsky, 2004; Pynoos et al., 1999; van der Kolk, 2003). The present study
      examines the efficacy of a relationship-based treatment approach involving the child and the
      mother. Dyads were randomly assigned to either the Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) treatment
      group or to a comparison group that consisted of monthly case management by an experienced
      Ph.D.-level clinician plus referrals for individual treatment in the community for mothers
      and child. We hypothesized that Child-Parent Psychotherapy would be more effective in
      alleviating children's traumatic stress symptoms and behavior problems because it focuses on
      improving the quality of the child-mother relationship and engages the mother as the child's
      ally in coping with the trauma. Treatment was offered for 50 weeks.
