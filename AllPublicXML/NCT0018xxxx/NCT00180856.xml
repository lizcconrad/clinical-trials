  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation has achieved impressive results in the treatment of unresectable
      primary and metastatic liver cancer. Animal studies have demonstrated that radiofrequency can
      fully ablate lung tumors in animal models. We set up a prospective study to evaluate the
      local efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of lung neoplasms. The aim of the study is to
      prospectively evaluate local efficacy with a minimal follow-up of one year, tolerance, lung
      disease-free survival and survival after radiofrequency ablation of lung tumors (primary lung
      cancer or lung metastases).

      Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has achieved impressive results in the treatment of unresectable
      primary and metastatic liver cancer. Animal studies have demonstrated that RF can fully
      ablate lung tumors in animal models. We set up a prospective study to evaluate the local
      efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of lung neoplasms with a minimal follow-up of one year.
      The primary endpoint was to determine the rate of incomplete local treatment at 1 year. The
      secondary endpoints were to evaluate tolerance, survival, disease-free survival and lung
      tumor-free survival. Patients are followed-up by CT scan examination at day 1 or 2 before
      discharge from the hospital, then at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months and then at 2 years

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unilateral or bilateral unresectable primary or metastatic lung tumors &lt;= 40 mm and a
             number of tumor &lt;=5

          -  Tumors located more than 1 cm from the hilum, and not involving soft tissues or
             mediastinum.

          -  Malignancy histologically proven for pulmonary nodules in patients with no history of
             cancer outside the lung.

          -  Lung tumors in patients with a known distant cancer history, has to be either
             histologically proven or a demonstrated change in size of at least 25% in their
             largest diameter is required on CT during the previous year

          -  Pretreatment imaging work-up within 4 weeks of scheduled RF ablation (at least a chest
             CT and an abdomino-pelvic CT)

          -  If a tumor is found outside the lung, it has to be amenable to complete eradication
             with RF or RF plus surgery

          -  Lung spirometry within 4 weeks of treatment with a FEV1 &gt;= 1 liter

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncorrectable coagulopathy with a prothrombin time greater than 1.5 and a platelet
             count below 106/mm3
