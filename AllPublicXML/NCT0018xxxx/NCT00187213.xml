      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that biventricular pacing (BiV) and left
      univentricular (left ventricular [LV] only) pacing are safe and effective for cardiac
      resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients implanted with a cardiac
      resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device.

      The hypothesis to be tested by this clinical investigation is that patients indicated for an
      ICD with cardiac resynchronization therapy respond as well to LV only pacing as to BiV
      pacing.
