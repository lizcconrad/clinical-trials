  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with kidney failure on dialysis have a much higher risk of developing cardiovascular
      disease as compared to the general population. Recently, two large studies have shown that
      increasing the amount of dialysis does not decrease cardiovascular disease. It is known that
      retaining too much fluid leads to high blood pressure and thickening of the heart wall.
      Peritoneal dialysis is a method of home dialysis which allows dialysis patients autonomy and
      independence. This study will measure blood levels of a protein called N-BNP and measure the
      extent of body fluid by a machine called a bioimpedance analyzer. This device administers an
      undetectible electric current which distributes throughout total body water. The relationship
      between these tests and the clinical presence of volume expansion will be assessed. In
      addition, the extent of total body fluid and it's impact on heart attacks, heart failure and
      stroke will be determined.

      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a higher risk than the general population
      of developing premature cardiovascular disease; the reasons for this are complex. Two recent
      randomized controlled trials in peritoneal dialysis patients have demonstrated that targeting
      patients to higher dialysis clearance values is not associated with a reduction in mortality.
      It is known that patients on peritoneal dialysis are more likely to be volume expanded,
      develop left ventricular hypertrophy, and have inadequate blood pressure relative to patients
      on hemodialysis. As a result there has been increased attention on the role of fluid
      management in reducing the risk of developing congestive heart failure and other adverse
      cardiovascular events in peritoneal dialysis patients.

      Extracellular fluid volume and total body water can be accurately assessed with
      multi-frequency bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Estimation of volume expansion by measuring the
      natriuretic peptide N-BNP produced by cardiac tissue in response to ventricular wall stretch
      can also be used.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether volume status, as measured by BIA and N-BNP
      levels, correlates with clinical volume assessment, cardiovascular outcomes, peritoneal
      membrane transport properties and markers of inflammation such as serum albumin and
      C-reactive protein.
