  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of a melanoma vaccine. Study participants will have melanoma that invaded
      deeply and spread to lymph nodes or another location. Although the participants' melanoma has
      been removed, there is a greater than 1 out of 2 chance it will return. There will be
      approximately 40 subjects in this study. The patients will have already taken part in a
      melanoma vaccine study, and in this current study, they will continue to receive booster
      injections of a similar vaccine given for two additional years.

      This study will test an experimental vaccine. The vaccine contains peptides which are
      fragments of substances made by most melanomas. The substances are tyrosinase, gpl00 and
      melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1). The vaccine also includes an assistant
      called Montanide ISA 51. The assistant stimulates the immune system. This study will also
      test the effects of a second assistant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF). All participants will receive the vaccine and assistant Montanide ISA 51, but only
      half will receive the assistant GM-CSF. The patients have a one in two chance of receiving
      the assistant called GM-CSF. The main purpose of this study is to find out if the booster
      injections increase the body's immunity to melanoma and prevent its level of immunity from
      getting lower over time. The investigators also wish to know if the GM-CSF increases the
      body's immunity to melanoma when given with the melanoma vaccine.

      The vaccine and assistant Montanide ISA 51 are not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). The assistant GM-CSF is approved by the FDA to increase
      infection-fighting white blood cells after chemotherapy. It is not approved by the FDA for
      treatment of melanoma. However, the FDA is permitting the vaccine and the assistants to be
      tested in this study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have completed protocol 10M-01-1 or 10M-00-4 are eligible for this study
             provided that:

               1. They have received all injections with evidence of an immune response.

               2. They have not experienced recurrence of the melanoma.

               3. Not more than twelve months have elapsed since the final injection on either
                  protocol.

               4. They experienced no grade 3 or 4 toxicity attributed to the prior vaccine
                  regimen.

          -  Serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or less, total bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dl or less and
             SGOT/SGPT of 2.5 X institutional norm or less.

          -  Total whte blood cell (WBC) of 3,000 or more with at least 1500 granulocytes,
             hemoglobin of 9.0 gm/dl or more, and platelet count of 100,000 per cu mm or more.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Patients will be eligible for this trial if they have failed alpha-interferon, if it
             is felt to be contraindicated due to a pre-existing medical or psychiatric condition
             or if they have refused treatment with it.

          -  Ability to read, understand and willingness to sign an institutional review board
             (IRB)-approved informed consent.

          -  Patients who have had another malignancy but with no evidence of disease for greater
             than 5 years from accrual to the current trial will be eligible if it is felt they are
             likely to be cured. Patients with squamous or basal carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix that have been treated with curative intent can be accrued to
             this trial 30 days after treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have undergone any other systemic therapy for their melanoma, including
             radiation therapy since completion of 10M-01-1 or 10M-00-4.

          -  Have major systemic infections like pneumonia or sepsis, coagulation or bleeding
             disorders, or other major medical illnesses of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or
             respiratory systems.

          -  Require systemic, ocular or inhaled corticosteroids.

          -  Pregnant or lactating, since the risk of autoimmune reactivity to tyrosinase, MART-1
             or gp100 is felt to present a risk to the fetus or a breast feeding infant. Effective
             birth control for men and women is required during and for four months after the study
             is finished.

          -  Known to be positive for hepatitis BsAg, hepatitis C antibody or HIV antibody. Since
             cells removed for ex vivo handling and tissue culture cannot be virus positive, and
             the effects of melanoma peptides might be detrimental to HIV positive patients,
             patients positive for the above viruses will not be treated in this trial.

          -  Have had a known allergic reaction to GM-CSF, Montanide ISA 51 (IFA) or any of the
             peptides included in this protocol.

          -  Have a prior history of uveitis or autoimmune inflammatory eye disease, immune
             hemolytic anemia or other active autoimmune disease.
