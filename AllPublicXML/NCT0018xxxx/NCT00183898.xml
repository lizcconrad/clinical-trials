      This study is for people with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. This study is
      being done to find out how long it takes tumors to grow after patients take the drugs
      capecitabine, oxaliplatin and cetuximab. Capecitabine (also called Xeloda) is a drug that has
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Capecitabine has been approved for
      treatment of cancer of the colon and rectum. Oxaliplatin is another drug approved by the FDA.
      Oxaliplatin is also approved for treatment of cancer of the colon and rectum. Cetuximab is
      also a drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer of the colon and rectum, as well
      as cancer of the head and neck. Capecitabine, oxaliplatin and cetuximab are not approved for
      gastric or gastroesophageal cancer. They are considered experimental drugs for this study.
      The purpose of this study is to see how long it takes patients' tumors to progress when they
      are taking oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Another purpose is to see how many tumors respond to
      this drug combination. The investigators also want to see how long people live when taking
      these drugs. The side effects of this drug combination will also be evaluated. This study
      will also measure the levels of certain genes (the cell's blueprint) in tumors. These genes
      affect how peoples' bodies react to the cancer drugs. Genes will also be measured in the
      blood. The investigators want to see how these genes can predict response to these study
      drugs.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic gastric
             or gastroesophageal cancer. Histology must be consistent with adenocarcinoma.

          -  No previous chemotherapy for metastatic or unresectable disease. Prior adjuvant
             therapy is allowed, as long as it was completed within six months of study initiation.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent prior to
             study-specific screening procedures, with the understanding that the patient has the
             right to withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.

          -  SWOG performance status of less than or equal to 2.

          -  At least one measurable lesion, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) criteria, which has not been irradiated (i.e. newly arising lesions in
             previously irradiated areas are accepted). Ascites, pleural effusion, and bone
             metastases are not considered measurable. Minimum indicator lesion size: &gt; 10 mm
             measured by spiral computed tomography (CT) or &gt; 20 mm measured by conventional
             techniques.

          -  Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of
             chemotherapy (female patients of childbearing potential).

          -  Availability of tumor biopsy (paraffin embedded or fresh frozen) at the time of
