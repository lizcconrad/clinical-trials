  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to assess the impact of a culturally-sensitive,
      patient-focused asthma communication instrument (ACCI) designed to enhance provider-patient
      communication by prompting and guiding providers in assessments of disease severity and
      discussion of adherence behaviors with minority patients with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improving communication between health care providers and their patients is the critical
      first step in efforts designed to reduce asthma-related health disparities in urban areas.
      Improving communication will help providers tailor asthma therapies to their patientsâ€™ needs,
      and help providers and patients to overcome barriers (e.g., concerns about adverse effects)
      to adherence with those asthma treatment plans.
