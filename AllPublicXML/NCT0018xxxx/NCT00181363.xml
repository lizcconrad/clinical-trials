      We hypothesize that for large pendulous breasts, breast irradiation in supine and prone
      position are equivalent with regard to coverage of the PTV, but with a better dose
      homogeneity in prone position and a smaller radiation exposure of lung and heart.The purpose
      of this study is to compare the 3-D dose distribution in PTV and normal tissues in prone
      position versus supine position.

      Local excision followed by adjuvant radiotherapy has become standard treatment for women with
      early-stage breast cancer. Adjuvant radiotherapy may encounter technical difficulties in
      patients with pendulous breasts when treated in supine position.

      Based upon literature and our own preliminary experiences, we hypothesize that for large
      pendulous breasts, breast irradiation in supine and prone position are equivalent with regard
      to coverage of the PTV, but with a better dose homogeneity in prone position and a smaller
      radiation exposure of lung and heart. However, no quantitative data are yet available to test
      this hypothesis. Therefore, the aim of our study is to compare the 3-D dose distribution in
      PTV and normal tissues in prone position versus supine position.
