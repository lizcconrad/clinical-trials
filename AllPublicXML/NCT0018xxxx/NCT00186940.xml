  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center trial for rasburicase in children at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome
      who have a history of asthma/atopy. The main purpose of this study is to establish the safety
      of this drug in patients with a history of asthma or severe allergies.

    <textblock>
      Because they were excluded from most of the clinical trials of non-recombinant urate oxidase
      and rasburicase, the safety of rasburicase in this population is not known, though
      preliminary data indicates that the drug is safe. The primary objective of this study is to
      estimate the proportion of grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions to rasburicase in patients with a
      history of asthma or severe allergy (to antigens other than rasburicase or other urate
      oxidases) treated with rasburicase for the prevention or treatment of malignancy or
      chemotherapy-induced hyperuricemia. Patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome with a history
      of asthma/atopy will be treated with rasburicase according to standard practice and observed
      for allergic reactions.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of hematologic malignancy.

          -  Existing hyperuricemia or high risk of developing hyperuricemia of malignancy.

          -  The treating clinician plans to treat the patient with rasburicase. A patient is only
             eligible for RASALL if the clinician has already decided to use rasburicase.
             Rasburicase should not be given in order to make a patient eligible for this
             non-therapeutic observational study.

          -  No prior exposure to rasburicase or other urate oxidase.

          -  A history of asthma or significant allergy.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Wheezing or an active hypersensitivity reaction at entry.

          -  Hypersensitivity to Aspergillus proteins.
