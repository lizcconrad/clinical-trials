      This trial will evaluate the ability of metoprolol (a beta-blocker drug) to prevent heart
      attacks and deaths around the time of surgery.

      The POISE Trial is a large multi-centre, blinded, randomized controlled group trial of
      metoprolol vs placebo in 10,000 at risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The POISE
      Trial will determine the impact of perioperative administration of metoprolol on
      cardiovascular events (defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or
      nonfatal cardiac arrest) during the 30 day post-operative period in at risk patients
      undergoing noncardiac surgery.

      Assuming a control group event rate of 6% for our primary outcome, we determined
      randomization of 8000 patients would provide 85% power and 10,000 patients 92% power to
      detect a relative risk reduction of 25% (two-sided alpha = 0.05). We set a goal to randomize
      10,000 patients recognizing that we would have adequate power if we randomized 8000 patients.
      Without knowledge of the trial results and knowing that we had randomized more than 8000
      patients and had a higher than predicted event rate, the Operations Committee decided to
      terminate recruitment on July 31, 2007 primarily because the remaining study drug expired in
      September 2007.

    <description>Patients received the first dose of the study drug (i.e., oral metoprolol CR or matching placebo 100 mg) 2-4 hours prior to surgery. Administration of the study drug at each dosing time required a patient to have a heart rate ≥ 50 beats per minute (bpm) and a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 100 mmHg. If the patient's heart rate was ≥ 80 bpm and their SBP ≥ 100 mmHg at any time during the first 6 hours after surgery, the patient received their first postoperative dose (i.e., 100 mg of the study drug) orally. Patients who did not receive the study drug during the first 6 hours after surgery received 100 mg of the study drug orally at 6 hours after surgery. Twelve hours after the first postoperative dose patients started taking oral metoprolol CR or placebo 200 mg daily for 30 days.</description>
