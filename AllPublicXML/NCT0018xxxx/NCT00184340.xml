  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the second phase (Phase B) of the main project &quot;Bank for Thoughts&quot;, which has the
      following aims:

        1. Improvement of software for secured (encrypted and access-controlled) asynchronous
           text-based communication within health services. (Adjustments for use in psychiatry.)

        2. Open clinical trials with Internet-mediated psychotherapy or counselling in out-patient
           child and adolescent psychiatry.

        3. Development of indications and precautions for text-based Internet-mediated
           psychotherapy.

      This phase (Phase B) concentrates on qualitative evaluation of open clinical single case
      trials using asynchronous Internet-mediated text-dialogue for psychotherapeutic purposes.

      Single patients in differing treatment phases, conditions, age and sex categories are
      interviewed after using Internet-contact as a supplementary tool in psychotherapy. Their
      therapists are interviewed as well.

      The purpose is systematically gathering single-case experiences with the tool, to build a
      hypothesis for research and preliminary guidelines for experimental clinical use of
      Internet-mediated psychotherapy.
