  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma affects approximately 500 children a year in the United States. When the tumor
      occurs in infants, it is frequently localized and responds well to therapy. Even disseminated
      disease can be eradicated in about 75% of infants, and indeed may undergo spontaneous
      remission. In older children, the prognosis is far worse, and 80% or more of those with
      disseminated tumor can be expected to relapse within 3 years.

      This study will utilize the concept of exploiting the immune system to eradicate
      neuroblastoma. In tumors in which there is consistent expression of tumor specific antigens
      as part of the malignant process, it may be possible to generate immune T-cells ex-vivo or
      in-vivo by using the specific protein or peptide(s) derived therefrom and eradicate the
      tumor. This study will evaluate the use of four to eight injections of IL-2 gene-transduced
      autologous neuroblastoma cells to induce a local, polyclonal T-cell infiltrate as well as an
      anti-tumor immune response.

      Secondary objectives for this protocol included the following:

        -  To determine whether major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted or unrestricted
           antitumor immune responses are induced by injection of modified allogeneic neuroblasts
           and the cell doses required to produce these effects.

        -  To obtain preliminary data on the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen.

    <description>A genetically modified (retroviral) allogeneic tumor vaccine coupled with the human interleukin-2. Patients were treated with 4 injections of these gene-modified tumor cells. The first two were given at weeks 1 and 2. Patients then had a 2 week rest and the remaining 2 injections were given at weeks 4 and 5. A complete evaluation for evidence of toxicity and response were performed at week 8.
At this week 8 evaluation, if there was no excessive toxicity, progressive disease requiring therapy, and if more transduced cells are available, patients had the option to receive 4 additional injections. These additional injections were separated by 1 month at the higher of the two dosage levels originally received.</description>
