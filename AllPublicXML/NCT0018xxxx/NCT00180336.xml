             course of the study

          -  Have a preexisting unipolar pacemaker that will not be explanted/abandoned

          -  Have an atrial tachyarrhythmia that is permanent (i.e., does not terminate
             spontaneously and cannot be terminated with medical intervention) within 180 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone acetate

          -  During the four weeks prior to implantation, a patient experiences an episode of AF &gt;=
             48 hours in duration and was not anticoagulated for at an adequate therapeutic level
             (INR &gt;= 2.0) for the 4 weeks prior to enrollment
