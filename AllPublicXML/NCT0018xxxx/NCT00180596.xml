      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefit of biventricular pacing in patients
      with heart failure who were receiving optimal pharmacological therapy, and who were either
      with or without an ICD indication

      Heart Failure is a syndrome that affects millions of patients in Europe with over half a
      million new cases reported annually. Drug therapy had been the conventional treatment of
      choice until the emergence of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) where biventricular
      pacing can be delivered to the heart through a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator. This study was designed to assess the effect of CRT on patients optimized on
      conventional heart failure medication including diuretics, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors.
      The effect of CRT was evaluated by comparison of 6 minute walk performance, Quality of Life
      and NHYA class after 6 months with CRT therapy either programmed ON or OFF. In addition,
      evaluation of the incidence of adverse events (predefined as ventricular arrhythmias,
      hospitalizations, drop-outs, complications and patient deaths) was done between groups at 6
      months. Patients were all programmed ON after 6 months and data was collected for an
      additional 6 months.
