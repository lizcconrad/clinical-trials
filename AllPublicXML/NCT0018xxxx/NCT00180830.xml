  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Glivec is effective, in children,
      adolescents and young adults, in the treatment of malignant disease in which evidence
      suggests a potential pathogenic role of one or more of the tyrosine kinases known to be
      inhibited by Glivec.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients from 6 months to 21 years of age.

          -  Malignant disease documented by conventional criteria to be refractory to standard,
             approved therapy, or for which no conventional therapies of definitive benefit exist.

          -  Immunohistochemistry documentation of positivity of either Kit (CD117) or PDGF-R in
             tumor tissue relevant. Each positive tumor will be centrally reviewed before inclusion
             of the patient in the trial.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  WHO Performance status 0,1, or 2 or Lansky Play Scale &gt;= 50%.

          -  Adequate organ function, defined as the following: total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, SGOT
             and SGPT &lt; 2.5 x UNL (or &lt; 5 x ULN if hepatic disease involvement is present),
             creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN, ANC &gt; 1x 109/L, platelets &gt; 75 x 109/L.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before initiation of study drug dosing.

          -  Male and female patients of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective
             barrier method of birth control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following
             discontinuation of study drug.

          -  Life expectancy of more than 6 weeks.

          -  Written, voluntary, informed consent, including consent for retrieval and
             investigational use of tissue samples for evaluation signed by parents or young adult
             patients.

          -  National and, when needed, local ethical approval.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with hematological disease positive for the chimeric BCR-ABL fusion protein or
             for c-kit.

          -  Patient has received any other investigational agents within 28 days of first day of
             study drug dosing.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Patient has another severe and/or life-threatening medical diseasePatient has an acute
             or known chronic liver disease (e.g., chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis).

          -  Patient has a known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Patient has received chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin-C
             or any antibody therapy) prior to study entry unless urgent enrollment needed and
             approved by the study coordinator.
