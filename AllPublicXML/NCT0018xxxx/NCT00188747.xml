  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-heart surgery frequently results in abnormal clotting, which in turn results in
      excessive blood loss and the need for transfusion of multiple blood products to patients and
      leads to adverse outcomes. Prompt identification of any clotting abnormalities after cardiac
      surgery reduces blood loss and blood product transfusion and may improve outcomes. Currently,
      however, this monitoring is dependent on standard laboratory-based tests of clotting that
      have a long turnaround time (30-45 min) and do not measure some important aspect of clotting.
      There are now other monitoring options that are carried out at patients’ bedside, providing
      results more quickly than standard laboratory tests (within 2-5 minutes for some), and
      measure more aspects of clotting, providing more information on possible causes of any
      abnormalities. In this study, we will compare the cost-effectiveness of two of these newer
      monitoring techniques with standard laboratory-based tests by assigning 150 patients who will
      be undergoing open-heart surgery to one of the three monitoring techniques (50 patients will
      be assigned by chance to each group). In each group, an explicit algorithm based on the
      monitoring technique of that group will be used to guide all transfusion decisions.
      Between-group differences in number of units of blood products transfused (primary outcome),
      amount of blood loss, rate of adverse events, and cost of monitoring will be measured. The
      objective of the study is to determine which of the three methods is most cost-effective in
      terms of these outcomes.
