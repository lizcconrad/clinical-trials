  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who have been treated with surgical removal of the testes or
      hormone therapy (Lupron or Zoladex) and whose prostate cancer has worsened despite this
      treatment.

      PS 341 is a type of drug known as a &quot;proteasome inhibitor.&quot; By inhibiting the &quot;proteasome&quot; in
      cancer cells, PS-341 alters the way those cells divide). We hope to learn whether this
      combination chemotherapy decreases cancer symptoms and tests (prostate specific antigen, also
      called PSA), and to determine how frequently serious side effects might occur with this
      treatment for this stage of prostate cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have had a histological or cytological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of
             prostate and currently must have metastatic disease (stage TxNxM1) that is
             unresponsive or refractory to hormone therapy. Patients must have metastatic prostate
             cancer deemed to be hormone refractory by one or more of the following (despite
             androgen ablation and anti-androgen withdrawal where applicable):

          -  Progression of measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior to registration. OR

          -  Progression of non-measurable (i.e. bone scan or PET scan) disease assessed within 42
             days prior to registration. AND

          -  Rising PSA - defined as at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA documented over a
             reference value (measure 1). The first rising PSA (measure 2) should be taken at least
             7 days after the reference value. A third confirmatory PSA measure is required (2nd
             beyond the reference level) to be greater then the second measure and it must be
             obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure. Patient must have a PSA concentration
             of at least 5 ng/ml in addition to increasing PSA to be eligible Note: The PSA result
             (done within 28 days prior to registration) need not be elevated for inclusion
             provided other criteria for progression are met and the serum PSA is at least 2 ng/ml.

          -  Must have received prior hormonal therapy and have a castrate level of testosterone
             (less than 100ng/ml within 90 days of entry to the study). Patients treated with
             orchiectomy are eligible. If patients have been treated with non-steroidal
             anti-androgens, the patients must have ceased taking flutamide or nilutamide at least
             28 days prior to enrollment and at least 42 days prior to enrollment for biclutamide.
             Either method of castration can have been supplemented with nonsteroidal antiandrogen
             (e.g. flutamide, biclutamide, nilutamide). Patients may have been treated with
             &quot;second-line&quot; hormonal therapy such as ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide and/or estrogen
             therapies but these must have ceased at least 7 days prior to commencement of study
             therapy.

          -  May have received at most one prior chemotherapy for hormone refractory prostate
             cancer provided they have not received docetaxel or Bortezomib for that indication or
             otherwise within 2 years of trial entry.

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed but it must have been to less than 25% of total
             body bone marrow. This includes prior use of samarium, but patients can not have
             received strontium. (&gt;10 days must have elapsed since completion of RT with recovery
             from side effects. Soft tissue disease irradiated in the prior 2 months is not and may
             not be designated as measurable

          -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5x the institutional upper limit of normal (within
             28 days prior to registration)

          -  Hepatic function Total Bilirubin less than or equal to ULN AST and ALT and Alkaline
             Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility.

        In determining eligibility the more abnormal of the two values (AST or ALT) should be used.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function. Complete blood count with differential must be done
             within 14 days prior to registration Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal
             to 1,500/mm3 Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8.0 g/dl Platelet count greater than
             or equal to 100,000/mm3

          -  ECOG performance status 0-3. (For patients with PS of 3, cause must be due to pain
             secondary to bone metastases to be eligible)

          -  Patients should (for good medical practice) have stabilization of their analgesic
             medications for at least one week prior to receiving study medication

          -  No other chemotherapy, biological response modifiers, RT, radioisotope therapy (e.g.
             samarium or strontium), corticosteroid, or concomitant hormonal therapy may be given
             during protocol treatment.

          -  Bisphosphonate therapy is permitted provided it commences prior to study entry and is
             maintained at recommended dosing intervals.

          -  Completed baseline McGill Pain Questionnaire and Pain Medication Log prior to
             registration. The nurse or CRA must complete MPQ and PML cover sheet for baseline
             assessment prior to registration. If unable to complete questionnaires in English or
             Spanish, patient can be registered without contributing to QOL study).

          -  Men of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for a reasonable period (90 days) thereafter.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Myocardial infarction or angina pectoris within one year of registration

          -  History of brain metastases, treated or untreated. (Patients with neurological
             symptoms must have CT or MRI brain negative for metastatic disease within 56 days
             prior to registration). Patients who have recovered from spinal cord compression and
             are clinical stable may enter the study provided they fulfill other criteria.

          -  Not recovered from major infections and/or surgical procedures, or has significant

             currently in complete remission or other cancer with no evidence of disease for
             greater than 5 years from accrual to the current trial. Patients with basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that have been treated with curative intent can be
             accrued to this trial 30 days after treatment. Solar keratoses treated topically do
             not preclude entry).

        Macrolide antibiotics: erythromycin, troleandomycin, azithromycin Imidazole antifungal

        agents: cyclosporin, FK-506

          -  Ongoing therapy with drugs known to induce P4503A4 drug metabolism including:
