  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pacemaker therapy has been recognized as effective for the control of sinus and
      atrio-ventricular (AV) node dysfunction. Single chamber pacing when compared with dual
      chamber pacing, has numerous advantages of low complication rates, lower cost, better
      longevity, with non-inferiority in the quality of life and hard outcomes proven in direct
      randomized comparisons. However, comparison between single and dual chamber pacers was never
      adequate, since not more then half of the patients in the trials were actually using
      pacemakers for the majority of the time. Routine dual chamber pacing using a right ventricle
      apical lead is also associated with significant increase in peri-operative and remote
      complications. Some of these complications may be related to ventricular desynchronization
      secondary to the pacing location, which is potentially avoidable by using biventricular
      pacing. A randomized trial which will compare single chamber rate responsive pacing to the
      best available modification of dual chamber pacing (biventricular pacing) in suitable
      patients is therefore warranted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has symptomatic bradycardia and is a candidate for first pacemaker
             implantation

          -  Patient has high risk of being pacemaker dependent by (at least one of the following):

               1. Average heart rate of 60 or less on pre-implant Holter

               2. Maximal heart rate of 60 in patient on telemetry monitoring 12 hrs
                  preoperatively, when not under medications decreasing heart rate, or under
                  chronic medical treatment inducing bradycardia, which is unlikely to be changed

               3. First degree AV block with PR intervals &gt; 300 ms, or second degree AV block at
                  heart rates &lt;= 80 bpm.

               4. Dependence for 12 hrs when on temporary pacemaker set at 50 bpm if bradycardia is
                  not secondary to medication, or under chronic medical treatment inducing
                  bradycardia, which is unlikely to be changed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt;= 65 years

          -  Chronic Atrial Fibrillation

          -  Indication for ICD

          -  Non-cardiovascular death is likely to occur within 3 years

          -  Geographical, social, or psychiatric reasons making follow-up problematic
