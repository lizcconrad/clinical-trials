      The main objectives of the project are:

        -  To classify patients suffering from plaque psoriasis responding on a given treatment
           (efalizumab) based upon reduction in Psoriasis Area and severity Index (PASI), Psoriasis
           Disability Index 8PDI) and dermatology Life Quality Index 8 DLQI)

        -  To characterize patients suffering from plaque psoriasis responding to or not responding
           to subcutaneous administrated efalizumab.

  <detailed_description>

      This is an investigator initiated,prospective, longitudinal, observation study. Before
      starting treatment with efalizumab we will record factors such as demographic data, type of
      psoriasis, previous treatment, other diseases etc.

      We will follow the patients and classify them as responders and non-responders. We hope to
      find 4-5 factors which we can use later to predict response of this drug.
