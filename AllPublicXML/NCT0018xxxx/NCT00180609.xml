  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to document the success rate of the automatic
      threshold testat pre-discharge in a normal pacemaker patient population implanted with
      Guidant Insignia Ultra or AVT .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently the optimal programming of the pacemaker output considers both pacemaker efficiency
      (prolonging battery longevity) and patient safety (adequate safety margin). A decrease in the
      programmed output can be used to increase the projected battery life or to eliminate
      diaphragmatic or pectoral muscle stimulation. An increase in programmed output may be
      required to account for increasing thresholds after lead implantation. The ability of an
      implanted pacemaker to automatically adjust the ventricular output above the pacing threshold
      while maintaining the appropriate safety margin has been explored since the early 1970s. The
      Automatic capture feature in the INSIGNIA I Ultra/AVT pacemaker automatically adapts the
      ventricular pacing output to ensure capture of the ventricle while optimizing the output
      voltage. The primary objective of this study is to document the success rate of the automatic
      threshold test in a normal pacemaker patient population by following normal pacemaker
      follow-up results for 1 year.
