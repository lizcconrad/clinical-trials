    <textblock>
      The goal of this post-marketing surveillance study is to compare two procedures which are
      used to treat patients who require a disc decompression procedure. These procedures are: 1)
      plasma disc decompression procedure using Coblation technology and 2) fluoroscopy guided
      transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI). The study will evaluate treatment efficacy
      and rate of improvement in symptoms through the first six months following the procedure.

      The principal objectives of this study are to determine whether subjects receiving the plasma
      disc decompression procedure demonstrate:

        1. Improved clinical outcomes over subjects receiving TFESI

        2. More rapid reversal of symptoms than subjects receiving TFESI

    <textblock>
      Chronic leg and back pain are two of the most common ailments in our society, and are
      associated with serious financial and social consequences. One surgical treatment modality is
      plasma disc decompression, based on the principle that inducing a small reduction of volume
      in the closed hydraulic space of an intact (contained herniated) disc can relieve pressure,
      and thereby reduce or eliminate pain. Another widely accepted treatment is transforaminal
      epidural steroid injection (TFESI), which delivers a high concentration of corticosteroid to
      the targeted disc nerve interface, and is thought to decrease pain by reducing inflammation.

      This study proposes to compare the efficacy of the plasma disc decompression procedure to the
      standard TFESI series in patients who have failed to improve after an initial TFESI
      injection. The goal is to better understand the differences between these two treatment
      modalities and to monitor the rates of symptom improvement through the first six months
      between patients receiving a series of at least two selective nerve root injections and those
      undergoing the one-time plasma disc decompression procedure after failing one fluoroscopy
      guided TFESI. Patients will continue to be monitored over the 2-year post-procedure period to
      assess stability of treatment effect.
