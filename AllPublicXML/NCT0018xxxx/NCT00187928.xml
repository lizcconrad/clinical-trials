  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a drug called topiramate is safe and effective
      as an add-on therapy in the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Topiramate is
      an investigational drug for OCD, which means it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA). Topiramate has been approved as an add-on therapy for adults and
      children with partial onset seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and for patients 2
      years of age and older with a severe form of epilepsy called Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.

      Up to 96 subjects will be enrolled in this study. This study consists of three phases:
      Washout/Screening Phase, Double-Blind Phase, and Taper Phase. The total expected length of
      your participation in the study is approximately four months.

      This is a multicenter, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive topiramate
      in treating subjects with OCD. The study consists of a washout/screening phase, a
      double-blind treatment phase of 12 weeks, a taper period of approximately 7 days. Upon
      successful completion of the washout/screening phase subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2
      treatment groups: topiramate up to 400 mg/day or placebo. A placebo control will be used to
      establish the frequency and magnitude of changed in clinical endpoints that may occur in the
      absence of active treatment.

      During the double-blind phase, subjects will be seen weekly for the first two weeks and then
      every other week for the remainder of the double-blind phase. Study medication will be
      titrated over the 8-week titration period up to 400mg/day or the subject's maximum tolerated
      dose. After the titration period, the dose will remain stable for the maintenance period
      during which visits will occur every 14 days. At the completion of the maintenance period,
      subjects will taper their study medication over the next 7 days.

      This study will be conducted in up to 96 subjects with a diagnosis of OCD with an onset at
      least 1 year prior to screening supported by the SCID-I. Forty-eight subjects will be
      assigned to topiramate and 48 will be assigned to placebo.

          3. Subjects must have stable OCD symptoms and must have a minimum severity of greater
             than or equal to 18 on Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) or a minimum
             score of greater than or equal to 10 on questions one through five if the subject has
             obsessions without compulsions at Visit 2 (Baseline).

          4. Subjects must be between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive.

          5. Subjects can be male or female and must be in generally good health as confirmed by
             medical history, baseline psychiatric history and physical examination, including
             vital signs. Baseline laboratory values must be within normal limits, or considered
             clinically insignificant by the investigator.

          6. Subjects must have observed the designated washout periods for prohibited medications
             outlined under the Concomitant Therapy section of this protocol.

          7. Subjects must have a negative urine drug screening (phencyclidine, cocaine,
             amphetamines, tetrahydrocannabinol, and opiates) at Visit 1.

          8. If female, the subject must:

               -  be postmenopausal for at least one year, or

               -  have had a hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation with resection or otherwise
