  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of fentanyl TTS for the treatment of neuropathic pain remains to be established,
      although opioids in general are clearly effective for neuropathic pain and fentanyl TTS has
      been shown to be effective for treating other types of pain. We propose to measure functional
      outcomes, pain relief and side effects of fentanyl TTS for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
      Measures will be made at baseline and after titrating the drug to an effective level.
