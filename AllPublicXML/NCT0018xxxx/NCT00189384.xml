  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one-third of neonatal deaths in developing countries are due to infections
      acquired through the birth canal and/or exposure to an unclean environment soon after birth.
      Current World Health Organization recommendations for the management of infants younger than
      2 months of age who have serious bacterial infections involve hospitalization and parenteral
      therapy for at least 10 days with antibiotic regimens containing penicillin or ampicillin
      combined with an aminoglycoside.However, in many settings throughout the developing world,
      this is not currently possible, nor is this standard of care likely to be feasible in the
      near future. Several studies have reported that for a variety of sociocultural reasons many
      families are unable or unwilling to access hospital-based care and their sick young infants
      do not get hospitalized, and instead, receive a variety of home-based antibiotic therapies,
      or none at all. In our community field sites, approximately 70% of families refuse hospital
      referral for a sick newborn, despite provision of transport.

      Thus, there is an urgent need to define the role of community/first-level facility-based care
      versus hospitalization for the management of young infants with serious bacterial infections,
      and the potential for community-based parenteral antibiotics as an alternative strategy in
      resource poor areas with high neonatal mortality rates. Bang and colleagues have demonstrated
      significant reductions in neonatal mortality from infections in an underdeveloped rural
      district in Maharashtra, India by a field-based case management approach which used oral
      cotrimoxazole and intramuscular gentamicin given for 7 days as treatment for neonates with
      sepsis.

      This study is an equivalence randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing once daily IM
      ceftriaxone injection to once daily IM procaine penicillin and gentamicin injection, to once
      daily intramuscular gentamicin injection and twice daily oral cotrimoxazole, given for 7 days
      in babies with clinically-diagnosed possible serious bacterial infection (pneumonia, or
      sepsis with or without local infections such as skin or umbilical infections) whose families
      refused referral to a hospital. After supplementary informed consent, patients meeting
      specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomly allocated to one of the three regimens
      being tested. The study hypothesis is that all 3 regimens will perform equally well in the
      treatment of sepsis in a first-level facility setting.
