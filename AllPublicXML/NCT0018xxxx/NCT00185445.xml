    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that oral fludarabine phosphate is comparable to
      i.v. formulation used in combination with mitoxantrone in terms of efficacy, safety and
      risk/benefit profile

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Indolent B-cell follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (grade I-II according to REAL
             classification)

          -  Stage II to IV according to Ann Arbor staging system

          -  WHO performance status grade 0, 1 or 2 and life expectancy of greater than 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received any previous treatment for follicular NHL

          -  Patients with severe or life-threatening cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, psychiatric
             or metabolic disease

          -  Pregnant and lactating women

          -  Women of childbearing potential, and all men, not agreeing to take adequate
             contraceptive precautions during and for at least 6 months after cessation of therapy

          -  Laboratory screens positive for Hepatitis B, C or HIV infections

          -  Patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia with clinical evidence.
             NB. A positive Coombs test alone (with no clinical evidence of hemolysis) would not
             preclude entry in the study.

          -  Histological transformation to aggressive B-cell lymphoma

          -  Patients with prior malignancies except non melanoma skin tumors or stage 0 (in situ)
             cervical carcinoma

          -  Impairment of hepatic function unless disease related indicated by bilirubin, ASAT,
             ALAT or gamma-GT raised 2 times above the upper limit of the local laboratory range

          -  Impairment of renal function indicated by serum creatinine &lt; 30 ml/min

          -  Patients who require systemic long-term therapy with glucocorticoids

          -  Participation at the same time in another study in which investigational drugs are
             used

          -  Patients unable to regularly attend outpatient clinic for treatment and assessments

          -  Any other co-existing medical or psychological condition that would preclude
             participation in the study or compromise ability to give informed consent

          -  Patients with active infection
