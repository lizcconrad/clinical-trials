  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project was to test whether screening and brief intervention for
      unhealthy alcohol use leads to improved alcohol-related outcomes (such as alcohol consumption
      and linkage to alcohol assistance) and is cost-effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of brief intervention for unhealthy
      alcohol use in a diverse group of hospitalized medical patients was tested.

      We conducted a randomized trial of medical inpatients with the whole spectrum of alcohol
      problems from risky use through dependence. Subjects in one group received standard care;
      subjects in the second group received a brief motivational intervention tailored to the
      severity of his or her alcohol problem. Primary outcomes are alcohol consumption and linkage
      to alcohol treatment. Additional outcomes include health-related quality of life, health care
      utilization, alcohol problems, and readiness to change. Costs, and clinical outcomes measured
      in quality-adjusted life years, a standard metric that allows comparison to other chronic
      illnesses, will be compared in a cost-effectiveness analysis.
