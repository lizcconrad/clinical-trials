  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass require significant fluid
      administration. Fluids are used routinely to replace blood lost during and after surgery.
      Significant amounts of fluid are also used to prime the tubing and components of the
      cardiopulmonary bypass pump before and during its use. The use of Pentaspan - a synthetic
      pentastarch - was started because of the restriction of use for blood and blood products,
      particularly albumin. Pentaspan is usually used after surgery in the Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU). The impact of the use of pentastarch on coagulation, fluid balance and bleeding are
      very limited. This study will methodically evaluate the impact of using increasingly greater
      amounts of pentastarch during surgery on an open heart surgery patient's recovery in
      particular - is there more bleeding, does his/her blood clot as well, and how much fluid
      overall is used and excreted?
