  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for patients with advanced testicular cancer. This research study involves
      treatment with oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine, which is an investigational
      chemotherapy combination. This study is for patients who have not responded to standard
      cisplatin-containing chemotherapy or the cancer has returned after such treatment.

      This research is being done to assess the effectiveness of the proposed combination of
      medications for this type of cancer.

             neoplasm not amenable to surgical cure

          2. Must have refractory germ cell neoplasm defined as one or more of the following:

               -  patients who progress during or within 4 weeks of cisplatin-containing tx, OR -
                  patients who have failed initial salvage chemotx regimens, including high-dose tx
                  (chemotx with stem cell support), POMB-ACE tx, VeIP, or VIP

          3. Must have one or more of the following (check all that apply):

             is not assessable as measurable dz.

          4. X-rays, scans, or PE for non-measurable dz must have been completed within 14 days of
             registration

          5. May have received prior surgery or RT. At least 3 weeks must have elapsed since
             completion of previous tx and must have recovered from any adverse effects

          6. Zubrod PS less than or equal to 2

          7. Greater than or equal to 16 years of age

         12. Serum K+ and Mg++ within inst range of normal (obtained within 14 days prior to
             registration)

         13. Men of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraceptive method

         14. Signed informed consent (including HIPAA authorization)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior tx with cytotoxic or experimental agents within 14 days prior to registration

          2. Evidence of concurrent infection (T &gt; 96.8F but &lt; 101.5F; WBC &lt; 11.0 unless these
             values can be ascribed to another tumor-related phenomena)

          3. Other prior malignancy, except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which patient is currently in
             chemoradiation (CR), or any other cancer from which patient has been disease-free for
             5 years
