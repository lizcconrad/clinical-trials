    <textblock>
      Some women have chest pain even without having a blockage in one of the major blood vessels
      that supplies blood to the heart. In many of these women the microscopic (small) blood
      vessels in the heart do not function normally. This study seeks to determine if treatment
      with eplerenone, a commercially available diuretic, can improve the function of these
      microscopic blood vessels and, possibly, improve the chest pain.

      INDICATION: Coronary Vascular Dysfunction (Endothelial Dysfunction and/or Microvascular
      angina).

      OBJECTIVES: To investigate effects of aldosterone blockade (eplerenone) on coronary vascular
      function.

      PATIENT POPULATION: Women who meet the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute-sponsored
      WISE (Women Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation) study criteria of chest discomfort, coronary
      vascular dysfunction and undergoing evaluation for myocardial ischemia in the absence of
      significant coronary artery stenosis.

      STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled, comparative trial
      of eplerenone, given in the presence of a renin-angiotensin blocker (ACE-I or ARB in the case
      of ACE-I intolerance).

      TREATMENT: Eplerenone 25mg titrated to 50mg as tolerated per day versus placebo for four
      months

      PRIMARY EFFICACY PARAMETER(S): Epicardial coronary artery endothelial function at Week 16
      (adjusted for baseline treatment group and site by treatment interaction variables) comparing
      the eplerenone group to the placebo group.

      SECONDARY EFFICACY PARAMETERS: Microvascular coronary endothelial function at Week 16
      (adjusted for baseline treatment group and site by treatment interaction variables) comparing
      the eplerenone group to the placebo group.

      OTHER EFFICACY PARAMETERS:

        -  Coronary flow reserve

        -  Chest discomfort as measured by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire

        -  DASI

      SAFETY PARAMETERS: Blood pressure, pulse rate and frequency and occurrence of adverse events.
      The latter will include serum K and Creatinine.

      STATISTICAL RATIONALE AND ANALYSIS: A statistical rationale for the number of patients in the
      study has been provided. Interim analyses are planned after 10 patients have completed
      treatment in each group.

      ANTICIPATED TOTAL NUMBER OF PATIENTS: 50 (25 per treatment group).

      ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF PATIENTS AT EACH SITE: Approximately 13.

      PARTICIPATING SITES: University of Florida (Carl Pepine, MD), Emory University (Arshed
      Quyyumi, MD), Rhode Island Hospital (Barry Sharaf, MD), and Mayo Clinic (Amir Lerman, MD).
      There is an existing relationship between the first 3 sites and the Mayo Clinic site is
      familiar with all necessary protocol procedures and is anxious to participate. The University
      of Florida will serve as the main contracting site.

    <measure>Epicardial Coronary Artery Endothelial Function (Adjusted) at Week 16 Comparing the Eplerenone Group to the Placebo Group</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure was the relative change in coronary diameter to acetylcholinem (ACH) at 16 weeks adjusted for baseline reactivity to acetylcholine. Change in coronary artery diameter after ACH was measured in mm at baseline and 16 weeks. Percent change at 16 weeks - percent change at baseline was the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Microvascular Coronary Flow Reserve(Adjusted) at Week 16 Adjusted for Baseline Coronary Flow Reserve Comparing the Eplerenone Group to the Placebo Group</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Coronary flow reserve is a ratio of coronary blood flow velocity before and after adenosine. The outcome measure is the difference between the coronary flow reserve at 16 weeks adjusted for coronary flow reserve at baseline.</description>

        <description>The primary measure was the relative change in coronary diameter to acetylcholinem (ACH) at 16 weeks adjusted for baseline reactivity to acetylcholine. Change in coronary artery diameter after ACH was measured in mm at baseline and 16 weeks. Percent change at 16 weeks - percent change at baseline was the outcome.</description>

Study allowed for 6 dropouts, leading to a final N=50 planned (25 per group). Per protocol analysis used.</population>
