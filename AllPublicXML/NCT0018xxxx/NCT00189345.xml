  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who receive
      surgical cytoreduction and platinum/taxane containing chemotherapy have a significant chance
      of entering complete clinical remission but about 70% will eventually relapse. Many patients
      respond to additional cytotoxic treatment with partial or complete responses, yet
      approximately 100% of these patients will ultimately progress. Novel consolidation strategies
      following treatment for recurrent disease are needed and an immunologic approach is an
      attractive option.EpCAM is expressed in a large number of epithelial ovarian cancer,
      fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer tissues. Thus targeting these cancers with an anti-EpCAM
      antibody is a promising innovative therapeutic approach.
