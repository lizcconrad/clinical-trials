      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the side effects of a new treatment for stomach
      cancer which may potentially improve the prognosis of this cancer.

      Our principle objective is to improve the results of standard chemotherapy and radiation
      after surgery of patients with gastric cancer. The intra-abdominal (intraperitoneal)
      administration of floxuridine (FUDR) is a procedure that we have studied and have determined
      it is a safe treatment. In this study, we want to evaluate the side effects of this treatment
      when it is given after surgery but before standard intravenous chemotherapy and radiation.

      Study treatment will start with surgical removal of the part of the stomach with cancer,
      together with surrounding tissues and lymph nodes. After surgery, patients will get treatment
      with a chemotherapy drug, FUDR, administered directly into the abdomen. This is called
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy. After this treatment patients will receive repeated intravenous
      injection of two drugs, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin alone or combined with irradiation of
      the abdomen.

             must be excluded from any RT port)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy or immunotherapy

          -  Presence of another active invasive malignancy (Except for adequately treated basal
