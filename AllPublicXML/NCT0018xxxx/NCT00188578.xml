  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for gynecological cancer is radiation therapy in two phases; whole pelvic
      radiation and then an internal radiation boost, also called a brachytherapy boost, to treat
      any remaining tumour.

      The purpose of this study is to test an alternative radiation boost treatment called
      conformal intensity modulated radiation therapy or IMRT. Currently, we do not have complete
      information on the overall effectiveness of IMRT compared to brachytherapy or conformal
      radiotherapy. We know that IMRT allows the radiation beams to be more accurately focused on
      the tumor, thereby sparing more normal tissue from radiation damage and lowering risks of
      side effects. We are investigating the extent to which IMRT can be used to protect normal
      tissues in patients with cervix, uterine or vaginal cancer from the radiation beams and how
      much the side effects of radiation are reduced.
