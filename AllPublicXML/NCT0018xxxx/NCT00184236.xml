  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of either a multidisciplinary
      approach or intensity-controlled interval training on cardiovascular risk factors in
      overweight adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several approaches have been used to improve cardiovascular health status and quality of life
      in obese children and adolescents, without coming to a consensus decision. Recently, a few
      studies have determined the effects of exercise training and diet on endothelial function in
      overweight and obese children and adolescents. The main findings are that only a moderate
      amount of exercise training and diet changes improves or restores endothelial function. It is
      difficult, however, to asses the separate effects of the training and diet, particularly
      because none of the studies have used a homogenous exercise training regimen. Unanimously,
      better, but affordable prevention and treatment strategies to improve wide-scale health
      outcome are called upon to slow down the current epidemic of overweight. It is now well
      established that physical activity reduces, but does not currently prevent the epidemic of
      obesity from either reaching global proportions or taxing public health and economy. Despite
      the recent advances in understanding the responsible biology of improved cardiovascular
      health with exercise training, several lines of research questions are still unresolved. For
      instance, the optimal program, e.g. when to initiate, whom to prescribe exercise to, which
      exercise-intensity is required, and the actual design of the treatment program, remain by far
      yet to determine.
