  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic suppurative otitis media is one of the most common chronic infections in children
      worldwide. Symptoms include otorrhea, otalgia and hearing loss. In many countries, it is
      treated primarily with antibiotics; in other countries such as the Netherlands a surgical
      approach, such as a tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, placement or removal of tympanostomy tubes
      or a tympanomastoidectomy is preferred. There is however, no agreement on the management of
      this disease.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with
      sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for 6-12 weeks in children suffering from chronic otitis media
      and otorrhea.

      Chronic suppurative otitis media is one of the most common chronic infections in children
      worldwide. Symptoms include otorrhea, otalgia and hearing loss. In many countries it is
      treated primarily with antibiotics; in other countries such as the Netherlands a surgical
      approach, such as a tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, placement or removal of tympanostomy tubes
      or a tympanomastoidectomy is preferred. There is however, no agreement on the management of
      this disease.

      Co-trimoxazole is an inexpensive antibiotic and tolerated well by children, also when long
      treatment regimens or prophylaxis is necessary. A previously performed retrospective study of
      48 children who were referred to the pediatric department of otorhinolaryngology in the UMC
      Utrecht because of &quot;therapeutic resistant&quot; otorrhea showed promising results; after 3 months
      follow-up, 52% of the patients were otorrhea free, 25% had otorrhea incidentally and 23%
      showed no signs of improvement. Therefore, the treatment of chronic otitis media with
      sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for a minimum of six weeks is promising and might be a good
      alternative to surgical treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with
      sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim during 6-12 weeks in children with chronic otitis media and
      otorrhea for more than 12 weeks.

    <description>The primary endpoint was otomicroscopic signs of otorrhea in either ear in the presence of a tympanostomy tube or tympanic membrane perforation at 6 and 12 weeks and 1 year follow-up. At these follow-up moments the participants were checked for the presence of otorrhea using an otomicroscope.</description>

    <description>After 12 weeks follow-up irrespective of the presence or absence of otorrhea the study medication was discontinued. After the first 12 weeks local otorhinolaryngologists and paediatricians were free to manage symptoms of otorrhea according to their regular practice. Parents kept a diary between 12 weeks and 1 year follow-up where Ear Nose and Throat Surgery was noted. This outcome describes the number of patients who underwent Ear Nose and Throat Surgery between 12 weeks and 1 year follow-up.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited between February 2003 and June 2006. Otorhinolaryngologists and paediatricians from all over the Netherlands referred potential participants, i.e. children with COM that had failed conventional management with topical medications and/or short term systemic antibiotics</recruitment_details>

          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Children assigned to the placebo group received two times a day a placebo for 6 to 12 weeks. The placebo was a blinded suspension with an identical taste, bottle and fluid appearance as the sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim suspension. When at the first control visit after 6 weeks otorrhea was found to be present in either ear, the study medication was continued for another 6 weeks. The study medication was discontinued if both ears were found to be free from otorrhea and parents confirmed that they had seen no signs of otorrhea during the previous week. Parents were instructed to start the study medication again if symptoms of otorrhea recurred between the follow-up visits at 6 and 12 weeks. At inclusion and if otorrhea was present at 6 and 12 weeks follow-up, antibiotic with corticosteroid eardrops were prescribed in addition to the study medication for 7 to 10 days. After 12 weeks follow-up the study medication was discontinued irrespective of the presence or absence of otorrhea.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients Who Underwent Ear Nose and Throat Surgery Between 12 Weeks and 1 Year Follow-up.</title>
        <description>After 12 weeks follow-up irrespective of the presence or absence of otorrhea the study medication was discontinued. After the first 12 weeks local otorhinolaryngologists and paediatricians were free to manage symptoms of otorrhea according to their regular practice. Parents kept a diary between 12 weeks and 1 year follow-up where Ear Nose and Throat Surgery was noted. This outcome describes the number of patients who underwent Ear Nose and Throat Surgery between 12 weeks and 1 year follow-up.</description>
