    <textblock>
      A multinational, randomized trial comparing two lung protecting strategies of respiratory
      life support among critically ill patients with severe lung injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare an innovative Lung Open Ventilation strategy with a proven low tidal volume
      strategy, hypothesizing that the Lung Open Ventilation strategy may reduce mortality, other
      organ dysfunction, and the duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care, and hospital
      stay.
