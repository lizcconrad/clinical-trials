  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-year study tested the concept that an intervention, which reduces trauma-related
      symptoms among adults who are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are
      experiencing trauma-related stress symptoms, and engaging in behavior that facilitates HIV
      transmission, can reduce the transmission risk of (HIV). Our central premise was that by
      first treating trauma symptoms, we would enhance the effects of a skills-building HIV risk
      reduction intervention for adults experiencing trauma-related symptoms such as hyperarousal,
      dissociation, and avoidance.

      The study aims were to:

        1. To determine if decreasing trauma-related stress symptoms improves HIV risk reduction
           behavior above a standard HIV risk reduction intervention alone post-intervention and 3
           months after the small group intervention sessions;

        2. To determine whether key variables moderate the intervention’s effects. For instance,
           gender, age, ethnicity, or psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety) may
           interact with the intervention to affect risky sexual or drug-related behavior; and

        3. To determine whether there is evidence that the theoretical mediator variables, which
           include trauma-related stress symptoms, self-efficacy, communication skills, and social
           support mediate the intervention’s effects on outcomes. This information addresses the
           theoretical question of why the intervention works.

    <textblock>
      There are no published longitudinal studies examining the impact of traumatic events on risk
      behavior among HIV-positive men and women. As a result, we know very little about how stress,
      particularly trauma-related stress, influences HIV risk behavior. This study will be one of
      the first randomized studies to examine the efficacy of reducing HIV risk behavior by
      combining a trauma-focused stress reduction intervention with a standard HIV prevention
      skills intervention. This study is specifically targeting a low-income, urban population, a
      group that experiences a disproportionate rate of crime as well as HIV infection. Findings of
      the research will likely provide information on the relationship between trauma and risk
      behavior. Furthermore, this research can identify key issues related to stress, psychosocial
      factors, and overall health that will be relevant to investigate in future, larger-scale
      studies of HIV-positive as well as HIV-negative populations.

      Individuals who reported living with HIV, engaging in HIV risk behavior in the past 3 months,
      experiencing a traumatic stressor and trauma-related symptoms in the past 3 months were
      assigned to one of three conditions: 1) standard HIV prevention skills; 2) standard HIV
      prevention skills + trauma-focused stress reduction skills training; or 3) trauma-focused
      stress reduction skills training.
