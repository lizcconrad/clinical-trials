  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether naltrexone (an opiate blocking agent
      approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence), ondansetron a serotonin 3 antagonist
      medication approved to treat nausea) or their combination are effective in the reduction of
      alcohol craving and drinking compared to placebo.

      Non-treatment seeking individuals meeting criteria for alcohol dependence N=160) will be
      recruited through advertisement and paid for their participation. Alcoholics, after baseline
      evaluation, will be assigned through urn randomization (using a double dummy placebo
      controlled design) to one of four experimental groups, naltrexone (50 mg/day) (N=40),
      ondansetron (0.25 mg twice a day) (N=40), naltrexone and ondansetron (N=40) or placebos
      (N=40). Subjects will take the study drugs for 8 days (day 1-5 being the natural observation
      period). After a minimum of 48 hours of abstinence from alcohol day 6-8) they will undergo an
      alcohol administration (priming dose) and motivated free choice drinking procedure (on day
      8). Alcoholic subjects will receive a brief counseling session at the end of the study to
      enhance their awareness of problem drinking and to motivate them to seek treatment. Referral
      for treatment will be offered.A subset of subjects from each medication group (N=15) will
      undergo a functional MRI brain scan with cue stimulation on day 7, on the evening before the
      alcohol administration paradigm.

      A smaller group of social drinker controls (N=16), recruited and paid in a similar fashion,
      will be randomly assigned to the same medication groups (4 per group). They will be used as
      procedure controls for the alcohol administration lab study and as a comparison/contrast
      group for the brain imaging sub-study.
