      This study will determine the effect of medication for bipolar disorder on the reproductive
      function and whether mood changes occur during the menstrual cycle in women with bipolar
      disorder.

      Bipolar disorder is a serious condition that can have devastating effects on social and
      psychological functioning. Evidence suggests that medications for bipolar disorder may
      influence reproduction function among women. This study will determine reproductive function
      and mood changes in women who are currently on medication for bipolar disorder.

      This study will comprise women with bipolar disorder and age- and body mass index
      (BMI)-matched healthy controls. Participants will have their reproductive function and mood
      changes assessed for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Daily, participants will report about
      their mood, sleep patterns, life events, and any psychiatric medications; this information
      will be entered into a computerized system named ChronoRecord. In addition, participants will
      measure their basal body temperature and collect their urine every morning to assess for
      ovulation. Blood collection will occur at study entry and between Days 3 and 6 of every
      menstrual cycle to determine levels of reproductive hormones. Participants will be asked to
      fast for 12 hours prior to every blood collection. During the first month of the study, an
      extra study visit will occur. Participants will undergo a physical exam for determination of
      excessive hair growth (hirsutism) and BMI. Additionally, insulin resistance will be measured,
      and participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire that will be used to determine
      their past and current menstrual function, as well as the reproductive and psychiatric
      history of their families.
