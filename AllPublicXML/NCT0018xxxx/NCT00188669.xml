  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 20 - 45 % of women treated with breast conserving treatment experience chronic
      pain in the treated breast. The aetiology of this is poorly understood. Some of these women
      have signs of chronic radiation mastitis. There is no accepted treatment for this condition.
      The combination of pentoxifylline and vitamin E has been shown to be effective in reversing
      radiation fibrosis in this region. Many of these patients have had a benefit in pain response
      in a time period of a few benefits. This study is a phase II study of these drugs for a 6
      month trial period to assess the effect on chronic breast pain in breast cancer patients who
      are 3 months to 3 years post radiation treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  UICC TNM stage 0 (i.e. in situ disease), 1 or 2 breast cancer patients treated with
             conservative surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy with chronic breast pain or tenderness,
             with or without fibrosis, within 3 months to 3 years following completion of
             radiotherapy

          -  Age 18 to 75 years of age

          -  Chronic symptoms localised to the breast treated with radiation, i.e. any one or more
             of the following- pain (not attributable to infection) or tenderness with or without
             associated oedema, fibrosis, necrosis or ulceration.

          -  Breast pain (maximum in the previous 24 hours) measurable on a Linear Analogue Scale
             with a length of 3cm or greater

          -  Prior treatment with radiation to the affected area i.e. in tangential breast fields
             or boost area

          -  Radiation completed at least 3 months and no longer than 3 years prior to study entry

          -  Informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active cellulitis in the breast

          -  Active malignant disease

          -  Any medical illness or condition judged likely by the local investigator to preclude
             safe administration of protocol treatment

          -  Contraindication to treatment with pentoxifylline (i.e. previously exhibited
             intolerance to pentoxifylline or other xanthines such as caffeine, theophylline or
             theobromine; recent cerebral and/or retinal haemorrhage; ischaemic heart disease;
