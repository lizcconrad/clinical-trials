      This study will determine the effectiveness of the &quot;Living in Harmony&quot; depression prevention
      program in preventing depressive symptoms among pregnant American Indian adolescents during
      pregnancy and after giving birth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy among reservation-based American Indian adolescents has become increasingly common.
      Numerous psychosocial and environmental factors have put this population at high risk for
      pregnancy-related depression. Depression during pregnancy and after giving birth is
      associated with reduced quality of life for both young mothers and their children. Many
      reservations lack mental health services; therefore, an inexpensive intervention is needed to
      prevent depressive symptoms among pregnant adolescents who live on reservations.

      The duration of this study will vary for each participant, depending on the time of study
      entry. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive weekly sessions of either the
      &quot;Living in Harmony&quot; program, consisting of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
      culturally-relevant education, and support; or general depression-prevention education and
      support. Participants' depressive symptoms will be assessed at study entry, at 4, 12, and 24
      weeks after giving birth, and study completion. Interviews and self-report scales will be
      used to assess participants.
