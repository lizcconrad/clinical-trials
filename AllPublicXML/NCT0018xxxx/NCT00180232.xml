  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study tries to reveal if aminobisphosphonates influence aside the bone density also the
      vascular status in the typical elderly patient population
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects - starting bisphosphonate treatment due to medical reasons - will be
      additionally investigated as outpatients (arterial stiffness, applanation tonometry), for
      each subject 3 individual dates with a duration of approx. 30 min each are scheduled, prior
      to therapy with bisphosphonate, after 3 and 6 month of treatment
