  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to test the safety of trilostane by looking at what
      effects, good and bad, it has on patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients will take trilostane orally once a day for three days, then twice a day
           thereafter.

        -  Patients will complete a daily drug log recording the date, time and number of capsules
           taken.

        -  Trilostane may moderately decrease the production of steroids by the adrenal glands. In
           order to prevent any symptoms related to decreased steroid production, patients will
           also take hydrocortisone at the same time as the trilostane.

        -  While the patients are on treatment blood work will be done after 2 weeks and then every
           4 weeks to test the levels of PSA in the blood. On weeks 4 and 8 of treatment additional
           blood work will be done to check hormone levels. Blood pressure and pulse rate will also
           be taken every 4 weeks.

        -  Depending upon disease status, radiological testing (CT scan, x-rays, and/or bone scan)
           may be repeated every 12 weeks.

        -  Patients will remain on study treatment as long as their disease responds and they do
           not experience any severe side effects.
