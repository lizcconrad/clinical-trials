  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AML96 study examines the feasibility of a risk-adapted postremission treatment strategy
      including related and unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation for high risk AML
      patients and related allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation for standard risk
      AML patients in a multi-center setting. Furthermore it randomizes patients between
      intermediate-dose Cytarabine vs high-dose Cytarabine within the first postremission-course.
