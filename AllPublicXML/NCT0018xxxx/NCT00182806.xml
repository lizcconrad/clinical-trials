      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and gemcitabine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Irinotecan may also increase the effectiveness of gemcitabine. Giving irinotecan
      together with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with gemcitabine
      works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive stage III or stage IV non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate (complete and partial response) in patients with
           recurrent or progressive stage IIIA-IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with
           irinotecan and gemcitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes on days 2 and 9. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 month and then every 8 weeks
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months.
