      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as S-1 and cisplatin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.
      Giving chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. It is not
      yet known whether giving S-1 together with cisplatin before surgery is more effective than
      surgery followed by S-1 in treating stomach cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well giving S-1 together with
      cisplatin before surgery works compared to surgery followed by S-1 in treating patients with
      stage III stomach cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with potentially resectable stage III gastric
           cancer treated with neoadjuvant S-1 and cisplatin followed by gastrectomy and adjuvant
           S-1 vs no neoadjuvant chemotherapy before gastrectomy and adjuvant S-1.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the curative resection rates in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens, in terms of postoperative complications, adverse
           events, and treatment- or surgery-related mortality rate, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (T3 vs T4) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control): Patients undergo gastrectomy with D2+ lymph node dissection. Patients
           then receive adjuvant oral S-1.

        -  Arm II (neoadjuvant therapy): Patients receive neoadjuvant oral S-1 on days 1-21 and
           cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 8. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 2 courses in the
           absence of disease progression. Patients then undergo surgery and receive adjuvant S-1
           as in arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
