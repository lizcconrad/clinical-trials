  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who receive
      surgical cytoreduction and platinum/taxane containing chemotherapy have a significant chance
      of entering complete clinical remission but about 70% will eventually relapse. Relapse more
      than 6 months following first line chemotherapy is regarded as platinum/taxane sensitive
      disease. Reinduction chemotherapy with platinum/taxane is known to be an effective treatment
      option. Therapy induced anemia is a common problem resulting in decrease of quality of life.
      The rationale of this trail is to evaluate the effects of epoetin alpha on reduction of
      therapy induced anemia, rate of transfusions and on quality of life.
