      This study will determine the effectiveness of three different drug therapies in treating the
      symptoms of mania.

      Mania is a serious condition characterized by extreme excitement, mental and physical
      hyperactivity, insomnia, and disconnected thoughts. Symptoms of mania are common in patients
      with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. When associated with these conditions, mania reaches
      psychotic proportions and often includes hallucinations, paranoia, and feelings of
      omnipotence. Such symptoms may put individuals with mania and those around them at risk for
      physical harm. Drug therapies that can safely and effectively treat symptoms of mania are
      needed. This study will compare three drug combinations in their ability to treat symptoms of
      mania in people with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.

      This study will last 26 weeks and will comprise two parts. In Part 1, participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: divalproex-extended release (DV-ER) and
      lithium, DV-ER and quetiapine, or DV-ER and placebo. Participants will receive their
      intervention for 12 weeks. Participants will have weekly study visits for the first 4 weeks
      of Phase 1; biweekly study visits will occur for the following 8 weeks. After Phase 1,
      participants who have not responded to their drug regimen will complete their participation
      in the study.

      Participants whose symptoms of mania have decreased will be enrolled in Phase 2. During this
      14-week continuation phase, participants will continue the drug regimen they began in Phase
      1. Participants will have biweekly study visits in Phase 2. During each study visit in Phases
      1 and 2, participants will be interviewed about their mania symptoms. Mania, depression,
      quality of life, and overall functioning scales will assess participants at study entry, at
      the end of Phase 1, and at the end of Phase 2. Participants over 50 years of age will have an
      electrocardiogram (EKG) at study entry to determine cardiac function.
