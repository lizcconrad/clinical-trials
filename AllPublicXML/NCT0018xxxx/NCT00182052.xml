  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study it to learn the effects (good or bad) that rosiglitazone has on
      patients and their prostate cancer. This study is going to look at what effects rosiglitazone
      has on prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients will be randomly assigned to initial treatment with either rosiglitazone or
           placebo orally twice daily, every day as long as there is no disease progression or
           serious side effects. Patients will be asked to complete a drug log to keep track of the
           medication.

        -  Before treatment begins the following tests will be performed: physical exam; bone scan;
           blood work (including PSA level test) and a urine sample.

        -  While on this study the following tests and procedures will be done once a month: review
           of side effects and routine blood tests (including PSA levels).

        -  While on this study the following tests and procedures will be done on months 2 and 4:
           review of side effects; routine blood tests (including PSA levels) and urine tests.

        -  If the patient's disease progressed the treatment code will be broken and if the patient
           was on placebo, they will have the option to begin taking rosiglitazone.
