  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many normal tissues, including the eyes, brain, and spinal cord are very close to cancers in
      the nasopharynx. The dose of radiation delivered to the cancer is limited by tolerance of
      these normal tissues. Standard radiation treatment techniques using three or four radiation
      beams cannot avoid delivering some dose of radiation to these normal tissues that do not need
      to get radiation. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) uses many hundreds of
      computer-controlled radiation beams aimed at your cancer to try to lower the amount of
      radiation that normal tissues receive, while still delivering the desired amount of radiation
      to your cancer and to areas that your doctor thinks may have cancer cells.

      The doctors at Princess Margaret Hospital are conducting this study in order to test whether
      the use of IMRT techniques can improve the chance of controlling your cancer in the head and
      neck region.
