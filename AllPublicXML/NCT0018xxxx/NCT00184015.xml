    <textblock>
      This research study is for subjects with cancer of the kidney (also known as renal cell
      carcinoma) that cannot be treated with surgery. The purpose of this study is to see if the
      combination of bevacizumab and bortezomib is safe and tolerable and can help people with
      kidney cancer. The investigators would also like to find out what dose of the study drugs can
      be used safely and effectively, whether the combination of these two drugs can decrease
      cancer symptoms and stop tumor growth, and how frequently serious side effects might occur
      with this combination.

      The study will be conducted in two phasesâ€”Phase 1 and Phase 2. In Phase 1, subjects will be
      assigned to a fixed dose of bevacizumab and different strengths of bortezomib given at 2
      different schedules. Phase 2 will depend on how subjects tolerate the doses and schedules of
      bortezomib in Phase 1.

      Bortezomib is a type of drug known as a &quot;proteasome inhibitor.&quot; By blocking the &quot;proteasome&quot;
      in cancer cells, bortezomib affects the way these cells divide. Bevacizumab is an inhibitor
      (blocker) of blood vessel formation. Tumors need blood vessels in order to continue to grow
      and bevacizumab is thought to work by preventing new blood vessels from growing.

      Bortezomib (also called Velcade or PS-341) has been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of myeloma, but has not been approved for the
      treatment of kidney cancer. Bevacizumab (also called Avastin) has been approved by the FDA
      for the treatment of colon cancer, but has not been approved for the treatment of kidney
      cancer. However, the FDA is permitting the combined use of bortezomib and bevacizumab in this
      research study.

      The bevacizumab that will be given in this study is not a commercially marketed product.
      Although it is expected to be very similar in safety and activity to the commercially
      available drug, it is possible that some differences may exist. Because this is not a
      commercially marketed drug, bevacizumab can only be administered to subjects enrolled in this
      study and may only be administered under the direction of physicians who are investigators in
      this study.

      Approximately 40-52 subjects will take part in this study.
