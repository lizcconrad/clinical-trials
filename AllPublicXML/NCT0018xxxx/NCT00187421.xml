  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to determine if a strategy of intraoperative
      patency assessment and graft revision can decrease the rate of graft occlusion or significant
      stenosis (&gt;50%) at 6-12 weeks after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus traditional
      operative management without routine intraoperative patency assessment. Patency will be
      assessed with a new fluorescence angiography technique as well as ultrasonic transit-time
      flow measurement. We hypothesize that the strategy of intraoperative patency assessment and
      graft revision will significantly reduce the frequency of graft occlusion at 6-12 weeks in
      comparison to patients who do not have intraoperative patency assessment. We also hypothesize
      that the strategy of intraoperative patency assessment and graft revision will significantly
      reduce the frequency of 50-99% stenoses at 6-12 weeks in comparison to patients who do not
      have intraoperative patency assessment. We expect both groups will experience similar
      perioperative outcomes but hypothesize that patients receiving a strategy of intraoperative
      patency assessment and graft revision will experience improved long-term graft patency and
      freedom from late clinical events at 5-6 years post-operatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immediate and long term success of coronary surgery is dependent on the construction of a
      high quality anastomosis with a durable conduit to an appropriate target coronary vessel.
      Significant advances in medical therapy including early post-operative aspirin administration
      and increased use of arterial grafting have improved early, midterm and late graft patency.
      However, modern coronary bypass series continue to report perioperative graft occlusions
      rates as high as 11%. These very early graft failures have been predominantly ascribed to
      technical problems at graft anastomosis sites and may be preventable. New intraoperative
      graft assessment technologies have recently become available which can identify technical
      problems such that they can be repaired in the operating room. However, these techniques
      increase the length of the bypass operation and may have false positives, which may lead to
      unnecessary and potentially damaging graft revisions. The primary objective of the proposed
      study is to determine if a strategy of intraoperative patency assessment and graft revision
      can decrease the rate of graft occlusion or significant stenosis(&gt;50%) at 6-12 weeks after
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus traditional operative management without
      routine intraoperative patency assessment.
