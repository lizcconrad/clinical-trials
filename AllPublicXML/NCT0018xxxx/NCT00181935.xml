  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to study the safety, effectiveness, tolerability and dosing
      regimen of risperidone, and olanzapine, in the treatment of mania in Bipolar Disorder I and
      Bipolar II Disorder in preschool children over an 8 week period. We hypothesize that these
      atypical neuroleptics may be effective in treating pediatric mania, with a lower risk of
      extrapyramidal side effects.

      Risperidone and olanzapine are atypical neuroleptics marketed for the treatment of psychotic
      disorders in adults. These medicines are called atypical neuroleptics because of their unique
      pharmacological profile, which include both D2 and 5HT2 antagonistic effects. The combined
      dopaminergic and serotonergic activity seems to be associated not only with antipsychotic
      effects, but also with mood stabilizing, mood elevating and tardive dyskinesia. The
      anti-climactic effects of this class of drugs led to the recent FDA approval of olanzapine as
      monotherapy for adult bipolar disorder.

      The study will consist of 8 week, open-label treatment period with random assignment to two
      determined treatment arms, risperidone or olanzapine. We plan to enroll 5 subjects for each
      arm. During the 8 weeks of treatment, patients will be seen at weekly intervals and receive
      study medication. At each week, measures of safety and efficacy will be obtained. Two teams
      of clinicians will see the patient at each visit. Team 1 will be the treating team, adjusting
      medication dosages and determining the safety of continuation in the study for the patient.
      Team 2 will be blind to the randomization status of the patient and will assess clinical
      improvement using the efficacy measures. For patients who have completed the 8-week acute
      phase without adverse event and have not responded to the medication they were assigned to
      will be allowed to then take part in additional 8-week trial with the other medication. At
      the end of the 8 weeks, patients who responded to their assigned treatment will be eligible
      to be enrolled and invited to participate in a separate10 month continuation study.
