  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1982, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has been
      conducting numerous clinical trials on patients infected with HIV-1. Unfortunately, once
      clinical studies have closed or participants have reached a study endpoint, no additional
      follow-up data are collected regarding progression of HIV infection and development of
      HIV-related complications in these study participants. This study will collect long-term data
      for participants of previous NIAID-sponsored clinical trials to study HIV-related disease
      processes and complications, benefits and toxicities of investigational medications and
      vaccines, and medical management of participants with known or suspected HIV infection.

      Study visits will occur every 6 months. A physical exam, blood collection, and medical
      history will occur at all visits. Depending on the need of participants, additional
      laboratory and diagnostic tests will be performed, and standard medical care will be
      provided.
