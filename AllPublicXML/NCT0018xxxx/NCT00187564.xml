  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term effects of high blood sugar include blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage
      that can ultimately cause loss of limbs. Research has shown that high blood sugar increases
      the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in diabetics, and that the increase in
      ROS causes damage to eyes, kidneys, and nerves by a process called &quot;oxidative stress.&quot; We
      postulate that alpha-lipoic acid, a potent anti-oxidant, can stop ROS from forming, thereby
      preventing long-term complications in diabetes. In this pilot study, we will be giving 30
      teenagers with type 1 diabetes (T1D) controlled-release alpha-lipoic acid for 3 months, and
      comparing the amount of oxidative stress before and after treatment. Ten teenagers with T1D
      will receive placebo instead of alpha-lipoic acid and undergo the same research protocol to
      aid in validation of outcome measures.
