  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the oxygen content and interstitial fluid pressure in
      cervix cancer patients. Tumour oxygen content and internal pressure of tumours may be an
      important factor that influences the effectiveness of radiotherapy and other treatments.
