  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)is a rapidly progressive, invariably fatal and untreatable
      neurodegenerative disease with a mean duration of about eight months. Beyond the debilitating
      cognitive and motor deficits that accompany CJD, the difficulty in treating behavioral and
      mood disturbances and the rapidity of its course compound its tragedy. Recent results from
      experiments show that, at physiological concentrations, the anti-malarial drug quinacrine
      permanently clears abnormal prion proteins from cell culture. The demonstrated efficacy of
      quinacrine in cell culture, its relative safety and well known side-effects in the clinical
      setting, and the universal fatality of CJD justify quinacrine as an immediate candidate for
      the treatment of CJD.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of the medication quinacrine
      on survival in sporadic CJD (sCJD). This will be accomplished by bringing approximately 60
      patients with probable or definite sCJD over approximately three years to UCSF for evaluation
      and initiation of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled (delayed treatment start)
      treatment study of quinacrine. Each patient will have a 50:50 chance of being placed on
      quinacrine or placebo upon study enrollment; however, all patients will be offered quinacrine
      after two months. Prior to study enrollment, patients will have a comprehensive clinical
      assessment to confirm the diagnosis of sCJD. Participants will come to UCSF for initial
      evaluation, potential study enrollment and, if possible, return to UCSF for follow-up at two
      and twelve months. Patients will receive telephone follow-up (every 2 weeks for the first two
      months and monthly thereafter) and local blood and testing to monitor for possible medication
      toxicity.

    <measure>Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) After 2 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month-2</time_frame>
    <description>The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) is a brief 30-point questionnaire that is used to screen for cognitive impairment. In about 10 minutes it samples functions including arithmetic, memory and orientation. A score greater than or equal to 25 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Lower scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-24 points) cognitive impairment. Low to very low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia, although other mental disorders can also lead to abnormal findings on MMSE testing.</description>

    <measure>Barthel Score Change After 2 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>An ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living. Scores range from 0 (worst, fully dependent) to 100 (best, independent); higher score associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence following discharge from hospital. 10 individual items are scored and summed to derive the overall Barthel index score. Each item may be scored 0, 5, 10 or 15; not all items use the full range of 4 possible values. The amount of time and physical assistance required to perform each item are considered in scoring each item. For subjects unable to return for month-2 visit, Barthel Index was performed via telephone.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDRS-SB) After 2 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDRS-SB). The CDR is obtained through semistructured interviews of patients and informants, and cognitive functioning is rated in 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The global CDR score is computed via an algorithm. The CDR-SB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18. A higher value and/or positive change is worse. For subjects unable to return for month-2 visit, CDRS-SB was performed via telephone.</description>

    <measure>Change in Rankin Score After 2 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. 0 - No symptoms.
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Dead. For subjects unable to return for the 2-month visit, Rankin score was assessed via telephone.</description>

    <measure>ADAS-Cog Change After 2 Months Among Survivors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>ADAS-cog measures cognitive performance by combining ratings of 11 components (word recall, word recognition, constructional praxis, orientation, naming objects and fingers, commands, ideational praxis, remembering instruction, spoken language, word finding, comprehension) representing six areas of cognition: memory; language; orientation to time, place and person; construction of simple designs and planning; and performing simple behaviors in pursuit of a basic, predefined goal. Seven components are scored as the 'number incorrect'. For example, in the commands component, the number of five commands performed incorrectly (range: 0-5). Four components are scored from 0 (no limitations) to 5 (max limitations) as the examiner's perception of remembering instructions, spoken language ability, word finding and comprehension. Component scores are summed into a total ADAS-cog score ranging from 0-75, with low scores indicating better cognitive performance.</description>

        <title>Change in Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) After 2 Months</title>
        <description>The mini–mental state examination (MMSE) is a brief 30-point questionnaire that is used to screen for cognitive impairment. In about 10 minutes it samples functions including arithmetic, memory and orientation. A score greater than or equal to 25 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Lower scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-24 points) cognitive impairment. Low to very low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia, although other mental disorders can also lead to abnormal findings on MMSE testing.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Month-2</time_frame>
        <population>Subjects still alive, who attended the month-2 visit and were willing and able to tolerate cognitive testing. 1 subject in each arm did attend the 2-month visit but did not cooperate fully with the MMSE, which was therefore not scored.</population>

        <title>Barthel Score Change After 2 Months</title>
        <description>An ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living. Scores range from 0 (worst, fully dependent) to 100 (best, independent); higher score associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence following discharge from hospital. 10 individual items are scored and summed to derive the overall Barthel index score. Each item may be scored 0, 5, 10 or 15; not all items use the full range of 4 possible values. The amount of time and physical assistance required to perform each item are considered in scoring each item. For subjects unable to return for month-2 visit, Barthel Index was performed via telephone.</description>

        <title>Change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDRS-SB) After 2 Months</title>
        <description>Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDRS-SB). The CDR is obtained through semistructured interviews of patients and informants, and cognitive functioning is rated in 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a 5-point scale of functioning: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The global CDR score is computed via an algorithm. The CDR-SB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18. A higher value and/or positive change is worse. For subjects unable to return for month-2 visit, CDRS-SB was performed via telephone.</description>

        <title>ADAS-Cog Change After 2 Months Among Survivors</title>
        <description>ADAS-cog measures cognitive performance by combining ratings of 11 components (word recall, word recognition, constructional praxis, orientation, naming objects and fingers, commands, ideational praxis, remembering instruction, spoken language, word finding, comprehension) representing six areas of cognition: memory; language; orientation to time, place and person; construction of simple designs and planning; and performing simple behaviors in pursuit of a basic, predefined goal. Seven components are scored as the ‘number incorrect’. For example, in the commands component, the number of five commands performed incorrectly (range: 0-5). Four components are scored from 0 (no limitations) to 5 (max limitations) as the examiner's perception of remembering instructions, spoken language ability, word finding and comprehension. Component scores are summed into a total ADAS-cog score ranging from 0-75, with low scores indicating better cognitive performance.</description>
