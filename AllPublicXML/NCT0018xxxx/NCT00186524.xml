  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with primary breast cancer may benefit from participating in supports groups as they
      cope with treatment and the psychological challenges of survivorship. Studies have documented
      that these women benefit from support groups run in a university setting; however, no one has
      documented that they benefit from community cancer support groups. Many community cancer
      support groups exist and provide service to a large number of women with breast cancer. It is
      important to know if these groups are providing comparable service to well researched support
      groups. We conducted this study as the first randomized study of community compared to
      university-style support groups. Women had a 50/50 chance of being assigned to either a
      community or a university style support group based on a coin flip. This study took place in
      two sites The Wellness Community East Bay (Walnut Creek) and San Francisco. Two community
      groups were studied.

      i) This study evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of two community-based support group
      interventions for breast cancer patients [The Wellness (TWC) and Cancer Support (CSC)
      Communities, in the San Francisco area]. We compared them with a type of therapy developed in
      the university setting (Stanford's Supportive-Expressive group therapy), studied which
      aspects are most effective, and who benefits the most. We compared these women on change in
      emotional distress, means of coping with cancer, and social and family support. In addition,
      change in physiological response to stress was measured using saliva samples.

      ii) We were able to achieve recruitment for 6 of 8 groups proposed. We randomized 72 women in
      blocks of 12 taking consecutive women per site until we accrued 12 for each group. Of those,
      61 women actually attended groups, of those 46 women to date completed at least one follow-up
      and were available for analysis for this report. We screened 108 women, 16 who were screened
      out on initial phone contact, 20 women began to go through our baseline interviews and
      assessments and either decided not to enroll or dropped out before we could compose a group
      for the second S.F. randomization. Our final two follow-up assessments for our final group in
      the East Bay are being conducted right now (8 month) and will be conducted in October, 2002
      (12 month) so they are not available for assay or analysis for this final report.

      iii) We examined 5 outcome variables for this report and found that women participating in
      the community groups changed at about the same level over the 4 months of group therapy as
      the women in the Stanford groups. This was true for depression symptoms, trauma symptoms,
      social support, self-efficacy, and post-traumatic-growth. These analyses are preliminary
      until we complete our final follow-up assessments. It is encouraging for the community groups
      that women benefited at the same rate as they did in the well-researched Stanford groups.
      Conclusions for this study are somewhat limited because we could not complete the recruitment
      of our entire sample. However, there is every reason to suppose that community groups are as
      effective at serving women with primary breast cancer as Stanford's groups though they are
      based on very different ideas of therapy. It is important to note that all of these groups
      were led by therapists, and that we may have found other results if the groups had been led
      by peers or other types of professionals. This study reduces the human and economic cost of
      breast cancer in California by validating community groups usually offered free to women with
      breast cancer.
