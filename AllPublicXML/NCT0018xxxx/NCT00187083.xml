      The main purpose of this study is to find out which form of asparaginase (the native E.
      coli/Erwinia) or PEG-asparaginase) is more effective during induction treatment for children
      with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back after treatment (relapsed) or is
      resistant to treatment (refractory)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol will compare the biologic effects of PEG-asparaginase vs native-forms of
      asparaginase in a randomized trial using the same dosages and schedules used in the POG 9411
      study. Comprehensive studies, including the measurement of antibodies and asparagine levels
      as well as the pharmacokinetics of L-asparaginase, will be performed. This protocol will also
      study the changes in topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II levels and the fractions of
      topoisomerase I/II translocations in malignant lymphoblasts after upfront window topotecan
      therapy, and correlate oncolytic response with these changes.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To compare changes in asparagine levels 28 days after initiation of treatment with
           asparaginase between the two groups.

        -  To estimate the pharmacokinetics of L-asparaginase, compare the pharmacokinetics between
           the two groups of patients, and correlate the pharmacokinetics with the development of
           antibody to asparaginase and depletion of asparagine.

        -  To measure the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of topotecan in patients with
           recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia

        -  To determine whether the frequency of recombinogenesis in lymphocytes is increased
           during or after etoposide therapy relative to the pre-therapy level, and to explore
           whether etoposide pharmacokinetics are related to the Day 7 or post-therapy level of
           recombinogenesis.
