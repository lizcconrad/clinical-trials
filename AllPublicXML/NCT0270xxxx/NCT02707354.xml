  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro-intestinal graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major source of morbidity and
      mortality amongst allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT). The
      diagnosis is based on histological findings that involve colonic biopsies with a risk of
      bleeding, especially in case of thrombocytopenia. Moreover the diagnosis is frequently made
      at a clinical stage of the disease, after the appearance of gastro-intestinal symptoms.
      Endo-microscopy is a novel endoscopic technique that allow &quot;optical biopsies&quot; during a
      conventional endoscopy and has proved its efficiency in several indications. In a pilot study
      the investigators showed that it had good sensibility and sensitivity compared to histology
      as gold standard. Therefore this study aim to identify endo-microscopic criteria allowing the
      early diagnosis of GHVD before its clinical manifestations.

      The investigators propose a mini-invasive alternative technique to perform biopsies in the
      terminal part of the colon with rectosigmoidoscopy alone. Confocal laser endomicroscopy,
      either using an endoscope-based or a probe based technology , aims to decrease the number of
      standard biopsies and their associated risks, by providing real-time in situ microscopy. In a
      previous pilot study performed in 15 patients at the University hospital of Nantes, the
      investigators suggested that combining probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) and
      wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) could detect early mucosal abnormalities suggestive of GVHD
      and thus be part of a mini-invasive algorithm for early detection of GI-GVHD. However, in
      this study, the investigators showed that pCLE was a sensitive method for the early diagnosis
      of GVH with a sensibility of 85% and a specificity of 71.5%. These interesting results are
      however to put in question due to several reasons. First of all the pCLE criteria used to
      define a GVHD in this study were established with data stemming of literature in other
      validated indications such as the MIAMI score for the diagnosis of malignant biliary
      structures and therefore can turn out not to be as relevant as expected. Secondly the
      interpretations of the images obtained with pCLE were only interpreted by a single
      endoscopist who by the way wasn't blinded from the macroscopic appearance of eventual lesions
      during rectosigmoidoscopy resulting in a bias. Thirdly the number of patient as in a pilot
      study was probably not sufficient to evaluate the real sensibility and sensitivity of those
      new indication and technique for the early diagnosis of GVH. All together these observations
      lead us to the necessity of developing the promising results obtained previously and allow
      their realization by the creation of an innovating pCLE score : the E-mage score. The
      different criteria of the score will be established after the one defined in the pilot study
      reviewed by an expert committee combining anatomo-pathologists and endoscopists to be as
      objective as possible with quantitative and semi-quantitative assessments focusing
      particularly on crypt architecture, morphologic and dynamic criteria and fluorescein leakage
      with a cut off standing as no GVHD, likely GVHD or certain GVHD.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the evaluation of E-mage score as a new way to detect the early occurrence of GVH amongst patient undergoing Allo-HSCT, considering its sensibility an sensitivity. The E-mage score will be constructed after an expert committee to define semiquantitative or quantitative criteria allowing the classification of pCLE lesions from no GVH to certain GVH. Those criteria will be set regarding the results of the pilot study. The pCLE images will be interpreted by two endoscopists used to pCLE images and blinded from macroscopic observations. Correlation between the E-mage score calculated for each patient and the gold standard histology will be evaluated and sensibility and specificity of the Emage score will be calculated.</description>

    <description>The probe is a miniaturized microscope in the form of a fiber which is inserted through the endoscope and brought into contact with the mucosa. It thus allows for a &quot;live virtual biopsy&quot;, that is to say, obtaining real-time microscopic virtual image of the mucosa. It requires an intra-veinous injection of 5 mL of 10% fluorescein diluted in 50 cc of saline serum. The images obtained during the examination will be recorded via the endomicroscopy console so that two endoscopists blinded from the macroscopic and histological findings can review the data.</description>
