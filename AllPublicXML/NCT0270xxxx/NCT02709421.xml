  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP)remains the most
      frequent adverse event of ERCP. Rectal indomethacin, as one kind of classic NSAIDs, has been
      proved to be effective in reducing the incidence of PEP. It has been widely used to prevent
      PEP in patients, especially those with potentially high risks of PEP. However, rectal
      indomethacin can not completely eradicate the occurrence of PEP. The rate of PEP in patients
      receiving indomethacin ranges from 3.2% to 9.2%. The risk factors of PEP in patients
      receiving rectal indomethacin remains unclear. The aim of the study was to identify potential
      risk factors in high-risk patients whose received administration of prophylactic rectal
      indomethacin after ERCP.

    <description>All the patients with high risks of PEP received administration of one single dose of 100mg rectal indomethacin after ERCP.
Patients were considered high risk of PEP if they met one of the following criteria: clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, a history of PEP, pancreatic sphincterotomy, precut sphincterotomy, ≥8 cannulation attempts, cannulation time≥10 minutes; pneumatic dilatation of an intact biliary sphincter, ≥3 inadvertent pancreatic duct cannulation, opacification of pancreatic acini, or the acquisition of a cytologic specimen from the pancreatic duct with the use of a brush or forceps.</description>
