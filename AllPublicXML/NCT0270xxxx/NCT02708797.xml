  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine with aura (MA) is an independent risk factor for stroke and is associated with
      silent brain infracts and T2 white matter hyperintensities on MRI. Previous studies using
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) have shown an impairment of cerebral autoregulation in MA
      patients. Studies with positron emission tomography have demonstrated an activation of brain
      stem areas during migraine attack. An increased density of brain stem grey matter as measured
      on MRI with voxel based morphometry (VBM) has been found in MA patients. As brain arteries
      and arterioles are innervated by ascending tracts from aminergic brainstem nuclei, th study
      hypothesize a negative correlation between the density of brainstem nuclei and the efficiency
      of cerebral autoregulation in MA patients compared with controls.

      Brainstem grey matter density will be studied with a MRI Philips 3 Tesla with a 32-channel
      antenna and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) cerebral autoregulation will be measured in the
      time domain using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and the Mx method.

      MA patients will be studied in a headache-free period. MRI and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) are
      non-invasive technics and will be performed on the same day.
