  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novelty with the OPEN study is to evaluate the effects of the simple sit-to-stand
      exercise during routine care, in combination with an oral protein-rich supplement, on
      functional status and independence in frail older persons. In this study we will also explore
      the experiences among older persons in the intervention group as wells as among staff of
      promoting the sit-to-stand exercise and nutritional supplement to gain knowledge for
      implementation as a daily routine in nursing homes across Sweden.

      Hypothesis The main hypothesis of the OPEN study is that physical exercise performed as a
      daily routine along with an oral protein-rich supplement, will result in improved functional
      status and independence in everyday life activities and thereby enhance health-related
      quality of life in older persons living in nursing homes. The primary outcome measure for
      functional status will be the number of sit-to-stands that the participant is able to
      complete in 30 seconds.

      Specific aims Aim I: To study the effects of the sit-to-stand exercise combined with an oral
      protein-rich supplement on functional and nutritional status, and health-related quality of
      life, and the frequency and incidence of falls, pressure ulcers and incontinence in older
      persons living in nursing homes. Furthermore, the cost effectiveness of the combination of
      the sit to stand exercise and oral protein-rich supplement vs. the control group will also be
      examined.

      Aim II: To describe the older persons' perceptions of daily being offered to conduct the
      sit-to-stand exercise and to drink the nutritional supplement.

      Aim III: To describe staff's perceptions of supporting the sit-to-stand exercise and the
      nutritional supplement with older persons living in nursing homes.
