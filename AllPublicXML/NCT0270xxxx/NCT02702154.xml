  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare the efficacy and tolerability of 20 Hz vs. 1 Hz vs. sham repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, delivered
      twice daily over 15 days, in patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The
      trial will include structural and functional MRI, EEG, and behavioral measures obtained
      before, during, and after treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria (Patient):

          -  Voluntary and competent to consent to treatment

          -  MINI confirmed diagnosis of MDD

          -  Outpatient

          -  Between the ages of 18-65

          -  Failed to achieve a clinical response to at least one pharmacotherapy or behavioral
             treatment in the current episode.

          -  Have had no increase or initiation of any psychotropic medication in the last 4 weeks
             prior to screening

          -  Must adhere to study assessment and intervention schedule.

          -  Pass the TMS Safety Screening Questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria (Patient):

          -  Have a concomitant major unstable medical illness, cardiac pacemaker or implanted
             medical pump

          -  Have active suicidal intent

             symptoms have a MINI diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress
             disorder (current or within the last year), anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety
             disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder), or dysthymia assessed by a study
             investigator to be primary and causing greater impairment than MDD

          -  Have received rTMS for any previous indication due to the potential compromise of
             subject blinding.
