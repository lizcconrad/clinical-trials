  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to determine the performance characteristics of the Cxbladder test
      for the detection of recurrent urothelial carcinoma (UC) in patients with a recent history of
      urinary tract UC, who have been treated according to standard practice and are undergoing
      routine investigative cystoscopy.

      The gold standard for determination of clinical truth is cystoscopy, plus any follow up
      investigations relating to the current visit.

    <measure>Proportion of participants with bladder cancer who are correctly identified as having cancer (true positives) and no cancer (true negatives) by the Cxbladder test.</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed by 6 months after trial completion.</time_frame>
    <description>The Cxbladder test results will be compared to that of cystoscopy, which is the gold standard method for diagnosing urothelial cancer; the true positive and true negative rates will be measured, along with the false positive and false negative rates of the test. The results will be reported as sensitivity and specificity of the Cxbladder test for detecting urothelial cancer in patients with recurrent disease.</description>

    <description>Performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV) of the Cxbladder test for detecting recurring urothelial cancer will be compared to urine cytology, in addition to the gold standard test (cystoscopy).
