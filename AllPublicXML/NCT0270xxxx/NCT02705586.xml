    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility of a video based mindfulness intervention for stress reduction
      and to evaluate the cortisol response in persons with PD and their caregivers. The data from
      this project will be used for a future grant application of a stress reduction intervention
      in persons with PD.

      Participants will be enrolled at the VA Portland and have a baseline assessment. The baseline
      will assess neurological disorders (including Parkinsonism) and current stress. All
      participants will attend 10 weeks of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) through video
      feed on the Portland VA campus. During the week prior to the first class and the week after
      the last class, participants will complete questionnaires regarding stress, collect saliva
      samples, and, for the Parkinson's patient, monitor motor symptoms of PD using diaries and
      inertial sensors. A final visit will assess stress, neurological diseases, and Parkinsonism.

    <description>Mindfulness focuses on helping participants understand their personal reactions to stress, teaches skills that provide means to modify stress reactions, and promotes self-care and feelings of competence and mastery. In addition to weekly class sessions, participants are asked to do an hour of home practice the days that the class does not meet.</description>
