  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate macrophage activation markers and correlations to liver fibrosis in
      patients with Wilsons Disease. Researchers wish to investigate associations to neurologic and
      metabolic liver function. Researchers will assess this by comparing blood samples with
      fibrosis and liver function analyses. This study provides new insight into macrophages and
      their involvement in Wilsons Disease.
