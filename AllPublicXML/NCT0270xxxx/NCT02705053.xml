    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a study to assess the performance of an automated glucose control
      system (Artificial Pancreas, AP) device in home settings for subjects with type 1 diabetes.
      Specifically, the investigators will test zone model predictive control AP that will be
      enhanced by run-to-run optimizations of basal rates (BR) and insulin to carbohydrate ratios
      (CR).

      This clinical trial is a study to assess the performance of an automated glucose control
      system (Artificial Pancreas, AP) device in home settings for subjects with type 1 diabetes.
      Specifically, the investigators will test zone model predictive control AP that will be
      enhanced by run-to-run optimizations of basal rates (BR) and insulin to carbohydrate ratios
      (CR). This protocol builds on the investigators previously validated Zone-MPC and Health
      Monitoring System (HMS) algorithms (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01929798) integrated into the
      Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) system (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02463682). The same AP system used
      in NCT02463682 will now be used with algorithmic adjustment of CR's prior to closed-loop
      initiation, and continued BR and CR algorithmic optimization during closed-loop use for a
      longer duration.

      The system will be evaluated on up to 12 subjects per site (n=36 subjects) for 15 weeks at 3
      different sites (William Sansum Diabetes Center, University of Virginia, and Mayo Clinic,
      Rochester, MN).

    <description>The artificial pancreas system will be allowed to employ its Model Predictive Control algorithm to make decisions about insulin delivery based on CGM glucose levels. The Health Monitoring System algorithm uses the same CGM data as the MPC control algorithm but utilizes a separate algorithm for trending and predictions of future glucose values. Using a redundant and independent algorithm is an important safety feature of the overall AP device. Algorithmic adjustment of carbohydrate ratios prior to closed-loop initiation, and continued basal rate and carbohydrate ratio algorithmic optimization during closed-loop use will occur.</description>
