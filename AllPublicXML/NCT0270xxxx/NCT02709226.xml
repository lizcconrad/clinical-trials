      Background:

      A glioblastoma is a tumor in the brain. It is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy. However, most people s tumors come back after therapy. When the tumor
      grows back, surgery or chemotherapy may not be possible or may no longer work. Repeat
      radiation therapy or re-irradiation, is an option for treating these tumors when they regrow.

      Objective:

      To find out the safety and highest tolerated dose of re-irradiation for people who have
      recurrent glioblastoma.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 50 who have glioblastoma that has been treated with radiation but has regrown.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      MRI of the brain: They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the brain.

      Participants will have baseline tests before they start therapy. These will include:

      Blood tests

      Neuropsychological tests: These test things like memory, attention, and thinking.

      Quality of life questionnaire

      Eye and hearing tests

      Participants will get a CT of the brain prior to radiation start in order to plan the
      radiation treatment. Once the plan is completed, they will receive radiation once a day
      Monday Friday for a total of 10 17 treatments. They will lie on their back for about 10
      minutes while they get the treatment.

      Participants will be monitored for side effects.

      After they finish treatment, participants will have visits 1, 2, and 3 months later. Then
      they will have them every 2 months for 3 years. These will include:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      MRI of the brain.

      Quality of life questionnaire

      Neuropsychological tests (at some visits)

      After 3 years, participants will be contacted by phone each month.

      Background

        -  Although the survival of gliomas has improved, most high grade gliomas will recur in
           field or adjacent to the treatment field within months to years of the original
           treatment. In newly diagnosed GBM, the concurrent use of radiation and temozolomide is
           standard of care.

        -  Surgical resection upon recurrence is possible in less than 50% of patients. For a
           significant proportion of recurrent glioma patients in whom reresection is not
           favourable and for whom systemic options have been exhausted, re-irradiation has emerged
           as a possible treatment option.

        -  Using modern precision RT techniques (stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic
           radiotherapy (SRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), Rapid Arc
           techniques), re-irradiation has proven a feasible option with possible benefit in
           outcome as these techniques are often able to minimize dose to previously treated organs
           at risk in the field (OAR) and treat the recurrence safely.

        -  Data from multiple retrospective studies has indicated that not only is re-irradiation
           feasible, but it may actually improve survival in the appropriately selected patient.

      Objective

      The primary objective of this phase I study is to determine maximum tolerated re-irradiation
      dose (MTD).

      Eligibility

        -  Recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma

        -  Prior standard radiation therapy to a dose ranging from 50 to 60 Gy at 1.8 to 2 Gy per
           fraction.

        -  Prior irradiation &gt; 12 months from enrollment on protocol.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18.

        -  KPS greater than or equal to 70

      Design

        -  Radiation therapy will be administered daily Monday-Friday at Radiation Oncology Branch
           (ROB), NCI. All the protocol related follow-up appointments will occur at NCI ROB.
           Radiation therapy dose will be administered on consecutive treatment days, 5 fractions
           per week via a linear accelerator using 6 MV photons or greater. Using a 3 plus 3 design
           , and three dose escalation levels, with 6 patients per dose level with 9 total patients
           at the MTD (provided no DLT), a maximum of 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled.

        -  Time to progression will be determined by the interval from initiation of treatment on
           protocol to progression as per RANO criteria.

        -  Neurologic decline without radiographic evidence of tumor will be designated as
           treatment related toxicity. Survival duration will be determined by the interval from
           initiation of treatment on protocol to date of death.

    <description>Dose escalation is as follows: dose level 1 (DL1) 3.5 Gy x 10; dose level 2 (DL2) 3.5 Gy x 12; dose level 3 (DL3) 3.5 Gy x 14.

If 2 DLTs are observed in the third dose level a step down dose of 3.0 Gy x 17 fractions will be tested. The study will have 3 planned reirradiation dose levels, with 1 to 6 patients per dose level using the 3+3 design to define the MTD.

                  NIH or outside pathology.

               2. Patients must be age greater than or equal to 18.

               3. Patients should have a KPS greater than or equal to 70%

               4. Prior standard radiation therapy to a dose ranging from 50 to 60 Gy at 1.8 to 2

               6. Concurrent therapy

                  The concurrent use of bevacizumab is allowed if previously initiated for tumor
                  progression or symptomatic management. Prior temozolomide or other cytotoxic
                  chemotherapy is allowed.

               7. Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and
                  the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

               8. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
                  suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,
                  she should inform her treating physician immediately.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Prior therapy &lt; than 2 weeks since surgical re-resection or biopsy

          2. Pregnant or breast feeding females are excluded due to potential mutagenic effects on

             life threatening infection, cardiac or neurologic events, current hospital admission
             for a coexisting comorbid illness), which would make it impossible for the patient to
             tolerate re-irradiation or systemic chemotherapy or likely to interfere with the
             results.

          5. Patients exhibiting baseline grade 3 or 4 by CTCAE criteria are excluded due to
             difficulty in assigning these to the study intervention as treatment related DLT.

          6. Patients with preexisting known or suspected radiation sensitivity syndromes will be
             excluded due to potential confounding effect on outcome.
