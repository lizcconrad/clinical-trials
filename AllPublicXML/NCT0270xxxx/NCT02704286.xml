  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have created an interactive knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk calculator that
      estimates a user's risk of developing symptomatic knee OA as well as the user's risk for
      undergoing a total knee replacement (TKR) within their lifetime. To test the impact of the
      calculator, the investigators recruited OA-free subjects from Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
      Participants were randomized to either access general information about OA or use the risk
      calculator in addition to accessing general OA information. The investigators hypothesized
      that participants randomized to the risk calculator arm would have more accurate perception
      of their knee OA risk and would have increased willingness to change risky behavior compared
      to the general OA information group.

    <description>The investigators have developed a personalized risk calculator for knee osteoarthritis. This risk calculator uses the Osteoarthritis Policy Model to estimate an individual's risk of developing knee osteoarthritis within their lifetime based on demographic information and risk factors. It shows this information to the user with interactive graphs and compares their risk to the risk of an average American of the same age.</description>
