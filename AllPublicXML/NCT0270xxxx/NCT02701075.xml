      The FDA-approved MC5-A Scrambler Therapy (MC5-A ST) is an electroanalgesia device that
      interferes with pain signal transmission by using nerve fibers as a passive means to convey a
      message of normality (sans pain) to the central nervous system. While preliminary research
      has demonstrated its efficacy in treating chronic neuropathic pain secondary to cancer and
      failed back surgery syndrome, its effectiveness in treating chronic neuropathic pain
      secondary to traumatic musculoskeletal injuries like those experienced in combat has not been
      investigated. The purpose of this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled, study is
      to determine if the MC5-A ST is efficacious in altering the biological, psychological, and
      social components of the chronic neuropathic pain experience in military Service Members
      (SMs) with traumatic musculoskeletal extremity injuries.

    <description>MC5-A Scrambler Therapy is an electroanalgesia device that interferes with pain signal transmission by using nerve fibers as a passive means to convey a no pain message to the central nervous system. Electrodes are placed on dermatomes that correspond to the area of pain. Patient is treated for 30 minutes and given up to 10 treatment sessions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  military service members (active duty &amp; retirees) between the ages of 18 and 79,
             inclusive
