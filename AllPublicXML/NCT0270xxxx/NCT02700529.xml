  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) inhibits lymphangiogenesis in the mouse tail model of lymphedema and is
      elevated in tissue in patients with lymphedema. Ubenimex is an inhibitor of leukotriene A4
      hydrolase (LTA4H), the biosynthetic enzyme for LTB4. This proof-of-concept study is designed
      as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing ubenimex at 150 mg, 3 times
      daily (total daily dose of 450 mg) with placebo for 6 months treatment period in patients
      with leg lymphedema. The primary objectives for the study are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of ubenimex in patients with leg lymphedema

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ubenimex in patients with leg lymphedema

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a diagnosis of secondary leg lymphedema, based on a positive lymphoscintigraphy
             (LSG) study of the affected leg OR has a diagnosis of primary lymphedema not of
             congenital onset affecting one or both lower limbs, based on positive LSG.

          2. Swelling of at least 1 leg not completely reversed by leg elevation or compression.

          3. Stage II or greater lymphedema, based on the International Society of Lymphology (ISL)
             staging system.

          4. Completion of a full course of complete decongestive therapy (CDT).

          5. Stable limb volume (within 10% during screening for worse/affected leg) .

          6. If patient has had a lymphatic vascularization procedure (lymphovenous bypass or lymph
             node transfer) or liposuction for lymphedema in the affected limb, then procedure must
             have been performed at least 1 year (12 months) prior to Screening AND affected limb
             must be clinically stable over the 3 months prior to Screening AND significant
             residual disease must be present.

          7. Ambulatory status (use of a walking aid is permitted).
