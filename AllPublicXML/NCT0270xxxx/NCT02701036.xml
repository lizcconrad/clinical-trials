  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The key goals of SPORTAX-NHS is to compare the phenotype of multiple system atrophy of
      cerebellar type (MSA-C) and sporadic adult onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) and to
      determine the rate of disease progression in both groups including determination of the
      factors that predict the development of MSA-C vs. SAOA, and at which time after onset of
      ataxia, a reliable distinction between both disorders is possible.

      The planned study will also allow to collect blood samples and other biomaterials from
      patients with sporadic ataxia, which will be useful for future genetic and biomarker studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progressive ataxia frequently starts in adults without a familial background. These patients
      may suffer from an acquired ataxia or a genetically determined ataxia despite negative family
      history. In the majority of them, however, a genetic or acquired cause of ataxia cannot be
      identified suggesting a sporadic degenerative ataxia. They can be subdivided into two groups.
      In one group, the underlying brain disease is multiple system atrophy (MSA), specifically MSA
      of cerebellar type (MSA-C). The characteristic clinical feature of MSA is the presence of
      severe autonomic failure defined by orthostatic hypotension or urinary incontinence. The
      second group is distinguished from MSA-C by the lasting absence of severe autonomic failure.
      These patients have been designated as sporadic adult onset ataxia of unknown aetiology
      (SAOA). In the first years after ataxia onset, a distinction between MSA-C and SAOA is often
      not possible.

      There are only few studies comparing the phenotype of MSA-C and SAOA, and longitudinal
      studies focussing on the evolution of the phenotype of these disorders are completely
      lacking. In particular, the progression rate of SAOA compared to MSA-C has not been defined.
      In addition, it is unknown which factors predict the development of MSA-C vs. SAOA, and at
      which time after onset of ataxia, a reliable distinction between both disorders is possible.

      To answer these questions, we plan to create a European registry of patients with sporadic
      degenerative ataxia of adult onset and to perform a natural history study. The planned study
      will also allow to collect blood samples and other biomaterials from patients with sporadic
      ataxia, which will be useful for future genetic and biomarker studies.

    <description>To distinguish between SAOA and MSAc adjusted criteria for multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type on the basis of consensus statement on the diagnostic criteria for MSAc are used (Second consensus statement on the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy: Neurology. 2008 Aug 26; 71(9): 670-676).
Probable MSAc requires a sporadic, progressive adult-onset disorder including rigorously defined autonomic failure and cerebellar ataxia. Possible cerebellar MSA requires a sporadic, progressive adult-onset disease including cerebellar ataxia and at least one feature suggesting autonomic dysfunction plus one other feature that may be a clinical or a neuroimaging abnormality (Babinski sign with hyperreflexia, Stridor, Parkinsonism (bradykinesia and rigidity), Atrophy on MRI of putamen, middle cerebellar peduncle, or pons, Hypometabolism on FDG-PET in putamen, Presynaptic nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation on SPECT or PET. If both criteria are not met patient is classified as a SAOA.</description>

    <description>SAOA denotes the non-hereditary degenerative adult-onset ataxia disorders that are distinct from multiple system atrophy (MSA). SAOA is a group of ataxia of unknown etiology characterized by a slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome starting around the age of 50 years.
