  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CKD-MBD (Chronic Kidney Disease - Mineral and Bone Disorder) is an extensive disease and
      includes dysfunction of the mineral metabolism, the bone metabolism and cardiovascular
      diseases in the context of renal insufficiency. Clinical pictures of peripheral artery
      occlusive disease (PAOD), Coronary artery disease (CAD) and arterial hypertension favours
      among other main risk factors (smoking, obesity, etc.) additional cardiovascular
      complications. For this reason it makes sense to monitor these patients regularly. For this
      purpose the determination of different biomarkers would be appropriate for control of the
      course of disease.

      During various studies the biomarkers FGF23, s-klotho, sclerostin, DKK1, BMP2, YKL-40 und MGP
      were established as indicators for the disease activity, as diagnostic criteria for the
      existence of CKD-MBD or as risk markers for the incidence of adverse events (incl. death)
      within the scope of CKD-MBD. For the clinical routine care application of these parameters
      standard operating procedures (SOP) are missing for the determination method relating to
      optimal pre-analytic and analytic procedures. These analyses are necessary to ensure the
      reproducibility of study results and to transfer these parameters in the clinical daily
      routine for risk stratification.
