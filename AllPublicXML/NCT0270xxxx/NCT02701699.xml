  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in lung cancer using
      a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Hypoxia can influence how lung cancer grows and
      responds to treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The use of PET scans to measure
      hypoxia may be better and simpler than the approaches used previously. This study will assess
      whether or not PET scans can provide useful information about hypoxia in lung cancer.

      In this study, a radiotracer called Fluoroazomycin Arabinoside (FAZA) will be used to measure
      hypoxia in the patient's tumour. FAZA has already been used in many cancers including lung
      cancer. Patients who consent to participate in this trial will receive 1 FAZA PET Scan prior
      to their first radiotherapy treatment
