      This is a prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled study. Patient with CTS were
      randomly assigned to group receiving ultrasound guided steroid injection and group receiving
      ultrasound guided corticosteroid injection and splinting. The steroid injection was using 1ml
      of 10 mg (10mg/ml) triamcinolone acetonide (Shincort) mixed with 1 ml of 2% lidocaine
      hydrochloride (Xylocaine). The inclusion criteria included an age of more than 18 years and
      typical signs of CTS according to American Academy of Neurology criteria lasting for at least
      3 months. The diagnosis of CTS was confirmed by electrophysiological tests.The exclusion
      criteria included the following: presence of thenar atrophy; existence of disorders such as
      hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, or rheumatoid arthritis; any
      accompanying orthopedic or neurologic disorders that could mimic CTS such as cervical
      radiculopathy, polyneuropathy, proximal median nerve entrapment, or thoracic outlet syndrome;
      prior steroid injection into the affected carpal tunnel or carpal tunnel surgery; history of
      distal radius fracture; pregnancy or lactation; regular use of systemic NSAIDs or
      corticosteroids; and known allergy to corticosteroids and local anesthetics.

    <description>or the motor studies, the CMAPs were obtained via surface electrodes placed on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The active recording electrode was placed on the muscle belly, and the reference electrode was placed on the tendon insertion. The median nerve was stimulated 8 cm proximal to the active recording electrode. Distal motor latencies were measured from the onset of stimulus artifact to the onset of the CMAP</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in sensory nerve conduction velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SNAPs were obtained using an antidromic method and recorded by surface electrodes placed at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the index finger for the median nerve and the same joints of the little finger for the ulnar nerve. The median nerves were stimulated at the wrist at a distance of 14 cm from the wrist to the active electrode. Distal sensory latencies were measured from the onset of the stimulus artifact to the onset of the SNAP. SNCV was calculated dividing the distance of 14 cm by the distal sensory latency.</description>

    <description>the CMAPs were obtained via surface electrodes placed on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The active recording electrode was placed on the muscle belly, and the reference electrode was placed on the tendon insertion. The median nerve was stimulated 8 cm proximal to the active recording electrode. The amplitude of CMAP were measured from baseline to negative peak.</description>

    <measure>change from Baseline in Cross sectional area</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CSA of the median nerve was measured using ultrasound at 2 levels: at the carpal tunnel inlet (CSA-I; immediately prior to the proximal margin of the flexor retinaculum) and in the mid-carpal tunnel (CSA-M; at the level of the pisiform bone and scaphoid tubercle). The CSA within the surrounding hyperechoic rim was measured. The CSA was measured using a continuous boundary trace of the nerve and was directly calculated using the area measurement software included with the ultrasonography device</description>

    <measure>change from Baseline in flattening ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The flattening ratio was measured only at the mid-tunnel (FR-M) using ultrasound. FR was calculated by dividing the horizontal diameter of the nerve by the vertical diameter.</description>
