        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The PI and other members of International Chronic Ocular GVHD Consensus Group have
             established the consensus diagnostic criteria and classification for chronic ocular
             GVHD.

        Table 1: Severity scale in chronic ocular GVHD

        Severity scores (points) Schirmer's test (mm) CFS (points) OSDI (points) Conj (points) 0
        &gt;15 0 &lt;13 None

          1. 11-15 &lt;2 13-22 Mild/Moderate

          2. 6-10 2-3 23-32 Severe

          3. ≤5 ≥4 ≥33

        CFS; corneal fluorescein staining, OSDI; Ocular Surface Disease Index. Conj; conjunctival
        injection. Severity classification; Total score (points); (Schirmer's test score+ CFS
        score+ OSDI score+ Conj injection score) = None;0-4, Mild/Moderate; 5-8, Severe, 9-11.

        Table 2: Diagnosis of chronic ocular GVHD None (points) Probable GVHD (points) Definite
        GVHD (points) Systemic GVHD(−) 0-5 6-7 ≥8 Systemic GVHD(+) 0-3 4-5 ≥6

        Based on these criteria (Tables 1 and 2),40 patients with definite ocular GVHD will be
        enrolled. Additionally, all of the following criteria should be met to be eligible for the
        study:

          -  Aged 18 years or older.

          -  Capable of giving informed consent and does provide informed consent.

          -  Schirmer I &lt;10

          -  Corneal/ conjunctival (Rose Bengal) staining ≥1

          -  Ocular symptoms must be considered as annoying or activity limiting (OSDI ≥13; mild).

          -  Women must be post-menopausal ≥ 1 year, or surgically sterilized. If not, a negative
             urine pregnancy test is required within 14 days of receiving her first dose of test
             medication (placebo/ study drug) along with definite evidence of contraceptive use
             during the duration of the study. Women of reproductive age should use a method of
             birth control that is acceptable to the subject and the study doctor. This may include
             oral contraceptive pills, birth control implants, barrier methods or abstinence. If a
             subject mentions she suspects she may be pregnant after being enrolled, another
             pregnancy test will be administered. If the test is positive, she will be discontinued
             from the study immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will not be eligible for the study if any of the following criteria are met:

               -  Allergic to rhDNase I or any similar products, or recipient of rhDNase I eye
                  drops 0.1%.

               -  Receiving or have received within 30 days any experimental systemic medication.

               -  Active ocular infection or ocular allergies.

               -  Any history of eyelid surgery or ocular surgery within the past 3 months.

               -  Corneal epithelial defect larger than 1 mm2 in either eye.

               -  Have active drug/alcohol dependence or abuse history.

               -  Vulnerable populations, such as neonates, pregnant women, children, prisoners,
                  institutionalized individuals, or others who may be considered vulnerable
                  populations.
