  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In neurosurgical anesthesia, propofol based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is frequently
      used due to brain relaxation and less effect on electrophysiologic monitoring. Response to
      propofol can vary between individuals and be associated with clinical factors including age
      and weight, and genetic polymorphism. Because the importance of rapid recovery in
      neurosurgery with long operation time is emphasized recently, the choice and dose adjustment
      of anesthetics should be determined according to clinical and genetic factors. Recently,
      researches about genetic variations have been performed with single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP). The aim of this study is to determine SNPs associated with propofol recovery and
      response in Korean adult population undergoing propofol based TIVA for clipping of unruptured
      cerebral aneurysm.

    <description>This study is an observational study performed in adult patients undergoing propofol based TIVA for clipping of unruptured cerebral aneurysm. We will collect data regarding recovery after stopping propofol infusion (time for eye opening and extubation), propofol requirement during anesthesia maintenance, and propofol effect site concentration to achieve bispectral index 40 during anesthesia induction, without doing any interventions. Data collection will be established with just observing and recording values displayed in screens of monitoring devices, and reviewing patient charts.</description>
