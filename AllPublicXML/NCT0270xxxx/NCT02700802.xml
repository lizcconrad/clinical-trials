    <textblock>
      The Feed1st proposed program of research will promote health of informal caregivers with a
      hospitalized child by testing a self-management intervention that addresses the widely
      overlooked problem of caregiver hunger. As many as 54% of parents and other informal
      caregivers of hospitalized children struggle with insufficient food to nourish themselves and
      their family during and after a hospital stay. Hunger impairs caregiver physical and mental
      health by depleting energy for self-care, emotional self-regulation, and supportive
      interactions with the child, the family, and the formal caregiver team. The long-term
      objective of the Feed1st program is to alleviate hunger and food insecurity among families
      with hospitalized children. Established in partnership with nursing and chaplaincy leadership
      at our children's hospital and the Greater Chicago Food Depository, the Feed1st program
      currently operates self-serve food pantries on four inpatient units and the emergency
      department in our children's hospital on Chicago's South Side. Since 2010, Feed1st has
      provided nearly 8500 pounds of food to at least 4,000 individuals and 1500 households via the
      self-serve food pantries in the children's hospital. Over this same period, our team has also
      created a system for efficiently connecting families to community-based resources for hunger
      and other basic needs.

    <description>Feed1st is a unique hospital-based hunger mitigation program that, since 2010, has operated low-cost, self-serve food pantries at Comer Children's Hospital. All parents and caregivers with a hospitalized child have 24/7 free access to these self-serve pantries with the option to eat food in the pantry, carry out as much food as needed, and contribute back to the pantry with food, volunteerism, or other resources. The program also offers free phone/text/email navigation for food support and other basic needs resources. We aim to conduct a 3-arm, randomized comparative effectiveness study to evaluate the impact, versus usual care, of two alternative referral strategies to increase Feed1st program utilization and impact.</description>
