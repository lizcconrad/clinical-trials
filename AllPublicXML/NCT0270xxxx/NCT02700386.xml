  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is being done to learn more about a particular dose of radiation treatment
      for breast cancer that is completed in a shorter amount of time than what has traditionally
      been used to treat breast cancer. Subjects are being asked to be in this research study
      because they have already had surgery for breast cancer and some cancer cells were found in
      their lymph nodes that drain the breast tissue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who join the study will receive a shortened course of radiation treatment that will
      last approximately four (4) weeks, instead of the traditional six (6) week course that women
      have typically received in this situation. The shorter course subjects will receive is
      designed in a way that it is thought to be equivalent to the longer course. This shorter
      course has already been shown to be very safe and effective when treating breast cancer in
      the breast tissue only. However, because cancer cells were found in the lymph nodes that
      drain their breast, subjects require radiation to a larger area of their chest, armpit, and
      shoulder than has been completely tested with this experimental dose.

    <description>Adjuvant Hypofractionated Radiation (4005 cGy) will last 3-4 weeks with 15 treatments, +/- 4 additional fractions as a boost. Radiation should commence within 180 days of the date of primary surgery. Four additional fractions (a &quot;boost&quot; or &quot;conedown&quot;) to areas deemed to be at particularly high risk of recurrence may be added at the end of the radiation course. Fraction size for the boost treatment will continue at 267 cGy for an additional 1068 cGy in four fractions.</description>

    <description>Hypofractionation is the delivery of radiotherapy in single daily doses greater than the 180-200 cGy. Hypofractionation, through use of larger doses per fraction and fewer total treatments, is a method of shortening overall treatment time in breast cancer therapy.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult women (â‰¥18 years old) with breast cancer who have undergone surgery for their
             primary breast tumor (either lumpectomy or mastectomy +/- reconstruction) and are
             confirmed to have involved lymph nodes on surgical pathology.

          2. Patient who have undergone either a total mastectomy or a lumpectomy are eligible.
             Acceptable procedures for assessment of axillary nodal status at the time of surgery
             include:

               -  axillary node dissection;

               -  sentinel node biopsy alone; or

               -  sentinel node biopsy followed by axillary node dissection.

          3. Eligible women include (American Joint Committee on Cancer) AJCC 7th ed. Stage cN0 or
             cN1 subsequently staged after surgery as Stage pIB (N1mic), pIIA, pIIB, pIIIA, or
             pIIIB: note that ypN0 will also be eligible if pathologic confirmation of nodal
             involvement was documented prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the patient was found
             to be node negative at the time of surgery. Note that women less than 50 years of age,
             women who received chemotherapy, patients staged as pN0 (i+ or mol+), and
             large-breasted women are eligible for enrollment.

          4. The patient must have recovered from surgery with the incision completely healed and
             no signs of infection. If adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, chemotherapy-related
             toxicity that may interfere with delivery of radiation therapy should have resolved.
             The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             of 0 or 1 (KPS &gt;70%).

          5. The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer (including re-excision of
             margins) and randomization must be no more than 180 days if chemotherapy is not
             delivered adjuvantly. If adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, the interval between
             the last chemotherapy treatment and randomization must be no more than 180 days.

          6. Before the patient is enrolled, the consent form, including any addenda, must be
             signed and dated by the patient and the person who explains the study to that patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. patients &lt;18 years old

          2. pregnant women

          3. male patients

          4. women with T4 disease, including inflammatory breast cancer

          5. women who have declined or otherwise not received preceding surgery

          6. women with positive margins after primary surgery

          7. women with node negative disease

          8. women without histologic confirmation of nodal involvement

          9. women more than 180 days out from primary breast surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy

         10. patients with clinically detected or suspicious lymph node involvement not readily
             amenable to surgical treatment (â‰¥cN2 disease)

         11. patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancers

         12. patients with prior ipsilateral thoracic or breast radiation

         13. patients with distant metastatic disease (cM1) or a life expectancy of less than 5
             years

         14. active collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a creatine
             phosphokinase (CPK) level above normal or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus
             erythematosis, or scleroderma.

         15. other non-malignant systemic disease that would preclude the patient from receiving
             study treatment or would prevent required follow-up.

         16. patients with psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study
             requirements.

         17. patients with a separate non-cutaneous cancer diagnosis for which the patient has not
             been without evidence of disease for at least 5 years

        Note: women &lt;50 years of age, women who received chemotherapy, pN0 (i+ or mol+), and
        large-breasted women are eligible for enrollment.
