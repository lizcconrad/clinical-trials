    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the association between gastric acid
      suppression and relief of 24 hour heartburn following treatment with the proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI) drug esomeprazole in frequent heartburn patients.

    <time_frame>Day 8 up to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Relief of 24 hour heartburn was defined as a daily diary response of &quot;0&quot; to the question &quot;Over the last 24 hours (yesterday and last night), what was the severity of your most intense episode of heartburn?&quot; on at least 6 of the participant's last 7 consecutive days [Days 8 - 14] of treatment allowing for one day with a maximum severity of &quot;2&quot;.The response was noted by participants in the diary for last 7 consecutive days [Day 8 - 14] on a 3 point scale ranged from 0 to 2 where 0= complete relief and 2= maximum severity. Higher score indicated worse condition/more severity. In this outcome measure, participants with relief of 24 hour heartburn and participants without relief of 24 hour heartburn were reported.</description>

    <description>Percentage of time was calculated over the 24 hour period during which intra gastric pH &gt;4 was observed. Relief of 24 hour heartburn was defined as a daily diary response of &quot;0&quot; to the question &quot;Over the last 24 hours (yesterday and last night), what was the severity of your most intense episode of heartburn?&quot; on at least 6 of the participant's last 7 consecutive days [Days 8 - 14] of treatment allowing for one day with a maximum severity of &quot;2&quot;.The response was noted by participants in the diary for last 7 consecutive days [Day 8 - 14] on a 3 point scale ranged from 0 to 2 where 0= complete relief and 2= maximum severity. Higher score indicated worse condition/more severity. In this outcome, change from baseline at Day 14 in percentage of time over the 24 hour period during which intra gastric pH &gt;4 was observed, was reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed symptom history of heartburn, acid regurgitation, or epigastric pain of at
             least 3 months, while treating with gastric acid modulating therapy (antacids, H2
             receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and/or PPIs).

          -  Heartburn symptoms that average 3 times per week or greater including at least 2
             episodes of nighttime heartburn symptoms per week over the past 30 days.

          -  When heartburn medications were used, subject had heartburn symptoms that were
             responsive to antacids, non prescription H2RAs, or short term non prescription or
             prescription PPIs at approved doses but complete resolution of heartburn was not
             achieved.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history (past or present) of erosive esophagitis verified by endoscopy.

          -  The need for continuous treatment with H2RAs, PPIs, gastric prokinetic drugs, or

        <description>Relief of 24 hour heartburn was defined as a daily diary response of “0” to the question “Over the last 24 hours (yesterday and last night), what was the severity of your most intense episode of heartburn?” on at least 6 of the participant’s last 7 consecutive days [Days 8 – 14] of treatment allowing for one day with a maximum severity of “2”.The response was noted by participants in the diary for last 7 consecutive days [Day 8 – 14] on a 3 point scale ranged from 0 to 2 where 0= complete relief and 2= maximum severity. Higher score indicated worse condition/more severity. In this outcome measure, participants with relief of 24 hour heartburn and participants without relief of 24 hour heartburn were reported.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Relief of 24 Hour Heartburn and Without Relief of 24 Hour Heartburn</title>
          <description>Relief of 24 hour heartburn was defined as a daily diary response of “0” to the question “Over the last 24 hours (yesterday and last night), what was the severity of your most intense episode of heartburn?” on at least 6 of the participant’s last 7 consecutive days [Days 8 – 14] of treatment allowing for one day with a maximum severity of “2”.The response was noted by participants in the diary for last 7 consecutive days [Day 8 – 14] on a 3 point scale ranged from 0 to 2 where 0= complete relief and 2= maximum severity. Higher score indicated worse condition/more severity. In this outcome measure, participants with relief of 24 hour heartburn and participants without relief of 24 hour heartburn were reported.</description>
          <population>Per protocol analysis set included all randomized participants who provided valid data for Day -1 PH monitoring, take at least one dose of randomized study medication, complete the 14 day treatment phase, undergo and provide valid data for Day 14 pH monitoring and complete at least 5 days of diary entries in each of Days -7 to -1 and Days 8 to 14.</population>

Relief of 24 hour heartburn was defined as a daily diary response of “0” to the question “Over the last 24 hours (yesterday and last night), what was the severity of your most intense episode of heartburn?” on at least 6 of the participant’s last 7 consecutive days [Days 8 – 14] of treatment allowing for one day with a maximum severity of “2”.The response was noted by participants in the diary for last 7 consecutive days [Day 8 – 14] on a 3 point scale ranged from 0 to 2 where 0= complete relief and 2= maximum severity.
