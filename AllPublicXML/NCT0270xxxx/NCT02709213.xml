      The aetiologies of computed tomography-diagnosed acute colitis remain surprisingly unknown.
      Moreover, no diagnostic tool or clinical score allow to quickly determine or at least
      stratify the exact cause of colitis in patients admitted at an Emergency Ward and to direct
      them to the appropriate therapeutic care. The aims of the present study are to describe the
      presentation and aetiologies of acute colitis, and to develop diagnostic methods to guide
      patients admitted for acute colitis to the appropriate therapeutic care, particularly
      colonoscopy.

      Introduction:

      Colitis is a generic term that refers to an inflammation of a segment of the colonic tract
      confirmed by computed tomography [1]. This pathology represents approximately 100-150
      admissions per year in the Division of Digestive Surgery of the University Hospitals of
      Geneva.

      The aetiologies of colitis are numerous and include all pathologies having the ability to
      cause the inflammation and thickening of the colon wall. Aetiologies affect therapeutic care,
      since patients with infectious colitis will improve with appropriate antibiotics, those with
      inflammatory chronic bowel disease will require the introduction of an immunosuppressive
      therapy, and those with ischaemic colitis will only need supportive treatment and careful
      evaluation to detect any progression to bowel perforation that would prompt for surgery.

      However, the literature is dramatically poor regarding the presentation of patients suffering
      from colitis and in identifying factors predicting aetiologies. To our knowledge, only 3
      studies reported the results of colonoscopies performed in patients with colon wall
      thickening diagnosed by computed tomography [2-4], and only 1 of them studied patients with
      colon wall thickening admitted in emergency. Wolff et al. analysed the results of
      colonoscopies performed in 107 patients out of 786 with computed tomography evidence of
      colonic thickening. They reported the following diagnoses: ischaemic colitis in 36.4%,
      infectious colitis in 15%, chronic inflammatory bowel disease in 9.3% and colorectal
      carcinoma in 7.4% of patients. No diagnosis was found in 26.1% of patients, which therefore
      had undetermined colitis [3]. This study highlights the importance of achieving colonoscopy
      in patients with colon wall thickening, considering the reported prevalences of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (9.3%) and tumours (7.4%). However, this study provided no information
      regarding the early identification of patients needing endoscopy. Moreover, we can note that
      the proportions cited by the authors are based on the population who underwent colonoscopy (n
      = 107) and not the 786 patients with colon wall thickening on computed tomography, which
      constitutes a significant selection bias. Finally, it is not stated what happened to patients
      without endoscopic assessment, who represented the majority of subjects of the eligible
      population. Similarly, no study investigated the species and proportions of pathogenic
      bacteria in stools of patients suffering from infectious colitis. Nevertheless, the
      prevalence of bacterial pathogens found during major episodes of diarrhoea was described by
      studies that referred to episodes of gastroenteritis. In a review of 877 episodes of bloody
      diarrhoea with a stool culture completion rate of 63%, a bacterial pathogen was found in 31%
      of cases and included: Shigella spp. 15.3%, Campylobacter spp. 6.2%, Salmonella spp. 5.8%, E.
      coli 0157: H7, 2.6% and others 1.6% [5]. Similarly, a review of 30,000 stool cultures
      performed in 10 US hospitals between 1990 and 1992 identified a bacterial pathogen in 5.6% of
      cases, with the following findings: Campylobacter spp. 2.3%, Salmonella spp.1.8%, Shigella
      spp. 1.1% and E. coli 0157: H7 0.4% [6]. The low proportion of positive cultures might
      reflect the low sensitivity of standard stool cultures. The PCR technique is more suitable,
      since its sensitivity to detect Shigella and entero-hemorragic E. coli is 96% for a
      specificity of 100%, versus 54% and 100% for culture, respectively [7].

      Therefore, the respective prevalences of the different aetiologies of colitis remain
      surprisingly unknown. Similarly, no diagnostic tool or clinical score allow to quickly
      determine or at least stratify the exact cause of colitis in patients admitted in the
      Emergency Ward and to direct them to the appropriate therapeutic care. This lack of
      scientific evidences has significant implications for the management of patients admitted for
      acute colitis in terms of hospitalization, prescription of antibiotics, endoscopy and
      hospital costs. For instance, at the University Hospitals of Geneva, all patients admitted
      with a diagnosis of computed tomography-proven colitis are subjected to broad-spectrum
      antibiotics associated with a 5-10 days hospitalisation for monitoring and investigations.
      Patients with negative microbiological examination of the stools benefit from colonoscopy, a
      procedure that carries significant risks of complications [8] and generates high costs.
      Moreover, the difficulties in the early identification of patients requiring endoscopy for
      suspected inflammatory chronic bowel disease or cancer may delay or even contribute to miss
      these diagnoses, especially if the acute phase of inflammatory chronic bowel disease has
      passed [9].

      The recent emergence of PCR-based multi-array assays, such as FilmArray (Biofire Diagnostics,
      Salt Lake City, USA), showing high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of many
      bacterial, parasitic or viral pathogens [10], could constitute a significant advance in the
      field of aetiological research for colitis. The consequences could be of significant
      importance, such as: 1) decreasing the number of false-negative bacterial cultures and
      preventing the realization of further costly and potentially dangerous investigations, such
      as colonoscopy, and 2) guiding antibiotic therapy. Similarly, faecal calprotectin, which is a
      protein produced by neutrophils that accumulates in stools in case of bowel inflammation or
      infection shows recent applications in the early diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases
      (calprotectin showed a 93% sensitivity and a 86% specificity to distinguish inflammatory
      bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome [11]) and for detection of recurrence of both
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [12-14]. Moreover, calprotectin values were described
      to be increased in stools during bacterial diarrhoea [15] or colorectal cancer. Therefore,
      extending the application of faecal calprotectin to patients diagnosed with colitis but with
      negative microbiological examination of the stools might help in distinguishing those
      requiring endoscopy (high calprotectin values) from those not requiring further
      investigations (low calprotectin values), with the potentiality of decreasing the risk of
      iatrogenic complications and realizing substantial savings.

      The present study aimed to describe the presentation and aetiologies of colitis, and to
      develop diagnostic methods to guide patients admitted for acute colitis to the appropriate
      therapeutic care, with the objective to generate savings by shortening hospital stays and by
      better prescribing additional tests, including colonoscopy. We thought that an adequate and
      early patient stratification has important medical and economical values in this setting.

      Aims:

        1. To determine the aetiologies of a first episode of acute colitis

        2. To identify anamnestic, clinical and biological predicting factors for patients
           requiring colonoscopy

      Methods:

      All patients admitted in the Emergency Department with a diagnosis of acute colitis were
      included in the cohort if they met the following criteria:

      Inclusion criteria:

      ≥18 year old, French speaking, Informed consent, Consultation at the Emergency Department,
      Episode of acute colitis (≥1 symptom compatible with an acute colitis (Fever≥38°C ± acute
      abdominal pain ± diarrhoea) + colon wall thickening at computed tomography)

      Exclusion criteria:

      Another diagnostic evoked by the radiologist (diverticulitis, tumour), Patient with a
      positive history for: chronic inflammatory bowel disease ± colorectal cancer ±
      immunosuppression ± abdominal ascites, Refusal of investigations

      Variables related to patients presentation at admission were detailed and collected,
      regarding anamnesis (age, gender, acute abdominal pain ≤7 days, diarrhoea, haematochezia,
      antibiotics ≤ 4 weeks, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ≤ 2 weeks, familial history of
      chronic inflammatory bowel disease), clinical examination (vital signs, abdominal status,
      digital rectal examination) and para-clinical investigations (haemoglobin, leukocytes,
      neutrophils, C-reactive protein, computed tomography). Results of the investigations
      performed during hospitalization were collected (routine microbiological examination of the
      stools for Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.; PCR for Clostridium
      difficile; colonoscopy). A detailed microbiological examination of the stools was performed
      using the FilmArray assay (detection of 22 gastro-intestinal pathogens: 13 bacteria, 4
      parasites and 5 viruses). Stool samples were collected and stored in a -80°C freezer.
      Determination of faecal calprotectin will be performed every month at Unilabs. Aetiologies of
      colitis were described using proportions, with special attention given to pathogens causing
      infectious colitis. Presentations of patients were described and compared for every
      aetiology. Predictors of &quot;positive&quot; colonoscopy (inflammatory bowel disease, cancer) were
      identified using univariate and multivariate logistic or linear regression, analysing
      variables collected at admission and faecal calprotectin, when appropriate. The diagnostic
      value of the FilmArray assay was compared to the usual microbiological examination of the
      stools (as prescribed by the physician in charge) and to the gold-standard (any positive
      examination).

    <description>Determination of the aetiologies of colitis and classification into one of the following categories (in %): infectious colitis (bacterial, parasitic or viral), chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, other), ischemic colitis and iatrogenic colitis (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other). In first intention, the routine microbiological examination of the stools usually performed (PCR assay looking for Shigella spp., Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp.; PCR for Clostridium difficile as well as cultures for Vibrio spp. and Yersinia spp. (in option)) will be completed with a high-sensitivity multi-array PCR assay (FilmArray). If the routine microbiological examination of the stools yields to the absence of a potential pathogen, a colonoscopy will be performed to look for: 1) a tumour, 2) a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, or 3) an ischaemic colitis. Patients in whom no aetiology can be found will be given a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis.</description>
