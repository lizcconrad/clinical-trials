      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a specific aquatic therapy program
      on balance with a land-based physical-treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease and to
      evaluate the long-term effects in a 6-month follow-up period.

      Background: Balance dysfunction (BD) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disabling sign leading
      to falls which have a negative impact on the quality of life. It is known that aquatic
      therapy could be useful to train balance given its physical features and for reducing
      patients' fear of falls. Many studies have evaluated the efficacy of land-based physiotherapy
      in treatment of BD, but few studies have investigated the efficacy of aquatic therapy on
      balance and none of those assessed clinical measurements in a clinically, relevant follow-up
      period.

      Objective: The aim of study was to compare the effectiveness of a specific aquatic therapy
      program on balance with a land-based physical-treatment in patients with PD and to evaluate
      the long-term effects in a 6-month follow-up period.

      Methods: Thirty-four patients with PD in medium-stage of disease were randomized into two
      groups: 17 underwent Multidisciplinary-Intensive-Rehabilitation-Treatment (MIRT) and 17
      underwent MIRT associated with aquatic therapy protocol (MIRT-AT). Investigators assessed the
      Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II-III, and Timed
      Up Go test (TUG) in both groups at admission, discharge and after a 6-months follow-up
      period.

    <description>Individuals underwent Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment. It consists of 4 weeks of physical therapy in a hospital setting with four daily sessions for five days and one hour of physical exercise on the sixth day.The duration of each session is about one hour. The first session comprises cardiovascular warm-up activities, relaxation and muscle-stretching. The second session includes aerobic exercises and the use of different devices: a stabilometric platform, treadmill plus, crossover, cycloergometer. The third is a session of occupational therapy. The last session includes one hour of speech therapy. The rehabilitation program can also include: robotic-assisted walking training, virtual reality training and meetings with a Psychologist.</description>

    <description>Patients underwent land-based therapy in association with aquatic therapy, three times per week for four weeks.
The land-based activities included the second and the third session of MIRT.
The water sessions were divided in 3 phases:
i) Warm Up Exercises. This phase lasted 10 minutes and comprised walking performances.
ii) Central session Training. This phase lasted 30-45 minutes and comprised trunk mobility exercises in standing position and sitting on a floating device, static and dynamic exercises. The successive balance training exercises comprised: maintaining balance with closed eyes; balance control with one leg resting on a step; postural control changing the support base.
iii) Cool-down. This phase lasted 5 minutes and comprised general stretching exercises and gentle walking.</description>
