      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of
      TAK-828 in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-828. TAK-828 is being tested to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) of single oral doses
      of TAK-828 in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 36 healthy participants. An interleaving crossover design
      with placebo substitution will be used for Cohorts 1-3. Each cohort will consist of 12
      participants, randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to a treatment sequence to
      receive TAK-828 or placebo after undergoing a fasting stage of at least 8 hours through
      intervention periods 1-4 for Cohorts 1 and 2 and through intervention periods 1 - 3 for
      Cohort 3. The assigned treatment sequence will remain undisclosed to the participant and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need). An additional
      interventional period 5 (fed state) is planned to be conducted in either cohort 1 or 2, based
      on the dose of TAK-828 that will be chosen to be studied under fed conditions. Cohorts 1 and
      2 were conducted in non-Japanese participants and Cohort 3 in Japanese participants.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in The United States. Participants will remain
      confined to the study site from check-in (Day -1) through Day 4 of each intervention period
      and will return 7 to 10 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
