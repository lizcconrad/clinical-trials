    <textblock>
      Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) remains the number one cause of perinatal mortality in many
      countries, including the United States. Multiple gestations are at increased risk of SPTB. A
      short cervical length (CL) on transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) has been shown to be a good
      predictor of SPTB, in both singletons and twins.

      The cervical pessary is a silicone device that has been used to prevent SPTB. The efficacy of
      the cervical pessary has been assessed in several populations including singletons with short
      CL, unselected twins, twins with short CL, and triplet pregnancies. Several randomized
      clinical trials (RCTs) have been published, and several are ongoing. However, no consensus on
      use of the cervical pessary in pregnancy or guidelines for management have been assessed.
