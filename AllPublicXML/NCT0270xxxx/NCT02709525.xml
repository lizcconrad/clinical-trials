    <description>During the postoperative interval of 30 days, the patients underwent cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Five central transverse scan images were captured from each socket. Using the KS300 software, the gray intensity was measured in each image and the results were expressed as mean percentage of bone formation</description>

    <description>During the postoperative interval of 30 days, the patients underwent cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Five central transverse scan images were captured from each socket. The pattern of the alveolar trabecular bone was also evaluated through the fractal dimension in each image.</description>
