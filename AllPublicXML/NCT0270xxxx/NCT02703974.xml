  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will collect and analyze quantitative data regarding handwashing behaviors among
      school-aged children to determine the impact of nudges compared to handwashing and hygiene
      education programs.

      Based on the success of the preliminary pilot, we hypothesize nudges leading to higher rates
      of handwashing than traditional handwashing and hygiene education programs.

    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a cluster-randomized trial design to collect quantitative data and
      analyze the handwashing behaviors of school-aged children.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to assess nudges as a viable method of promoting
      handwashing among school-aged children.

      The specific objectives of this quantitative exploration are to:

        1. Determine if nudges can prompt significant behavior change and result in higher rates of
           handwashing among school-aged children in Bangladesh

        2. Determine if behavior change resulting from nudging is sustainable over time

    <description>Students will be randomized into Nudge intervention or Hygiene Education intervention at the completion of data collection in week 6, and the change in probability, or prevalence ratio, will be assessed over time, with measures at weeks 4-5, weeks 6-7, week 12, weeks 18-19 and weeks 24-25, comparing the probability of handwashing of nudge students post-toileting event to that of hygiene education students post-toileting event, measured using camera observations of the handwashing station outside of the latrine area.</description>

    <description>Students will be randomized into early handwashing station intervention (built in weeks 1-2) or late handwashing station intervention (built in weeks 3 and 4), and the change in probability, or prevalence ratio, will be assessed at week 2-3 and week 4-5, comparing the probability of handwashing of the early handwashing station students post-toileting event to that of the late handwashing station students post-toileting event, measured using camera observations of the handwashing station outside of the latrine area.</description>

    <description>In order to assess if the timing of the handwashing station building influences handwashing, the change in probability, or prevalence ratio, will be assessed over time, with observations at weeks 4-5, weeks 6-7, week 12, weeks 18-19 and weeks 24-25 within the Nudge group, comparing the probability of handwashing among students who received the early handwashing station (built in weeks 1 and 2) to the probability of handwashing among those students who received the late handwashing stations (built in weeks 3 and 4), measured using camera observations of the handwashing station outside of the latrine area.</description>

    <description>Hand hygiene education-based program: the hygiene promotion element will include a one month program of handwashing education involving weekly facilitator led sessions. Each session will be about 30-45 minutes long, and will cover the following topics:
Importance of handwashing
Method of handwashing
Critical times of handwashing
Finding solutions for handwashing in school and at home The sessions will involve use of flipcharts, and other IEC materials (e.g. videos) and participative learning methods.
The Hand hygiene education-based program will begin at the beginning of weeks 4 and 5, after Phase II data collection is complete in each randomly assigned education school.</description>
