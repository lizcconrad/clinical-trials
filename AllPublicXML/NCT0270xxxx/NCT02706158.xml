      Aims: Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia frequency is 2-8% from all pregnancies. Dietary factors and
      dietary status have been suggested to play a role in development of preeclampsia. Low intake
      of nutrients such as calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, omega 3 fatty acids, is related to
      increased risk of preeclampsia. Also high triglyceride levels, high BMI, low Omega 6: omega 3
      ratio and high calories consumption are possible risk factors.

      Material and Methods: A prospective study will be carried out. Woman medically diagnosed as
      high risk for preeclampsia will randomly be assigned to dietary treatment or no dietary
      treatment groups. In the dietary treatment group, besides medical care, all woman will get
      calcium and vitamin D supplementation from 8th to 16th gestational weeks, and thereafter
      until delivery personal extensive nutritional guidance. A 3 day food diary will be collected
      at inclusion and thereafter at Gestational weeks 16 and 28. All routinely collected data
      during pregnancy (blood tests, weight, blood pressure and preeclampsia symptoms) will be
      documented.

      In both groups incidence of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, blood pressure and protein in urine
      will be recorded.
