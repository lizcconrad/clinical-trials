  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have shown that patient transfer is a risk factor for back pain, back
      injuries and long term sickness absence, whereas consistent use of assistive devices during
      patient transfer is associated with reduced risk of back injury. In consequence, Danish
      hospitals have made great efforts to increase knowledge, availability and use of assistive
      devices to reduce work-related physical strain due to patient transfer. Yet, a recent survey
      among more than 300 nurses and nurses' aides showed that two thirds rarely uses assistive
      devices during patient transfer. Thus it seems relevant to investigate barriers,
      opportunities and practical solutions for increasing use of assistive devices among
      healthcare workers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a participatory organizational
      intervention for improved use of assistive devices during patient transfer.

    <time_frame>Average use during the entire 1-year follow-up (i.e. continous measurement during 1 year) adjusted for use during 4 weeks prior to the intervention (baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The healthcare workers are encouraged to push one of the following two buttons every time they leave the room after having performed patient transfer; button 1 &quot;Press this button if you used the necessary assistive devices for your patient transfer&quot; and button 2 &quot;Press this button if you did not use the necessary assistive devices for your patient transfer&quot;. The number of Button 1 counts as a percentage of total counts (Button 1+2) will be calculated for set of counters and used as primary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Use of assistive devices (accelerometer)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 1-year follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Accelerometers will be placed on the assistive devices. The method is currently being validated in the laboratory and will be finalized before initiation of the 1 year follow-up measurement. Accelerations of a certain time frame will be defined as &quot;use&quot;, whereas brief accelerations will be considered as noise</description>

    <description>Pain intensity in the low-back is rated subjectively using a 0-10 modified VAS scale, where 0 indicates &quot;no pain at all&quot; and 10 indicate &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;</description>
