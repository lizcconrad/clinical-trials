      Objectives:

      Objective 1: Conduct focus group discussions with 15 adolescents in order to design
      game-based social activities (GSA's) aiming to reduce smoking curiosity and increase positive
      connections.

      Objective 2: Through a short-term pilot evaluation, compare the use of &quot;a smoking prevention
      interactive experience (ASPIRE) alone (ASPIRE group) with the use of GSAs along with ASPIRE
      (GSA-ASPIRE group).

      Hypothesis 2.1: Adolescents in the GSA-ASPIRE group will be more likely to decrease in their
      intention to smoke, when compared with adolescents in the ASPIRE group.

      Hypothesis 2.2: Adolescents in the GSA-ASPIRE group will be more likely to (a) reduce in
      smoking curiosity and (b) engage in positive social influence, when compared with adolescents
      in the ASPIRE group.

      Exploratory hypothesis 2.3: (a) Smoking curiosity and (b) Positive social influence are
      related to the decrease in intention to smoke.

      Objective 3: Conduct in-depth interviews with 15 adolescents in order to obtain feedback on
      how GSAs can be best improved as part of future research.

      Objective 1:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, they will complete &quot;screening tests&quot; to
      help researchers decide if they are eligible to take part in this study. During Screening,
      information about participant's smoking habits, age, and how they feel about their friends
      and the after school program they are in will be collected.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will complete up to 2
      parts of this study during their after school program:

      Part 1:

      For Part 1, participant will complete a survey about their mental and physical health and
      their opinions about health information and the internet. The survey should take about 15-20
      minutes to complete.

      Part 2:

      If the results of participant's survey show that they are still eligible, they will complete
      Part 2 of this study. Participant will take part in a group discussion called a focus group
      with 5 other participants. During the focus group session, participant will share their
      thoughts about what kinds of group activities they think are effective and they will be asked
      to design group activities along with other study participants. The focus group should take
      about 40 minutes to complete.

      Length of Study:

      Participation in this study will be over after participant has completed either the survey or
      the focus group, depending on their eligibility.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 145 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 15 participants will be enrolled
      in Parts 1 and 2 of the study.

      Objective 2:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will complete up to 4
      parts of this study during their after school program:

      Part 1:

      For Part 1, participant will complete a survey about their mental and physical health and
      their opinions about health information and the internet. The survey should take about 15-20
      minutes to complete.

      If the results of participant's survey show that they are still eligible, they will continue
      to Parts 2, 3, and 4 of the study.

      Part 2:

      For Part 2, participant will complete a survey about their friends at the program.
      Participant will be asked who their best friends are and who their leaders are at the
      program. The survey should take about 15-20 minutes to complete.

      Part 3:

      For Part 3, participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study
      groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse
      than the other group. Participant will have a 1 in 2 chance of being in either Group A or
      Group B.

      Researchers will form study groups by pairing together participants who are not likely to
      smoke with those who are more likely to smoke. This will be determined based on the results
      of the questionnaires that participant completed throughout the study.

      Both Group A and Group B will use a website called A Smoking Prevention Interactive
      Experience (ASPIRE). The ASPIRE website has been designed for middle and high school students
      and has videos, activities, and health information facts about the effects of smoking, the
      benefits of meditation, and healthy living. Participant will complete sessions using the
      ASPIRE website once a week for 3 to 4 weeks throughout their first semester. Each session
      should last about 1 hour.

      During Week 2 of the study and the last week participant is on the study, they will complete
      the 2 surveys they completed during Part 1 and Part 2 after their ASPIRE session.

      If participant is in Group B only, in addition to using the ASPIRE website, they will also
      complete health-related activities on paper about the effects of smoking.

      Part 4:

      After the last ASPIRE session, participant may be randomly selected to take part in an
      interview about how to improve the ASPIRE website. Participant will have a 3 in 10 chance of
      being asked to take part in the interview. The interview should take about 30 minutes to
      complete.

      Up to 15 participants will be selected for the interview.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 145 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 130 will take part in Parts 2-4
      of the study.
