  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will utilize a Molecular MicroscopeTM diagnostic system (MMDxTM) that combines the
      molecular and histopathological features of biopsies, plus clinical and laboratory
      parameters, to create the first Integrated Diagnostic System. This MMDxTM will be utilized to
      phenotype cutaneous melanoma biopsy samples to detect an immune responsive mRNA signature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial treatment will consist of a pretreatment 18 gauge core biopsy of locally advanced
      or metastatic cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions. The biopsies will be stabilized on site in
      RNAlater and shipped to ATAGC by courier at ambient temperature. RNA will be extracted using
      Trizol-chloroform method and purified using RNAEasy micro kit (Qiagen). RNA samples passing
      the quality control test (Agilent Bioanalyzer) will be labeled, hybridized to PrimeView
      Affymetrix microarrays and scanned according to the manufacturer's protocol. Resulting &quot;.CEL&quot;
      files will be used for the analysis of the global gene expression.

      Pathogenesis Based Transcript (PBT) sets that represent molecular signatures of inflammation
      will be assessed in core biopsies from melanoma patients. Each PBT set gets a &quot;score&quot; - a
      summarized expression of all members of a set. PBT scores allow an estimate of pre and
      post-treatment immunological activity in each tumor e.g. TCMR activity or macrophage burden.
      PBT scores will be correlated with clinical outcome to determine the utility of this
      technology as a prognostic and predictive biomarker. Finally a molecular classifier
      predicting the response to therapy will be built.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic melanoma with cutaneous or
             subcutaneous lesions

          -  Immunotherapy treatment naïve subjects (ie, no prior systemic anticancer therapy for
             unresectable or metastatic melanoma)

          -  Scheduled to receive ipilimumab, nivolumab, or combination treatment

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of ≤ 2

          -  Not pregnant or lactating. Women who are of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             an effective means of birth control (i.e., latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, etc)
             to avoid pregnancy.

          -  Informed consent for microarray analysis of locally advanced lesion or skin metastasis
             retrieved by standard of care biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co- stimulation or immune
             checkpoint pathways

          -  Subjects with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease

          -  If considered high-risk and tested for hepatitis: Any positive test result for
             hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating acute or chronic infection

          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

          -  Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness,
             that would prevent the subject from participating in the study, places the subject at
             unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study, or any condition that
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study
