  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary biomarkers are compounds in biofluids that directly reflect the intake of specific
      foods or food groups. Their exploration and use in the field of dietary assessments could
      provide an objective measure of actual intake complementing classical assessment methods
      (e.g. food frequency questionnaire, 24h recalls). To date, only a limited number of foods
      have been covered by validated biomarkers.

      The study is part of the international project &quot;The Food Biomarker Alliance (FOODBALL)&quot;. The
      study described here has been assigned to assess biomarkers of the intake of milk and cheese.
      Up to now, there is an evident lack of data on specific and validated biomarkers of milk and
      cheese (dairy products), which belong to the most relevant public health related foods in
      Europe. This study will further provide novel insights into the influence of fermentation of
      milk-based foods on metabolic effects and postprandial adaptations, which has not yet been
      studied in depth before using cheese as fermented product. Outcomes will support and expand
      earlier findings on correlation between the intake of fermented dairy products intake and
      human health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an acute, randomized, controlled, cross-over study designed to identify dietary
      biomarkers of milk and cheese intake and to asses metabolic effects after the ingestion of a
      non-fermented product (milk) and a fermented product (cheese) in healthy subjects.

      Twelve healthy participants (six women, six men) in fasted state will consume three different
      foods in a randomized order on three different study days. Two days prior to each dietary
      intervention, the run-in period is initiated, during which participants have to follow a
      restricted diet. Participants will receive a standardised meal for the last dinner during
      run-in phase. The same meal will be served on the day of the dietary intervention for lunch
      and for dinner (period of controlled diet). Before and after ingestion of the test foods,
      blood samples and urine samples will be collected (up to 6 hours). Additionally, 24h-samples
      will be collected. Primary outcomes (metabolites) will be measured in blood serum and plasma
      collected at 6 different time points and in urine collected at 7 different time points.
      Transcriptomics analysis will be performed on whole blood samples collected at 4 time points
      while clinical chemistry parameters will be assessed in blood samples withdrawn at 6
      different time points.
