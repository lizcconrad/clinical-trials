      Multi-center observational trial with study device blinded in order to assess in parallel
      standard monitoring and intervention practices related to management of respiratory
      compromise in the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU)

      All Study device information is blinded to medical staff but the Study Coordinator will have
      full access to device measurements, alarms, notification and events via a local Wi-Fi hub
      sent to a portable tablet. The tablet Case Report Form (CRF) will allow all observation be
      inserted with a time stamp on the electronic device data. In addition, all electronic data
      will be collected from the bedside monitor.

    <measure>Frequency of Respiratory Adverse Events in the PACU identified by capnography</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 hours in the PACU</time_frame>
    <description>Identification by blinded capnography to understand the ventilation challenges of patient in the PACU during standard of care that does not include capnography. First tier is RN (Registered Nurse) level of notification for early intervention and second tier is level at which covering MD (Medical Doctor) might request notification:
High Respiration Rate &gt;25 bpm for &gt; 15 seconds (tier one) and &gt;30 bpm for more than 30 seconds (tier two)
Low Respiration Rate &lt; 8 bpm for more than 15 seconds and &lt; 6 bpm for more than 30 seconds
High end tidal CO2 (EtCO2) &gt; 55 mmHg for &gt; 15 seconds and &gt; 60 mmHg for more than 30 seconds
Low EtCO2 &lt; 25 mmHg for &gt; 15 seconds and &lt; 25 mmHg for more than 30 seconds
High Heart Rate &gt; 120/min for 15 seconds and &gt;120/min for 30 seconds
Low Heart Rate &lt; 40/min for 15 seconds and &lt; 40/min for 30 seconds
SpO2 (oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry) /Hypoxemia &lt; 90% for more than 15 seconds and&lt; 90% for more than 30 seconds</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Critical Adverse Events (CRAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>PACU and 24 hours post PACU</time_frame>
    <description>Critical CRAE in the PACU or in 24 hour post PACU chart review:
Narcotic overdose that required an Opioid reversal
Partial airway obstruction that required an NMBA (neuromuscular blocking agent) antagonist
Respiratory Insufficiency that would require Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, ambu bag mask assisted ventilation
Respiratory failure that would Invasive mechanical ventilation
Upper airway obstruction requiring airway support measures (oral or nasal) such as intubation, LMA (laryngeal mask airway), or airway
Respiratory insufficiency/failure that would require a transfer to the ICU
Cardiopulmonary arrest
Death due to respiratory/pulmonary related complications Other (free text that might capture aspiration, pneumothorax)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ventilation insufficiency on transfer from the PACU</measure>
    <time_frame>At PACU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Population of patients leaving the PACU in early stage ventilation respiratory insufficiency as defined as etCO2 ≤ 25 mmHg or etCO2 ≥55 mmHg combined with low RR (respiratory rate) and hypotension within 15 minutes before transport out of the PACU.</description>
