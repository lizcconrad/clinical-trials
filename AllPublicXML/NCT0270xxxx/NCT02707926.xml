      Hypothesis:

      Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) with enhanced LT penetration characteristics in vitro and in
      macaques will translate into an ARV regimen with increased LN and GALT concentrations and a
      faster decay and more potent suppression of HIV replication in LT in HIV-infected persons.

      Objectives:

        1. Determine lymph nodes (LN) and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) pharmacokinetics
           (PK) in HIV-infected persons on an antiretroviral drug (ARV) regimen.

        2. Determine virological responses of antiretroviral therapy in plasma, peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymphoid tissue (LT).

      This is a single-center study of 18 ARV naïve, HIV infected persons to assess impact of an
      ARV regimen on lymph node (LN) and (GALT) virus reservoirs.

      All participants will give informed consent. At baseline, plasma and PBMCs will be obtained
      and all subjects will have an incisional biopsy of an inguinal LN and pinch biopsy of ileum
      and rectum via colonoscopy. The selected LT-enhanced ARV regimen will be initiated.
      Participants will return to the clinic at weeks 2 and 4 and then monthly for safety
      evaluations, CD4 T cell counts, plasma HIV-RNA and ARV drug concentrations in plasma and
      PBMCs. An intensive PK study will be performed at week 2. At months 3 and 6, the inguinal LN
      biopsy and pinch biopsies of ileum and rectum will be repeated.

        Eighteen (18) antiretroviral drug (ARV)-naive, HIV-infected persons who are going to
        initiate ARV therapy will be recruited at the University of Minnesota. Study entry is open
        to adults regardless of race or ethnic background. While there will be every effort to seek
        out and include minority participants from both genders, the patient population is expected
        to be no different than that of the HIV infected population in Minnesota.

             the study.

          9. Screening viral isolates demonstrate genotype sensitivity to chosen antiretroviral
             therapy (ART) regimen.

         10. Able to provide voluntary written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

             study procedures as determined by the principal investigator.

          3. Planning or current pregnancy or breastfeeding

          4. History and/or presence of any clinically significant disease or disorder, such as
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neurological, gastrointestinal and
             psychiatric/mental disease/disorder, which, in the opinion of the enrolling physician,
             may put the participant at risk because of participation in the study, influence the
             results of the study, or affect the participant's ability to participate in the study.

          5. Inability to comply with study procedures per enrolling physician discretion

    <ipd_description>The results of this trial will be of interest to the HIV research and medical communities. We expect to submit the data from the main analysis within 6 months of completing the work. We will publish the results in a major scientific journal and present the results at a major scientific meeting (e.g., CROI). Subsequent analyses will be presented at national and international HIV meetings. Data generated under this project, and any intellectual property, will be administered in accordance with NIH policies, including the NIH Data Sharing Policy the NIH Public Access Policy.</ipd_description>
