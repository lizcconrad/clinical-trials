    <textblock>
      With aging, the elderly decreased ability to control postural balance will be accompanied by
      increased risk of falling (Berg et al, 1992;. Tinetti et al, 1988). According to previous
      studies, it showed that the elderly over 65 years fall each year probability was 30 %, and it
      increased with age (Skelton, &amp; Todd, 2004). In view of this, age-related posture control has
      become important issues of modern preventive medicine and family care.

      Many clinical studies have been developed assessment tools and measurements for clinical
      staff to provide balanced assessment and intervention. However, the factors of affecting
      postural control are diverse and complex, not all tools or measurement could effectively
      detect a risk of falling. In daily living, the postural control involved integration of
      sensation, biofeedback, movement response, and kinesthetic sense to maintain postural
      stability, and finally integrated into the neuromuscular system and coordination to help
      achieve the perfect postural control. Current clinical tools used to assess the fall or
      research methods to detect the incidence of falls and the lack of effective relevant and
      contradictory, and it's difficult to effectively evaluate the risk of falls (Gates, et al,
      2008).

      With the development of postural balance issues associated with aging process in older
      people, there is no set of standardized equipment, and lack of effective methods for the
      assessment of normal and older people who fall. In response to these problems, if we can
      provide a virtual reality interfaces, and with daily living activities as gait, across
      obstacles activity, sit to stand, will be able to better meet the desire to explore the issue
      of real significance to enhance researchers for aging, motion analysis, and brain cortex
      activity mechanism in postural control mechanism.
