  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal canal carcinoma (ACC) represents 1.2% of digestive cancers. Its incidence is increasing.
      As epidermoid ACC (95% of ACC) are particularly sensitive to radio and chemotherapy,
      concomitant radio-chemotherapy is the standard treatment of locally advanced ACC, with proven
      efficacy on locoregional control, anal sphincter preservation, progression-free survival and
      complete response rate higher than 80%.

      Nevertheless, conventional radiotherapy frequently induces significant non-haematological
      toxicities requiring treatment interruptions. Thus, treatment usually includes a chemotherapy
      (5-Fluorouracil and Mitomycine-C) and 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy followed by a planned 1-week (or
      more) interruption and a boost, for a total 54-60 Gy radiation dose over 9 weeks.

      Considering the numerous anatomic pelvic structures, ACC has become a localisation of
      interest for Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) associated with less toxicity.

      However, IMRT induces grade≥3 cutaneous toxicities requiring irradiation breaks. Dose
      escalade did not show its interest: 60 Grays remains the standard.

      Assuming the deleterious effect of increased overall treatment time on local control and
      survival in head-and-neck and cervical cancers and the epidermoid histology of ACC, the
      benefit of no irradiation break on ACC tumour control is of interest.

      IMRT offers the possibility to deliver different doses to different target volumes
      simultaneously by altered fractionation schedule like SIB-IMRT (simultaneously integrated
      boost-IMRT). Several SIB-IMRT schedules have been retrospectively evaluated. Similar results
      were observed with moderate doses and schedules delivering higher doses with short
      interruptions. Nevertheless, standard SIB-IMRT schedule in ACC still not exist.
