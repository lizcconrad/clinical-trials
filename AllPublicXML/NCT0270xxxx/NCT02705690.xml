    <textblock>
      This study aims to benchmark the performance of an iOS application against the Berg Balance
      Scale (BBS), which is the most commonly used assessment tool by clinicians for measuring
      balance across the continuum from acute care to community-based care. An iPhone will be tied
      around the waist of the participant and concurrent measurements will be taken for five of the
      fourteen stances which comprise the BBS.

      'Project Balance' aims to make balance an actionable component of an individuals health,
      allowing a long term intervention via a monitoring and training of balance health much before
      a fall happens. Towards this end, we have designed an iOS application and a belt. The phone
      is kept stable against the lower back of the participant using the belt. The application
      turns on the accelerometer in the phone to sample acceleration along x (media lateral) and z
      (anterior posterior) axis. These displacements from the mean are used to calculate the Root
      Mean Square of a person which acts a proxy score for Postural Sway. (Postural sway is defined
      as the phenomenon of constant displacement and correction of the position of the center of
      gravity within the base of support)

      Studies in the past have compared the use of accelerometers to the use of the clinical
      measured of Timed Up (TUG) test and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) in the assessment of postural
      stability and indicated that there is a high correlation between BBS, TUG and Accelerometry.
      Accelerometry has also found to be able to distinguish between sway responses to differing
      balancing conditions and between fallers and non-fallers.

      We aim to conduct a benchmarking study for our iOS application against the BBS.

    <description>The iOS application can compare the Root Mean Square(RMS) from the left leg to the right leg to produce a symmetry ratio for the physiotherapist, this provides a more granular view of the participants balance health. Similarly, the application can calculate the ratio of Anterior Posterior movement to the Media Lateral movement.</description>

    <description>We have designed an iOS application and a belt. The application uses accelerometer data to calculate postural sway. Steps:
The phone is kept stable against the lower back of the participant using the belt.
The iOS application gives instructions to user to adopt the correct stance (eg: Standing Unsupported, legs side by side) Once the stance is adopted, the application turns on the accelerometer in the phone to sample acceleration along x (media lateral) and z (anterior posterior) axis.
These displacements from the mean are used to calculate the Root Mean Square of a person which acts a proxy score for Postural Sway. (Postural sway is defined as the phenomenon of constant displacement and correction of the position of the center of gravity within the base of support)</description>
