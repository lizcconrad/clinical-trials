      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Epidiolex at various
      doses between 5 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day as an additional (add-on) drug for treating
      debilitating, drug-resistant epilepsy.

      The specific goals of this phase 1 dose finding study conducted in consecutively enrolled
      patients 15 years and older are to prospectively and longitudinally assess the safety and
      tolerability, including cognitive effects, of CBD at various doses between 5 mg/kg/day and 25
      mg/kg/day with additional titration in some cases up to 50 mg/kg/day. In order to participate
      in the study, participants will need to fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
