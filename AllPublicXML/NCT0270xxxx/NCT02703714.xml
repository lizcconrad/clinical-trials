  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II trial to examine efficacy and safety of a novel combination of
      pembrolizumab plus induction GM-CSF in patients with advanced biliary cancers treated at
      UCSF.

      This phase II study will examine the efficacy and safety of the novel combination of
      pembrolizumab plus induction GM-CSF in advanced biliary cancer patients with the hypotheses
      that the combination may increase proportion of patients with overall response compared to
      contemporary historical controls, with acceptable safety.
