  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the emerging worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes, dietary recommendations to improve
      diabetes management have been emphasized in the scientific community. Particular attention
      has been drawn to various benefits of replacing saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty
      acids. Alpha-linolenic acid, the only omega-3 fatty acid that is from plant sources, has been
      suggested by animal and cell studies to play a beneficial role in regulating blood glucose
      levels. However, human studies have been more inconsistent with their findings. The focus of
      this project is to investigate the evidence in the context of ALA and blood glucose
      parameters in participants with type 2 diabetes by conducting a systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
