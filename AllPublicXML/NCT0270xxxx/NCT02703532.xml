  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify the potential benefits of a home-based,
      intervention designed to facilitate carepartners' roles in stroke survivor rehabilitation.
      Stroke survivors and caregivers will participate in pairs. Stroke survivors will receive
      constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT). Caregivers of stroke survivors will be randomized
      to traditional caregiver education or a web based intervention for the duration of stroke
      survivor therapy. By learning the best way to involve family members in therapy,
      investigators hope to decrease the harmful effects of stroke.

    <description>CARE-CITE is an online educational program developed to provide information that may help caregivers understand more about constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) and their potential roles in helping the stoke survivor gain as much benefit as possible from CIMT.
If participants do not have access to a computer or tablet, they will be loaned an electronic tablet for the 2-3 week period of the study to access the information.
Participants will be asked to review six educational modules over a period of 2-3 weeks while the stroke survivor receives CIMT.
Participants will attend three in home evaluation visits; one at the beginning of the stroke survivors therapy sessions, one at the end of his/her therapy visit series, and a third evaluation one month later in which they will be asked to complete questionnaires. Evaluation visits will take approximately 1 ½ hours to complete.</description>

    <intervention_name>Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT)</intervention_name>
    <description>Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is one type of therapy that helps stroke survivors gain more use of their weaker arm.This therapy involves wearing a soft mitt (like a sock or oven mitt) on the stronger arm to remind the stroke survivor to use their weaker arm for daily activities and also intensive practice of tasks with the supervision of a therapist.
Participants will attend three in home evaluation visits; one at the beginning of your therapy sessions, one at the end of your therapy visit series and a third evaluation one month later. These evaluation sessions will involve an evaluation of arm function and answering three questionnaires about how well the weaker arm works and how the stroke has affected daily activities. The interview questions and assessment will take approximately 1 ½ hours to complete.</description>
