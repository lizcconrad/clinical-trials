  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators examine the effects of low-dose ketamine on different
      oculomotor, perceptual and cognitive functions. They also examine effects on concurrent brain
      activity using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI). A sample of N=25 healthy, male participants is required to complete the study. The
      design is within-subjects, placebo-controlled, double-blind and cross-over. A targeted
      ketamine level in plasma of 100ng/ml is applied. It is hypothesised that ketamine, compared
      to placebo, will lead to changes in task performance and brain activity similar to those
      observed in patients with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has been proposed
      as a model system of the symptoms of schizophrenia. To complement this model system and to
      allow neurobiological as well as translational studies, biomarkers are often applied to
      people under the influence of ketamine. Here, we apply oculomotor, perceptual and cognitive
      biomarkers to healthy human volunteers whilst they undergo BOLD fMRI at 3 Tesla field
      strength. We use a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects
      design. A sample of 25 healthy participants is required. Participants will receive
      intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine (with a 100ng/ml target plasma concentration) on one of two
      assessment days and they will receive placebo (intravenous saline) on the other assessment
      day. BOLD fMRI will be carried out on a Siemens Trio scanner at the Life&amp;Brain Centre, Bonn.
      In addition to brain functional and cognitive, perceptual and oculomotor responses, we will
      also measure self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences. These will be obtained using the
      Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI; Mason et al 2008).
