      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcome of loop intrauterine contraceptive device
      and heart-shaped intrauterine balloon for the adjunctive treatment of severe intrauterine
      adhesions in patients with infertility.

    <textblock>
      Intrauterine adhesion, also known as Asherman's syndrome, is the partial or complete
      occlusion of the uterine cavity as a result of endometrium damage. Most intrauterine
      adhesions patients manifest amenorrhea, reduced menstrual pattern, infertility, and
      intrauterine growth restriction, which seriously affect their reproductive health. Currently,
      hysteroscopy is the preferred method of intrauterine adhesions diagnosis and treatment.
      However, because intrauterine adhesions patients generally have poor endometrium repair
      capability, the incidence rate of reformation of intrauterine adhesions ranging from
      20%-62.5% in those with severe adhesions. The successful pregnancy rate after treatment in
      severe Asherman's syndrome is reported to be consistently lower, only 33%. The prevention of
      intrauterine adhesions recurrence after trans-cervical resection of adhesion is clinically
      important but difficult. Therefore, this study was conducted.
