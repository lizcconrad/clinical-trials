  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is relevant to the identification of the relationship, and its
      significance, between patient morality and a number of demographic, clinical and corporate
      characteristics. Two separate data sets have been compiled linking the existing intervention
      and employment data, one focusing on the admitting nurse and another one considering all the
      nurses involved in each intervention. Several statistical experiments will take place to
      support or reject the main hypothesis: higher nurse education, satisfaction and staffing
      levels result to lower patient mortality.

      The primary research objective is to investigate the relationship between the education,
      satisfaction and staffing level of the nurses and the mortality rate across HMC. The
      relationship between mortality will be investigated against some additional demographic
      characteristics of the patient and the nurses as well as a umber of clinical parameters like
      the length of stay and the severity of the interventions. To achieve that data will be
      retrospectively collected from the Human Resources database containing the nurse education
      and demographic information and will combine it to the intervention data coming from the
      clinical information systems of all major public hospitals in Qatar excluding accident and
      emergency cases to avoid confounding. Rigorous statistical analysis will be conducted to
      obtain the significance of this relationship within expected confidence intervals. The end
      result of that process is to find whether there is a significant positive or negative
      relationship between nurse education and mortality rate.

      For confounding purposes Accident and Emergency data have been excluded, we have performed
      several adjusted and unadjusted Logistic Regression tests and taking into consideration the
      clustering effect of the data.
