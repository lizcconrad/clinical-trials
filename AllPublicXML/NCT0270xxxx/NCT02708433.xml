  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anecdotal data suggest that the buffered form of the local anesthetic is more potent at equal
      dosages, and a lower dosage of the drug might be used with an effect equal to higher dosage
      not buffered. Clinical data are needed to confirm these anecdotal data. No data exist
      comparing buffered local anesthetics at lower drug concentrations to current dosages commonly
      used in dental and oral surgical procedures

      Specific Aims:

      Compare clinical depths of pulpal anesthesia (cold, Electronic Pulp Test) for mandibular
      molar, and canine teeth at 30 minute intervals post injection for mandibular block anesthesia
      with buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine as compared to non-buffered 2%
      lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine.

      Hypotheses:

      No differences exist in anesthetic depth for pulpal anesthesia after intraoral injection for
      mandibular block anesthesia between buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine as
      compared to non-buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine.

      Study Time Frame: 6 months Month One: Recruit 24 volunteers as subjects. Prepare case-books.
      Months Two-Three: Clinical Study, Months Four-Five: Analyze data Month Six: Prepare
      Abstracts, Papers Methods: Blinded, Randomized Clinical Design Recruit subjects with
      Institutional Review Board approved consent at UNC Subjects will serve as their own controls
      in a cross-over AB/BA study design which is uniform within sequences, uniform within periods,
      and balanced Randomized subjects to be injected orally for mandibular block (inferior
      alveolar, lingual, buccal nerves) alternatively with 4cc of buffered 1% lidocaine with
      1/100,000 epinephrine and 4cc non-buffered of 2% lidocaine with 1/100,000 epinephrine.

      Assessment: pre, and post-anesthetic administration for pulpal anesthesia with cold,
      Electronic Pulp Test: Mandibular molar, canine at 30 minute intervals Inclusion Criteria: Age
      18-30 years, American Society Anesthesiologists (ASA) I Exclusion Criteria Allergy to
      lidocaine class of anesthetic drugs, Local anesthetic drug past week Current symptoms teeth
      or oral mucosa. SAS will be used for database management and statistical analysis.

In week two the alternate anesthetic would be administered.
