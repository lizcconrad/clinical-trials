  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study the effects of underwater
      ultrasound (US) therapy were investigated in 48 patients with moderately active rheumatoid
      arthritis (disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) ≥3.2 and ≤5.1).

      Patients randomly assigned to the ultrasound group (N=25) received underwater ultrasound
      therapy to both wrists and hands for 7 minutes per session with an intensity of 0.7 W/cm2
      during 10 sessions. The control group (N=23) received sham treatment under the same
      conditions. At baseline, at the end of treatment (Week 2) and at the follow-up visit (Week
      14), the following parameters were evaluated: disease activity - erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), tender and swollen joint counts, pain on a visual
      analogue scale, and DAS28, hand function (fist making, wrist extension and flexion, hand grip
      strength), quality of life - Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the patients rated
      their own condition.
