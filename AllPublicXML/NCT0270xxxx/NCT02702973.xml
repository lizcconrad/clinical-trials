  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high doses of interferon α-2b therapy in patients with melanomas of the skin may induced
      retinopathy, especially in the patients with hypertension or diabetes, so these patients
      should be followed up after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with melanomas of the skin whose tumors have been resected completely were
      collected. The detailed ocular examinations including intraocular pressure, slit lamp
      microscope, indirect ophthalmoscope and color fundus photography were done before the
      induction therapy, 2 weeks after the induction therapy, after the whole course of induction
      therapy and each month in the maintenance treatment period. Fundus examinations were carried
      out by experienced ocular fundus doctors and the retinopathy characteristics were recorded.

          4. Must complete all primary therapy (wide excision with or without lymphadenectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Mucous membrane or ocular melanoma.

          3. Patients with retinopathy on baseline fundoscopic examination at the start of
             interferon therapy.

          4. History of any other malignancy within the last ten years (except basal cell carcinoma
             or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix).
