  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the bioavailability of a generic product of amlodipine
      with that of a reference product when administered to healthy volunteers under fasting
      conditions. The test product name is BF-Amlodipine Tablet 10mg manufactured by Bright Future
      Pharmaceuticals Factory O/B Bright Future Pharmaceutical Laboratories Limited, and the
      reference product is Norvasc Tablet 10mg. The plasma pharmacokinetic data of amlodipine
      obtained from two formulations will be used to access the interchangeability of the products

      The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence crossover with a
      washout period of two to three weeks. During each session, the subjects will be administered
      a single oral dose of 10mg amlodipine (one BF-Amlodipine Tablet 10mg or one Norvasc Tablet
      10mg) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours. Venous blood samples will be
      collected at pre-dose (0 h), and up to 96 h post dose. The plasma concentrations of
      amlodipine will be determined by a validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used
      to analyze the plasma concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic
      parameters such as Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Time to maximum concentration (Tmax),
      Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-last, AUC0-inf) and Elimination
      half-life (T1/2). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on logarithmically
      transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. The two one sided tests will be used to calculate
      the 90% confidence intervals for the mean difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax, and to
      assess the bioequivalence of the two products
