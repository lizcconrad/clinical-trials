  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the physical, cognitive and psychological symptoms experienced by individuals
      with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there is new research which indicates that some individuals
      with MS have a deficit in emotional processing, specifically, facial affect recognition.
      Emotional processing is defined as &quot;a central aspect of social cognition&quot;. Models of social
      cognition indicate that emotional processing is an essential component of interpersonal
      relationships. The failure to accurately perceive other's emotions has been shown to lead to
      difficulty in social relationships, misinterpreting other's affect, and consequently,
      inappropriate responding.

      However, even though a significant number of individuals with MS have impairments in
      emotional processing, we do not yet have an understanding of how these impairments affect the
      social functioning of individuals with MS, including the impact of these deficits on family
      structure. It is well-known that MS impacts one's social functioning including factors such
      as employment, daily living activities and interpersonal relationships. Recently a strong
      correlation was observed between reduced social participation in MS and quality of life.
      There is evidence to suggest that emotional processing deficits lie at the heart of this
      reduced social participation in persons with MS, leading to decreased social functioning and
      thus reduced quality of life. However, to date, this hypothesis has not been tested.
