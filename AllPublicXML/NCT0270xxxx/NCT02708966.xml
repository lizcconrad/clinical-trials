  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes (PD) was defined as an state in which glucose levels are above normal but not
      enough to meet criteria for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). PD can be presented as
      impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and glycated hemoglobin A1c
      (A1C) altered. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported that in 2013 the
      prevalence of IGT was 6.9% which is equivalent to approximately 316 million individuals with
      IGT, it is expected that by 2035 this number will increase to 417 million people affected.
      Many hypoglycemic effects attributed to Gymnema sylvestre have been reported, including:
      increase of insulin secretion, regeneration of pancreatic islet cells, increased glucose
      utilization in various ways and inhibition of glucose uptake in the intestine.

      The target is to evaluate the effect of the administration of Gymnema Sylvestre on glycemic
      control, insulin secretion and insulin sensibility on patients with IGT. The investigators
      will conduct a double-blind trial, randomized, placebo control group, each group 12 female
      and male patients, between 30 and 59 years old with IGT (2-h values in the oral glucose
      tolerance test [OGTT] from 140 mg / dL to 199 mg / dL), Body Mass Index (BMI) from 25 to 34.9
      kg / m2. Randomization will determine who will receive the intervention during the 9-week
      trial (Gymnema Sylvestre capsules, 300 mg 2 times daily with the first bite of breakfast and
      dinner or homologated placebo capsules). The clinical findings and laboratory tests include a
      metabolic profile and biosafety, which will be made at baseline and at week 9. Body weight,
      body fat, BMI and blood pressure will be determined during the initial and final visit.
      Adverse events and adherence to treatment will be documented. Statistical analysis:
      Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon and Fisher exact test. It is considered with significance at p
      &lt;0.05.
