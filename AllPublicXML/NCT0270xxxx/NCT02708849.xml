      The purpose of the study is to characterize the effects of a single, sub-anesthetic dose of
      ketamine in rs-fMRI in healthy subjects. Post-ketamine rs-fMRI data will demonstrate a
      pattern of increased global brain connectivity (GBC) in fronto-temporal cortex.

      In this study, healthy participants will be randomized into one of two parallel groups: (a)
      open-label ketamine and active lamotrigine, or (b) open-label ketamine with a matched-placebo
      control (i.e., sugar pill). All participants will complete a baseline rs-fMRI approximately
      1-week prior to the ketamine infusion and a follow-up rs-fMRI 24-hours post-infusion. The
      subanesthetic dose of ketamine (0.23mg/kg bolus followed by 0.58mg/kg infusion over
      approximately 60 minutes) will be administered via intravenous infusion to occur during the
      MRS scan. Participants will be administered lamotrigine (300 mg oral dose) or the
      matched-placebo control about 2-hours prior to the start of the infusion.

    <description>Participants will be randomized into one of two parallel groups—ketamine+lamotrigine or ketamine+placebo—and will complete pre- and post-ketamine rs-fMRI.
The hypothesis is that post-ketamine rs-fMRI data will demonstrate a pattern of increased global brain connectivity (GBC) in fronto-temporal cortex.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between the ages of 21-65 years. Females will be included if they are
             not pregnant and agreed to utilize a barrier method contraceptive (e.g., condom or
             diaphragm with spermicide) tubal ligation, abstinence, or partner with vasectomy) or
             if post-menopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically sterile.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent according to Yale HIC guidelines.

          -  Agree to refrain from elective surgeries (including dental) for a 2-week period
             following study drug.

          -  Able to read and write English as a primary language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Personal history of mood, anxiety, or psychotic axis I DSM-IV disorders confirmed
             after comprehensive psychiatric evaluation.

          -  Any history of serious medical or neurological illness.

          -  Any signs of major medical or neurological illness on examination or as a result of
             ECG screening or laboratory studies.

          -  A first-degree family member with history of schizophrenia.

          -  Lifetime history of psychoactive substance or alcohol dependence or substance or
             alcohol abuse (other than nicotine or caffeine abuse), or drinking more that 5
             drinks/week during the last year.

          -  Abnormality on physical examination. A subject with a clinical abnormality may be
             included only if the study physician considers the abnormality will not introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedure (e.g.
             uncontrolled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism will be excluded).

          -  A positive pre-study (screening) urine drug screen or, at the study physician's
             discretion on any drug screens given before the scans.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women or a positive urine pregnancy test for women of
             child-bearing potential at screening or prior to any imaging day.

             Subjects will be invited back either for their next study visit or for a HIV/Hep
             debriefing session. A study clinician will inform them in person of the results. They
             will be given access to counselling and advised of the appropriate next steps.

          -  Has received either prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC) centrally active medicine or
             herbal supplements within the week prior to the MRI scan. Subjects who have taken OTC
             medication or herbal supplements may still be entered into the study, if, in the
             opinion of the principal/co-investigator, the medication received will not interfere
             with the study procedures or compromise safety.

          -  Any history indicating learning disability, mental retardation, or attention deficit
             disorder.

          -  Known sensitivity to ketamine.

          -  Known sensitivity to lamotrigine.

          -  Body weight of 250 pounds or greater.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 56 days prior to dosing.
