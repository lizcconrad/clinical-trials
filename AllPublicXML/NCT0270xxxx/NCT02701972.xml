  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The preclinical and clinical evidence of safety and efficacy with the BACE device (concept
      and feasibility) paved the way for the evaluation of the BACE device in this prospective,
      multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled study for safety and efficacy in the treatment of
      functional MR in a maximum of 60 adult subjects.

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be reduction of MR grade to 1+ or less from the baseline
      MR grade through the 6 month study period. Primary safety endpoint will be freedom from major
      device and surgery-related adverse events for the duration of the 6 month follow up period.
      Patients will be followed up to two years.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the BACE device
      for the treatment of FMR.

      Secondary objective is to assess the ease of deployment of the BACE device Study Population:
      Since this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new device, with no control arm or
      comparator, the number of subjects enrolled will be a maximum of 60.

      Approximately 8-10 sites are expected to be included in the study. The subject population is
      adults of 18 to 80 years of age, either gender, with FMR as specified in the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.
