      The purpose of the study was to examine the immediate effect of subliminal priming with
      subliminal reward stimuli on standing balance in healthy young adults. The study also
      compared the outcomes with the immediate effects of subliminal priming with supraliminal
      reward stimuli.

    <description>This intervention consisted of five presentations [three cycles of mosaic (displayed for 117 ms each), physical exertion words as subliminal priming (displayed for 17 ms), and positive words as subliminal reward (displayed for 17 ms)].
These were set to 1 package. 1 package is 24 times per 5 seconds presented in the animation (Animation of Skateboarding) for approximately 2 min.</description>
