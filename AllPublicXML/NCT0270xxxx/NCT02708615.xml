    <textblock>
      This study compares two different types of speculum insertion to determine the level of
      discomfort they might cause. This study compares the straight horizontal insertion (SHI) of
      the speculum and the vertical insertion and rotation (VIR).

      Participants are randomly assigned to one of the two insertion groups and are not told which
      group they are in until the examination is over. Participants rate their level of discomfort
      immediately after insertion of the speculum.

      Basic demographic information (e.g., age, ethnicity, number of vaginal deliveries, menopausal
      status, etc.) and clinical information are also collected to determine if other factors
      influence the level of discomfort experienced.

      *NOTE* This is NOT a paid study.

    <textblock>
      In most medical schools around the world, speculum examination is taught using a bivalved
      speculum, since this is the type of speculum most commonly used in clinical practice. Due to
      the oval shape of the vulva, and the alignment of the labia majora and minora, the aperture
      of vaginal introitus is commonly perceived to have a vertical orientation. In reality
      however, the vaginal introitus is round and the vagina itself has more of a horizontal
      orientation: the anterior and posterior vaginal walls are opposed, and the sidewalls only
      become apparent once the anterior and posterior walls are separated. Nevertheless, the most
      common way of teaching the speculum examination worldwide is to introduce the speculum in a
      vertical orientation and then once it is successfully inserted into the vagina to rotate it
      90Â° into a horizontal position. Once it is correctly positioned, it is slowly opened to
      visualize the vaginal epithelium and the cervix. However, in clinical practice, the rotation
      of the speculum in the vagina may cause pain and discomfort. Introduction of the speculum
      initially in a horizontal orientation, without rotation in the vagina, seems more appropriate
      and could potentially be associated with less discomfort or pain for women undergoing this
      exam. In practice, a minority of clinicians separate the labia first, introduce the speculum
      in a direct horizontal fashion, and thus avoid the potentially uncomfortable twisting part of
      the procedure.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to quantify the amount of pain/discomfort women experience with two different types of speculum insertion: straight horizontal insertion (SHI) and vertical insertion and rotation (VIR). Participants will rate their pain/discomfort by placing a mark on a visual analog scale measuring 10 cm in length. Pain/discomfort ratings on this scale range from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;pain as bad as it possibly could be&quot;.</description>
