               2. NHL: Measureable disease including target lesion(s) as defined by the Lugano
                  Classification2 for initial evaluation and staging.

          5. Patients must have a site of disease amenable to biopsy and be a candidate for biopsy
             according to the treating institution's guidelines.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1.

          7. Adequate hepatic function:

               1. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (except patients with
                  Gilbert's syndrome [hereditary indirect hyperbilirubinemia] who must have a total
                  bilirubin of ≤ 3 times ULN),

               2. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 times
                  ULN (except patients with known liver involvement of their advanced solid
                  malignancy or NHL who must have their AST and ALT ≤ 5.0 times ULN).

          8. Adequate renal function: estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 mL/min, calculated
             using the formula of Cockroft and Gault (140-Age) • Mass (kg)/(72 • creatinine mg/dL);
             multiply by 0.85 if female.

          9. Female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use dual methods of
             contraception (including one highly effective and one effective method of
             contraception) and have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening, and male
             patients must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with
             a female of child-bearing potential. For both male and female patients, effective
             methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for 3 months following
             the last dose.

         10. Adequate hematopoietic function: total white blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 1500/mm3,
             absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 10.0 g/dL, and platelet

             ratio of 2:1 (NAPRT1 negative:NAPRT1 positive). The NAPRT1 status must be determined
             prior to enrollment based on evaluation of a fresh tumor biopsy or archival tissue
             taken ≤ 6 months of screening.

         12. Dose Expansion Phase (KPT-9274 ± niacin ER cohort only): Patient tumors NAPRT1 and
             IDH1 tumor status must be determined at the central laboratory prior to enrollment.

             a. Confirmation of NAPRT1 expression and IDH1 mutation based on evaluation of a fresh
             tumor biopsy or archival tumor biopsy taken ≤ 6 months of screening tests as follows:

             i. NAPRT1 positive for expansion cohort I or III

             ii. NAPRT1 negative for expansion cohort II or III

             iii. IDH1 mutation status for expansion cohort IV

         13. Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  non-hematologic toxicities, ≤ Grade 2 or to their baseline for hematologic
                  toxicities) from toxicities related to their previous treatment except for
                  alopecia. In specific cases, patients with Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicities
                  will be allowed following approval by the Karyopharm medical monitor.

          3. Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) disease or leptomeningeal
             involvement, regardless of response to prior therapy, are excluded.

               2. Clinically significant heart disease (e.g., symptomatic congestive heart failure;
                  uncontrolled arrhythmia, or hypertension; history of labile hypertension or poor
                  compliance with an antihypertensive regimen).

             antifungals within one week prior to C1D1. Prophylactic antibiotics, antivirals or
             antifungals are permitted.

          7. Patients with a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); HIV testing is

          8. Known, active hepatitis A, B, or C infection; or known to be positive for HCV RNA or
             HBsAg (HBV surface antigen). Testing is not required.

          9. Patients with significantly diseased or obstructed gastrointestinal tract or
             uncontrolled vomiting or diarrhea that could interfere with the absorption of
             KPT-9274.

         10. Serious psychiatric or medical conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could interfere with treatment, compliance, or the ability to give consent.
