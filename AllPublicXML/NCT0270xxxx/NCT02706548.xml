  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many persons with chronic health conditions fail to take their medications as prescribed,
      resulting in declines in health and function. Unfortunately, current interventions for
      medication nonadherence are not very effective. This objective of this study is to test a new
      intervention, the Integrative Medication Self-management (IMedS) intervention to improve
      medication adherence in adults with chronic health conditions.

      Many persons with chronic health conditions fail to take their medications as prescribed,
      resulting in declines in health and function. Objective: The purpose of this study was to
      perform a phase I feasibility study to understand if an integrated occupational therapy
      intervention could help people with chronic health conditions improve their adherence to
      medications. Method: Using a small-N design, we report single-subject analyses of the
      medication adherence, behavior counts, and perceptions of medication adherence of
      participants before and after either an occupational therapy intervention or standard of care
      intervention. We used a multiple baseline approach with inter-subject replication, and
      blinding.

    <description>Half of participants received a manualized 30-minute occupational therapy intervention, Integrative Medication Self-Management Intervention (IMedS). During IMedS, the interventionist and client progress through three steps in which the pair: 1) reflect on past performance of medication management, 2) set a medication goal, and 3) generate strategies to reach the goal. During strategy generation, the interventionist uses therapeutic use of self and motivational interviewing to help the client self-generate new medication management strategies, specifically addressing 1) altering the activity, 2) advocacy, 3) education, 4) assistive technology, 5) environmental modifications, and 6) securing timely refills.</description>

    <description>The standard care educational intervention was a 30-minute pamphlet based educational session. In the standard care intervention group, participants and interventionist first reviewed the pamphlet, Managing Your Medicines: Our Guide to Effective Medication Management (American Heart Association &amp; American Stroke Association, 2013). Then, the interventionist engaged in active listening, where she asked open-ended questions about the participant's medication routines and provided simple reflections. For the standard care procedures, the interventionist was prohibited from providing affirmations, complex reflections, summaries, problem-solving, or suggesting any specific interventions.</description>
