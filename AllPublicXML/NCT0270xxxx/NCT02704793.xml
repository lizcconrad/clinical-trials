  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) is a low-mortality, though truly burdensome and debilitating condition
      which is known to be the second most common movement disorder of the adult population only
      after restless legs syndrome. The prevalence of the disorder in all age groups has been
      estimated to be 0.9%. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an almost safe
      technique which has been used in diagnosis and treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric
      conditions. Recent studies have shown that cerebellum has a significant role in development
      of ET and that rTMS could exert therapeutic effects on its motor symptoms. In this study
      researchers will recruit at least 30 subjects among patients visiting at the Specialty Clinic
      of Mashhad Medical University according to researchers exclusion and inclusion criteria and
      after signing a written informed consent, will randomly be assigned to either real or sham
      rTMS. On the real rTMS arm, patients will be treated with 900 pulses of 1 Hz rTMS on 90% of
      resting motor threshold (RMT) delivered over each cerebellar hemisphere for 5 consecutive
      days and sham treatment will be performed with the same protocol using a small device placed
      on the TMS coil (not visible to the patients) producing electrical stimulation (less than 3
      mili amperes), to simulate the sensation of real TMS. Subject's ear will be protected with
      earplugs during both real and sham stimulations. After 2 months of follow-up, patients will
      undergo crossover and receive the other treatment as described above. Patients would be
      assessed using Fahn-Tolosa-Marin scale at the baseline and again on days 5, 12, and 30 after
      each real or sham treatment session by a blinded researcher. Data will be analysed by another
      researcher who is also blind.
