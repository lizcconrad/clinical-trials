      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate tau distribution in the brain of subjects
      with: FTD caused by different genetic mutations, any mutation carriers (with or without
      symptoms), any non-mutation carrier, any sporadic FTD, normal controls.

    <description>Participants will receive a single intravenous bolus injection of approximately 6.5-10mCi (240-370MBq) of F 18 T807. For those who cannot tolerate the full exam, participants will receive single intravenous bolus injection of approximately 6.5-10mCi (240-370MBq) of F 18 T807.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female participants, at least 18 years of age.

          2. Clinically diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or a carrier of a mutation
             known to cause FTD (with or without symptoms); or a normal control.

          3. Participant is able and willing to undergo testing (MRI or CT, PET, radioactive tracer
             injection, LP; for those unable to undergo an MRI, CT will be used to generate
             regions-of-interest).

          4. Pre-menopausal women will have a negative a urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of
             T807 drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, could increase risk to the
             participant, limit the participant's ability to tolerate the experimental procedures,
             or interfere with the collection/analysis of the data (for example, participants with
             severe chronic back pain might not be able to lie still during the scanning
             procedures).

          2. Is deemed likely unable to perform the imaging procedures for any reason.

          3. Has a history of Torsades de Pointes or is taking medications known to prolong QT
             interval. To determine who will be excluded from this study based on this criterion,
             we will review participant's medical history and current medications at time of
             screening. Participants will be excluded from the study if any of the following
             restricted medications are being taken:

               -  Disopyramide

               -  Dofetilide

               -  Ibutilide

               -  Procainamide

               -  Quinidine

               -  Sotalol

               -  Bepridil

          4. Has hypersensitivity to F 18 T807 or any of its excipients.

          5. Contraindications to PET, PET-CT or MR (e.g. electronic medical devices, inability to
             lie still for long periods) that make it unsafe for the individual to participate.

          6. Severe claustrophobia.

          7. Currently pregnant or breast-feeding.

          8. For those electing to undergo the optional lumbar puncture: on

        anticoagulant of any form prior to lumbar puncture.
