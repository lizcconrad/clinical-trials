    <textblock>
      1. Purpose: 1) compare three conservative treatment approaches for subjects with
           femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAI), and 2) analyze functional outcome
           comparatively across groups.

        2. Interventions will be provided based on randomized assignment. Group 1 will receive
           treatment based on identified impairments and treated twice weekly to address said
           impairments with hip manual therapy and exercise, as well as a prescriptive exercise for
           strengthening and mobility of the hip. Group 2 will receive only the prescriptive
           exercise program. Group 3 will be a control group (supervised neglect)

        3. Primary outcomes data analysis will involve a mixed design (repeated measures) ANOVA for
           assessment of the primary outcome measure of the HAGOS. Secondary analyses will include
           chi square analyses (PASS, surgery at 6 months, adverse events), ANCOVA (PPMs, and
           expectations measures), or other appropriate comparative measures. None of the proposed
           treatment is considered outside of 'standard of practice'.

    <description>One group will receive education and advice, manual therapy that is applied toward the impairments of the subject, a prescription of progressive rehabilitation exercises designed to strengthen weakened muscle groups and stretch joint movements that demonstrate range of motion limitations. Treatment is based on clinical presentation and identification of impairments by the treating clinician. Subjects will be seen twice weekly for 4 to 6 weeks, depending on the progression.
All three groups will receive standardized education on the current state of FAI interventions (with both conservative and surgical care). All interventions will be provided by licensed physical therapists that are named as investigators in this study.</description>
