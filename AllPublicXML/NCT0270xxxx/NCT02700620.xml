      Background: Previous studies on Internet-based treatment with eating disorders have shown
      promising results.

      Objective: The first aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a tailored therapist
      guided internet-based treatment for individuals with eating disorders. The second aim was to
      examine the role of knowledge acquisition.

      Method: 138 participants were recruited. Screening consisted of online questionnaires
      followed by a telephone interview. A total of 92 participants were included after a
      semi-structured diagnostic interview and randomized to an 8 week treatment program (n=46) or
      to a control condition (n=46). Treatment consisted of individually prescribed cognitive
      behaviour therapy text modules in conjunction with online therapist guidance. The control
      group consisted of a waitlist who later received treatment.
