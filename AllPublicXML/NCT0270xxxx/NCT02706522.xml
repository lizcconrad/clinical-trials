  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effects of preoperative carbohydrate intake on perioperative
      neuroinflammation and development of delirium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative insulin resistance may primarily contribute to development of postoperative
      delirium in high risk patients. Preoperative administration of oral carbohydrate reduces
      insulin resistance. The investigators aimed to investigate the influence of carbohydrate
      loading on the serum level of S-100β, a surrogate marker of delirium, and the incidence of
      postoperative delirium in elderly patients.
