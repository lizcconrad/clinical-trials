      This study is a Phase Ib/II open label, single arm, adaptive multi-centre trial of copanlisib
      in combination with trastuzumab in pretreated recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast
      cancer.

      Patients with HER2 positive, metastatic or incurable recurrent breast cancer, following
      disease progression during, or after, treatment with at least one systemic treatment regimen
      in the metastatic or recurrent setting, will be treated with copanlisib (at 30, 45 or 60 mg
      flat dosing IV weekly - depending on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in the Phase
      Ib part of the study) plus trastuzumab (4 mg/kg IV Cycle 1 Day 1 and then 2 mg/kg IV weekly
      starting from day 8).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ib One of three dose levels of copanlisib is assigned at registration according to the
      dose escalation scheme.

      Phase II The copanlisib dose for the Phase II part of the trial will be based on the MTD
      established in the Phase Ib part of the study.

      Clinical and laboratory parameters will be assessed to evaluate disease response and toxicity
      of study therapy.

      Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study.

      Efficacy assessments (radiological examination) will be performed on all patients every 8
      weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter.

      Following baseline cardiac assessment, cardiac safety monitoring will include physical exam
      (with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification for patients with diagnosed
      congestive heart failure) during each cycle, Multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or
      Echocardiogram (ECHO) and 12 lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) within 7 days of Day 1 of every
      third cycle starting at cycle 3 (Cycle 3, Cycle 6, etc.).

    <description>Copanlisib is a novel small molecule PI3K inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of a wide variety of advanced and refractory malignancies either as a single agent or in combination with other investigational agents.Copanlisib has potent and selective activity against all four Class I PI3K isoforms with IC50s of 0.5-6.4nM in biochemical assays. Notably, copanlisib shows excellent anti-tumour activity in pre-clinical models with an up-regulated PI3Kα pathway suggesting a particular role for it in PIK3CA mutated cancers.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they meet all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Adult women ≥18 years of age with histologically confirmed, recurrent, or metastatic,
             HER2-positive breast cancer.

             Eligible recurrent disease is recurrent disease that is considered incurable by the
             treating oncologist. Many local only recurrences are treated with curative intent; a
             treatment plan with curative intent for a local only recurrence would indicate that
             the patient is not eligible for this clinical trial. A local only recurrence must be
             considered incurable by the treating oncologist for the patient to be eligible.

          2. Documented HER2 overexpression by local laboratory (IHC 3+ or FISH or CISH positive).

          3. At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria (Version 1.1). Patients
             with bone only disease are not eligible.

          4. Patient has received at least one trastuzumab based or TDM1-based treatment regimen in
             the setting of metastatic disease or incurable locoregional recurrence. A trastuzumab
             based or TDM1-based treatment regimen is considered as any treatment regimen that
             includes trastuzumab or TDM1.

             Patients must have had at least 1 line of therapy for metastatic and/or incurable
             locoregional recurrent disease to be eligible. A patient is eligible regardless of the
             period of time from adjuvant therapy so long as she has disease that is progressing
             after at least 1 line of trastuzumab-based therapy in the setting of metastatic
             disease and/or incurable locoregional recurrence.

          5. Disease progression during or following the most recent anticancer therapy.

          6. ECOG performance status ≤2.

          7. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          8. Availability of fresh tissue and/or archival tumour tissue at screening.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception when sexually active. This applies from signing of the informed consent
             form until at least 100 days after the last study drug administration. The
             investigator or a designated associate is required to advise the patient how to
             achieve an adequate birth control. Highly effective contraception is defined in the
             study as methods that achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
             consistently and correctly. Such methods include: combined (oestrogen and progestogen
             containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,
             intravaginal, transdermal) progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable and implantable), intrauterine device (IUD),
             intrauterine hormone releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, successfully
             vasectomised partner and sexual abstinence. In addition, the use of condoms by
             patients or their partners is required unless the woman has had a hysterectomy.

         10. Adequate baseline laboratory values collected no more than 14 days before starting
             study treatment:

             Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (&lt;3 x ULN for patients with liver involvement). Alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN (≤5 x ULN for
             patients with liver involvement from breast cancer).

             Lipase ≤1.5 x ULN. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2 according to the
             Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula. If not on target,
             this evaluation may be repeated once after at least 24 hours either according to the
             MDRD abbreviated formula or by 24 hour sampling. If the later result is within
             acceptable range, it may be used to fulfil the inclusion criteria instead.

             International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤1.5 x ULN.
             Patients who are therapeutically treated with an agent such as warfarin or heparin
             will be allowed to participate provided that no prior evidence of underlying
             abnormality in coagulation parameters exists. Close monitoring of these patients (Day
             15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each cycle) will be performed until INR/PTT is stable based
             on a measurement that is predose as defined by the local standard of care.

             Platelet count ≥75 x 109/L. For patients with breast cancer bone marrow infiltration,
             platelet count ≥50 x 109/L.

             Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥8 g/dL. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1 x 109/L. For patients
             with malignant bone marrow infiltration, ANC count ≥0.75 x 109/L.

             Fasting blood glucose &lt;125 mg/dL (≤6.9 mmol/L) if not diabetic or &lt;160 mg/dL (≤8.9
             mmol/L) if diabetic

         11. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), above the Institutions lower limit of
             normal, as determined by ECHO or MUGA.

         12. Patients must have recovered from clinically significant side effects associated with
             prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

             5.1.1 Additional criteria for Phase II:

         13. PIK3CA mutation confirmed by central laboratory.

         14. Phase Ib subjects (who are confirmed PIK3CA mutation carriers) must have been treated
             at the MTD in order to proceed with enrolment/registration to the Phase II study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
