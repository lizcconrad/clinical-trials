  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, and is
      the proximate cause of death in over 100,000 hospitalized patients per year. To put this in
      better context, VTE kills more people each year than the annual morbidity from motor vehicle
      crashes and breast cancer combined. Surgeons commonly provide enoxaparin, a low molecular
      weight heparin, for VTE prophylaxis. Enoxaparin's activity is quantified by anti-Factor Xa
      (aFXa) levels. Studies of enoxaparin metabolism in patients with traumatic injury, thermal
      injury, or those undergoing reconstructive surgery have shown that standard dosing can result
      in inadequate aFXa levels, likely from the hypermetabolic state associated with significant
      injury. Small studies have associated subtherapeutic aFXa levels with increased risk for life
      or limb-threatening VTE events. Prior work from has shown that 2-10% of highest risk surgical
      patients have a VTE event despite enoxaparin prophylaxis. The investigators believe that
      surgical patients would benefit from an individualized dosing regimen for enoxaparin
      prophylaxis and that individualized dosing will decrease observed rates of life or
      limb-threatening post-operative VTE events.

      This project will critically examine the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic doses of enoxaparin
      in surgical patients, and will evaluate how alteration of enoxaparin dose magnitude and
      frequency affects peak and trough aFXa levels as well as risk for re-operative hematoma. If
      subtherapeutic aFXa levels are observed, the study will design, implement and test a clinical
      protocol to optimize post-operative aFXa levels. Although not an explicit Aim, this study
      will also provide important preliminary data on VTE rates in surgical patients with in range
      and out of range aFXa levels.

    <description>We will identify a convenience sample of surgical patients placed on enoxaparin prophylaxis at their attending surgeon's discretion—the proposed research will not dictate the initial enoxaparin dose magnitude or frequency. However, we will identify patients already on enoxaparin, evaluate peak and trough steady state aFXa levels, and adjust patient's dose if necessary based on steady state aFXa levels. Eligible patients will have enoxaparin prophylaxis started within 36 after surgery at their surgeon's discretion. Steady state peak and trough aFXa levels will be drawn at 4 and 12 hours, respectively, after the third enoxaparin dose. Goal peak aFXa levels will be 0.2-0.4 IU/mL for twice daily dosing and 0.3-0.5 IU/mL for once daily dosing.</description>

    <description>Patients with identified out of range levels will receive pharmacist-driven real time enoxaparin dose adjustment and will receive followup steady state peak and trough aFXa levels. aFXa monitoring will be discontinued when in range peak levels are obtained, when enoxaparin prophylaxis is discontinued at surgeon discretion, or when the patient is discharged. Patients may be continued on enoxaparin prophylaxis after discharge per attending surgeon discretion but aFXa levels will not be followed in the outpatient environment.</description>
