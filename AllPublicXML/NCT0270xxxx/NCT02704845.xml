  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biopsychosocial model is well established in chronic low back pain (CLBP) research.
      Nevertheless, researchers to date have overlooked the biopsychosocial aspects of Inflammatory
      Low Back pain (ILBP). Most health care providers are biologically oriented in their treatment
      of ILBP, neglecting its possible multidimensional nature. It is true that people with ILBP
      may present with more complex pain and physical limitations than those with chronic
      non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP), but it remains unexplored whether or not these
      limitations are affected by the same pain factors that affect CNSLBP patients. This study
      aims to explore and compare the biopsychosocial back pain profiles of adults with ILBP and
      CNSLBP.

      This is a multicentre case-control study that will compare back pain in patients with
      ankylosing spondylitis and CNSLBP. A multidimensional pain assessment will be conducted for
      patients in both groups. Each patient will be assessed on one occasion by the same
      experienced physiotherapist.
