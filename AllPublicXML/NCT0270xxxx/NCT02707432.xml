  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine the feasibility and efficacy of adapting an evidence-based
      intervention (EBI) to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in rural African
      American communities and determine the acceptability of mobile technology in these
      communities to support behavior change.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in the United States (US),
      disproportionately burdens rural communities. CVD prevalence rates for residents of rural
      areas (13.1%) is higher compared to those in urban areas (11.2%) of the US.Geographic
      differences in heart disease mortality led Cosby et al. to describe the rural &quot;mortality
      penalty&quot; in the US. The proposed settings for this research report similar trends in CVD
      prevalence, where CVD and stroke are among the top three leading causes of death. In
      community health assessments conducted in the last three years CVD risk factors such as
      obesity and hypertension were among the top 10 health priorities in our target counties.
      Compared to residents of metropolitan areas, rural residents have higher rates of cigarette
      smoking, obesity, mortality from ischemic heart disease, and are physically inactive. These
      disparities are likely to widen; at the current rate, its estimated 50% of individuals in the
      US will have CVD by 2030.

      Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, our specific aims for the
      study are to:

        1. Expand and sustain a coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop
           successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities;

        2. Conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble,
           review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths
           and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and
           healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk
           reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention
           using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and
           facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability;

        3. Adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping;

        4. Conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b)
           feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings.
