  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, single-arm, window of opportunity pilot trial of pembrolizumab
      in patients with resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. All patients will undergo a
      pretreatment PET/CT scan for clinical staging and a VATS procedure to acquire pretreatment
      tissue. Three cycles of pembrolizumab will then be administered (200 mg IV every 21 days). A
      PET/CT scan will then be repeated to assess response to pembrolizumab and then surgical
      resection will be performed via an extended/pleurectomy decortication at least 4 weeks after
      the third dose of pembrolizumab. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and
      pemetrexed for 4 cycles (every 21 days) will be given starting about 6-8 weeks following
      surgery, after a new baseline CT scan is obtained. Restaging CT scans will be obtained to
      assess response after every two cycles of chemotherapy. After the completion of standard
      chemotherapy, optional adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab will be given to eligible
      patients for 1 year post-surgery.

      Primary Objectives

        1. To determine the rate of induction of a Gamma-Interferon Gene Expression profile (GEP)
           using a CLIA Nanostring nCounter based assay (performed in Merck's CLIA laboratory) in
           patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with pembrolizumab

        2. To determine the safety and feasibility of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in patients with
           malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      Exploratory Objectives

        1. To determine 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with
           pembrolizumab via a multimodality approach (including neoadjuvant pembrolizumab,
           extended pleurectomy/decortication, adjuvant pemetrexed/cisplatin and if applicable
           adjuvant pembrolizumab).

        2. To determine the median overall survival (OS) for MM patients treated with pembrolizumab
           via a multimodality approach (including neoadjuvant pembrolizumab, extended
           pleurectomy/decortication, adjuvant pemetrexed/cisplatin and if applicable adjuvant
           pembrolizumab).

        3. To determine the 1-year PFS, disease free survival (DFS) and OS for PD-L1 positive or
           TCIP-positive MM patients treated with a multimodality approach.

        4. To determine safety of adjuvant pembrolizumab treatment after surgery and adjuvant
           chemotherapy

        5. To determine the objective response rate to single-agent pembrolizumab via PET/CT in
           previously untreated MM patients, and to correlate this response with changes in the
           immune microenvironment.
