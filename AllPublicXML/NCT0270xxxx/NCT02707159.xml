  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer have metastatic disease at the time of
      diagnosis. The prognosis is extremely poor with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%.
      Treatment with chemotherapy can improve efficacy, but still the median progression-free
      survival in patients receiving nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine is only 5,5 months and median
      overall survival is less than one year. There is a urgent need for tools for predicting the
      efficacy of the treatment. The current trial aims at investigating the biomarker potential of
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients treated by
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female &gt; 18 years up to 80 years

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas before start of
             treatment. Also patients for whom there is a strong suspicion of unresectable
             pancreatic cancer will before the diagnosis is confirmed be asked for consent to take
             2 additional biopsies at the time of diagnostic biopsy retrieval, in case the
             histological analysis confirms that they can be included.

          -  Locally advanced (primarily unresectable) and/or metastatic disease.

          -  Presence of at least one measurable lesion according to the RECIST criteria, not
             restricted to previously irradiated area or limited to bone, pleural effusion or
             ascites.

          -  ECOG/WHO performance status ≤2

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1.5 x 109 /L and platelet count &gt;100 x 109/L

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range at the institution
             (ULN) or AST or ALT &lt; 2 x ULN. If liver metastases are present, patients can be
             included if total bilirubin &lt; 5× ULN or AST/ALT &lt;10× ULN. Dose reductions of
             paclitaxel will be performed when bilirubin &gt;2xULN, depending on increase of the
             bilirubin level according to the recommendations of the Summary of Product
             Characteristics.

          -  Serum creatinin &lt; 1,5 ULN / calculated creatine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current infection, bowel obstruction or subobstruction, or other uncontrolled
             intercurrent illness.

          -  Prior medical treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer

          -  Confirmed brain metastasis.

          -  Concurrent or past history of another malignancy except curatively treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix.

          -  Treatment with any other investigational drug more than 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Allergy to anyone of the included drugs.

          -  Female patient breast feeding or pregnancy

          -  Not able/ or not willing to use adequate contraception (defined below). A pregnancy
             test will be included in the baseline visit for women of childbearing potential.
