  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma and shows extremely poor survival. This prospective pilot study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of pegylated aspargase(PEG-ASP)combined with etoposide and gemcitabine
      (PEG) treatment in this population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment PEG dosages were as follows: days 1 and 8,30min intravenous infusion of 1000mg/m2
      gemcitabine;day1,4h intravenous infusion of 100mg/m2 etoposide,day1-3,deep intramuscular
      injection of 2500unit/m2 PEG-ASP at three different sites.The regimen was repeated every 3
      weeks.Stage IE/IIE patients underwent four cycles induction chemotherapy, followed by
      involved-field radiotherapy after got complete remission ,partial regression or stable
      disease.Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was done by linear accelerator at 2.0 grays
      (Gy) per daily fraction with 5-6 weeks. The involved-field radiation (IFRT) dose was 50-56
      Gy.Stage IIIE/IVE patients were given for a maximum of six cycles.Refractory/relapsed
      patients underwent at least two cycles treatments unless there was disease progression or
      unacceptable side effects, or withdrawal of patient consent. Autologous haematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (AHSCT) was recommended after achieving CR for advanced stage and
      refractory/relapsed patients
