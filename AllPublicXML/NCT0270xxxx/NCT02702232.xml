  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder that is increasingly
      recognized in our ageing population. It is characterized by cardinal clinical features
      including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. For most people with PD,
      the most serious concern is with the motor system: stiffness, slowness of movement, impaired
      handwriting and coordination, poor mobility and balance. However, more than half of all
      people with PD have experienced painful symptoms. Most people experience aching, stiffness,
      numbness and tingling at some point in the course of the illness. Defazio et al reported that
      pain may begin at clinical onset of PD or thereafter as a non-motor feature of PD.5 Aching
      muscles and joints are especially common in PD. Rigidity, lack of spontaneous movement,
      abnormalities of posture and awkward mechanical stresses all contribute to musculoskeletal
      pain in PD.

      One of the most common musculoskeletal complaints is shoulder pain or shoulder disorders,
      including frozen shoulder, bursitis, and rotator cuff lesions. Actually, shoulder pain or
      shoulder disorder can be the first sign of PD. The prevalence and severity of shoulder
      disorders in Parkinson's disease are not totally clear. In a retrospective study, Stamey
      found shoulder pain was present in 11% of patients with PD.

      Over the past ten years ultrasound (US) has become popular in the evaluation of shoulder
      disorders. It allows for the detailed assessment of a wide range of changes involving
      different anatomic structures of the shoulder joint, including rotator cuffs, biceps tendon,
      and subdeltoid bursa. Koh et al found among 33 PD patients, 22 patients had abnormal US
      findings on the dominant side, and all 22 patients with abnormal US finding had a tendon tear
      and 9 patients had frozen shoulder. However, there were no control group in Koh' s study, and
      diagnosis of frozen shoulder with US findings is still controversial.

      The purposes of this study are to evaluate patients with PD with a combination of physical
      examination and US study of the shoulder, and to compare the frequency and type of shoulder
      lesion in US between patients with PD and normal subjects. The investigators also plan to
      test the correlation between shoulder disorders or US abnormality and the severity of PD.

    <description>The VAS scores were obtained using a horizontal lines of 100 mm, with 0 on the left indicating no pain and 100 on the right indicating very severe pain. A VAS has been shown to be reliable and sensitive for quantifying pain, with test-retest reliability of ï¼ž0.90.19 In previous studies of patients treated for various shoulder disorders, the responsiveness of VAS for pain was moderate to good.</description>

    <description>The SPADI is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the pain and disability associated with shoulder disease. The total SPADI score is ranges between 0 and 100. The SDQ is a symptoms in patients with shoulder disorders. The final score is obtained by dividing the number by 100, which results in a final score ranging between 0 (no disability) and 100 (the worst situation).</description>
