  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is the final phase of a three phase PCORI-funded study to develop and test
      patient-centered approaches to collect sexual orientation and gender identity (SO/GI)
      information in the ED. From the results of Phase 1 qualitative interviews and national
      quantitative survey and Phase 2 Delphi rounds with the Stakeholder Advisory Board, we have
      determined two methods of collection favored by patients and providers to implement in the
      trial. The first method, nurse verbal collection, is in alignment with Partners recommended
      clinical practice and is therefore a quality improvement (QI) evaluation. The second method,
      non-verbal registrar form collection with nurse verbal confirmation, is a research
      intervention to evaluate and compare a new patient-centered approach to SO/GI collection. To
      compare the patient-centeredness of the two different approaches, satisfaction surveys will
      be administered to ED patients and staff members involved in collection.

      In summary, the study design (1) evaluates recommended current practice (QI), (2) evaluates a
      quality improvement project to increase recommended current practice, and (3) evaluates a new
      method of collecting SO/GI (research intervention).

    <description>In Mode 1, all patients presenting to the ED will have SO/GI information collected verbally by the nurse, which is standard of care. In Mode 2, all patients presenting to the ED will have SO/GI information collected in a non-verbal manner, in which the registrar will ask them to complete an electronic form.</description>
