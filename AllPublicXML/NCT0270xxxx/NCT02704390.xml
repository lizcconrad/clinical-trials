  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of ORADUR®-Methylphenidate in children
      and adolescents with ADHD, subjects who participated in the previous OP-2PN012-301 study will
      be invited to join this extension study for 24-month follow-up. Subjects will continue to
      receive ORADUR®-Methylphenidate at the previously determined optimal dose.
