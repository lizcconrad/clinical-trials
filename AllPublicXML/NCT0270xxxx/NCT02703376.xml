      This study is safety and proof-of-concept study for oral prednisolone in the treatment of
      esophageal stricture after esophageal surgery. The patients who develop the severe esophageal
      strictures from 28 days after esophageal surgery are included. Primary outcomes are Safety
      and Success rate of this treatment.

    <textblock>
      Esophageal strictures are common complications after surgery and aggressive endoscopic
      submucosal dissection (ESD) for early-stage esophageal cancer and adenocarcinoma. However,
      patients, who develop esophageal strictures after extensive operations, usually develop
      refractory strictures. Although there are several treatments for refractory strictures, their
      utility is limited.

      Yamaguchi and colleagues have developed new treatments using oral prednisolone. They have
      shown the safety and potential efficacy to prevent esophageal strictures after ESD. However,
      the efficacy and safety of oral prednisolone is not evaluated to esophageal stricture after
      esophageal surgery.

      This study is safety and proof-of-concept study for oral prednisolone in the treatment of
      esophageal stricture after esophageal surgery. The patients who develop the severe esophageal
      strictures from 28 days after esophageal surgery are included. Primary outcomes are Safety
      and Success rate of this treatment.
