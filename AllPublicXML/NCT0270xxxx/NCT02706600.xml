  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently 900,000 people in the UK with a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD), The disease is progressive and often causes disabling symptoms such
      as chronic cough, breathlessness and reduced tolerance to exercise. National Institute for
      Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that patients with COPD have a self management
      plan (SMP). The utilisation of SMP's has been shown to reduce healthcare utilisation, improve
      quality of life, and reduces the need for hospitalisation. Currently SMP's are delivered to
      patient in a paper format, myCOPD is a web based self management system which has been
      developed by Healthcare professional and patients encompasses the principles of Self
      management and offers a viable solution to a national recommendation.

      The study will compare paper self management plans against the online version myCOPD. The
      study aims to recruit 60 patients with a diagnosis of COPD during their admission to hospital
      for an exacerbation or flare up of their COPD. Patients will be given an information sheet
      during their admission and prior to leaving hospital be asked if they wish to participate in
      the study. Patients will participate in the study for no less than two months and a maximum
      of three months. 30 patients will receive written self management and 30 will receive online
      self management. There will be a total of 4 visits for the duration of the study.

      The screening visits will comprise of written or verbal consent, Demographics, Medical,
      exacerbation and healthcare utilisation history, Quality of Life questionnaires, inhaler
      technique assessment and delivery of either a written self management plan. The telephone
      visits will comprise of verbal consent and completion of the COPD Assessment Test. The End of
      Study visit will comprise of verbal consent, Demographics, Medical, exacerbation and
      healthcare utilisation history, Quality of Life questionnaires and assessment of inhaler
      technique.

      The study will compare paper self management plans against the online version myCOPD. The
      study aims to recruit 60 patients with a diagnosis of COPD during their admission to hospital
      for an exacerbation or flare up of their COPD. Patients will be given an information sheet
      during their admission and prior to leaving hospital be asked if they wish to participate in
      the study. Patients will participate in the study for no less than two months and a maximum
      of three months. 30 patients will receive written self management and 30 will receive online
      self management. There will be a total of 6 visits for the duration of the study.

      Visit One - Screening Visit This visit will take place within two weeks of discharge from
      hospital in the participants home and comprise of written informed consent, Demographics,
      Medical, exacerbation and healthcare utilisation history, Quality of Life questionnaires,
      inhaler technique assessment This will be assessed using the critical errors list for each
      inhaler devices. Participants will also have their technique using each of their devices
      videoed. Those that fore fill inclusion and exclusion criteria will then be randomised in one
      of two groups, those receiving paper self management and those receiving online self
      management 'myCOPD'. For those receiving written self management The study nurse will
      complete with the participant a written self management plan. For those randomised to online
      self management they will be loan an android/iOS tablet computer and be given unique access
      codes and directed to the online 'How to tutorials .

      Visit Two,Three - Telephone Visits There will be 2 telephone visits during the study and will
      comprise of verbal consent completion of the COPD Assessment Test and adverse event
      reporting.

      Visit Four - End of Study Visit This visit will take place in the participants home and
      comprise of verbal consent, Demographics, Medical, exacerbation and healthcare utilisation
      history, Quality of Life questionnaires and assessment of inhaler technique. This will be
      assessed using the critical errors list for each inhaler devices and technique will be
      videoed. Participants will also be asked to complete a feedback questionnaire to evaluate
      user experience. Those allocated online will have their tablet computers collected by the
      study team and have a written self management plan delivered.

    <measure>COPD Assessment Test (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a validated symptom scoring system used in COPD studies9 The CAT questionnaire contains eight questions and provides a reliable measure of the impact of COPD on health status. Patients read the two statements for each item, which describe the best and worst scenario, (e.g I never cough - I cough all the time), and decide where on the scale of 0-5 they fit. The maximum score is out of 40. The higher the CAT score the greater the impact of symptoms on their health status. Experts involved in the development of CAT suggest that any change of 2 or more in the patient's final score may indicate a clinically significant change. CAT will be recorded at the start prior to any intervention at visit one and 3 months post intervention at visit 4</description>

    <measure>Inhaler technique</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>As different inhaled medication devices require different techniques, each participant's inhaler technique will be assessed according to manufactures guidelines for each device and critical errors recorded. Their technique will be video recorded at visit one and visit two. Any changes to devices during the study will be recorded prior to starting any new treatment. Each participant's technique will be evaluated and the number of critical errors recorded for each device and a composite . Each device will have its own critical error list we have created based on manufactures guidelines. Participants technique will be videoed and assessed using a critical error list for each device by a Health care Professional. This assessment will take place at visit one prior to intervention and 3 months post intervention at visit 4. The difference in the number of errors for each device pre and post intervention will then be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Patient Activation Measure (PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>PAM is a tool used for measuring the level of patient engagement in their healthcare. It was designed to assess an individual's knowledge, skill and confidence for self-management. PAM is a 13-item scale that asks people about their beliefs, knowledge and confidence for engaging in a wide range of health behaviors and then assigns an activation score based on their responses to the 13-item scale. This will be assessed prior to and three months post intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VSAQ is validated Self administered questionnaire developed to estimate exercise capacity for the development of exercise prescription. The VSAQ consists of physical activities listed in progressive order according to their energy demand estimated by metabolic equivalents (METs). One MET is equal to resting oxygen consumption 3.5 ml/kg/min. Therefore, numbers of METs express the energy cost of physical activities as a multiple of the resting metabolic rate. This will be assessed prior to and three months post intervention</description>
