      Validate a non-DRE exosome gene expression test, with an NPV &gt;/= 90% certainty, will exclude
      the presence of high gleason grade/ score (&gt;/=7) prostate cancer in a prostate needle biopsy.

      The purpose of this multi-center clinical study is to determine the association of an Exosome
      Urine Test score with the presence of high Gleason grade / score (GS&gt;/=7) prostate cancer on
      a prostate needle biopsy and validate the assay's performance characteristics in men
      presenting to their urologist with or without a previous negative biopsy, and recommended for
      an initial or subsequent biopsy. The results of this study are to support the use of this
      assay as a laboratory developed test. A secondary objective is to develop an assay that
      accurately predicts the presence of any Gleason grade prostate cancer in men at risk for
      prostate cancer.

    <description>Validate various thresholds utilizing the exosome RNA gene signature to stratify patients based on the likelihood of having any Gleason pattern 4 disease present within the biopsy (or when available the prostatectomy specimen surgical pathology report) for first time biopsy patients in the PSA gray zone of 2.0-10 ng/mL. In our earlier cohort analyses and in the literature there is an expected 20-25% of patients who will present with Gleason score &gt;/=7 and the prevalence of a dominant Gleason 4 varies considerably dependent upon studies from 17-30%.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male, &gt;50 years of age with a clinical suspicion for prostate cancer based in part on
             an elevated PSA (limit range: 2.0 - 20 ng/ mL), and or suspicious DRE, with or without
             the clinical history of a single prior negative biopsy, and who have been recommended
             for a repeat and or first time biopsy.

          2. The subject must be able to comprehend and sign an approved informed consent form and
             other applicable study documents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of medications or hormones that are known to affect serum PSA levels within 3-6
             months of study enrollment.

          2. Clinical symptoms of urinary tract infection (including prostatitis) at the time of
             enrollment.

          3. History of prostate cancer.

          4. History of invasive treatments for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) or lower urinary
             track symptoms within 6 months of study enrollment.

          5. Medical history or concurrent illness that the investigator considers sufficiently
             serious to interfere with the conduct, completion or results of this trial, or
             constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject.

          6. Participation in pharmaceutical or treatment related clinical study within 6 months of
             study enrollment. Exception: Trials for non-prostate conditions may be acceptable,
             with approval by the investigator and Sponsor.

          7. No known hepatitis (all types) and/or HIV documented in patient's medical record.

          8. Patients with history of concurrent renal/bladder tumors within 6 months of study
             enrollment.
