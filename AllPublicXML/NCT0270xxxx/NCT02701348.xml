      The purpose of this study is to monitor the change in cancer size in women with breast cancer
      on anti-hormone treatment using different types of assessment including ultrasound scan (US),
      shearwave elastography (SWE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and assess how this
      corresponds to the changes in the cancer biology.

      Background Endocrine resistance is a significant problem in the management of breast cancer,
      with increasing evidence that the tumour microenvironment is influential on tumour growth and
      disease resistance. The neoadjuvant setting provides an excellent opportunity to observe
      tumour response to treatment in vivo, allowing development of methods for monitoring and
      predicting response to treatment.

      Aims To assess potential radiological and biological tumoural and peri-tumoural biomarkers in
      patients before and during neoadjuvant endocrine treatment. Our hypothesis is that there will
      be less response in women with abnormal peri-tumoural stroma, and that tumours with high
      monocarboxyl transporter (MCT4) and loss of caveolin-1 in stroma are resistant to endocrine
      treatment.

      Techniques and Methodology Patients with primary breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant
      letrozole will undergo radiological assessment with digital mammogram, US including SWE, and
      MRI. Core biopsies will be taken at diagnosis and at surgery from tumour and peri-tumoural
      stroma, and assessed for biomarkers lysyl oxidase (LOX), fibronectin, collagen,
      proliferation, MCT4 and caveolin-1. All data will be correlated to peri-tumoural
      abnormalities on MRI and SWE.

      Impact on breast cancer research This study will provide information on the ability of SWE
      and MRI to predict and detect endocrine resistance, correlated with biological markers that
      are associated with endocrine resistance. Identifying resistant tumours can prevent
      unnecessary treatment and reduce risks of recurrence as alternative or additional therapies
      can be utilised.
