      This pilot, randomized phase II trial studies how well depleted immune suppressor stem cell
      transplant works compared to standard stem cell transplant in enhancing immune response to
      vaccines in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Chemotherapy and the patient's own stem
      cells are effective in treating MM, however there is a risk of disease returning due to poor
      recovery of the immune system as shown to poor response to vaccines to prevent infections.
      Before chemotherapy, patients' stem cells are collected and certain immune cells called
      suppressor cells are removed from the stem cells. Patients then receive chemotherapy to kill
      cancer cells and after that the immune depleted stem cells are returned to them to replace
      the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Giving depleted immune
      suppressor stem cells transplant to patients with MM may result in a more robust immune
      response to vaccines after transplant and may prevent MM from returning. It is not yet known
      whether depleted immune suppressor stem cell transplant is more effective than standard stem
      cell transplant in enhancing immune response to vaccines in patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the cellular and humoral vaccine response post-transplant between the two arms.

      II. To determine the feasibility and safety of this approach.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare post-transplant recovery of innate and adaptive immune cells (cluster of
      differentiation [CD] CD8, CD4, CD19, natural killer cells [NK], gamma delta T-cells), in
      addition to T-cell phenotype markers between the two arms.

      II. To compare post-transplant recovery of regulatory T-cells (T-regs) and myeloid derived
      suppressor cells (MDSCs) between the two arms.

      III. Progression free survival at 2 years post-transplant. IV. To compare multiple myeloma
      (MM) minimal residual disease (MRD) status at 3 months post-transplant between the two arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive X box binding protein-1(XBP1)-US/XBP1-SP/CD138/CS1 multipeptide
      vaccine PVX-410 subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks for 3 doses before transplant and on days
      1, 15, and 30 and tetanus and influenza vaccines intramuscularly (IM) with the 3rd dose
      vaccine dose before transplant. Patients receive conditioning regimen comprising high-dose
      melphalan intravenously (IV) on day -2 and undergo autologous CD34 hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) on day 0. Patients also receive autologous donor lymphocyte (DLI) IV on day
      2.

      ARM II: Patients receive XBP1-US/XBP1-SP/CD138/CS1 multipeptide vaccine PVX-410
      subcutaneously and tetanus and influenza vaccines as in Arm I. Patients receive high-dose
      melphalan IV on day -2 and undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) on
      day 0.
