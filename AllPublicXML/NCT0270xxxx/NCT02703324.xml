      This study will evaluate a blood sugar lowering insulin, LY900014, delivered by an insulin
      pump continuously under the skin. The study will be conducted in participants with type 1
      diabetes mellitus to investigate how the human body processes LY900014 and its effect on
      blood sugar levels when it is delivered via an insulin pump. Side effects and tolerability
      will be documented.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female participants with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) who are receiving
             insulin therapy via an approved insulin pump

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 33 kilogram per square meter (kg/m²),
             inclusive, at screening

          -  Have blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood and urine laboratory
             test results that are acceptable for the study

          -  Have had no episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the past 6 months (requiring assistance
             in treatment by a second party)

          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling

          -  Have provided written consent and are willing to follow study procedures and commit to
             the study duration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are currently participating in or completed a clinical trial within the last 30 days
             from a clinical trial or any other type of medical research judged to be incompatible
             with this study

          -  Have previously participated or withdrawn from this study

          -  Have or used to have health problems, laboratory test results, blood pressure or ECG
             readings that, in the opinion of the doctor, could make it unsafe to participate in
             the study

          -  Had blood loss of more than 500 milliliters (mL) within the last month
