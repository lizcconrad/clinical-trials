  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen reserve index (ORI) measured by multiple wave pulse co-oximeter is a new technological
      development in medical science. Our aim in this study is to identify the correlation between
      arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and ORI, and to identify the specificity and sensitivity of
      ORI as a tool to prevent hypoxia and hyperoxia in abdominal surgery patients.

      Patients aged between 20-55 years old,American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status
      1-2 who will have hemicolectomy will be included to the study. If hemodynamic instability or
      a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) occurs, arterial blood gas
      analysis will be taken from the patient and ORI, SpO2, PaO2, and arterial oxygen saturation
      (SaO2) will be recorded. The primer endpoint of the study is to identify the correlation
      between PaO2 and ORI, seconder end-point is to identify the specificity and sensitivity of
      ORI as a detector of PaO2. Pearson test for correlation, regression analysis for sensitivity
      and specificity will be performed. The study will include 240 patients according to power
      analysis
