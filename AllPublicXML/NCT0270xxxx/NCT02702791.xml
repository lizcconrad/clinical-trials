  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will investigate whether the implementation of a telecoaching
      program, initiated during pulmonary rehabilitation, is able to increase and maintain physical
      activity and general benefits until six months after rehabilitation discharge.

      After three months of pulmonary rehabilitation (3 times a week), patients with COPD will be
      randomized to either an intervention group which receives an additional telecoaching program
      on top of the pulmonary rehabilitation, or to the usual care group, which only receives
      rehabilitation program. Apart from the added telecoaching program to the intervention group,
      the rehabilitation program will be identical and last for another three months (2 times a
      week). After discharge, both groups will be followed up for six months.
