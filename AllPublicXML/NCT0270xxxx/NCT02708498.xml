  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research on ageing during the last couple of decades has increasingly focused on
      questions regarding the quality of life and life satisfaction of the old people. Yet the
      research indicates that when it comes to the final stage of life, the end includes
      unnecessary suffering and the quality of life drops. Palliative care has traditionally been
      provided successfully to younger persons dying from incurable illnesses while older people
      dying of multiple morbidities or &quot;old age&quot; has received far less of this type of care.
      However, sixty percent of all people who died in Sweden in 2010 were at least 80 years old
      and it is well known that dying among older people often is a prolonged period of suffering.
      One reason might be that it is more difficult to identify when the final stages of life
      begins for older persons.

      The purpose of this project is to implement and evaluate how a knowledge-based model for
      palliative care in nursing homes affects the quality of life and the participation in the
      care process for older persons in nursing homes and their next of kin. A second aim is to
      explore the staff's implementation process of palliative care and the role of the leadership.
      The final aim is to investigate which factors (barriers and facilitators) that affect the
      implementation process of this model.

      The project is conducted as a cross-over implementation project about evidence-based
      palliative care. It is an educational intervention with seminars for professionals in nursing
      homes. It takes place in two counties (Kronoberg and Skåne) in the south of Sweden. The
      strategy is based on two national knowledge documents concerning palliative care at the end
      of life and the Swedish Register of Palliative Care (SRPC). The main tailored intervention
      study is ongoing during 6 months. It is based on a pilot study conducted during fall 2014.
      The main intervention started in April 2015 in Alvesta and Ljungby municipalities, Kronoberg
      County. The educational intervention will be implemented in other municipal nursing homes
      than in the pilot/feasibility study. Implementation of the educational intervention is
      conducted in ten nursing homes in Kronoberg County (2015). An equal number of nursing homes
      in Skåne County will consist of the control group. The educational intervention will then be
      evaluated in the same way in the two counties through measurement before (baseline) and after
      the intervention. In the second phase (cross-over design) during 2016, the ten control
      nursing homes in Skåne will be chosen to implement the co-created palliative care educational
      intervention and ten new nursing homes in Kronoberg, which has not received the intervention,
      will be chosen as a control group in Tingsryd and Växjö municipalities.

      Every seminar group meets once a month and includes different professions (unit manager,
      district nurse, assistant nurse, and other staff i.e. occupational therapist and
      physiotherapist). There will be 5 meetings with 8-10 participants in each group from each
      nursing home. The total intervention period is about 6 months.

    <description>The seminar groups will be led by two experienced clinical nurses and researchers from the field of palliative care and geriatric care. The educational material consist of six themes; values in palliative care, symptom relief, dignity and a dignified death, collaborative co-creating care, support to next of kin and dialogue with older persons and next of kin about death and dying. The content of the different themes will have a common core for each nursing home but will be adjusted based on the expressed needs of each nursing home. New themes can be created related to the needs of the unique nursing home. The participants in the seminar groups will reflect together over the content of the developed binder of educational material and will relate it to their own work in order to identify areas suitable for changes and/or development.</description>
