    <textblock>
      There is little evidence showed that adjuvant therapy had been shown to extend the survival
      of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receiving surgical resection. We investigated
      whether injections of highly-purified Cytotoxic T lymphocytes prolongs recurrence-free
      survival of patients after resection for HCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common and the third leading cause of
      cancer-related death worldwide. Resection is considered as the main curative treatment for
      HCC, but recurrence of tumor within the liver remnant is common, with a reported 5-year
      recurrence rate of 70%, which results in poor prognosis of HCC, and the high recurrence rate
      has led efforts to develop adjuvant therapies to reduce recurrence. However, the benefit of
      any form of adjuvant therapy remains unclear. Current guidelines didn't recommend any
      adjuvant therapy after resection. A previous clinical trial from Japan reported that
      cytokine-induced killer(CIK) cell immunotherapy increased recurrence-free survival (RFS)
      after surgical resection of HCC. Immunotherapy has become an optional treatment for HCC.
      Cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL), a kind of effective T cells that specific recognizing and
      killing antigen targeted cells through cloning amplification after receiving antigen
      information from antigen presented cell and playing key role to clear cancerous cells. There
      is little evidence for adjuvant CTL treatment for HCC receiving resection. So our hypothesis
      is that adjuvant highly-purified CTL is superior to resection alone for HCC. The aim of this
      prospective study is to compare the outcome of resection combined with highly-purified CTL
      with resection for HCC.

    <description>Resection was carried out under general anesthesia using a right subcostal incision with a midline extension. Intra-operative ultrasonography was performed routinely to evaluate the tumor burden, liver remnant and the possibility of a negative resection margin. The investigators performed anatomical resection aiming at a resection margin of at least 1 cm. Pringle's maneuver was routinely used with a clamp and unclamp time of 10 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. Hemostasis of the raw liver surface was done with suturing and application of fibrin glue.</description>

    <description>Peripheral blood (20-30mL) for manufacturing the individualized highly-purified CTL agent was collected from the respective participants who were randomized to the immunotherapy group before starting treatment. The highly-purified CTL agent was prepared at a central manufacturing facility. Participants in the immunotherapy group received a number up to 5×10E9 of the highly-purified CTL agent intravenously over 60 minutes without any premedication and then were observed for at least 30 minutes. Participants were scheduled to receive highly-purified CTL: 4-6 treatments at a frequency of once two-week during 6 months after receiving resection, followed by 6-9 treatments during 6 months to 2 years after receiving resection.</description>
