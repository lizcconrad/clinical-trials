  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multi-center cohort study of pediatric cardiac arrests.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the association between chest compression mechanics
      (rate, depth, flow fraction, compression release) and patient outcomes. In addition, the
      investigators will determine the association of post cardiac arrest care with patient
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrests in children are a major public health problem. Thousands of children each
      year in the USA are treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and managed after their
      cardiac arrest. Neurological outcomes following these in-hospital CPR events are often
      abnormal. As children with neurological deficits following CPR are a major burden for
      families and society, improving neurological outcomes through superior chest compression
      delivery during CPR and optimal care and management after cardiac arrest is an important
      clinical goal.

      Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to obtain evidentiary support to associate
      the relationship of quantitative CPR quality data (depth, rate, chest compressions (CC)
      fraction, compression release) during CPR, post-cardiac arrest care (PCAC) and patient
      survival in those children who suffer an arrest within the study (RES-Q) Network.

    <description>Primary outcome: &quot;Guideline-compliant CPR&quot; which will be determined by an aggregate score comprised of the following three components: depth, rate, and chest compression fraction. The three components will be analyzed in 30 and 60 second epochs. &quot;Guideline-compliant CPR&quot; requires that each component meet the following criteria: 1) Age-determined American Heart Association (AHA) guideline recommended depth; 2) rate ≥ 90 and ≤ 120 CC/min; and 3) CC Fraction ≥ 0.80. Depth, rate, and CC Fraction will be calculated for each epoch and an aggregate score will be assigned. The primary analysis will be performed on that total score.</description>
