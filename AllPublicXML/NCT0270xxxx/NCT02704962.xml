    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that an antipsychotic drug combination of low-dose olanzapine
      plus low-dose trifluoperazine is similar to regular-dose olanzapine monotherapy in efficacy
      and safety for treatment of schizophrenia.The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy
      and safety of the olanzapine (10 mg/d) and olanzapine (5 mg/d) plus trifluoperazine (5 mg/d)
      in the treatment of acute psychotic exacerbations of schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antipsychotic monotherapy is recognized as the treatment of choice for patients with
      schizophrenia. Surveys have shown that antipsychotic polypharmacy are frequently prescribed,
      yet few randomized, double-blind clinical trials have examined this practice. Olanzapine, an
      atypical antipsychotic agent, has low incidence of extrapyramidal symptom but with high cost
      compared to trifluoperazine. It has been reported that mean doses of typical antipsychotics
      less than 600 mg per day of chlorpromazine or its equivalent has no higher risk of
      extrapyramidal symptom than atypical antipsychotics. The objective of the study is to compare
      the efficacy and safety of the olanzapine (10 mg per day) and olanzapine (5 mg per day) plus
      trifluoperazine (5 mg per day) in the treatment of acute psychotic exacerbations of
      schizophrenia. In this 6-week, double-blind, fixed-dose study, patients with schizophrenia
      are randomly assigned to olanzapine (10 mg per day)) or olanzapine (5 mg per day) plus
      trifluoperazine (5 mg per day). The hypothesis is that the two treatment groups have the
      similar efficacy and safety, but different cost. The primary efficacy measure is change from
      baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores; secondary outcomes
      include Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), the Calgary Depression Scale for
      Schizophrenia (CDSS), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF), Short Form-36 (SF-36),
      Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Safety assessments include the change from baseline on
      Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes
      Akathisia Scale (BAS), and UKU Side-effects Rating Scale, and the change from baseline in
      prolactin levels, body weight, vital sign, blood pressure, Bazett's correction of QT interval
      (QTc interval), fasting glucose level, and lipid panel (cholesterol, high density lipid
      protein, low density lipid protein, and triglyceride).
