  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta percreta is a life-threatening condition that patients are under risk of massive
      bleeding. It readily necessitates very complicated surgery even leads to mortality. Cesarean
      hysterectomy is the procedure that is acknowledged worldwide, however, recent studies
      discussing conservative treatment with segmental resections were published. Fetal extraction
      and segmental resection could be performed from same (single uterine incision) or two
      different (double uterine incision) incisions. In this study, the investigators aimed to
      evaluate the effectiveness and the results of double uterine incision.
