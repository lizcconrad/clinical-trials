      Among persons with Immunoglobulin G subclass 4 Related Disease (IgG4)-related disease who
      have persistent or recurrent disease despite standard therapies, does combination therapy
      with rituximab and revlimid cause a sustained disease remission?

    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin G subclass 4 Related Disease (IgG4-RD) is a recently recognized systemic
      fibroinflammatory condition. Various manifestations of IgG4-RD were previously recognized in
      individual organ systems, but these entities (including autoimmune pancreatitis, orbital
      pseudotumor, Reidel's thyroiditis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, idiopathic sialadenitis and
      dacryoadenitis, etc) are now recognized as manifestations of a common disease process that
      can affect any organ system. IgG4-RD is characterized by distinctive histologic findings of
      tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells together with storiform fibrosis and
      obliterative phlebitis. Both clinical and pathologic consensus diagnostic criteria have been
      defined. Serum IgG4 concentration is a biomarker for IgG4-RD and is elevated in 70% to 90% of
      patients with active disease.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of active IgG4-RD based on standard pathologic or clinical criteria (see
             below) and requiring medical treatment

          2. Patient is:

               1. in relapse after prior steroid and/or rituximab (RTX) treatment or while tapering
                  steroid treatment, OR

               2. has disease that is refractory to steroids, OR

               3. has contraindications to steroid therapy (including diabetes, mood disorder,
                  obesity)

          3. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500 and platelet count &gt;/= 100,000

          4. Calculated creatinine clearance (or estimated GFR) greater than or equal to 60ml/min

          5. In patients without hepatobiliary involvement by IgG4-RD, total bilirubin less than or
             equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT)
             and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) less than or equal to 3 x ULN

          6. Not pregnant or nursing

          7. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory Revlimid Risk Evaluation
             and Mitigation Strategy (REMS™) program, and be willing and able to comply with the
             requirements of the REMS™ program

          8. Females of reproductive potential must adhere to the scheduled pregnancy testing as
             required in the Revlimid REMS™ program

          9. Able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients
             intolerant to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) may use warfarin or low molecular weight
             heparin)

         10. Agrees to use acceptable methods of birth control during and for 12 months after

             treatment is low
