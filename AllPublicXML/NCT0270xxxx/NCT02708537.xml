      The hypothesis is growing semen samples with plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF), because it
      could improve sperm motility in patients subsidiary TRA, ultimately improving pregnancy
      rates.

      Platelet growth factors are a group of proteins involved in cellular communication modifying
      biological responses. Obtaining plasma rich in growth factors is already widespread and
      simple protocol technique that is being used in various areas of medicine with superb
      results. Described many of the growth factors present in the PRGF are related to sperm
      parameters, especially motility The described effects have been studied in mammalian and each
      growth factor individually. PRGF contains a pool of growth factors and therefore be
      interesting to analyze their effect on various sperm parameters.

      One of those parameters is very important for fertilization sperm motility, since the lack of
      it will prevent displacement by the cervix to meet the egg in the fallopian tube.

Seminogram to analyze all semen parameters according to the criteria of the WHO (2010), paying particular attention to sperm motility.
Sperm vitality will be analyzed before and after treatment with PRGF. PRGF application on the seminal aliquots will be conducted at different concentrations assessing sperm motility.</description>
