    <textblock>
      To determine the feasibility of frameless Virtual Cone trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery at a
      single institution prior to multi-institutional enrollment. To measure pain relief after
      Virtual Cone radiosurgery utilizing the Barrow Neurologic Institute Pain Intensity Score
      (BNI).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The mean of Barrow Neurologic Institute Pain Intensity Score (BNI) (pain relief score) between the two arms.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Relief Score designed to assess trigeminal neuralgia associated pain. It ranges from &quot;I&quot; being &quot;no trigeminal pain, no medication&quot; to &quot;V&quot; being &quot;severe pain/no pain relief&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with treatment-related adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the assessments of the patient and the responses provided by the patient in questionnaires, we will assess acute and late neurologic toxicities. All adverse events/toxicities will be assessed with the utilization of CTCAE v.4.0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean of Quality of Life Scores as measured by SF-36 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life (QOL) will be measured by SF-36. This questionnaire consists of 36 questions (items) measuring physical and mental health in relation to 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role of limitations due to physical health problems, role of limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perception. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>3 months following the completion of radiosurgery, the patient will be asked the following two questions: 1) Would you have the radiosurgery procedure again? 2) Would you recommend it to friends and family?</description>

    <intervention_name>Unframed Virtual Cone</intervention_name>
    <description>A face mask (unframed) will be placed over the patient's face to keep their head from moving during the procedure. This will allow for very precise targeting. During the procedure, the study doctor will also confirm the exact location that needs to be treated using x-rays and optical imaging cameras. The face mask (unframed) will hold the patient's head to prevent it from moving and to focus the x-rays and aim them on the painful nerve in the patient's brain. For most patients, the actual time on the radiosurgery treatment machine is in the range of 30 to 60 minutes. The face mask (unframed) will be removed after the treatment.</description>
