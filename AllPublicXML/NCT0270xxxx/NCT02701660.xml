  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic dispensers for polypharmacy are used in home care to assist patients with their
      medication management and to improve adherence. Opioid dependent patients with substitution
      therapy often exhibit multiple risk factors for non-adherence. The increase of both the age
      and associated comorbidities in this population demand for innovative solutions to optimize
      medication management. The investigators developed a novel medication supply model with an
      automated electronic medication dispenser to simultaneously assist opioid dependent patients
      with their medication and objectively monitor their adherence. This study aims to demonstrate
      the feasibility of the new supply model.

    <description>An Automatic Tablet Dispensing and Packaging System is used to repack all solid oral prescription medications for each participant into unit-of-dose pouches. Every participant receives a roll with pouches for 14-28 days loaded into a dispenser installed at their homes. The electronic medication dispenser is a remote controlled, electronic medication management aid reminding the patients with acoustic alerts to take their medication.</description>
