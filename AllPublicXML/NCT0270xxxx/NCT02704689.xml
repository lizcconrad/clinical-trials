      This is a post-market clinical study of the AccuLIF expandable transforaminal lumbar
      interbody fusion (TLIF) cage in patients requiring surgery for degenerative disc disease
      (DDD) with up to Grade I spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis, at one or two levels, between
      L2 and S1.

      Study evaluations will be evaluated pre-operatively and at 6-weeks, 3-months, 6-months,
      12-months and 24-months post-operatively to assess clinical outcomes, patient reported
      outcomes and radiographic status.
