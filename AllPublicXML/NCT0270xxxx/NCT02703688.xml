  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few treatments have been developed for young children with obesity from diverse backgrounds.
      The present study will develop and test an intervention designed to improve preschool obesity
      in Latino children. The intervention will focus on improving eating, activity, and sleep
      behaviors and the home environment for improved weight status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children from low income families of minority status are at greater risk for development of
      obesity. There are no known existing treatments for pediatric obesity that focus on improving
      parental behaviors and the home food and activity environment. The objective of this study
      will be to address this limitation by developing and testing a novel treatment for low-income
      minority families. The objective will be attained by testing the following hypothesis: A
      parent-focused, home-based treatment aimed at improving parental feeding behaviors, child
      exposure to fruits and vegetables, and the home food and activity environment will result in
      significantly greater decrease in percent overweight / obesity compared to recommended
      practice. The hypothesis will be tested by using the approach of a pilot randomized control
      trial (RCT). The rationale for this aim is that success of the planned research will derive a
      treatment package that will provide the basis for the RCT. The planned research is expected
      to show the level of impact of changing parental feeding behaviors and the home environment
      on childhood overweight / obesity.

    <description>The Healthy Homes Behavioral Intervention (HHBI) will be delivered during 8 sessions over 10 weeks using home visitations. The first 6 sessions occur weekly and provide education about healthy dietary intake including caloric recommendations for preschool aged children, healthy sleep goals, active play and screen time limits, and family routines and organization. Each session will include a parent-child interaction component to teach child behavior management skills related to intervention goals. Two final sessions occur every other week to provide problem solving and planning for maintenance of treatment effects.</description>
