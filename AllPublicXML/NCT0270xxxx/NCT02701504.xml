    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea is a prevalent disorder in patients with coronary artery disease. Previous
      studies suggested sleep apnea was associated with coronary plaque burden and future adverse
      cardiovascular events. Sleep apnea is also associated with a high incidence of atrial
      fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Yet, previous reports
      used Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale Questionnaire to diagnose sleep apnea.
      However, these screening questionnaires are not as accurate as a proper sleep study. In the
      SABOT study, the investigators used the portable sleep device to diagnose sleep apnea, and
      evaluate the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular outcomes after coronary
      artery bypass surgery.

      The SABOT Study is an observational study designed to study the impact of sleep apnea on
      cardiovascular outcomes after non-urgent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Patients
      between the ages of 18 and 90 who are scheduled undergo an non-urgent CABG were eligible for
      the study

      Sleep Apnea Screening Questionnaire All recruited patients will be asked to complete the
      Berlin Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. The Berlin Questionnaire is
      a validated screening tool used to identify individuals at high risk of sleep apnea. It
      consists of 10 items in three categories, assessing the presence and intensity of snoring,
      the severity of daytime somnolence, and the presence of hypertension and obesity. A positive
      score in two or more categories indicates a high risk of sleep apnea. The Epworth Sleepiness
      Scale is a validated questionnaire that identifies the perceived likelihood of falling asleep
      during eight everyday situations. Patients were asked to rate their likelihood of falling
      asleep during each scenario on a scale of 0-3, for a total score ranging from 0 to 24.
      Excessive daytime sleepiness was defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score &gt; 10.

      Overnight Sleep Study The consenting participants were scheduled to undergo a hospital-based
      overnight sleep study using a US Food and Drug Administration-approved portable monitoring
      devices: the Watch-PAT (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel). Watch-PAT is a four-channel
      unattended sleep monitoring device that measures peripheral arterial tone (PAT), pulse
      oximetry, heart rate, and actigraphy from a built-in actigraph. Respiratory events are
      identified by digital vasoconstriction mediated by α-adrenergic receptors that are sensitive
      to surges in sympathetic activity. Respiratory events are considered to be present when one
      of the following three criteria was met: a reduction in PAT amplitude with an acceleration of
      the pulse rate or an increase in wrist activity; a reduction in PAT amplitude with ≥3%
      oxyhemoglobin desaturation; and ≥4% oxyhemoglobin desaturation only. Although manual scoring
      and editing of the Watch-PAT signals are possible, we adopted results generated by the device
      algorithm alone with no intervention by the operator. The diagnosis of sleep apnea is
      confirmed if the AHI was greater than 15 events/h.

      End Points The pre-specified primary end point is a major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular
      event (MACCE), defined as a composite of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, non-fatal stroke, and repeat revascularization. The secondary end point comprised
      sudden cardiac death or resuscitated cardiac arrest, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization
      for heart failure.
