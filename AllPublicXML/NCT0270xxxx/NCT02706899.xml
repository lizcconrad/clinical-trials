  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 study to evaluate the combination of vadastuximab talirine (SGN-CD33A;
      33A) and azacitidine in subjects with previously untreated International Prognostic Scoring
      System (IPSS) Intermediate-2 or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the phase 1 portion of the study, escalating doses of 33A will be evaluated in combination
      with azacitidine, and a dose of 33A will be selected to proceed to phase 2. The phase 2
      portion of the study is randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled; it is designed to
      compare the overall response rate (ORR) between 2 study arms.
