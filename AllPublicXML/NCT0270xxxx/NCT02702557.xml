    <textblock>
      This feasibility study investigates if frail elderly and hospitalized patients are able to
      perform unsupervised elastic band exercises as a supplement to their usual supervised
      physiotherapy sessions and how much training they perform during their hospitalization. It is
      also investigated how the frail elderly and the health personnel experiences the unsupervised
      elastic band exercises.
