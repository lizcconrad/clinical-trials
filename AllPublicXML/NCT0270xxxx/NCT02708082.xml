      Study consists of five visits over a one to three month time period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each visit consists of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scanning (4 scans ) and two HFA
      (Humphrey Field Analyzer) visual fields of the study eye only.
