  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to determine whether integrating a novel parent-report
      measure of vaccine hesitancy into pediatric primary care is effective in improving acceptance
      of childhood vaccines among vaccine-hesitant parents.

      The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative
      intervention designed to address these barriers—the Screening for Hesitancy to Optimize Talk
      (SHOT) intervention—in improving provider-parent vaccine discussions and increasing vaccine
      acceptance. The SHOT intervention involves administering a validated parent-report measure to
      parents and communicating their score and item-specific responses to their child's provider
      before their child's 2 and 6 month health supervision visits. The survey contains 15
      questions regarding Health Belief Model concepts that influence parent vaccination behavior
      and has been shown to predict under-immunization.

      Our specific aims are to (1) evaluate the impact of the SHOT intervention on a child's
      immunization status using a matched-pair, cluster randomized controlled trial design; (2)
      assess how parents' ratings of their vaccine discussions with their child's provider change
      as a function of the SHOT intervention; and (3) compare pre- and post-study perceptions of
      barriers to quality vaccine discussions with parents between providers in the SHOT and
      control arm.
