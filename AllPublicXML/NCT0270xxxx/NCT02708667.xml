  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crizotinib, an inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), was approved by Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) and its administration has achieved considerable success. However, adverse
      effects inevitably occurred and the most common one was hepatic toxicity, appearing as
      elevating alanine aminotransferase(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase(AST). Therefore, the
      investigators try to figure out the mechanism of crizotinib-inducing hepatic toxicity, and
      explore whether there is any biological marker to diagnose this side effect in an early
      stage, which may realize individualized therapy with more efficacy and less side effects.
