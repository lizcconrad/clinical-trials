      A non-interventional, prospective observational study to assess the performance of SeptiCyte®
      Lab to diagnose patients identified as suspected of sepsis in general medical and surgical
      wards with infection-positive from infection-negative SIRS
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating a molecular diagnostic device developed to distinguish between
      sepsis and infection-negative SIRS among critically ill patients.

      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, non-interventional, observational trial of
      patients with suspected sepsis in the medical and/or surgical wards. The study is being
      conducted on two preselected patient care units.

      All patients identified by a local screening tool undergo physician review. If the suspicion
      of sepsis is found to be plausible, routine and conventional diagnostic procedures,
      including: routine bloods, blood culture and specialized tests are conducted.

      Blood collection for SeptiCyte® Lab and SeptID® is drawn within 6 hours of a positive screen
      - both use peripheral blood as the clinical sample. The diagnostic performance of the two
      experimental assays will be compared to Retrospective Physician Diagnosis (RPD), and
      conventional microbiological culture. The results of SeptiCyte® Lab and SeptID® are not used
      in any clinical decision-making.

      This data will be used to analyze the performance of SeptiCyte® Lab according to the endpoint
      measures.
