    <textblock>
      Using a 2-arm, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) among congestive heart failure (CHF)
      patients at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS), to test the effectiveness of
      applying automated hovering to improve outcomes among CHF patients at high risk of
      readmission. This will leverage the electronic medical record (EMR), the Penn Data Store (an
      electronic repository that can be used to identify study cohorts), and the NIH-funded Way to
      Health platform, which provides linkages between home-based remote monitoring devices and a
      server that can provide automated feedback to patients. The primary outcome will be hospital
      readmission rate during the 12 months of study enrollment. Secondary outcomes will include
      the total cost of hospitalizations. We will enroll CHF patients discharged from UPHS and
      randomize them to either: usual care with no additional intervention; or 1) the provision of
      wireless pill bottles and scales with daily lottery incentives to encourage daily adherence
      2) asked to provide the name and contact information of a family member or friend to serve as
      their support partner 3) have their weights monitored for clinically significant threshold,
      with verified weight gains alerts sent to the managing physician through the EMR. Managing
      providers will also be sent a weekly report of weight measurements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a recent University of Pennsylvania Health System hospital (UPHS)
             discharge of congestive heart failure (CHF) aged 18-80 who will receive follow-up in a
             UPHS outpatient clinic.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they will not or cannot give consent or have a markedly
