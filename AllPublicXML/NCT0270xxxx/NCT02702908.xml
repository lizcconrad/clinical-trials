      This study aims at estimating the incidence of second primary malignancies as well as the
      overall survival among metastasized prostate cancer (mPC) and metastasized castrate-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients not treated with radium-223-dichloride.

      This study aims at estimating the incidence of second primary malignancies as well as the
      overall survival among mPC and mCRPC patients not treated with radium-223-dichloride. The
      source of data for this study will be the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database
      (GePaRD). A retrospective cohort study covering the time period from 2004 to 2013 will be
      conducted. The study population will comprise CRPC patients developing bone metastases. These
      patients will be followed up for the occurrence of second primary malignancies, end of study,
      or death due to any cause. As this study serves as a historical control group for a
      single-arm observational study, incidence rates of second primary malignancies obtained from
      these studies will be compared by the standardized incidence ratio using results from this
      study as a reference.

        The study population will consist of mPC patients (prostate cancer patients with bone
        metastases) and a subgroup of patients who can be regarded as mCRPC patients
        (castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Members of the mPC cohort will have to fulfill all of the following criteria:

               -  Valid information on sex, age and the region of residence

               -  A period of at least 12 months of continuous insurance preceding cohort entry

               -  Diagnosis of PC (ICD-10 Code C61) in the study period (01-Jan-2004 to
                  31-Dec-2011)

               -  Diagnosis of bone metastases (ICD-10 Code C79.5) in the enrolment period
                  (01-Jan-2005 to 31-Dec-2011)

               -  In addition to the criteria of the mPC cohort, members of the mCRPC will
                  additionally have to fulfill:

               -  One of the following in the enrolment period and before or at the same time with
                  bone metastases

                    -  Discontinuation of the initial chemical castration, change of the agent or
                       modality of the Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or start of treatment
                       for advanced Prostate cancer (PC) after the primary ADT.

                    -  Surgical castration and initiation of ADT treatment

                    -  Treatment with medication specific to mCRPC.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the mPC and from the mCRPC populations if they meet one
             of the following criteria:

               -  First PC diagnosis later than 2 months after the diagnosis of bone metastases, or

               -  Use of any radiopharmaceuticals for bone metastases (e.g., samarium, strontium,
                  rhenium, radium)
