  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a lifestyle intervention for women with a pregnancy wish
      who have a high risk on perinatal morbidity because of overweight or obesity. Half of the
      patients will receive the lifestyle intervention while the other half will receive usual
      care. It is hypothesized that an effective lifestyle intervention directed towards healthy
      living, including reduction of overweight or obesity and, if applicable, smoking reduction,
      health problems in mothers and their offspring can be prevented.
