    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a second complete course
      of 200 mg mifepristone and 800 mcg misoprostol for ongoing pregnancy following
      mifepristone-misoprostol medical abortion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site double-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess treatment with a
      repeat mifepristone-misoprostol regimen and with a two-dose misoprostol-alone regimen in
      women who are diagnosed with ongoing pregnancy â‰¤77 days gestational age at 1-week follow-up
      after medical abortion. The sample will be stratified in two cohorts: women with ongoing
      pregnancies &lt;= 56 days of gestation and women with ongoing pregnancies 57-77 days of
      gestation. Eligible women who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to
      either Group 1 for treatment with 200 mg mifepristone followed in 24-48 hours by 800 mcg
      buccal misoprostol, followed by 4 misoprostol placebo pills 3-12 hours later, or to Group 2
      for treatment with one mifepristone placebo pill, followed by 800 mcg buccal misoprostol
      24-48 hours later and another 800 mcg dose repeated in 3-12 hours.

      The study will also assess the acceptability of additional medication for ongoing pregnancy
      following an initial course of mifepristone-misoprostol medical abortion.
