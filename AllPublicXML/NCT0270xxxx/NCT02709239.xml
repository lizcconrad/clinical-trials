  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how much DHA to give to mothers in order to provide
      enough to the baby. Researchers will also learn if there are differences in development of
      the baby up to 12 months after birth.

    <textblock>
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential nutrient. Our bodies make DHA from the foods we
      eat. If we eat foods with a lot of DHA, like fatty ocean fish, we have more DHA in our
      bodies. DHA is found in all cells of the body but is especially high in nerve cells of the
      brain and eye. Babies get DHA from the mother when they're in the womb. After birth, they can
      get DHA from breast milk or infant formulas.

      This study will enroll pregnant women and follow them and their baby until the baby is 12
      months old. Changes in the development of the baby will be tracked. Half of the participants
      in this study will receive 200mg of DHA to take daily. The other half of participants will
      receive 800mg of DHA to take daily. Participants, along with the researchers, will not know
      which dose of DHA they are receiving.

    <description>Maternal blood samples and infant cord blood will be collected at delivery and Red Blood Cell (RBC) DHA concentrations between maternal-infant pairs will be compared. Maternal-Infant DHA Equilibrium occurs if newborn cord blood DHA is less than or equal to the mother's DHA at delivery.</description>
