  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are planning to recruit approximately 30 study participants aged 50 years
      and older that will undergo a 4 week attention and emotion regulation intervention. The
      intervention systematically targets thoughts, emotions and behavior in order to promote
      quality of life and advance successful brain aging. The investigators will assess the
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining participants for an attention and emotion regulation
      intervention. In addition, the investigators will determine the efficacy of the intervention
      to enhance and promote quality of life, sustained attention, emotions, motivation and
      cognitive health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CASA model is developed here in the investigators program (Geda et al) based on
      neuroscience and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The rationale for the study is that
      the cortico-cortical network linking the prefrontal cortex with the mesial temporal lobe is
      susceptible to the wear and tear of day to day life such as stress and emotional distress.
      The investigators hypothesize that the CASA intervention will promote emotional and cognitive
      health by targeting this network.

    <measure>WHOQOL-BREF quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one year</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF instrument comprises 26 items, which measure the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The WHOQOL-BREF is a shorter version of the original instrument that may be more convenient for use in large research studies or clinical trials. Scoring is 1-5 with 1 being either - Not at all, Very poor, Very dissatisfied, or Never. 2 being either - Not much, Poor, Dissatisfied, A little, or Seldom. 3 being either - Moderately, Neither poor nor good, Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, A moderated amount, or Quite often. 4 being either - A great deal, Good, Satisfied, Very much, Mostly, Good, or Very often. 5 being either - Completely, Very good, Very satisfied, An extreme amount, Extremely, or Always.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. The PSS was designed for use in community samples with at least a junior high school education. The questions are of a general nature and hence are relatively free of content specific to any subpopulation group. The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, respondents are asked how often they felt a certain way. PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all scale items. A short 4 item scale can be made from questions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale.</description>
