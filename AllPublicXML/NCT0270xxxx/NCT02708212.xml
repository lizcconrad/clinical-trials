  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Same-day bidirectional endoscopy (BDE) is commonly used in clinical practice. However,
      the optimal sequence of performing a same-day BDE has not been well-established.The primary
      aims of this study are to compare the sedative doses and patient discomfort between the study
      groups who received a colonoscopy followed by and EGD (colonoscopy-EGD), or an EGD followed
      by a colonoscopy (EGD-colonoscopy) during a same-day BDE. The secondary aim is to assess
      colonoscopy performance, including the cecal intubation time and adenoma detection rate
      between the two endoscopic sequences.

    <description>In this group, patients receiving an EGD followed by a colonoscopy during a same-day bidirectional endoscopy. Patients receive moderate conscious sedation with fentanyl and midazolam for the procedures. Gastric polypectomy will be provided when gastric polyps are found during an EGD study. Colon polypectomy will be provided when colon polyps are found during a colonoscopy study. Patients' heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation will be recorded every 60 seconds during the endoscopic examinations. Patients' tolerability to EGD and colonoscopy examinations will be scaled by patients and endoscopists after the completion of the examinations. Aldrete scores are recorded15 minutes and 25 minutes after entering the recovery room. The recovery time will also be recorded.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Total 129 patients were invited to participate in the study from April to July 2016, and 8 patients were excluded. Finally, 121 patients were recruited for the study which was performed in a community hospital (Evergreen General Hospital). One patient in the EGD-colonoscopy was further excluded from final analysis due to poor bowel preparation.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eight patients were excluded from assignment due to refusal to provide informed consent (n=3), American Society of Anesthesiology class 3 (n=3), duodenal peptic stricture (n =1), and partial colectomy (n=1).</pre_assignment_details>

Patients received modeate conscious sedation with fentanyl and midazolam and carbon dioxide insullfation.

Patients' heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded every 60 seconds during endoscopic examinations. Patients' tolerability to both endoscopy examinations was scaled by patients and endoscopists after examinations. Aldrete scores, at 15 minutes and 25 minutes after entering the recovery room, was recorded. Recovery time to discharge was also recorded.</description>

      <desc>The adverse events during moderate sedation were usually transient and related to overall sedative doses. The primary aim of the study was to compared the overall sedative doses between the patients receiving EGD-colonoscopy and colonoscopy-EGD sequences. Theoretically, patients who received less sedative doses should experience less episodes of adverse events. Therefore, we calculated the overall sedative doses and adverse events after the completion of both EGD and colonoscopy examinations.</desc>
