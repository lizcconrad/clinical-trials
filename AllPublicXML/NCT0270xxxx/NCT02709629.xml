  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study examines the efficiency of a home-based computerized cognitive training
      (CT) intervention targeting older adults with diabetes.The primary aim of the study is to
      evaluate the effects of CCT on cognitive and disease management in non-demented older
      diabetes adults. Investigators will also evaluate the effect of the intervention on a range
      of secondary outcomes, including mood, caregiver burden, self-efficacy, and for a small
      sub-sample, on brain activity as reflected in changes in task-related blood-flow on fMRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests a link between diabetes-related processes and increased risk of cognitive
      decline and dementia in older adults. Optimal disease self-management may be key in the
      prevention of cognitive decline among older diabetic patients, but this may be compromised
      due to sub-clinical cognitive impairment.

      In the current study, 120 community-dwelling, non-demented participants aged 65 and over,
      with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes will be randomly assigned either to an 8-week, home-based
      individually-tailored CCT program with adaptive difficulty level, and regular performance
      feedback, or to an 8-week, home-based active control (AC) condition, involving training on a
      generic CCT program with fixed difficulty level and without performance feedback. Both
      intervention groups also include a range of theory-informed behavior change techniques
      (BCTs), including self-efficacy management, self-monitoring and goal-setting in order to
      enhance treatment fidelity, and to maximize treatment compliance and adherence. In both
      groups, participants train approx. 30 min. per day, 3 times per-week for 8-weeks.
      Participants undergo a comprehensive evaluation of all outcomes at baseline, immediately
      after the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up, with 1-week booster training completed 3
      months from completion of the intervention.

    <description>Training in this group is individualized using a computer algorithm which assigns tasks (from a pool of 33 training tasks) on the basis of cognitive strengths and weaknesses as determined by the training program. In addition, task difficulty is adaptive and responsive to performance level. Participants are able to see feedback on their progress each training session in the form of a session-score. A range of behavior change techniques are used throughout the training period (delivered via scheduled monitoring phone calls, and email contact with participants) to support the compliance and adherence of participants. These include a range of motivation and confidence building strategies, based on a theoretical framework. Participants are required to train for approx. 30 min., 3 times per week, for 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>Training in this group is generic, and tasks (from the same pool of 33 training tasks) are randomly selected by the training program. In addition, task difficulty is fixed, such that irrespective of performance, each time a participant is presented with a given task, the level of difficulty returns to the basic level. Participants in this arm do not receive feedback on their progress at the end of each training session. The same protocol of behavior change techniques is used in this intervention arm.
Participants are also required to train for approx. 30 min., 3 times per week, for 8 weeks.</description>
