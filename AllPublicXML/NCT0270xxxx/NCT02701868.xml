  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although breast milk is recommended exclusively until 6 months of age, two-thirds of infants
      in the U.S. are fed infant formula. Despite an almost identical energy density between infant
      formula and breast milk, formula fed infants experience greater weight gain in the first year
      of life. The investigators propose that unintentional overfeeding, of nearly one additional
      day of calories per week, due to the &quot;over-scooping&quot; of powdered formula contributes
      significantly to this phenomenon and potentially to the early development of childhood
      obesity, a significant public health problem.

      In the proposed study the investigators will assess the literacy and understanding of
      individuals to follow commercially available infant formula instructions. The investigators
      will collaborate with the LA CaTS Health Literacy Core to improve the reading and
      comprehension of the manufacturer package instruction, and will solicit the input of
      caregivers and key stakeholders to inform the development of educational intervention around
      infant feeding. Following modification of infant formula preparation instructions, the
      investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of the
      modified instructions on infant overfeeding in comparison with the manufacturer package
      instructions. One hundred and fifty participants will be asked to complete one study visit
      during which they will be asked to measure various serving sizes of infant formula following
      either the manufacturer package instructions or the modified instructions.

        Up to 40 individuals will be recruited to participate in focus groups at Pennington
        Biomedical Research Center. Phase 1 will utilize qualitative data gathered from focus
        groups to direct the modification of infant formula manufacturer preparation instructions
        to enhance user understanding and accuracy. The modified instructions will be used in Phase
        2.

        Up to 150 individuals will be enrolled in Phase 2 to test the efficacy of the revised
        instructions on infant overfeeding in comparison with the instructions currently provided
        on the packaging.
