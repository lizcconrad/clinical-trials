  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of trametinib once daily on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a daily dosing oral contraceptives (OCs) containing norethindrone
      (NE) and ethinyl estradiol (EE) in female patients with solid tumors. The PK of trametinib
      and its metabolite M5 will also be assessed.

             &lt;35%). Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 3.0 x ULN, except for patients with liver
             metastasis, who may only be included if AST ≤5.0 x ULN. Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤
