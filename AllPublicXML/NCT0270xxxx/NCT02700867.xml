  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators sought to compare the intraosseous access success rates of the proximal
      tibia and the proximal humerus using new Intraosseous access device &quot;NIO&quot; in an adult cadaver
      model during simulated resuscitation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Success rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Success rate of IO cannulation was defined as successful administration of infusion solutions via the performed IO access. Failure was defined as extravasation or unsuccessful (first) effort of IO insertion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of IO insertion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Procedure time was defined as the duration of picking up the prepared set of IO device from the shelf, preparation of the access set and patients' insertion site including disinfection and draping, insertion procedure of the cannula itself, assembling of the access set and first successful administration of drugs or infusion solutions through the newly established vascular access. The time taken for each infusion attempt was measured offline while reviewing procedures by videotape, and subsequently entered into a computer spreadsheet. Times were measured in seconds.</description>
