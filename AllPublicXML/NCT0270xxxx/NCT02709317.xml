  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans who are taking prescription opioids for chronic pain and are engaging in risky
      drinking are at heightened risk for drug interactions, including overdose and other negative
      effects, particularly if they are also using benzodiazepines. In this application, the
      investigators propose to test an integrated prevention intervention, designed to reduce rates
      of risky drinking in veterans receiving prescription opioids to treat their chronic pain.
      This adaptive, patient-centered intervention provides integrated clinical assessment, brief
      intervention, monitoring, and extended prevention services delivered through a combination of
      clinical visits, telephone calls, and text messages. The investigators propose to conduct a
      study in which veterans (N=300) who are on daily doses of prescription opioids and screen
      positive for risky alcohol use will be randomized to receive 12 months of an adaptive
      integrated prevention intervention (IPI) or to standard care (SC), which consists of a Brief
      Intervention (BI) with 2 follow-up contacts. Potential participants will be veterans at the
      Philadelphia VA, and surrounding areas, or the Pittsburgh VA who, based on pharmacy records,
      are using opioids daily to treat chronic pain. An initial evaluation will identify
      individuals who also engage in risky alcohol use based on NIAAA-recommended guidelines and
      meet other inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study. The evaluation will also identify
      the use of other medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) that could interact negatively with
      opioid use. For veterans randomized to the IPI condition, a BI is first provided to reduce
      alcohol to non-hazardous levels and the effects are monitored for one month. Veterans who
      reduce alcohol use to non-hazardous levels during this one-month period continue in a
      monitoring track, consisting of tailored text messages and brief monthly telephone contacts.
      Veterans who continue to drink at risky levels are instead placed in a track that provides
      tailored text messages and more frequent telephone calls. In addition to monitoring, these
      calls provide further prevention/BI services to help the veteran reduce alcohol use to
      non-hazardous levels. Key components of these services are motivational enhancement and
      development of more effective ways to cope with stress and other triggers for risky alcohol
      use. All participants will be followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after baseline. The
      primary outcome at each follow-up point will be a dichotomous measure of any risky drinking
      since the prior follow-up (yes/no). Secondary outcomes will include self-reported frequency
      of heavy drinking, biological measures of alcohol use, other drug use as determined by urine
      toxicology tests, opioid overdoses, and ratings of depression and pain. Repeated measures
      analyses will compare the IPI and SC conditions on primary and secondary outcomes assessed
      across an 18-month follow-up. Analyses will also test hypothesized moderation and mediation
      effects.

    <description>An adaptive monitoring intervention, delivered through text messages and brief telephone calls, that can provide extended prevention services for veterans engaging in risky alcohol use. After a veteran receives a BI for risky drinking, we will monitor alcohol use for 4 weeks. Veterans who reduce alcohol use to safe levels will be placed in a monitoring track, which consists of tailored text messages and brief monthly telephone contacts. Conversely, veterans who continue to use alcohol at hazardous levels will be placed in a track that provides tailored text messages and more frequent telephone calls. These calls provide further prevention/intervention services to help the veteran reduce alcohol use. These services address motivational issues and identify more effective ways to cope with stress and other factors that trigger unsafe alcohol use. Information on the veteran's progress is used to guide the content of subsequent text messages and prevention interventions.</description>
