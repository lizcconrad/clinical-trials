    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in participants with type1 diabetes on insulin injection therapy
      to investigate how the body processes LY900014 and the effect of LY900014 on blood sugar
      levels. Side effects and tolerability will be documented. The study will be conducted in two
      parts (Part A and Part B) to achieve its objectives. Participants are expected to enroll in
      both parts.
