  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the effect of a structured resistance training program
      on glycemic control, measured by hemoglobin A1c (glycated hemoglobin), in patients with type
      2 diabetes (T2DM) who are enrolled in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The investigator
      will compare the experimental group receiving resistance training to a control group made of
      patients enrolled in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and perform 3 aerobic exercise
      modalities during their sessions, which is the current standard of care.
