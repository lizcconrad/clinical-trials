    <textblock>
      This phase IIa trial studies how well pan fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase
      inhibitor BGJ398 works in treating patients with FGFR1-3 translocated, mutated, or amplified
      head and neck cancer that has returned after a period of improvement. Pan FGFR kinase
      inhibitor BGJ398 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess efficacy of pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 (BGJ398) in FGFR altered human
      papillomavirus (HPV) negative (-) and HPV positive (+) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess efficacy of BGJ398 in relation to specific genetic aberrations in HPV (+) and HPV
      (-) FGFR altered HNSCC (i.e. FGFR3-transforming, acidic, coiled-coil-containing protein 3
      [TACC3] translocation, FGFR1 high copy number/amplification, FGFR2 mutation, FGFR3 mutation).

      II. Assess safety and tolerability of BGJ398 in patients with head and neck cancer.

      III. Assess progression free and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine mechanisms of resistance to FGFR inhibition at disease progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pan FGFR kinase inhibitor BGJ398 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 1-3 months for 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck
             including nasopharyngeal carcinomas (lymphepithelioma histology is ok if criteria 2 is
             met)

               -  Patients must have progressed on prior platinum based therapy (or have become
                  intolerant) prior to enrollment on this study

          -  FGFR genetic alterations (specifically FGFR1-3 mutation, amplification, or
             translocation) via deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) based assay;
             prescreening has to be completed prior to enrollment on this study; commercial or
             local testing is typically expected, but samples can also be sent to the University
             (Univ.) of Chicago for testing

               -  The following genetic aberrations will be screened for:

                    -  FGFR1 amplification, FGFR1 somatic mutations, FGFR1 translocations

                    -  FGFR2 somatic mutations, FGFR2 translocations, FGFR2 amplification

                    -  FGFR3 somatic mutations, FGFR3 translocations, FGFR3 amplification

               -  Other genetic FGF/FGFR pathway aberrations may be acceptable should such genetic
                  changes be observed to emerge and require approval per the lead investigator for
                  enrollment (e.g. fibroblast growth factor (FGF) amplification); should one
                  genetic aberration be overrepresented in one or both of the arms the lead
                  investigator (Dr. Seiwert) may decide to restrict enrollment of such patients; a
                  notification/memo will be sent out to all investigators should such a restriction
                  on enrollment be implemented (see inclusion criteria); for example, if more than
                  5 pts with FGFR1 amplification are enrolled further enrollment of FGFR1 amplified
                  patiens will be put on hold, or if FGFR translocations are under-represented
                  enrollment may be focused on this aberration

          -  HPV status in oropharyngeal carcinomas; while HPV status (e.g. via p16) does not have
             to be known prior to consenting, the HPV status (e.g. using p16 immunohistochemistry
             [IHC]) needs to be established prior to start of therapy

          -  Presence of measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) 1.1

             anti-convulsant therapy; patients with leptomeningeal involvement are excluded

          -  Patients who received a prior selective FGFR inhibitor in the recurrent/metastatic
             disease setting; prior use of a multikinase inhibitor that includes anti-FGFR activity

             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of

                       methods are not allowed as the sole method of contraception because BGJ398
                       has not been characterized with respect to the potential to interfere with

                       are allowed to participate in this study; women are considered
                       post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
                       months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
                       profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had

                       ligation at least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only
                       when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
                       hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 3 months after the last dose of the study drug and should not father a child
             in this period; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to
             prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid
