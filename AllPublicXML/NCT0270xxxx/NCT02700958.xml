  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has remained significant and severe complication of
      angiographic procedures despite the increasing use of preventative methods. It has been
      associated with prolonged hospital stay, high morality and the need for dialysis. Since
      classically used creatinine for diagnosing of CIN does not reflect the degree of tubular
      injury before 24-48 hours after exposure to contrast media alternative earlier biomarkers and
      preventative methods are needed. Remote ischemic preconditioning is a non-invasive and safe
      method which in some studies has been reported to protect against contrast-induced
      nephropathy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of remote ischemic
      preconditioning (RIPC) (1) as an additional method to standard treatment to prevent
      subclinical and clinical contrast-induced acute kidney injury and (2) to assess its effect on
      functional properties of arterial wall, organ damage biomarkers and low molecular weight
      metabolites.
