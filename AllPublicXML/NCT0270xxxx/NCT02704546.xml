  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the possible effects of MPH use on physiological
      functions among ADHD\ADD patients, by performing a set of physical trials to assess aerobic
      and anaerobic capacity, to characterize the tendency for muscle break down while performing
      monitored moderate physical effort and to assess the physiological strain while performing
      moderate exercise in heat load conditions by using the heat tolerance test.

      20 male, non-combat soldiers with a pre-existing childhood diagnosis of ADHD\ADD, who are
      chronically treated with MPH will participate in the study. If necessary, civilian volunteers
      with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD\ADD may also be recruited to complete the study population
      (up to 50%, i.e. 10 participants).

        1. st encounter: the subjects will receive an explanation of the study and sign an informed
           consent form, complete a medical questionnaire and undergo physical examination by a
           physician, including ECG.

        2. nd-9th encounter: the subjects will be requested to undergo 10 tests on 8 examination
           days, which will include the: maximal oxygen consumption test, wingate test, heat
           tolerance test and step test. Each subject will perform each test twice: once while
           taking MPH and once with placebo.

    <measure>physiological strain (composite)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 experimental days for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>the physiological strain will be determined by monitoring body core temperature and heart rate of the subjects during a Heat Tolerant Test (HTT). the test is performed in a climatic chamber. during the test the subjects walks on a treadmill (5 km/h and 2% incline) for 2h.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>aerobic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 experimental days for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>the aerobic capacity of the subjects will be determined by performing a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2max). VO2 will be monitored continuously with a metabolic system (ERGOTEST 680, ZAN, GERMANY ).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rectal temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>2 experimental days for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>rectal temperature will be recorded at a depth of 10 mm past the anal sphincter using YSI-401 thermal thermistor during each heat tolerance test (HTT).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>skin temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>2 experimental days for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>The skin temperature will be monitored by skin thermistors located at 3 sites (chest, arm and leg).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>8 experimental days for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>The heart rate will be monitored using a wearable heart rate monitor (Polar® sensor and heart rate monitor watch).</description>

    <measure>lactic acid</measure>
    <time_frame>8 experimental days for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>lactic acid level is assessed from blood drop (finger sting), will be taken before and after every test. lactic acid is a marker for anaerobic effort evaluating.</description>
