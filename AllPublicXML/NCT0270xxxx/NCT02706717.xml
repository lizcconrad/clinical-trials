  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the probiotic Visbiome Extra Strength reduces
      inflammation in HIV-infected men and women when compared to a placebo (inactive medication
      like a dummy pill). The study will evaluate whether taking Visbiome Extra Strength by mouth
      for 24 weeks is safe and well-tolerated for HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy
      (ART). Probiotics are germs such as yeast or bacteria that are found in food and supplements
      that are used to improve the health of the digestive system. Many people refer to probiotics
      as &quot;helpful bacteria.&quot; These bacteria live in the body and help the body work normally. In
      some medical conditions, including HIV infection, helpful bacteria are replaced with bacteria
      that can change the normal intestinal function and increase inflammation. The investigaors
      will test whether giving a probiotic can restore normal intestinal function and decrease
      inflammation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit.

        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg, indirect versus
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Currently on continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) for ≥48 weeks prior to study
             entry with no change in the ART regimen within the 24 weeks prior to study entry
             except as noted below.

        NOTE A: Continuous ART is defined as continuous ART for the 48-week period prior to study
        entry with no ART interruption longer than 7 consecutive days.

        NOTE B: Modifications of ART during the 24 weeks prior to study entry are permitted in
        certain circumstances. For example, the change in formulation (eg, from standard
        formulation to fixed-dose combination including ART modifications switching from ritonavir-
        to cobicistat-boosted protease inhibitors or from tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to
        tenofovir alafenamide) is allowed within 24 weeks prior to study entry. A within-class,
        single-drug substitution (eg, switch from nevirapine to efavirenz or from atazanavir to
        darunavir) is allowed within 24 weeks prior to study entry, with the exception of a switch
        between any other NRTI to/from abacavir. No other changes in ART within the 24 weeks prior
        to study entry are permitted.

          -  No plan to change ART regimen for the study duration.

          -  Screening CD4+ cell count &gt;200 cells/mm3 obtained within 45 days prior to study entry
             by any US laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

          -  Screening HIV-1 RNA levels &lt;50 copies/mL using a FDA-approved assay performed by any
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent within 45 days prior to
             study entry.

          -  HIV-1 RNA levels below the limit of quantification using a FDA-approved assay with a
             quantification limit of 50 copies/mL or lower for at least 48 weeks prior to study
             entry performed by any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent.

        NOTE: Single determinations that are between the assay quantification limit and 500
        copies/mL (ie, &quot;blips&quot;) are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent determinations
        are below the level of quantification. The screening value may serve as the subsequent
        undetectable value following a blip.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 45 days prior to entry by any US
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dL for men and 9.0 g/dL for women

               -  Platelet count ≥50,000/mm3

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2.5 x ULN (if on atazanavir ≤5 x ULN)

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;60 mL/min, as estimated by the
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation.

          -  For females of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test within
             45 days prior to entry by any US clinic or laboratory that has a CLIA certification or
             its equivalent, or is using a point-of-care (POC)/ CLIA-waived test, or at any
             network-approved non-US laboratory or clinic that operates in accordance with Good
             Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) and participates in appropriate external quality
             assurance programs.

          -  If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study
             participant must be willing to use a contraceptive while receiving protocol-specified
             medication. At least one of the following methods MUST be used:

               -  Condoms (male or female), with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Hormone-based contraceptive

          -  Ability and willingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to provide
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Initiation of ART during acute HIV infection.

        NOTE: Participants who initiate ART within 6 months of HIV seroconversion are considered to
        have been initiated during acute infection and are excluded.

          -  Receipt of antibiotic therapy within 60 days prior to study entry.

        NOTE: Antibiotics for OI prophylaxis are exclusionary.

             will take the shape of a container. If the duration of loose stools meeting this
             criterion definition is greater than 30 days, this is chronic diarrhea and is not
             exclusionary.

          2. Acute diarrhea is defined as 3-14 day duration.

          3. Persistent diarrhea is defined as 15-30 day duration.
