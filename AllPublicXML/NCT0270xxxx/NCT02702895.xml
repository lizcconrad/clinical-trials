      MTN-032 is an exploratory sub-study of the ASPIRE and HOPE trials that will utilize
      qualitative In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) and Focus-Group Discussions (FGDs) to explore
      socio-contextual and trial specific issues which affected participants' adherence to the
      dapivirine vaginal ring (VR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MTN-032 trial is a two-phase exploratory sub-study of the ASPIRE and HOPE trials. A
      sample of up to 224 women who participated in ASPIRE will be selected for participation in
      Phase 1 of this study. Approximately 84 former Phase 1 participants who participated in HOPE
      will be selected for participation in Phase 2. There will be approximately 4-6 months
      allotted for recruitment and follow-up at each site for each phase.

      MTN-032, an observational study, using interviews and focus group discussions, is primarily
      designed to identify factors that may have affected participant adherence to study product in
      ASPIRE and HOPE. MTN-032 will also elicit perceptions about various participant engagement
      and adherence promotion interventions implemented in ASPIRE and may also explore the
      potential use of incentives to promote adherence to VR use.

      MTN-032 will use study product adherence results from ASPIRE and HOPE, qualitative in-depth
      interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) to explore study product adherence
      behaviors and strategies used to overcome adherence challenges. An in-depth understanding of
      the various socio-behavioral factors that contribute to product use adherence may assist in
      the interpretation of past and ongoing study results and inform implementation of future
      studies.

        A sample size of up to 224 former ASPIRE participants will be selected to take part in
        Phase 1 of the study, and approximately 84 Phase 1 participants who then enroll in HOPE
        will be selected to take part in Phase 2. Participants will all be adult women from seven
        sites in three African countries: South Africa, Uganda and Malawi. It is anticipated that
        participants will be representative of the overall ASPIRE and HOPE trials by enrolling
        participants from each of the participating ASPIRE and HOPE countries.
