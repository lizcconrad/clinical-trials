  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study looking to evaluate the safety of dose escalated stereotactic
      radiotherapy (SRS) without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in patients with high-risk
      human papilloma virus (HPV)- unassociated oropharyngeal squamous cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is frequently found within tumor cells removed from patients
      diagnosed with oropharynx cancer. Tumors which do not contain HPV virus (termed
      &quot;HPV-Negative&quot;) are not cured as frequently by radiation therapy. Tumors which do contain HPV
      in patients who have a history of cigarette smoking also are not cured as frequently by
      radiation.

      One way to potentially overcome this challenge is to deliver a more intense dose of radiation
      treatment to the tumor. The standard way to deliver radiation, termed Intensity Modulated
      Radiotherapy (IMRT), can protect normal tissues near tumors to a certain degree but not
      completely. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a technique which can deliver radiation more
      precisely.

      This trial will test the safety of treating HPV-unassociated oropharynx tumors to higher
      radiation doses wth SRS (termed a &quot;boost&quot;) after a standard course of IMRT has been given. In
      addition, the investigators will look at whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning
      can detect treatment response in oropharynx tumors earlier than with standard tests.

    <description>Patients will receive 6 weeks of IMRT (standard of care) followed by the stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS Boost). Dose of the boost is reliant on which cohort the patient is assigned to. Cohort 1 will receive 8 Gy, Cohort 2 will receive 10 Gy in a single fraction, Cohort 3 will receive 10 Gy split into two fractions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients older than 18 years of age with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma
             of the oropharynx

          -  HPV-negative disease status by routine p16 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining or in
             situ hybridization (ISH) of biopsied tumor tissue or &gt;10 pack-year cigarette smoking
             history

          -  Stage T1-4, N0-3 disease, as defined by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
             criteria

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (Zubrod) Performance Status 0-2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have undergone resection of primary disease

          -  Patients who have received induction chemotherapy for their oropharynx cancer
             diagnosis

          -  Prior cancer diagnosis within 5 years, except appropriately treated localized
             epithelial skin cancer or cervical cancer

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the head and neck region

          -  Women of childbearing potential (a woman of child-bearing potential is a sexually
             mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., who has had menses at any
             time in the preceding 24 months]) and male participants must practice effective
             contraception (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal
             ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized
             partner) throughout the study

          -  Patient unable to tolerate MRI or having an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)
             &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2.

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

          -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within the
             last 6 months

          -  Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months

          -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of
             registration

          -  Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects; note,
             however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation parameters are not
             required for entry into this protocol

          -  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current Centers for Disease
             Control (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry
             into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is
             necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly
             immunosuppressive. Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised
             patients

          -  History or treatment with potent immunosuppressive drugs for such conditions as organ
             transplant, severe rheumatoid arthritis, etc. within the past 6 months.
