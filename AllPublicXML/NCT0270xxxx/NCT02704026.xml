  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and growth retardation are common in children with inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), especially in Crohn's Disease (CD). Malnutrition is associated with disease type,
      anatomical location, severity of disease and age of patient. Recently, it is reported that
      almost all children with CD and half with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have reduced lean mass,
      however, body fat alteration are not well defined.

      The aim of this prospective and observational study was to evaluate nutritional and growth
      status and body composition of children with IBD using anthropometric measurement and
      bioelectrical impedance during 1 year follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients 6 to 18 years of age at the time of enrolment who have IBD at any stage of disease
      activity, on any or no treatment and age- and sex-matched healthy controls will be included.
      All participants will be followed for 1 year.

      Written informed consent will be obtained from the parents or guardians of the participants
      at the time of enrolment. Prospective and retrospective data will be collected. Complete
      family and medical history, physical examination and laboratory findings will be recorded on
      standard case report form. Disease activity will be scored using the Paediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index for children with CD and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity
      index for those with UC. Endoscopic data will be reviewed and disease location will be
      classified according to Paris classification. Puberty will be assessed based on the
      development of secondary sexual characteristics. At the time of enrollment and after 1 year,
      anthropometric measurements including height, weight, triceps skin fold thickness, middle arm
      circumference and assessment of body composition by bioelectrical impedance will be performed
      for each child. Anthropometric data will be standardized by generation of z-scores for height
      and weight based on age and gender. Growth deficiency for height and weight measurements will
      be defined as a z-score\-2.
