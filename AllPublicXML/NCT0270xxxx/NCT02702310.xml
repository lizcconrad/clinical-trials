    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies low- dose total skin electron therapy in treating patients with
      stage IB-IIIA mycosis fungoides that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory) or
      has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed). Radiation therapy uses high energy
      electrons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Rotisserie technique is a method in which
      the patient receives total skin electron therapy while standing on a rotating platform.
      Giving low dose total skin electron therapy using rotisserie technique may kill tumor cells,
      while having fewer side effects, and may allow therapy to be repeated in future if clinically
      indicated.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the skin-related quality of life using an established method (Skindex-29), with
      comparisons made between pre-treatment and each of follow-up post-treatment skin assessments.

      II. To assess the durability of response using an established method (modified
      Severity-Weight Assessment [mSWAT] tool), with comparisons made between pre-treatment and
      each of follow-up post-treatment skin assessments.

      III. To determine side effect profile for low dose total skin electron therapy (TSE) for
      mycosis fungoides administered via rotisserie technique.

      OUTLINE:

      The investigational portion of this research study involves collecting quality of life (QOL)
      questionnaire data and objective measurements of patients' skin responses, which are obtained
      by the radiation oncologist during the patient's standard of care radiation treatment
      planning. Patients will also undergo standard of care low-dose total skin electron therapy
      for under 1 hour daily on days 10-21.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 and 12 weeks, and then
      every 3 months thereafter.

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Skindex-29 is a validated quality of life questionnaire to help quantify how mycosis fungoides may affect one's quality of life on a day to day basis, including emotional impact of the skin disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the durability of response assessed by mSWAT tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>mSWAT is the Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool used by the radiation oncologist during complete physical examination to quantify skin findings of patches, plaques, and tumors in all regions of the body; this would help the radiation oncologist and dermatologist to better follow the response to treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be closely monitored by the radiation oncologist during treatment, with at least 2-3 visits while patient is on treatment. Side effects will be documents in patient medical records.</description>

    <description>At initial visit (day 1) - for determination of a baseline quality of life, patients will be given a self-reported questionnaire called the Skindex-29. Following standard of care radiation treatments, at weeks 6 &amp; 12, and every 3 months thereafter, patients will complete the Skindex-29 questionnaire.</description>

    <description>At initial visit (day 1) , using mSWAT the radiation oncologist can follow the patient's treatment response by accurately grading the severity of the patient's skin findings. Following standard of care radiation treatments, at weeks 6 &amp; 12, and every 3 months thereafter, mSWAT will again be determined by physician. Follow-up visits will continue until patient has a change in disease.</description>

        The high volume of cutaneous lymphoma patients seen at Vanderbilt makes it likely to
        significantly contribute to the knowledge about this treatment technique. Given the rarity
        of this disease, with Vanderbilt being a major treatment center for mycosis fungoides, the
        goal is to systematically contribute to the data for low-dose total skin electron therapy
        in order to prospectively assess these endpoints. It is expected to find skin
        manifestations of mycosis fungoides that are refractory or have relapsed on at least one
        prior therapy. Patients with prior skin electron therapy, including either high or low-dose
        total skin electron therapy, are permitted on this protocol if the radiation oncologist
        determines that low-dose radiation therapy can safely carried out. The goal is to assess
        quality of life and accurately grade skin findings following this non-experimental,
        standard of care, total skin electron radiation treatment.
