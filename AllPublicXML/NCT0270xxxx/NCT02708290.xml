    <textblock>
      Visual puzzles have been used for centuries to facilitate early development in kids. Mental
      Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) is a unique, early-intervention application for children
      with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The app includes bright, interactive puzzles designed to
      help children learn how to mentally integrate multiple features of an object, an ability that
      has proven to lead to vast improvements in general learning. Success with MITA puzzles could
      overtime result in significant improvements in a child's overall development, specifically in
      the realms of language, attention and visual skills.

      SCIENCE BEHIND THE PROJECT:

      MITA is based on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), one of the best-supported therapies for
      children diagnosed with ASD. MITA aims to develop one of four pivotal skills targeted by PRT:
      a child's ability to notice and to respond to multiple visual cues presented simultaneously.
      This ability is typically impaired in individuals with autism, leading to what is commonly
      described as stimulus overselectivity, or &quot;tunnel vision.&quot; Improving the capacity to discern
      and respond to multiple cues has been shown to reduce stimulus overselectivity, which in turn
      leads to vast improvements in general learning.

      The visual exercises follow a systematic approach for developing a child's ability to notice
      multiple characteristics, or features of an object. MITA starts with simple exercises that
      teach a child to attend to only one feature, such as size (see screenshot 1) or color
      (screenshot 2). Over time, the exercises get more difficult and require the child to attend
      to two features simultaneously, such as both color and size (screenshot 3). In order to solve
      these puzzles, a child must learn how to hold two pieces of information in their mind (both
      the size and the color of an object) and make a decision based on the combination of these
      features. Once a child has practiced attending to two features, the program moves on to
      puzzles that require attending to three features, such as color, size and shape (screenshot
      4), and then eventually to puzzles that involve attending to an ever-increasing number of
      characteristics.

      As a child progresses through MITA's systematic exercises, he or she is developing the
      ability to simultaneously attend to a greater number of features, reducing the propensity
      towards tunnel vision, and thus developing an essential component of language. The ability to
      mentally build an image based on a combination of multiple features is absolutely necessary
      for understanding syntax, spatial prepositions and verb tenses.

      MITA is designed for early childhood and intended for long-term, daily use. It is designed to
      be engaging and educational, as well as adaptive and responsive to the individual abilities
      of each child.

    <description>All participants are encouraged to engage with MITA exercises on a daily basis. However this routine is not enforced. As a results, some participants engage with MITA more often than others. At the end of the study we plan to compare participants who engaged with the MITA software at least 3 days/week to those who engaged with MITA less than twice a week.</description>

    <description>There is a broad consensus that early intervention has the greatest chance of positive impact on an individual with ASD. All participants are encouraged to enter the study as early as possible. On the other hand, there are no contraindications to cognitive exercises. Many parents of teenagers with low functioning ASD expressed satisfaction with their kids engagement with MITA. One parent noted that his boy with low functioning autism &quot;turns into smart kid for an hour. He stops acting out and, the sporadic fires in his brain stop and he turns into cognitively thinking kid.&quot; At the end of the study we plan to compare participants who entered the study before the age of four to those who entered the study after they reached the age of 7.</description>

    <description>There is a broad consensus that prolonged intervention has the greatest chance of positive impact on an individual with ASD. MITA provides unlimited adaptive puzzles good for years of daily exercises. We encourage all participants to keep exercising with MITA. MITA is completely free and there is no reason to ever stop brain training.
At the end of the study we plan to compare participants who engaged with MITA exercises for over 2 years to those who quit the study in less than three months.</description>
