    <textblock>
      Early goal directed therapy (EGDT) is an effective treatment for patients with septic shock,
      which is widely used in clinic. Fluid resuscitation can significantly reduce the mortality of
      patients with septic shock and improve the prognosis of patients with EGDT. However, in
      recent years, the standard of EGDT to determine the existence of the target of septic shock.
      Some studies have shown that there may be a manifestation of the deficiency of kidney and
      liver and other organs such as kidney, liver and other organs in the recovery of EGDT.
      Therefore, this experiment is to explore the brain perfusion and metabolism of the EGDT when
      the target is reached.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of EGDT as a guide
      to the cerebral perfusion and metabolism in order to provide clinical evidence for the
      treatment of fluid resuscitation in patients with septic shock.

      1. patients enrollment this project: Met the inclusion criteria without exclusion criteria
           were entered test, and record the general information, including name, hospital number,
           gender, age, height, weight, admission, and in time, ICU admission and in ICU diagnosis,
           previous underlying diseases, into the group of APACHE II score and SOFA score

        2. implement septic shock bundle: measurement the value of lactic acid of patients after
           administrating of ICU, take blood culture before antibiotic using, give wide-spectrum
           antibiotic treatment and began liquid resuscitation

        3. preparation： A. basic state records B. using CAM-ICU delirium assessment for patients,
           and record the assessment results C. cerebral oxygen saturation monitor D. via the
           jugular vein placed central venous catheter and femoral artery placed PiCCO catheter

        4. monitoring of hemodynamics and cerebral perfusion and metabolic indicators

    <description>NSE is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ENO2 gene. NSE is produced by small cell carcinomas which are neuroendocrine in origin, and the raise of its concentration indicates the injury of brain.</description>
