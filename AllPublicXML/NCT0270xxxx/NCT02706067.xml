  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of a multifactorial approach associated with orlistat
      (Xenical) in weight loss maintenance during 4 years. The effect of orlistat in combination
      with diet, physical activity, and/or cognitive behavioral therapy will be monitored.

    <description>Participants will receive orlistat on an intermittent basis as 120 milligrams (mg) three times a day: once with breakfast, once with lunch, and once with dinner. In case of weight relapse (increase 2.5 percent [%] or more from Baseline) orlistat will be administered for up to 2 months or until weight regain reaches 0% from Baseline. For special occasions (feasts, birthdays, anniversaries) orlistat will be given for up to 3 days.</description>
