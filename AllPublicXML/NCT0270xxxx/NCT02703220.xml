  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB or sleep apnea) is very common among elderly Veterans and
      leads to increased morbidity and mortality in this population. The proposal aims to identity
      whether oxygen, finasteride and acetazolamide can be effective in reducing unstable breathing
      and eliminating sleep apnea in the elderly via different mechanisms. This proposal will
      enhance the investigators' understanding of the pathways that contribute to the development
      of sleep apnea in the elderly. The investigators expect that the results obtained from this
      study will positively impact the health of Veterans by identifying new treatment modalities
      for sleep apnea. A cumulative effect of the investigators' research will fulfill the
      long-term goal of improving the quality of life of elderly Veterans suffering from sleep
      apnea and its potential life-threatening complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) has a high prevalence and is associated with adverse
      cardiovascular consequences in elderly Veterans. Positive airway pressure therapy is deemed
      cumbersome and often associated with non-adherence to therapy. This proposal will investigate
      whether alternative therapies can be developed by modulating specific physiologic mechanisms
      of ventilatory control. Specifically, the investigators will study whether interventions with
      sustained hyperoxia (Aim 1), finasteride (Aim 2) and acetazolamide (Aim 3) will reduce
      breathing instability during sleep by reducing chemoresponsiveness and/or increasing
      cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in order to alleviate sleep disordered breathing in the
      elderly with sleep apnea. The proposed aims will also allow us to delineate key mechanisms of
      breathing instability in the elderly. The investigators envision that the results obtained
      from this project will ultimately allow us to develop novel alternative therapies for sleep
      apnea in the elderly. We will also compare CVR in young vs older adults
