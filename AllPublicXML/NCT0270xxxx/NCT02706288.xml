  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how weight loss by a very low fat plant-based diet
      with an exercise program affects metabolic and cardiovascular health in overweight adults at
      high risk for disease. Outcome measures will include assessment of insulin sensitivity,
      β-cell function, body fat distribution, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biology,
      cardiovascular function, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, immune function, and
      the gut microbiome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced energy intake and increased physical activity have profound effects on
      cardiometabolic health as assessed by insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, serum lipids,
      intra-abdominal fat mass, intrahepatic triglyceride content, and blood pressure, and is the
      cornerstone of treatment for people with obesity. However, the specific additional
      therapeutic effects of regular exercise in conjunction with diet-induced weight loss are not
      clear. In addition, the optimal dietary macronutrient composition needed to reduce
      cardiometabolic risk is not known. The use of a very low fat, plant-based (PB) diet is
      becoming increasingly popular to treat people with obesity and is the only diet therapy that
      is reimbursed by Medicare in the treatment of people with coronary heart disease.

      Participants will undergo nutritional counseling and have supervised exercise training 4 days
      per week until 7-10% weight loss is achieved. Meals will be provided and food diaries will be
      kept during weight loss. Tests before and after the intervention will include muscular
      strength and aerobic fitness, cardiovascular assessments, glucose tolerance tests,
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test for insulin sensitivity, heavy water metabolism,
      resting energy expenditure/metabolic rate, muscle and fat biopsies, body composition scans,
      blood tests, and urine and stool collection.

      The overarching goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive characterization of weight
      loss induced by using a PB diet with regular exercise in people with MAO, followed by a
      comparison of the effects of this study with those from another study that is evaluating the
      effect of the same amount of weight loss induced by using a PB diet alone, without exercise.
      Specifically, we will evaluate changes in body composition, body fat distribution,
      cardiopulmonary function, muscle strength, the plasma metabolome, insulin sensitivity,
      beta-cell function, systemic and adipose tissue inflammation and immune system function,
      adipose tissue and muscle cellular metabolic pathways, and the gut microbiome to determine
      cellular, multiorgan, and whole-body effects of PB diet alone and PB diet plus exercise.
      Accordingly, this study will fill two important gaps in our knowledge that have considerable
      physiological and clinical significance; the data from this study will provide: 1) a better
      understanding of the effects of a PB diet plus exercise on a series of key outcome measures,
      and 2) the potential additional benefit of adding regular exercise to a PB diet.

    <description>Persons with obesity with blood glucose concentrations higher than recommended and a moderate to high amount of fat in the liver (people with metabolically abnormal obesity) will be tested before and after 7-10% weight loss. Following baseline testing, participants will be placed on a caloric-restricted plant-based very-low-fat (PB) diet and an exercise program until 7-10% weight loss is achieved; they will then be re-tested so that pre- and post-intervention outcomes can be compared.</description>

    <intervention_name>Weight loss with very low fat plant-based diet and regular exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will lose 7-10% of their body weight while on a calorie-restricted very low fat plant-based (PB) diet and performing exercise 6 days/week (4 sessions/week under direct supervision). The macronutrient composition of the diet is approximately 70% of energy from carbohydrate, 15% from protein, and 15% from fat. Food will be provided in the form of take-out meals and will be picked up by participants during weekly study visits with a weight management dietitian. To promote adherence to the diet and exercise intervention, subjects will participate in a lifestyle intervention program that includes dietary and behavioral education topics. Treatment will be provided in weekly individual or group sessions depending on subject availability. (Note: this is the only intervention for the study; the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp is not an intervention but is the gold standard for evaluating insulin sensitivity, a primary study outcome.)</description>
