      Objective: To evaluate whether trimester specific d-dimer levels and brain natriuretic
      protein (BNP), along with the modified Wells score (MWS), is a useful risk stratification
      tool to exclude pregnant women at low-risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) from diagnostic imaging
      with radiation exposure.

      To account for all women meeting the study eligibility criteria, this study utilized a
      combined prospective and retrospective arm. Pregnant women who underwent diagnostic imaging
      to evaluate for suspected PE at our institution were prospectively enrolled from February
      2014 to August 2015. Both d-dimer and BNP serum levels were drawn, and a MWS was assigned.
      All pregnant women diagnosed with a PE that underwent diagnostic imaging and had a d-dimer
      level drawn from January 2009 to June 2014 were retrospectively enrolled. Patient electronic
      records were used to apply the MWS and analyze their risk.
