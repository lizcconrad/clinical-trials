    <time_frame>21-day cycle one of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Phase I part:
The primary variable is the incidence of DLTs during the first 21 days of therapy. Estimation of the MTD of the combination treatment will be based upon the estimation of the probability of DLT during the first 21 days of therapy for patients in the DDS.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until progression of disease up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Phase II part:
The primary variable used to evaluate the efficacy of the ribociclib and trametinib combination is the ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed CR or PR, as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until progression of disease up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Among patients with a confirmed response (PR or CR) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented response (PR or CR) to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause. The distribution function of DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median DOR along with 95% CI will be presented by treatment arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to response</measure>
    <time_frame>Until progression of disease up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Time to overall response of CR or PR (TTR) is defined as the time from start of study drug to first documented response (CR or PR, which must be confirmed subsequently) for patients with a confirmed CR or PR. TTR will be summarized by treatment arm, using descriptive statistics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease control rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Until progression of disease up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or SD per RECIST 1.1. DCR will be estimated and the binomial exact 95% CI will be provided by arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression disease rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Until progression of disease up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Progression disease rate defined as the proportion of patients with a progression disease as assessed per RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Until progression of disease up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>overall survival</measure>
