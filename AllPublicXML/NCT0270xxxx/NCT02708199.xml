      This study is longitudinal and observational cohort study to detect the drug resistance
      molecular markers in asymptomatic malaria infected local residents in study site. Only local
      residence who are not migrants, are recruited in the study and active and passive
      surveillance have been carried out within one year observation period. At the time of
      enrollment, blood film examination, rapid diagnosis test (RDT) testing have been done all
      together with the collection of the venous blood (about 1-2 mL) that would be used for
      molecular analysis later. All of the RDT or microscopy positive cases were treated according
      to the National Malaria Treatment Policy in Myanmar. A total of at least 1000 participants
      have been recruited in the study. Active case detection has been done in every three months.
      The venous blood were used for molecular based detection of the asymptomatic malaria
      infection by using High-throughout pooling strategy. All of the positive samples, (falciparum
      and vivax), have been checked for drug resistance molecular analaysis compared with the
      previously collected symptomatic malaria infection cases in the same region.

    <description>K13, Pffd, Pfmdr2 and Pfcrt markers for falciparum and Pvcrt-O, Pvdhps, Pvdhfr and Pvmdr1 for vivax asymptomatic infections.The target sequences will be analysed to detect the specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Molecular marker analysis will be done as soon as after asymptomatic infection have been confirmed. It will be finished in 2016 April. (up to 6 months after last sample collection)</description>
