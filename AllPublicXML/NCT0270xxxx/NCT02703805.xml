  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Building on an earlier pilot study, this randomized controlled trial will compare the
      effectiveness of a 12 week community YMCA-based wellness program specifically designed for
      people with stroke (Fit for Function) to a standard YMCA membership.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The program will be delivered through a partnership between McMaster University, the YMCA and
      Hamilton Health Sciences/ the Brant Community Healthcare System/ the Niagara Health System.
      Participants will exercise three times a week and receive weekly education about how to take
      care of themselves after a stroke. The YMCA staff who deliver the program will have
      specialized training about how to help people with a stroke exercise safely and effectively.
      The hospital within each region will provide specialized on-site physiotherapy consultative
      support. The comparator standard YMCA membership will include typical sessions with a
      wellness coach who has basic safety training regarding stroke and exercise.
