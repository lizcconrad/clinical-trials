  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is undertaken to explore in patients with uncontrolled T2D treated with insulin,
      whether a diet with large breakfast and lunch with small dinner (Bdiet) will enhance CG
      expression and will be more effective for weight loss and for achieving glycemic control and
      reduction of total daily insulin dose compared to an isocaloric diet with 6 small meals
      distributed evenly along the day

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance (IR), often require
      sequential increments of total daily insulin dose (TDID). This causes weight gain, worsens
      IR, leading to further increase of TDID and persistent hyperglycemia. In these patients,
      weight loss (WL) and reduction of IR are mandatory in order to achieve glucose control with
      less TDID. Impaired clock gene (CG) expression is linked to obesity and IR in T2D and it was
      shown in animals and T2D patients treated with oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs, that WL diet
      with restricted meal timing to specific hours, restored CG expression and was more effective
      for WL and for reduction of hyperglycemia compared to isocaloric WL diet, (commonly
      recommended for T2D), consisting of small meals randomly distributed along the day.

      The investigators hypothesized that in patients with uncontrolled T2D treated with insulin, a
      diet with large breakfast and lunch with small dinner (Bdiet) will enhance CG expression and
      will be more effective for WL and for achieving glycemic control and reduction of TDID,
      compared to an isocaloric diet with 6 small meals distributed evenly along the day (6Mdiet).

      This will be a randomized parallel, open label clinical study. Thirty overweight and obese
      insulin-treated T2D patients with HbA1c&gt;7.5% will be assigned to 12 weeks of 2 isocaloric
      diets: either Bdiet or 6Mdiet. HbA1c and CG mRNA expression in white blood cells and overall
      daily glycemia measured during 5 days, will be assessed before and at the end of the diet
      intervention. The TDID will be adjusted by physician, according to the results of
      self-monitoring of blood glucose on 3 consecutive days at baseline and before each of the
      visits.
