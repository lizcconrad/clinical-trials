    <textblock>
      The study has been designed as a 12-month, open-label, randomized, controlled study comparing
      the use of prednisone mono-therapy and prednisone and leflunomide combination therapy in
      treating patients with IgG4-related disease.

      The aim of this clinical trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of Leflunomide in
      treating patients with IgG4-related disease by comparing the outcomes of prednisone and
      leflunomide combination therapy with prednisone mono-therapy. The follow-up period will be 12
      months. During the follow-up period, results of laboratory tests and image examinations,
      IgG4-RD RI and other parameters which can reflect treatment response as well as adverse
      effect events will be recorded.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 18 and 80 years.

          2. Diagnosis of IgG4-RD according to either Consensus statement on the pathology of
             IgG4-related disease (for those who have undergone biopsies) or 2011 Comprehensive
             diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related disease. Both of the two criteria for diagnosis
             are specified below.

        (1)Consensus statement on the pathology of IgG4-related disease

          1. Histopathologic features consisting of dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate,
             fibrosis(usually storiform in character)and/or obliterative phlebitis within involved
             organs.

          2. Either an elevated IgG4+/IgG+cell ratio of ＞40% within the affected organs or elevated
             IgG4-bearing plasma cells per high-power field is necessary. The cut-off number of
             IgG4-bearing plasma cells per high-power field is different depending upon the types
             of affected organs and specimens(through surgery or needle puncture biopsy).

        (2)2011 Comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related disease

          1. Clinical examination showing characteristic diffuse/localized swelling or masses in
             single or multiple organs.

          2. Hematological examination shows elevated serum IgG4 concentrations(135 mg/dl).

          3. Histopathologic examination shows marked lymphocyte and plasmacyte infiltration and
             fibrosis or Infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells(ratio of IgG4+/IgG+ cells &gt; 40% and &gt;10
             IgG4+ plasma cells/HPF).

             Definite: a + b + c,Probable: a + c,Possible: a + b

          4. Excluded from malignant tumors of each organ (e.g. cancer, lymphoma) and similar
             diseases (e.g. Sjögren's syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Castleman's
             disease, secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis,
             Churg-Strauss syndrome) by additional histopathological examination.

          5. Even when patients cannot be diagnosed using the Comprehensive diagnostic criteria,
             they may be diagnosed using organ-specific diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD, such as
             Diagnostic criteria for IgG4-Mikulicz's disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects having received steroids or immunosuppressants in recent 3 months will be
             excluded.

          2. Subjects who were hypersensitive to leflunomide will be excluded.

          3. ALT and/or AST is more than two folds of the upper limit of relevant reference value
             at baseline.

          4. WBC is less than 3×10*9/L at baseline.

          5. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          6. Known significant concurrent medical disease.
