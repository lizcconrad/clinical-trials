    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of dietary fats, ingested in two physical
      forms, on acute energy balance, appetitive, and glycemic responses of healthy normal (BMI
      18-24.9 kgm-2) or overweight (BMI&gt;25kgm-2) adults.

      This will be a randomised, crossover study. Randomisation will be performed with an online
      randomisation software (www.randomizer.org). Participants will be screened (1 screening
      visit) and attend five test visits conducted in a whole room calorimeter (WRC). During each
      test visit, participants will arrive at the laboratory after an overnight fast, enter the WRC
      and rest for 15 minutes in a supine position,have their resting energy expenditure (REE)
      measured for 30 minutes and consume congee and juice alone(control), or with one of the 4
      dietary fats: sunflower oil (SO) or gel (SG) and coconut oil (CO) or gel (CG) (total 5 test
      visits). Post-meal energy expenditure, fat oxidation, glycemia and appetite (visual analog
      scales) will be measured continuously for 3 hours in WRC, followed by a meal challenge where
      participants will eat until sated. Participants will return and repeat the protocol until all
      fat types and forms are completed.

    <measure>180-min postprandial energy expenditure (kJ/min over 180 minutes and total kJ/180-min session) measured by an indirect ventilated-hood calorimeter</measure>
    <time_frame>180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Gaseous exchanges obtained from the indirect calorimeter (volume of oxygen consumed and volume of carbon dioxide produced) will be used to calculate energy expenditure using the Weir equation: EE = 3.9 VO2 + 1.1 VCO2 [Weir, J. B. (1949). &quot;New methods for calculating metabolic rate with special reference to protein metabolism.&quot; Journal of Physiology 109(1): 1-9]</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>180-min postprandial carbohydrate and fat oxidation (kJ/min over 180 minutes and total kJ and total grams during each session) measured by an indirect ventilated-hood calorimeter</measure>
    <time_frame>180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Gaseous exchanges obtained from the indirect calorimeter (volume of oxygen consumed and volume of carbon dioxide produced) will be used to calculate energy expenditure using the Frayn equations: carbohydrate oxidation = 4.55 VCO2 - 3.21 VO2; fat oxidation = 1.67 VO2 - 1.67 VCO2 [Frayn, K. N. (1983). &quot;Calculation of substrate oxidation rates in vivo from gaseous exchange.&quot; Journal of Applied Physiology 55(2): 628-634]</description>

    <measure>Post-test-meal capillary blood glucose (mmol/L) at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Capillary blood glucose will be assessed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes using a Hemocue system (HemoCue Glucose 201 RT Systems, Helsingborg, Sweden)</description>

    <measure>Post-test-meal subjective appetite measurements at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite ratings will be collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes after test meal consumption using a previously validated visual analog scales [Flint, A., A. Raben, J. E. Blundell and A. Astrup (2000). &quot;Reproducibility, power and validity of visual analogue scales in assessment of appetite sensations in single test meal studies.&quot; International Journal of Obesity 24(1): 38-48]</description>

    <measure>Free-living food intake after completion of test session</measure>
    <time_frame>180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to keep a food record that document the types and amount of food and beverage they consume after they leave the research centre, until they go to bed on the same day. Data will be analysed using nutrient analysis software.</description>
