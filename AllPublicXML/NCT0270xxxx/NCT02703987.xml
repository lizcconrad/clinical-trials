        Inclusion Criteria:

        BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2 inclusive Lactose intolerant

        The following criteria need to be checked at visit 2:

          -  Lactose intolerance confirmed by positive Hydrogen Breath Test (HBT) (i.e. if there
             are two or more samples with hydrogen level &gt; 20 ppm increase compared to baseline
             sample between 90 mins and 240 min sampling time point).

          -  At least one sample with hydrogen level &gt; 20 ppm increase compared to baseline between
             90 mins and 180 mins sampling time point.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        History of gastrointestinal disorders Current illness which could interfere with the study
        (e.g. diarrhea, regurgitation) Any history of cow's milk protein allergy or known allergy
        to galacto-oligosaccharides Any current participation or within 8 weeks of study start, in
        any other study involving investigational or marketed products, any medical procedures, or
        any surgical methods.

        Any antibiotic, laxative or colonic cleansing treatments within 4 weeks of study start Any
        administration of probiotic in the 1 week prior to study start Investigator's uncertainty
        about willingness or ability of subject to comply with protocol requirements

        The following criteria need to be checked at visit 2:

          -  Level of hydrogen &gt; 20 ppm in the baseline breath sample.

          -  An early peak of hydrogen (i.e. hydrogen level &gt; 20 ppm increase compared to baseline
             value) in the first 60 minutes after ingestion of the study products.
