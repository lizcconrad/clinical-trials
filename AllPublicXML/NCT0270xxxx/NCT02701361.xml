      Many survivors of the intensive care unit (ICU) suffer from persistent symptoms of
      depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study, the
      investigators will test the impact of mindfulness to address this distress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A majority of the &gt;1 million people who require life support in an intensive care unit (ICU)
      now survive. As survival has improved however, growing numbers suffer not only from
      subsequent physical disability, but also persistent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Few interventions address ICU survivors' psychological
      distress. Fewer still address the physical, geographical, and logistical barriers to
      receiving post-discharge support that medically ill populations encounter. Consequently, this
      population suffers with an unmet need of great public health importance.

      Mindfulness is an adaptable self-regulation practice that alleviates psychological distress
      symptoms using a variety of meditative techniques, typically taught face-to face over months.
      As an extension of standard mindfulness practices, the investigators developed a
      telephone-/web-delivered mobile mindfulness-based training (mMBT) system informed by ICU
      survivors' input that could address medically ill patients' delivery barriers. The
      investigators' recent pilot study demonstrated early support for mMBT's feasibility and
      acceptability, now with enhanced content and electronic patient-reported outcomes capability.

      The investigators' early work on mMBT, while promising, identified key knowledge gaps in
      population targeting, plausible ranges of psychological distress estimates relevant to study
      design, and assurance of acceptability that must be addressed before a definitive clinical
      trial is conducted. Therefore, the study team proposes a 2-year pilot study in which 90 ICU
      survivors are randomized to an education control, 'standard' telephone sessions of mMBT, or
      self-directed / app-based mMBT. A mixed methods approach will be used to determine treatment
      effect.

             document (or having it read to them) can (a) generally understand the terms of
             participation in the study: the purpose of the study, what will be required of study
             participants; the potential risks, benefits and alternatives of study participation;

          -  reliable computer online access plus telephone access

          -  unable to complete study procedures as determined by study staff

          -  discharge to a location other than a home setting

          -  complex medical care expected soon after discharge (e.g., multiple planned surgeries,
             transplantation evaluation (including outpatient daily cardiopulmonary
             rehabilitation), extensive travel needs for hemodialysis, disruptive chemotherapy or
             XRT regimen, etc)

        Other issues relevant to the consent process:

          -  unable to approach patient for logistical reasons (e.g., off ward in test at time of
             approach, etc)

          -  patient discharged before consent could be obtained

          -  patient dies before consent obtained

        Patient exclusion criteria present after consent but before randomization:

        After providing informed consent, patients will become ineligible if any of the following
        are present:

          -  they become too ill to participate (or die)

          -  they exhibit significant cognitive disability

          -  they exhibit suicidality

          -  patient was unexpectedly discharged to location other than a home setting and then did
             not arrive home within 1 month from hospital discharge
