    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of the CyPass Micro-Stent in
      subjects who completed Study Protocol TMI-09-01, COMPASS Trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COMPASS Trial was a prospective, randomized, comparative multicenter study to assess the
      safety and effectiveness of the CyPass Micro-Stent in subjects with primary open angle
      glaucoma who were undergoing cataract surgery. In the study, 505 subjects were randomized to
      either the CyPass group, who underwent cataract surgery and received the CyPass Micro-Stent,
      or the Control group, who underwent cataract surgery alone. All subjects randomized were to
      be followed for 2 years postoperatively. Four hundred eighty (480) subjects completed this
      study.

      The COMPASS-XT Trial is designed to collect safety data beyond 24 months postoperatively for
      subjects who completed the COMPASS Trial. In COMPASS-XT, clinical data will be collected at
      36 months, 48 months, and 60 months postoperatively for a total of 5 year follow-up across
      the 2 studies.
