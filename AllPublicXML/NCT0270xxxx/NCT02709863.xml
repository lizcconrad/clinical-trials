    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of sevoflurane, desflurane and total intravenous
      anaesthesia on pulmonary function tests in patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal
      transsphenoidal surgery of pituitary gland. Participants will be divided into three equal
      groups. The first group will receive sevoflurane, second grup will receive desflurane and
      third grup will receive total intravenous anaesthesia. Investigators are also going to
      evaluate blood gas analysis.

      Investigators are going to evaluate forced expiratory volume in 1st Second (FEV1), forced
      vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial
      pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), potential of hydrogen (pH), arterial oxygen
      saturation (SaO2), base excess (BE), bicarbonate (HCO3) and partial pressure of arterial
      oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio to compare the effects of drugs.
