  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research already found that patients with autistic spectrum disorders lack of Prevotella
      intestinal type, then schizophrenia patients may also show the specific intestinal type, so
      investigators want to detect the gut metagenome of schizophrenia patients by high-throughput
      DNA sequencing to find specific intestinal type, so as to achieve the purpose of
      schizophrenia diagnosis. According to the detection of inflammatory factors in the blood,
      nerve growth factor in the cerebrospinal fluid, to find the mechanism of the
      gut-microbes-brain axis.

      A prospective observational study will be conducted and cases will be recruited by
      multi-center cooperation. Investigators plan to collect 100 schizophrenic patients as case
      group, 100 healthy people as control group. Investigators use the single drug of risperidone
      in the treatment of schizophrenia patients and follow up the patients on day 1, the third
      week, the third month, the sixth month and the first year. There are two objectives:

        1. compare healthy population with schizophrenia patients in the difference of gut
           metagenome and inflammatory factors in the blood, stool samples aimed at detecting the
           difference of composition of intestinal microorganism;

        2. Observe the change of intestinal microorganism, inflammatory factors, γ－aminobutyric
           acid of schizophrenic patients who received risperidone treatment according to the
           blood, stool samples, cerebrospinal fluid during the follow-up period.
