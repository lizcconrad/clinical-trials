  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety before cesarean section is common and may be severe. Stress consequences
      are often deleterious for the mother and for the upcoming newborn. Means to reduce anxiety
      before cesarean section are limited. Anxiolytic drugs are avoided in the context of the birth
      of a newborn. Auricular acupuncture has been shown to relieve anxiety disorders. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the anxiolytic effect of auricular acupuncture administered before
      an elective cesarean section. Anxiety will be measured at T0: inclusion (approximately 1-2
      hours before cesarean section) and T1: departure to surgical unit (approximately 30 minutes
      to 1 hour after T0). Patches (needle or needle-free) will be set up at T0 just after the
      initial anxiety assessment (anxiety Visual Analog Scale aVAS).

    <description>Intervention Description :
The auricular acupuncture protocol is based on an anxiolytic triad of three points selected according to the World Health Organization classification. These points are detected and located precisely by a differential detector starting with the right ear, and in the absence of response, the points are searched on the left ear. The detected points are treated by application of adhesive tape with needles of diameter 0.2 mm and length 0.9 mm.
Data collected :
T0 : anxiety VAS, pain VAS, APAIS, ANI, arterial pressure and cardiac frequency
T1 : anxiety VAS, pain VAS, APAIS, ANI, arterial pressure, cardiac frequency and side effects
T2 : anxiety VAS, pain VAS, arterial pressure, cardiac frequency and side effects
T3 : anxiety VAS, pain VAS, arterial pressure, cardiac frequency and side effects</description>
