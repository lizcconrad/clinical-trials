  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of electroretinogram (ERG) using a novel
      handheld system, RETeval, and evaluate contrast sensitivity testing in detecting pre-clinical
      retinopathy on a tablet device.

      Investigators also seek to assess if a medication called Sinemet™ CR can improve the
      electrical functions of the eye in participants with diabetes mellitus. This study will
      include a total of 45 participants; 30 with diabetes mellitus and 15 age-matched non-diabetic
      controls. Participants with diabetes mellitus and electroretinogram (ERG) delays will be
      randomized to a low or high dose Sinemet CR group.

      controls. Participants with diabetes mellitus and electroretinogram (ERG) delays will be
      randomized to a low or high dose Sinemet™ CT group.

      Age-matched controls will not receive Sinemet Ct drug treatment.

      The study involves four visits over the course of 4 weeks, each visit consisting of 2-3
      hours. Visual testing will be performed at 1 day and 2 weeks following treatment. The drug
      treatment will be halted and testing repeated again after a 2 week wash-out period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Retinal Function assessed by Electroretinogram (ERG) Device</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The RETeval device consists of a hand-held wand with a pupil tracker. A skin electrode placed below the eye or DTL fiber records the response to flash stimuli. The pupil tracker provides feedback to the system so that the flash stimuli can compensate for the pupil size and produce the proper illumination to the retina. RETeval is intended to generate photopic signals and measure and display the electrical response signals generated by the retina and the visual nervous system using flash stimuli.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Contrast Sensitivity assessed by the Contrast Sensitivity Function v1.0 (CSF v1.0) Tablet Application</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will view the screen monocularly while wearing their normal correction. A drifting grating will be presented at 60 cm for 3, 6, 12 and 18 c/d. Following photopic testing (100 lux), the participant will be dark-adapted and a neutral density filter will be applied to the tablet screen to produce luminance of ~1 lux.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Contrast Sensitivity assessed by the Sine Wave Grafting Test (CSV-1000E)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The CSV-1000E is self-illuminated (85 cd/m2). A drifting grating will be presented at 60 cm for 3, 6, 12 and 18 c/d. The participant will view the chart from 2.5m. The intensity of the CSV-1000 will be reduced to 1 lux with neutral density filters for scotopic testing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Acuity assessed by the Standard Snellen Static Chart</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The common Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. The first line consists of one very large letter, which may be one of several letters, for example E, H, or N. Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters that decrease in size. Participants will cover one eye from 6 metres or 20 feet away, and read aloud the letters of each row, beginning at the top. The smallest row that can be read accurately indicates the visual acuity in that specific eye. The test will be repeated covering the opposite eye.</description>

    <intervention_name>RETeval Electroretinogram (ERG) Testing</intervention_name>
    <description>ERG testing consists of sitting in the dark for 15 minutes. During the procedure, participants will have a single-use adhesive sensor strip placed on the skin near the eye. A hand-held device, called the RETeval, will be placed in front of the eye and a series of flashes and flickering lights presented. The light intensity level is typically not uncomfortable. When right eye imaging is complete, the procedure will be repeated on the left eye. Both eyes will be evaluated in less than 5 minutes for most participants. Electroretinogram (ERG) testing will be completed at baseline, day 1, week 2, and week 4.</description>

    <description>Contrast sensitivity testing consists of looking at a series of moving lines on a tablet device. The lines will change from white to grey to black. Participants will be asked to determine when they can no longer distinguish between the lines. Contrast sensitivity testing will be completed at baseline, day 1, week 2, and week 4.</description>
