  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different models of a wearable bionic pancreas device (the
      iPhone-based bionic pancreas vs. the iLet bionic pancreas) in adult participant with type 1
      diabetes. Both bionic pancreas devices measure glucose levels every five minutes and then
      give insulin and/or glucagon automatically to regulate the blood glucose (BG).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The iPhone bionic pancreas has been used in earlier studies, during which volunteers used the
      system for up to 11 days at a time while living their normal lives at home and work. The iLet
      bionic pancreas has never been tested in humans. In this new study, volunteers will
      participate in a training visit to learn how both devices work. They will then use the
      iPhone-based BP for 1 day and the iLet BP for 1 day in random order using Lilly glucagon.
      They will then use the iLet BP for one additional day using Xeris Xerisol glucagon (a stable
      formulation of human glucagon).

      A custom infusion set is required for this bihormonal system, to prevent future consumers
      from being able to accidentally swap their insulin and glucagon reservoirs and infusion sets,
      which could be potentially fatal. Previous experiments have demonstrated flaws in the
      infusion set design, requiring human experiments to be suspended and modifications to the
      infusion set be made. We believe the current infusion set has addressed these flaws by
      incorporating an anti-coring heel and a tri-beveled needle, and the infusion set sub-study is
      designed to isolate and study the infusion set function before further experiments using the
      iLet BP are conducted.
