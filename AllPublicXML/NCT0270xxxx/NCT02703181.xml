  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      additional repeat doses of epelsiban in healthy females, and will be the first dosing
      experience of repeat dosing at higher doses in women with this compound.

      This study is a 14 day, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind (sponsor unblind),
      repeat dose, ascending cohort, dose escalation study in healthy, female volunteers. Upon
      successful completion of the Screening period, a subject will be enrolled in the study. The
      study will be composed of three periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up. A subject's
      total time involved in the study will be approximately six weeks.

      Cohorts will be conducted sequentially. Each subject will be enrolled in only one cohort. Ten
      subjects will be enrolled in each cohort and randomized to epelsiban (n=8) or placebo (n=2).
