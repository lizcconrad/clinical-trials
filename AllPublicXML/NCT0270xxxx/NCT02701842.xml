      The researchers want to find out more about a standalone software application, ImPACT Online
      and how it relates to other commonly used tests of memory, attention and reaction time.
      ImPACT Online is a computer-based neurocognitive test for concussion management. The test was
      designed to help measure the effects of concussion on cognitive processes (for example,
      memory, attention, brain speed) and visual functioning.
