  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm dietary
      intervention study. In total, 800 men and women at risk for Metabolic Syndrome (MS) will be
      recruited. Subjects will be eligible to the study if they present with two to four of the MS
      diagnostic criteria, at least one of them being:

        -  fasting triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL but ≤400 mg/dL OR

        -  HDL-cholesterol ≤50 mg/mL in women, ≤ 40mg/mL in men (with fasting triglycerides ≥110
           mg/dL).

      Each of the four recruiting centres will recruit 200 volunteers. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of four groups to receive either:

        -  Dairy BEF + egg placebo + bakery placebo

        -  Egg BEF + dairy placebo + bakery placebo

        -  Bakery BEF + dairy placebo + egg placebo

        -  Dairy, egg and bakery placebo

      Participants will be required to consume all three of the allocated products each day for 12
      weeks.

      Eligible volunteers will be included and randomly allocated to one of the four groups. At
      baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks after inclusion, each participant will visit the recruiting
      centre for clinical and biochemical investigations. At 3 weeks and 9 weeks participants will
      complete questionnaires relating to their satisfaction with the food products, compliance to
      consumption of the study food products, and any gastrointestinal side effects or
      health-related adverse events that have occurred in the previous 3 weeks.

      At each recruiting centre 40 participants will be required to take part in additional
      activities, these are: stool sample collection, adipose tissue aspiration, body composition
      analysis by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and assessment of physical activity.

    <description>Changes in fecal bacterial composition and diversity will be determined at baseline and after 12 weeks of consumption of foods enriched with DHA, alone or in combination with AC or BG, in subjects at risk for or affected by MS.

The interindividual differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota (beta-diversity) will be evaluated with the analysis of principal coordinates (PCOA). Appropriate statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate significant differences in the relative abundance of the microbial groups of intestinal microbiota between different groups of subjects.</description>
