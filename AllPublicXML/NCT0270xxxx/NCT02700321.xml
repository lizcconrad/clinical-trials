    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether High Flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen is more
      efficient than the standard High Flow face mask (HFFM) for preoxygenation before orotracheal
      intubation after crash induction in non severely hypoxemic patients

      This study will be designed as followed : patients will be randomized in 2 groups : High Flow
      nasal cannula &quot;HFNC&quot; or standard High Flow face mask &quot;HFFM&quot;.

      Patients randomized in &quot;HFNC&quot; group will receive a four minutes preoxygenation period with
      Nasal High Flow Therapy (60 L/mn , fraction of inspired oxygen (FI02) = 100%) before
      orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash induction. After induction and during
      laryngoscopy, HFNC will be maintained in an attempt to achieve apneic oxygenation.

      Patients randomized in &quot;HFFM&quot; group will received a four minutes preoxygenation period with
      standard face mask (15 L/mn) before orotracheal intubation under laryngoscopy after crash
      induction. After induction, HFFM will be removed, enabling laryngoscopic vision
