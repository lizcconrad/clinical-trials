  <brief_summary>

      Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, mono center, Phase III trial to
      compare EXACYL in preventive with placebo on perioperatory bleeding in orthognathism surgery.

      The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical value of preventive treatment EXACYL® on
      bleeding during surgery to orthognathism. Our hypothesis is that this preventive treatment is
      not enough reduces bleeding to cause a change in patient management (count additional blood
      count, extra padding, transfusion).

      Prospective equivalence trial type controlled by two parallel group, randomized, triple-blind
      (patient, surgical team, anesthesia team).

        -  EXACYL® Group: 1 syringe 1g EXACYL® on one hour + 1 syringe 1g EXACYL® on 8 hours

        -  Control group: 1 syringe 30 mL of saline on one hour + 1 syringe 30 mL saline on 8 hours
           Main criteria is amount of blood during the entire hospitalization: bleeding during
           surgery completed in the amount of blood present in the suction drains and nasogastric
           tube until ablation thereof.
