      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study to assess
      the safety and tolerability of PDC-APB by intramuscular (IM) injection compared to placebo.
      In this First-in-Human study it is anticipated that up to 5 dose levels (2.5 mg, 10 mg, 0.125
      mg, .375 mg and 1.0 mg PDC-APB) will be studied in sequential cohorts. Each cohort will
      enroll 8 subjects, 6 subjects randomized to active treatment and 2 randomized to placebo, in
      a double-blind manner. A sentinel group of 2 subjects in each cohort will be randomized to
      active (1 subject) or placebo (1 subject). If the dose is tolerated in the sentinel group,
      the remaining 6 subjects in the cohort will be treated (5 active and 1 placebo).

      Safety will be assessed in each cohort before starting treatment at the next higher dose
      level. If the study treatment is tolerated and there are no findings that necessitate
      stopping the study, the next cohort will be treated at the next higher dose level, in the
      same manner. This process will continue until the highest intended dose (1 mL) is reached, or
      side effects that limit further dose escalation are observed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are required to meet the following criteria in order to be included in the study:

          1. Healthy male and female subjects as determined by medical history and physical
             examination, from 18 to 55 years of age, inclusive

          2. History of previous exposure to poison ivy, oak, or sumac without development of
             significant contact dermatitis. Significant contact dermatitis is defined as a skin
             reaction that covered more than 10% of body surface area by the subject's estimation,
             occurred on the face or genitals, was rated by the subject as moderate or severe, or
             required treatment with topical, oral, or injectable (systemic) steroids for
             resolution of symptoms. History of exposure will be documented using the Allergic
             Contact Dermatitis Questionnaire (Appendix 1).

          3. For female subjects: Surgically sterile or menopausal (at least 1 year absence of
             vaginal bleeding or spotting) and as confirmed by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥
             40 mIU/mL. Females of childbearing age/potential may be included provided that they
             are using medically acceptable methods of birth control for 1 month prior to and for
             the duration of the study and for 3 months thereafter. Dual methods must be used, for
             example a hormonal method used with a barrier method.

          4. For male subjects and their partners of childbearing potential: Willing to use two
             methods of contraception, one of which must be a barrier method, for the duration of
             the study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug, and agreed not to donate

             which are permitted)

          5. Any screening laboratory evaluation outside the laboratory reference range that is
             judged by the investigator to be clinically significant (including hepatic and renal
             panels, complete blood count, chemistry panel, and urinalysis)

          6. History of significant renal or urinary disease or active symptoms of renal or urinary
             disease. A history of renal stones or of urinary tract infections does not exclude a
             subject.

          7. History of significant hepatic disease or impairment, or any active symptoms of
             hepatic disease

             unacceptable risk to the subject in this study, in the opinion of the investigator,
             based on possible interference with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or
             elimination of the study drug or possible effect of the study drug on the condition or
             abnormality

         14. History of significant allergies requiring treatment with steroids (by topical or oral
