    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to perform a randomized trial comparing the use of the algorithm,
      with dosing of warfarin in standard manual dosage clinical practice, in a high quality
      anticoagulant setting (PSM). This is done for safety concerns and to ensure good performance
      of the algorithm when used in a clinical setup. The results from the study are expected to
      increase our knowledge of efficacy by using the algorithm in clinical practice.

    <description>The algorithm is based on a model, which is designed to handle time series of daily warfarin intakes and INR values measured at designated time points. Based on these inputs the model is able to suggest a warfarin maintenance dose to achieve target INR value. Model parameters are initially set to population values and gradually, as data is entered into the model, these parameters become patient specific.</description>
