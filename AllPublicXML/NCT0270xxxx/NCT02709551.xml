    <description>For the physiological assessment of HRV we used the HRV-Scanner from BioSign GmbH which gathers different HRV parameters like RMSSD and pNN50. HRV was assessed before and after a stressor (Stroop Color-Word Task (based on findings by Stroop, 1935) and D2-R Concentration and Endurance test (Brickenkamp et al., 2010). Alteration in data will be statistically compared.</description>
