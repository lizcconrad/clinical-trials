  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is an observational study in patients with heart failure investigating the incidence of
      arrhythmias using a wearable device which can monitor heart rhythm for up to 14 days. In
      addition to gathering routine clinical information, research assessments include a symptoms
      questionnaire and a corridor walk test. Patients will be followed for clinical events
      (interventions for arrhythmias, hospitalisation, death) for 1 year.

      due to the slow recruitment, on the one hand, and the fact that the preliminary analysis gave
      the valuable results, on the other hand, the number of patients was reduced from 400 to 100
      and the follow-up from five years to one year

    <description>A dysrhythmia will be defined as either
Arrhythmia for which there is a Class I or IIa recommendation for treatment with medication or devices in ESC guidelines.
One or more of the following even if it does not otherwise meet guideline-indication for treatment:
Sinus bradycardia ≤30bpm for ≥one minute
High-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (3rd degree or Mobitz Type I or II)
Pauses lasting ≥3 seconds (either sinus or AV block)
Frequent ventricular ectopy defined as &gt;1,000 ectopic beats per day.
Ventricular tachycardia with rate ≥100 bpm for ≥5 beats.</description>
