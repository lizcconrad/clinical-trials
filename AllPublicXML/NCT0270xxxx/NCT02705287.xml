  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot project is to trace the metabolism of vitamin D in the body in
      pregnant and non-pregnant women. At the conclusion of this study the investigators will have
      obtained novel information on the absorption and utilization of vitamin D in women and will
      have validated a new approach. The long-term goal is to better understand the unique
      metabolism of vitamin D during pregnancy.

    <textblock>
      Nearly 30% of US women are either vitamin D insufficient or deficient. Vitamin D inadequacy
      during gestation is increasingly linked to adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth,
      risk of cesarean section and placental and pregnancy associated infections. At this time the
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) has not advocated any increase in vitamin D intake across
      gestation but this remains controversial in large part due to insufficient information on the
      basic physiology of vitamin D. Pregnancy induces dramatic changes in regulation of vitamin D.
      The investigators hypothesize that increased maternal, placental, and fetal vitamin D
      requirements during late gestation will result in an increase in vitamin D absorption and a
      decrease in the half-life of both vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

      The specific aims of this project are to:

        1. Obtain pilot data on the absorption of vitamin D3 in non-pregnant and pregnant women,
           following oral dosing with deuterated vitamin D3

        2. Obtain pilot data on the dynamics of the conversion of vitamin D3 into 25-hydroxyvitamin
           D3, following dosing with oral deuterated vitamin D3

        3. Estimate the serum half-life of vitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in non-pregnant and
           pregnant women
