  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth symptoms mostly occur as drug side-effects. Available products such as saliva
      substitutes are disappointing (bad taste, poor efficiency).

      The hypothesis stems from the &quot;empirical&quot; observations that many patients alleviate dry mouth
      symptoms by the consumption of dairy products. Through its composition, the dairy product in
      itself provides relief for the patient, due both to its physical and biochemical properties,
      which could explain these observed improvements, and to elements related to the phenomena of
      consumption of food as an alternative to medication. In the latter case, hedonism takes on a
      role which has not been previously assessed. Initial work undertaken with the department of
      applied research at the National Dairy Industry School (ENIL) led to the prototyping of a new
      milk product, to qualify and adapt a product with a &quot;health benefit&quot; in patients suffering
      from xerostomia.

      This dairy product has specific taste, texture and lubrication properties and will be tested
      in a randomized controlled cross-over study for its efficiency and acceptability versus a
      reference product (Aequasyal ®, Oxidized Glycerol Triester) on a group of 32 patients at
      Dijon and at Besançon University Hospitals.

      This way of combatting xerostomia at the interface of patients' diet, such as it is proposed
      here, could help improve their quality of life, minimize harmful effects (infection, decay)
      and promote adherence to treatments which are responsible for xerostomia.
