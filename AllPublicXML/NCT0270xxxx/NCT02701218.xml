  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral posterior canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) cases will be
      randomized to treat with single or multiple cycles of canalith repositioning procedure.The
      treatment outcomes will be assessed at 7th and 28th days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients present with brief episodes of vertigo will be evaluated by Dix-Hallpike test. Cases
      with positive Dix-Hallpike test, unilateral, posterior canal, will be randomized with block
      of four. Either single or multiple cycles of canalith repositioning procedure will be
      performed. Four treatment outcomes will be blindly assessed at 7 and 28 days.
