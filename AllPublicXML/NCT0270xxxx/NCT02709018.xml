  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker
      (ARB), is safe and effective in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      symptoms. The study is also intended to determine if certain genetic markers are useful in
      predicting PTSD symptom reduction with losartan. Approximately 160 subjects with chronic PTSD
      ages 18-65 will participate in this study across five sites. Subjects will be assigned by
      chance to take either flexibly dosed losartan (up to a maximum dosage of 100 mg) or placebo
      (which resembles the study drug but has no active ingredients), once a day for 10 weeks.
      Furthermore, it is hypothesized that CC homozygotes for rs4311 SNP in the ACE gene will have
      a superior response to losartan on PTSD symptoms compared to T carriers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are limited current treatments available for PTSD, and the only FDA-approved
      medications are SSRIs, which were empirically found to be somewhat helpful. Losartan provides
      a potentially important and exciting development in that it is readily available, safe,
      inexpensive (available as a generic drug), and has a neurobiological mechanism based on
      recent exciting discoveries, as outlined below. This proposal is designed to test, in a
      multisite RCT, this novel, mechanistically-determined, safe and well-tolerated, potentially
      powerful treatment for PTSD symptoms.

        protocol by contacting the Principal Investigator]

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subject must be a man or woman between 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Subjects must have a primary DSM-5 diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

          3. Subjects must have a Clinical Administered PTSD Scale for PTSD (CAPS-5) ≥ 25
             persistent at Screening for at least 3 months duration.

          4. Subject must be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions
