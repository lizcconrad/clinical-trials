  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS), also known as the anterior knee pain, is one of the most
      common musculoskeletal disorders. Most of the patients suffer from knee pain for long time.
      The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term effects of Mobilization with movement
      and Kinesiotaping on pain, function and balance in patient with PFPS.

    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome is one of the most common musculoskeletal problem in the world.
      It's incidence is also becoming higher and most people who have knee pain suffer from it for
      long time. In the treatment of PFPS, conservative treatment methods are preferred prior to
      surgical ones. When the literature was reviewed, no study in which Mobilization with movement
      (MWM) method was used and in which the effects of it was shown and compared with
      (Kinesiotaping) KT has been found so far with respect to the treatment of PFPS. Thirty-five
      female patients diagnosed with unilateral PFPS were randomly assigned into 2 groups. The
      patients in the first group (n=18) received two techniques of Mobilization with movement
      intervention while Kinesiotaping was applied to the other group (n=17). Both groups were
      treated with exercise. All patients received 4 sessions of treatment twice a week for a
      period of 2 weeks and followed up in accordance with a 6-week-home exercise program. Primary
      outcomes: pain severity, knee range of motion, hamstring flexibility, and physical
      performance (10-step stair climbing test, timed up and go test), Kujala Patellofemoral Pain
      Scoring and Y-Balance test were assessed.

    <description>The patients in this arm (n=18) received two techniques pertaining to Mulligan's Mobilization with movement approach (Mulligan's Straight Leg-Raise with Traction and Tibial Gliding) along with an exercise therapy. Patients received 4 sessions of treatment twice a week for a period of 2 weeks and followed up in accordance with a 6-week-home exercise program. Primary outcomes: pain severity, knee range of motion, hamstring flexibility, and physical performance (10-step stair climbing test, timed up and go test), Kujala Patellofemoral Pain Scoring and Y-Balance test were assessed before the treatment, 45 minutes after the initial treatment, at the end of the 4-session-treatment during 2-week period and 6 weeks later.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm were applied kinesiotaping on quadriceps and hamstring muscle along with an exercise therapy. Patients received 4 sessions of treatment twice a week for a period of 2 weeks and followed up in accordance with a 6-week-home exercise program. The same assessment parameters was conducted on this arm too.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mulligan's Straight leg-raise with traction</intervention_name>
    <description>Mulligan's Straight leg raise technique was performed on patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. The extremity on which the practice would be performed in supine position was grasped from the ankle level and was, then, subjected to traction longitudinally. Afterwards, the knee was lifted up passively while in extension and was kept for waiting for a few seconds at the point where tension was felt and was, then, returned to its initial position. The practice was repeated 10 times, and 3 sets of practice at 1-minute-intervals were performed.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mulligan's Mobilization with Movement</intervention_name>
    <description>Mulligan's Mobilization with Movement technique was performed on patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Each patient was tested in every direction in the course of the active knee flexion-extension movement so as to find out the best pain-free tibial gliding direction (medial-lateral part of the tibia, anterior-posterior, internal-external rotation). At the time of the active movement of the knee, the tibial gliding direction where pain was felt at the least was selected as the treatment direction of mobilization technique along with movement. The practice was performed by doing 10 repetitions for 3 sets and by providing 1-minute-resting time between the sets.</description>

    <intervention_name>Kinesiotaping</intervention_name>
    <description>Kinesiotaping was applied on patient with patellofemoral pain syndrome. To maintain proprioceptive stimulation in the quadriceps (from origo towards insertio) and to alleviate the tension of hamstring muscle, a 'Y''-shaped kinesiotape was applied by using the muscle technique.</description>

    <description>All the patients were provided with several exercises within the scope of the home exercise program, such as hamstring muscle stretching, quadriceps isometric exercises, 4-way-strengthening with exercise elastic bands for the muscles of the hip, knee locking on foot and mini-squatting exercises. They were asked to do these exercises in 3 sets a day along with 10 repetitions for a period of 6 weeks.</description>
