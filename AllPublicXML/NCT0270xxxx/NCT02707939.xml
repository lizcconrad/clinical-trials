  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the fastest growing neurodevelopmental disorder in the
      world. Approximately 1% of the population worldwide is affected by this disorder. Children
      with ASD exhibit some very stereo-typical behaviors. Their daily functionality depends on
      very rigid and predictable schedules and routines. Any changes in their schedules can often
      trigger negative emotional outbursts. The need to come to the hospital for procedures can be
      one such trigger. The purpose of this study is to examine the post anesthesia behavior
      outcomes of children with ASD.
