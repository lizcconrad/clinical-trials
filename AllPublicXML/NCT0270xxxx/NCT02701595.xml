  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious infection with a significant burden for patients and
      hospitals (in France, median length of hospital stay = 43 days), partly due to the long
      duration of intravenous (IV) antibacterial treatment recommended by international guidelines,
      between 4 and 6 weeks in most situations.

      A recent survey of practices regarding the management of IE in France showed that a switch
      from IV to oral antibiotics is feasible, when patients with left-sided
      Streptococcus-Enterococcus IE are stable after an initial course of IV antibiotic treatment,
      with or without valvular surgery.

      These practices have not been associated with unfavourable outcome, while significantly
      reducing the duration and cost of hospitalization, the risk of nosocomial infection, and
      patients' discomfort.

      There has been no randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the field of IE over the last 20
      years; current guidelines are mostly based on expert advice, in vitro studies, animal
      experiments, or clinical studies performed before the 90's.

      The RODEO 2 project is an unprecedented opportunity to bring back evidence-based medicine in
      the field of IE.

      Most experts acknowledge that the pharmacological PK/PD characteristics of antibiotics such
      as amoxicillin allow a high level of efficacy in the treatment of IE when orally
      administrated after an IV period of induction.

      It's needed to conduct RCTs that clearly demonstrate the clinical non-inferiority of this
      strategy for streptococci, and enterococci IE with a benefit regarding costs.

      The RODEO 2 project corresponds to one pragmatic trial assessing the impact of a switch
      strategy, making it a comparative effectiveness trial that should be able to feed the next
      revision of IE international guidelines and to change practices in IE management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RODEO 2 study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of partial oral treatment
      of IE compared with traditional full-length parenteral treatment. Our primary objective is to
      demonstrate that in patients with left-sided multi-susceptible Streptococcus-Enterococcus IE
      who have received at least 10 days of IV antibiotic treatment with or without valvular
      surgery, a switch to an oral combination of amoxicillin between Day 10 and Day 28 after
      initiation of the IV antibiotic treatment, is not inferior to the continuation of the
      conventional IV antibiotic treatment regarding to treatment failure within 3 months after the
      end of antibiotic treatment.

      Nationwide, noninferiority, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trials.

      Randomisation will only be offered to patients who have received at least 10 days of IV
      conventional antibiotic treatment of IE, and fulfil the inclusion criteria.

      Randomisation will take place between Day 10 and Day 28 after initiation of parenteral
      antibiotic therapy or valvular surgery, thus ensuring to have at least 14 days of oral
      therapy in the experimental group.

      Patients will be eligible whether they have undergone valvular surgery or not. This will
      imply that surgery procedure prior to randomisation will be heterogeneous, but randomisation
      will be stratified on the requirement of valvular surgery as part of the treatment of the
      current episode of IE or not.
