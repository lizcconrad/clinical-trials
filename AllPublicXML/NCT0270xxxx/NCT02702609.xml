    <textblock>
      Randomized Controlled study to compare the effectiveness of two different treatment
      approaches using a new moldable beta-tricalcium phosphate(TCP) bone graft material in ridge
      preservation of an atraumatic extraction socket site compared to allograft with collagen
      plug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of informed consent

          -  At least 18 years old

          -  In need of one posterior tooth, excluding third molar molars, planned for extraction
             and replacement with a dental implant (If the subject requires two adjacent socket
             preservation, they can still be enrolled in the study but only one site will be used
             for the study)

          -  Intact ridge as verified with cone-beam CT scan

          -  At least one natural tooth adjacent to the study site present.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Insufficient interocclusal space to allow for implant supported prosthesis

          -  Dehiscence or fenestration identified at the time of reviewing CBCT.

          -  Non-treated caries or uncontrolled periodontal disease present affecting the teeth in
             adjacent to study teeth.

          -  Any of natural teeth adjacent to the study site presents active periapical endodontic
             lesion (&quot;active periapical endodontic lesion&quot; will be determined per consultation by
             endodontics specialist).

          -  Adjacent tooth (mesial and distal) to study site was extracted within last 6 months

          -  Adjacent teeth (or tooth) to study site with significant soft tissue loss

          -  Smoker using more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent per day

          -  Smokeless tobacco use or e-cigarette use

          -  Current alcohol or drug abuser

          -  Systemic or local disease or condition that would compromise post-operative healing
             and/or osseointegration e.g. uncontrolled diabetes

          -  Need for systemic corticosteroids or any other medication that would influence
             post-operative healing and/or osseointegration

          -  Pregnancy, as indicated by positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test
             result.

          -  Unable or unwilling to return for follow-up visits for a period of 5 months

          -  Unlikely to be able to comply with study procedures according to Investigators
             judgement

          -  Subject in other clinical trials
