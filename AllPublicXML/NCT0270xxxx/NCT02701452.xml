  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, the risk of moderate to severe OHSS is 3 to 6% and reaches 31% in high
      risk populations 9 days after oocyte triggering with hCG. Many studies report no or a
      markedly decreased risk of OHSS after triggering ovulation with a GnRH agonist. However,
      criteria to define OHSS are rarely explained and OHSS itself is not thoroughly asserted. It
      is well known that OHSS is associated with hypercoagulability. However, no study after
      triggering with a GnRH agonist assessed haemostasis in these high-risk patients with high
      circulating estradiol levels.

      Study design, size, duration: In a French academic reproductive medicine centre, a systematic
      prospective observational follow-up of all patients triggered by GnRH agonist for excessive
      follicular response will be conducted. Participants/materials, setting, methods: All patients
      undergoing antagonist protocol and at high risk of OHSS (estradiol level ≥ 3000 pg/mL and/or
      more than 20 follicles ≥ 11mm on the day of triggering) will be triggered by GnRH agonist. No
      luteal phase support and a &quot;freeze-all&quot; strategy will be performed. On the day of oocyte
      retrieval (T0), at 48h (T1) and at day 7 (T2), OHSS and hypercoagulability will be
      systematically assessed. Haemostasis data will be compared to the initial status of each
      patient.
