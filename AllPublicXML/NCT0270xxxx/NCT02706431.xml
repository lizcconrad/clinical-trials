  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula with 100% oxygen has only been evaluated in a
      limited number of studies. Although data are convincing it is of importance to evaluate this
      new concept in our department before implementing it into clinical practice.

      The general purpose of this project is to evaluate a new ventilation strategy during
      ENT-surgery based on oxygenation with high-flow nasal cannula with 100% oxygen with focus on
      gas exchange.
