      A multicenter prospective interventional comparative study that investigate pain management
      during Jaydess insertion in nulliparous women that will be tested by the analgesic affects of
      oral tramadol or 'verbal anesthesia' on the patients.

    <textblock>
      Most intrauterine contraception (IUC) insertions do not require pain management. However,
      small proportions of nulliparous women experience substantial pain that needs to be
      proactively managed No prophylactic pharmacological intervention has been adequately
      evaluated to support routine use for pain reduction during or after IUC insertion. Women's
      anxiety about the procedure may contribute to higher levels of perceived pain, which
      highlights the importance of counselling, and creating a trustworthy, unhurried and
      professional atmosphere in which the experience of the provider also has a major role; a
      situation frequently referred to as 'verbal anaesthesia'.

      It has been proven in the past that the use of oral Tramadol can reduce the pain in the
      insertion.

      In the study investigators will compare the analgesic affects of oral Tramadol and verbal
      anesthesia on pain relief during Jaydess insertion in nulliparous women.
