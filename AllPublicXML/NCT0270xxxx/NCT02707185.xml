      METHODS:

      Subjects:

      All internal medicine (IM), emergency medicine (EM), anesthesia (A), surgery (S) residents
      and all hospital ICU nurses (approximately 400 subjects) will be undergoing evaluation and
      training in CPR techniques according to their department training policy.

      Study Assessment Tool:

      An objective assessment tool has been developed and tested in medical code scenarios during
      training sessions recently done in the simulation lab. The tool has five domains: Airway,
      Breathing, Circulation, Communications/Leadership, and Defibrillation. Each domain consists
      of 3-8 tasks and skills (attachment A).

      Design:

        -  Phase I: In groups of five to six subjects, residents and nurses will undergo baseline
           assessment in CPR techniques in the simulation lab. Subject will be presented with a
           clinical scenario that includes cardiopulmonary arrest. Subjects will be scored by
           observers based on the previously described assessment tool and will be video recorded.

        -  Phase II: All study subjects who completed phase I assessment will undergo standardized
           debriefing and demonstration of proper CPR techniques after reviewing their individual
           baseline videotape followed by repeated demonstration in CPR techniques during a
           clinical scenario with cardiopulmonary arrest in the simulation lab. Knowledge retention
           will be assessed periodically.

        -  Phase III: Rates of survival to hospital discharge and survival at 24 hours in
           hospitalized patients after cardiopulmonary arrest collected by the CPR committee and QA
           department longitudinally for one year after completion of project training (phase II)
           will be reviewed and compared to the same period one year earlier (CPR outcome data are
           being collected since 2005 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospitals).
