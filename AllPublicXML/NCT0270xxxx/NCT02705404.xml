      The investigators are doing this research to see if they can use small tissue samples or
      fluid to develop a test that will determine if the tissue samples are related or not related
      to each other. The test will use the patient's DNA, which is part of their unique genetic
      material that carries the instructions for the body's development and function. Cancer can
      result from changes in a person's genetic material that causes cells to divide in an
      uncontrolled way and, sometimes, to travel to other organs. Currently, researchers and
      doctors know some of the genetic changes that can cause cancer, but they do not know all of
      the genetic changes that can cause cancer.

      A frequent clinical dilemma in lung cancer care is the management of multifocal lung cancers.
      The management decision is based on determining if multiple cancers represent true
      independent primary cancers or related metastasis. This determination is critical to the
      appropriate staging of the cancers and treatment. Indeed, this distinction represents the
      difference between aggressive local therapy with either surgery or radiation therapy for
      primary early stage lesions, or palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care with
      appropriate symptom management for advanced stage metastatic disease.

      No existing pathologic or molecular test is currently capable of making the distinction
      between multiple independent lung primaries from metastatic disease with accuracy. The recent
      release of preliminary data from the NLST screening trial, suggesting survival benefit for
      screening high risk patients with CT scanning, will only increase the number of patients
      facing these treatment dilemmas. The research team has recently developed a test that allows
      this distinction with great accuracy. This test allows determination of lineage between two
      tumors using the identification of large genomic rearrangements using mate pair next
      generation sequencing (MP). The test has been developed using fresh frozen tissue from
      resected lung tumors and is currently being validated for a clinical test.

      The investigators' goal is to develop the test using cytology and small biopsy specimens.

      The patient will have some or all of the samples taken listed below:

        -  Blood sample of 10 ml (2 teaspoons).

        -  Up to two lung bronchoscopic or transbronchoscopic needle aspiration biopsies will be
           given to the research study during an already scheduled bronchoscopy. In addition at the
           time of the bronchoscopy a brushing or washing specimen could be collected for research.

        -  A piece of lung or lymph node tissue taken at the time of the CT guided lung or lymph
           node biopsy will be given to the research study.

        -  A piece of lung tumor tissue removed during surgery will be given to the research study.

        -  If pleural fluid is removed as part of the procedure(s) and there is any fluid left
           after what is needed for your clinical care, it will be given to the research study.

        -  DNA genome sequencing will be performed on the collected tissues, blood and fluid.
