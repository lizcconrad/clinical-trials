      The research and innovation programme Food´n´Go - Empower aims to develop, test and implement
      health technology solutions for active involvement and increased empowerment of elderly
      patients and their relatives solving well-known problem areas as malnutrition and inactivity.

      The prototype was developed in 2013. The project is a collaboration between departement of
      internal medicine in Copenhagen University Hospital, one local municipality and a private
      it-company. The technology is a tablet computer, used by elderly patients to order and
      register food intake during hospitalization. The tablet is also used to get inspiration for
      physical activities during hospital admission and after discharge and for registration of
      physical activities.

      The aim of this study is to test if an adjusted version of the Food´n´Go technology through
      active involvement of the elderly patient can prevent weightloss and loss of muscle strength
      during hospitalization and after discharge.

      Welfare and health technology are often directed at solving problems and meeting the needs of
      societies' most vulnerable groups often not familiar with computers.

      The research and innovation programme Food´n´Go - Empower aims to develop, test and implement
      health technology solutions for involvement and increased empowerment of elderly patients and
      their relatives. The focus is on frequent issues for this group of patients, in this phase
      focusing on nutrition and physical activity. Later, the solution will include pain
      management, management of sleep problems, medication management, prevention of confusion and
      coordination of the treatment and care course across sectorial borders. The technology is a
      tablet- computer, operated by the patient by means of a number of app-like software
      applications.

      In the summer 2013 the programme received a grant from the Capitol Region's
      Public-Private-Innovation (OPI) pool for design and development of the prototype. In 2014 the
      prototype for nutrition was tested in a feasibility study. Usability and acceptability was
      tested in the patients' own home, as well as the effect of the nutrition intervention, after
      discharge from hospital (see protocol 10/16/2014).

      The results were promising, and the aim is now to test the technology for supporting both
      nutrition and physical activity across sectorial boundaries. The elderly patient will operate
      the tablet during admission and after discharge, continuing the efforts aimed at nutrition
      and physical activity during the stay at a rehabilitation centre 5 to 6 weeks after
      discharge. The working hypothesis is: Functional ability and nutritional status will be
      stabilized or improved, and readmissions and dependency of municipal services will be
      reduced.

      The aim of this study is:

        1. to test if an adjusted version of the Food´n´Go technology through active involvement of
           the elderly patient can prevent weight loss and loss of muscle strength during
           hospitalization and after discharge

        2. to develop and test the technology in relation to stability, applicability and
           acceptability

    <description>Patients from the local municipality, planned to be discharged to a rehabilitation stay at the municipality training centre receive a tablet computer. The patient will be introduced to the tablet and informed about the nutritional and mobilisation intervention based on his/her individual needs and preferences. The patient and the research assistant will jointly prepare an individual plan for nutrition and physical activity The patient uses the tablet for ordering meals, registering dietary intake, viewing his/her instruction videos for the activity programme and registering physical activity during hospital admission and at the training centre up to 6 weeks after discharge from hospital.</description>

    <intervention_name>Tablet computer</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention group will receive a tablet computer with an app-like software solution supporting nutrition and physical activity. The patients operate the computer and order their meals from the hospital menu; register dietary intake, and receive feedback informing about their current status for protein and energy intake. Likewise, the patients use small series of brief videos instructing in daily life activities for strengthening their muscles. After this, they register their performed activities and will receive informing and motivating feedback. Nudging and prompting is part of the solution.</description>
