      Once participants have been recruited, their grip strength shall be tested and they will all
      complete baseline questionnaires to assess functional status and symptom severity.

      Following the recruitment stage, participants will be asked to attend Medway Maritime
      Hospital once a week for four weeks, to receive the massage protocol. At the first session
      participants shall be asked to rate their pain (NPRS), before receiving a massage treatment.
      This will be followed by instructions on how to perform self-massage, which they will be
      asked to complete daily over the four-week period, and record in a diary. At the remaining
      three sessions, participants shall just complete the NPRS prior to receiving the massage
      treatment.

      After four weeks the group will be reassessed at the same Orthopaedic Clinic they attended
      prior to recruitment. They will be asked to complete a final pain score, record any changes
      in their condition, repeat the initial symptom questionnaire, and finally preform a grip
      strength test. The duration of four weeks was chosen as this is the time-frame within which
      the specific massage protocol advises a 'significant symptom improvement' should be seen.
