      The incidence of reactions during penicillin challenge tests among children with suspected
      penicillin allergy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      children who are suspected to have penicillin allergy due to a suspected allergic reaction
      during penicillin treatment are sent for allergy investigation to role out allergy. Patients
      go through penicillin test and if negative are challenged by oral administration under
      medical observation. The investigators would like to check the incidence among our pediatric
      pediatric patients.
