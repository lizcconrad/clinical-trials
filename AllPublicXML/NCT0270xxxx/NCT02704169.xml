  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The last decade has seen progressive advances in RT delivery, such as intensity modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT)and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), which now allow highly
      precise radiation dose delivery. Together, IMRT and IGRT offer the potential of more
      selective treatment of the primary tumour and surrounding neck nodes by reducing the dose
      inflicted on critical organs at risk without compromising tumour dose and. IMRT has been
      shown to significantly decrease radiation-induced toxicity, and is now considered standard
      treatment for H&amp;N tumors. With these advances in delivery technology, the accurate definition
      of the target is emerging as the weakest link in the radiotherapeutic treatment chain.
      Accurate target definition is the primary link on which all subsequent treatment planning and
      delivery depend and is therefore critical for successful RT. Incorrect target definition can
      result in poorer outcomes through either less tumour control, more normal tissue toxicity, or
      both. Computed x-ray tomography (CT) is the standard volumetric imaging modality for RT
      because of its high resolution, accurate definition of anatomy and its intrinsic measure of
      electron density necessary for accurate dose calculation. However, its ability to distinguish
      between tumour and normal tissue is limited due to a lack of contrast for structures of
      similar electron density and image artifacts for objects of high density. This additional
      noise can result in large inter-observation variability. Disease visible on endoscopy can be
      contoured and registered to the planning CT, allowing inclusion of superficial disease
      invisible on the volumetric CT image dataset into the treatment plan.
