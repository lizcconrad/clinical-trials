  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic carcinoma typically has a high recurrence rate and very poor prognosis. Surgery is
      the best choice for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, but for those advanced pancreatic
      cancer patients，when surgery is not available，chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy or
      interventional therapy is commonly used in the treatment，but the prolonging survival effect
      is not obvious. And now, some clinical researchers use CAR-T cells in the treatment of
      pancreatic carcinoma, according to the existing results, therapeutic effects are not as good
      as expecting. One of the most likely reasons is that they continued to use the intravenous
      infusing of CART cells to patients, when the T cells into the blood circulation, will result
      in decreased tumor activity and more potential adverse effects. We believe that a suitable
      TAA targeted-CAR-T cells will be an effective way to treat cancer, as long as the pathway of
      the cell infused to the body can not only improve the drug concentration of the tumor site
      but reduce the potential off-target side effects. In order to achieve this goal, it is
      probably the best choice to use vascular intervention to mediate CAR-T cells infusion.
      Mesothelin is a cell-surface antigen implicated in tumor invasion, which is highly expressed
      in pancreatic carcinoma but low-level expressed in mesothelia. We design a 2nd CART cells
      targeted with mesothelin, and use vascular intervention mediated CAR-T infusion to patients.
      We hope deliver anti-mesothelin CART cells locally can reducing the side effects while
      enhancing the antitumor affect by more CART cells accumulate in tumor sites while less can
      reach normal mesothelial tissue.

      This study is being conducted to assess vascular interventional therapy mediated
      anti-mesothelin-CAR-T(meso-CAR-T) cells safety and efficacy in treating patients with
      advanced pancreatic carcinoma.The investigators constructed a 2nd CAR, using mesothelin as
      target, using 4-1BB as co-stimulator. The source of T cells used to prepare CAR-T should be
      autologous. The infusion dose is (1-10)×106 meso-CAR positive T cells/kg, and the specific
      cells numbers depends on the situation of individual CAR-T cells preparation. The infusion
      way is vascular interventional mediated, which would undergo cannula--DSA radiography--CAR-T
      cells perfusion. The cells perfusion process would lasts 15min to 2 h, and the specific time
      depends on patent's tumor-burdened state.

The infusion will be scheduled to occur 2 days after a single dose of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide, which will be administered according to standard procedures. Patients will undergo cannula--DSA radiography--CAR-T cells perfusion.
