  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N2O has been used during general anesthesia (GA) for more than 100 years. It is known to have
      anesthetic agents sparing effect. But small is know on his real analgesic effect during GA.
      So far, the only way to monitor pain during GA was based on vital signs that are not specific
      and not sensitive. Few devices tried to evaluated pain under GA during the last 2 decades.
      More recently, better devices were proposed such as the Physiodoloris device and the PMD200
      device. The first offers an index called ANI based on heart rate variability (HRV)
      assessment. The second offers the NoL index based on the analysis of 5 parameters. The aim of
      the present study is to evaluate quantitatively the analgesic index of N2O during GA using
      the two indices ANI and NoL.

      Title: Assessment of the intraoperative analgesic effect of 50%/50% Nitrous Oxide / Oxygen
      inhalation by the pain index ANI following a standardized electrical forearm stimulus in
      patients undergoing laparotomies under general anesthesia and with an intraoperative active
      epidural analgesia. Comparison to the new NoL analgesic index.

      Objectives: To observe the variations of the intraoperative pain indexes ANI and NoL after a
      classical and standardized electrical stimulation of the forearm (applied with the commonly
      used nerve stimulator we use for muscle relaxation monitoring) at different concentrations of
      inhaled Nitrous Oxide (N2O) (from 0% to 50%, concentrations that are commonly used in daily
      anesthesia). This will allow a quantification of the analgesic effect of N2O.

      Study Design: Prospective, open label, observational and descriptive study Subject
      Population: Adult patients scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery by laparotomy under general
      anesthesia with an active intraoperative epidural analgesia Sample Size: 40 patients will be
      evaluated in this study Study Duration: 1 year Study Center: Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital,
      Montreal, Quebec, Canada Adverse Events: None expected

    <description>The same patient is anesthetized without N2O in the gas mixture first. The first standard stimulus is applied on the forearm of the patient when the N2O concentration in the anesthesia mixture is at 0%. ANI response to the stimulus is recorded. Then N2O is slowly increased to reached et-N2O 50% in the anesthesia mixture. Then, at ET-N2O 50%, the same standard stimulus is applied and ANI variations registered.</description>

    <description>During the surgery, for primary and secondary objectives, N2O will be at 0, then 50%.
For these secondary objectives, N2O inhaled concentration in teh anesthetic mixture will be set at 25% and then again at 0% and the same standard stimulus will be applied and ANI and NoL responses recorded and compared to the ones gotten at 50% .</description>

    <description>There is only one arm in this study. All patients under General Anesthesia are exposed to 4 different doses or concentrations of inhaled N2O that is combined with the anesthetic desflurane. Each patient will be submitted to the standard nociceptive stimulus when inhaled N2O is at 0, 50, 25, and finally back to 0%. ANI and NoL Indices variations between &quot;before stimulus&quot; and &quot;after stimulus&quot; at each N2O concentration will be assessed and compared. This will allow to demonstrate an analgesic effect (less variations of ANI and NoL) when inhaled N2O is high (50%) testifying for the analgesic effect of this gas N2O.</description>
