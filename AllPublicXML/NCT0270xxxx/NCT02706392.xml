      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified T-cell
      therapy in treating patients with receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 positive
      (ROR1+) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL), stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled
      with treatment (advanced). Genetically modified therapies, such as ROR1 specific chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, are taken from a patient's blood, modified in the laboratory
      so they specifically may kill cancer cells with a protein called ROR1 on their surfaces, and
      safely given back to the patient after conventional therapy. The &quot;genetically modified&quot;
      T-cells have genes added in the laboratory to make them recognize ROR1.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of adoptive T cell therapy using ex vivo expanded autologous
      cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ ROR1 CAR-T cells for patients with advanced ROR1+
      hematologic (Cohort A) and epithelial (Cohort B) malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and the
      phenotype of persisting T cells.

      II. To determine trafficking of adoptively transferred T cells traffic to the bone marrow or
      other tumor site and function in vivo.

      III. To determine preliminary antitumor activity of the adoptive transfer of ROR1 CAR-T cells
      in patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ROR1 CAR-specific autologous T-lymphocytes.

      Patients receive chemotherapy comprising fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide as
      determined by the referring physician in consultation with the protocol principal
      investigator (PI). Beginning within 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy, patients receive ROR1 CAR-specific autologous T-lymphocytes intravenously (IV)
      over 20-30 minutes. Patients may receive a second infusion of ROR1 CAR-specific autologous
      T-lymphocytes with or without additional cytoreductive therapy at the same (for those that
      received the highest cell dose) or up to the next highest dose level and there is persistent
      disease, there were no toxicities attributed to the first infusion, and the patient is at
      least 21 days from the first T cell infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 15 years.
