      This study is a multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with primary
      ciliary dyskinesia, the clinical information of recruited patients, including clinical
      manifestations, lung function, chest imaging, quality of life and other indicators, will be
      followed for 10 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All new cases of primary ciliary dyskinesia which was confirmed or diagnosed at each center
      from the beginning of the study are made the investigation of the clinical manifestations and
      specific tests by the standard diagnostic process.Then all the patients' following clinical
      data will be followed for 10 years (once per six month): clinical manifestations, lung
      function, chest imaging (once per year), quality of life and other indicators.

        Inclusion Criteria: A included patient must be coincident with all the following items:

          -  Age 0~18 years old

          -  Any organ system symptoms consistent with PCD and being conform to the clinical
             diagnostic standard of Katergener syndrome or being coincident with at least two
             following specific tests:

          -  Abnormal ciliary beat frequency or movement by the high speed photography microscope

          -  Abnormal ciliary structure through the electronic microscopy

          -  The nasal NO decreased significantly

          -  The target gene mutation found

          -  The clinical diagnostic criteria of the Katergener syndrome: ① bronchial expansion; ②
             sinusitis or nasal polyps; ③ transposition of viscera and (or) dextrocardia.

          -  If all the typical clinical manifestations but only 1 specific test with positive
             results, can also be included in the registration of suspected PCD cases

          -  Consent to provide the related clinical specimen to the certain hospital

          -  The guardians of the patients fully understand the purpose of the study, volunteer
             their children to participate in this study, and sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria: Subject will be excluded if she or he has one of the following:
