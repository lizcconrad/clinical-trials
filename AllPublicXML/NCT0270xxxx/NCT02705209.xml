  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The beneficial analgesic effects of Rubefacenciae (redden skin substances), is known since
      1830 as a treatment for pain, cramps, and disorders of the musculoskeletal system. Herbal
      cataplasms containing rubefacient substances, such as Cayenne pepper, are commonly used as
      natural medications to treat painful or aching areas in the case of acute or chronic back
      pain, and rheumatisms. In Vienna and lower Austria, a Cayenne Pepper Cataplasm (CPC)
      application containing Cayenne pepper and Kaolin powder in mixed proportion, is commonly used
      to treat musculoskeletal conditions of pain especially of the low back.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study was to test effects of a series of ten applications
      of CPC prepared with 5% of pepper, investigating the resulting effect on: skin temperature,
      skin sensory functions, pain threshold, and proprioception. Placebo control condition (0%
      cayenne pepper) was also tested. It was hypothesized that a series of 20-minute application
      of a CPC will have significant effects on the measured parameters.

      40 subjects will be randomized into Treatment/control group.

    <description>The subject is lying prone during the test and test will be performed with a BASELINE Aesthesiometer (0-100mm). The test will be performed at the level of L3 spinal process, the medial pin 3 cm laterally from midline and the pins oriented in medial-lateral direction. The two pins will be pressed perpendicular to the skin and the subject will be asked to report whether he/she feels one or two pins. Each inter-pin distance will be used three times using single pin touches in between for a control. The smallest inter-pin distance which the subject reports correctly at least 2 out of 3 repetitions, will be taken, as the result of the test.</description>
