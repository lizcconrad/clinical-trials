  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed for lung transplant patients who have developed chronic lung allograft
      dysfunction (CLAD). Consented patients will receive 4 intravenous doses of allogeneic,
      bone-marrow-derived MSCs (2*10^6 cells/kg/dose) or matching placebo over a period of 2 weeks
      with a 12 month follow up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized study (n=82, 1:1 MSC:placebo) where consented
      patients will receive 4 intravenous doses of IMP over a period of 2 weeks. Patients must
      provide written informed consent and meet the all Inclusion Criteria and none of the
      Exclusion Criteria to be eligible. Screening procedures include obtaining medical history,
      current medications, questionnaires, vital signs, Chest Xray, 6 Minute walk test and blood
      tests. Historical chest CT and full lung function from 12 weeks prior to screening may be
      used. Bronchoscopy with biopsy must have been performed no more than 6 months prior to
      screening. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is required, however will not
      need to be repeated if performed within 14 days prior to the baseline visit. Patients will
      then receive 4 infusions of MSC/placebo over a period of 2 weeks, with follow up at Week
      3,6,10,14,28,41 and week 54.

             the 6 months prior to the screening visit. Other causes of a fall in FEV1 (acute
             cellular or humoral rejection, active infection, anastomotic stenosis etc.) must be
             excluded as per international guidelines.

          2. Untreated cellular or humoral rejection

          3. Clinically meaningful and untreated viral, bacterial or fungal infection

          4. Use of azithromycin or another macrolide antibiotic, if commenced within 8 weeks of

          5. Intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone, within 8 weeks of the screening visit

          6. Use of extracorporeal photopheresis, within 8 weeks of the screening visit

          7. Use of total lymphoid irradiation, within 8 weeks of the screening visit

          8. Fundoplication, within 8 weeks of the screening visit

          9. Poor functional status not expected to survive 6 months

         10. Allergy to beef products

         11. Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or unwilling to use adequate contraception
