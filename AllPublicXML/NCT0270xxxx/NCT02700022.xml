  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib study is designed to establish the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD,
      which will also be the recommended phase II dose (RP2D)) of the aurora kinase A inhibitor
      alisertib when combined with dose-adjusted (DA)-R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, doxorubicin,
      vincristine, cyclophosphamide and prednisone) in patients with CD20-positive diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), transformed follicular lymphoma or Burkitt lymphoma positive for Myc
      gene rearrangement (Myc+). Filgrastim or peg-filgrastim is also included with each cycle of
      R-EPOCH. Once we identify the MTD, an expansion cohort limited to the Myc+ DLBCL population
      will be opened to further characterize clinical activity and safety.

      Secondary objectives include estimates of complete response rate (CR) and progression free
      survival (PFS). We will also explore for associations between baseline kinome signatures
      and/or RNA sequencing and CR, and identify differential kinome and transcriptome prior to and
      during treatment.

    <description>Dose escalation will take place within cohorts. Subjects will receive alisertib tablets twice daily in combination with R-EPOCH chemotherapy on days 1 through 5 of each 21-day cycle. The treatment will be given in 6 cycles. The first 3 patients to be enrolled will receive a 20 milligram (mg) dose of alisertib. The dose of alisertib will be increased or decreased as more subjects enter the study. Each dose level will be evaluated for safety and tolerability before the next higher dose is given. The dose levels will be modified until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Once the MTD has been established, enrollment into that cohort will continue with up to a maximum of 24 patients total enrolled into the study.</description>
