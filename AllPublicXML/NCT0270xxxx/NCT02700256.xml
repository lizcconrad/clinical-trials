      The purpose of this pilot study is to find out if patients are willing to self-report
      symptoms in the first 5 days following discharge, or when they leave the hospital after
      &quot;ambulatory surgery&quot; (&quot;ambulatory surgery&quot; is when the patient has surgery and then goes home
      within 24 hours).

    <description>A patient will be deemed a &quot;responder&quot; if they complete at least 5 of the 8 symptom items on at least 3 days postoperatively. The symptom assessment method will be deemed successful if 32 of the 50 patients respond.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete a baseline survey after enrollment. After surgery, enrollees who opt for the email/online access will receive an email upon discharge with a link to the WebCore site. Email will be sent at 9 am on postoperative day (POD) 2 to the email address the patient provided at consent. On post-operative days 2 through 6 the patient will be asked to complete a symptom inventory, they will receive an email with a link to the WebCore website, where they will be able to complete that day's survey. Enrollees who opt for the automated phone calls will complete their surveys via Interactive Voice Response (IVR), which will be automatically set-up to call the patient at 9 am on POD 2. Patients will complete phone surveys daily for 5 days. If the first phone call does not connect to the patient, a second phone call will be made at 10:00am. If the second call is unsuccessful a third &amp; final call for that day will be placed at 11:00am.</description>
