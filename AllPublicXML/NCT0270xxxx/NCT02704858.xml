  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NEO100-01 is a Phase 1/2A study of the monoterpene, perillyl alcohol (NEO100)in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma. NEO100 is delivered four times a day by intranasal administration
      using a nebulizer and nasal mask for up to 6 months. Four escalating doses will be evaluated
      for tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose will be extended in the 2A phase for a total
      of 25 patients. There is no concurrent control. This is the first nasal administration in the
      US, after prior oral studies with perillyl alcohol proved ineffective. Nasal administration
      of perillyl alcohol is on-going in Brazil
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perillyl alcohol has previously been tested in 15 clinical studies in &gt; 600 subjects This
      includes 13 studies in 255 subjects using oral administration sponsored by the National
      Cancer Institute and two studies in &gt; 350 subjects using intranasal administration in Brazil.
      NEO100 is a highly purified (&gt;99%) form of perillyl alcohol. Studies in Brazil suggest
      improved survival for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Doses of 96 mg qid, 144mg qid,
      192mg qid, and 288 mg qid administered intranasally to patients with recurrent GBM for up to
      6 months, disease progression or death. From 3 to 6 patients will be evaluated after first
      cycle (28 days) until MTD is reached. MRI with gadolinium will be at base line, and at the
      beginning of even cycles. A total of 25 patients will be treated at the MTD. PK studies will
      be conducted during Phase 1 at first dosing, and after first dose of 3rd cycle.
