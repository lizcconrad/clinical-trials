  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing
      (CAD/CAM) and semi-custom insole types on pain, quality of life and physical performance and
      also to decide whether they are necessary in treatment of painful flexible flatfoot.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity Measured by 100 mm Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The scale scores the pain intensity with 0 and 100 mm, minimum and maximum levels.
Higher score means worse pain and also negative changes mean reduced pain. Participants were asked to rate the maximum level of foot pain they had in the last week.
Changes were calculated as the difference between 8-week follow-up and baseline results.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life Assessed With Short Form-36 Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The scale scores the health related quality of life with 0 and 100, minimum and maximum levels.
Each question is scored between 0-100 and the total score is found by dividing to number of question.
Higher score or positive change mean better quality of life in the scale. We used physical health part of it.
Changes were calculated as the difference between 8-week follow-up and baseline results.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Balance Was Assessed With a Dynamic Platform</measure>
    <time_frame>In the same session after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic platform was the equipment used in balance assessment. Participants were assessed after using the insoles for 8 weeks in order to get compliance.
Measurements were taken in the same day with and without insoles in shoes. The software calculates balance value between 0 and 5 that lower value means better balance score.
Difference between with and without insole was calculated by subtracting the result with insole from the result without insole.
Therefore, negative changes mean better balance score with insole.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Six-minute Walk Physiological Cost Index Was Calculated</measure>
    <time_frame>In the same session after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physiological cost index was calculated by taking heart rate with finger oximeter and walking distance after a six-minute walk test.
The result is calculated by dividing one minute heart rate (beat) to walking distance (meter).
Lower values mean better physiological cost. Participants were assessed after using the insoles for 8 weeks in order to get compliance.
Measurements were taken in the same day with and without insoles in shoes. Difference between with and without insole was calculated by subtracting the result with insole from the result without insole.
Therefore, negative changes mean better score with insole.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Vertical Jump Height Was Measured With a Special Mat</measure>
    <time_frame>In the same session after 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sensor mat was used in vertical jump measurement. The result is the distance (cm) that was jumped vertically and it is normalized by dividing the distance to length of subject in order to get percentage of jump distance.
Higher values mean better vertical jump performance. Participants were assessed after using the insoles for 8 weeks in order to get compliance.
Measurements were taken in the same day with and without insoles in shoes. Difference between with and without insole was calculated by subtracting the result with insole from the result without insole.
Therefore, positive changes mean better score with insole.</description>

Difference between with and without insole was calculated by subtracting the result with insole from the result without insole.
Therefore, negative changes mean better balance score with insole.</description>

        <title>Vertical Jump Height Was Measured With a Special Mat</title>
        <description>Sensor mat was used in vertical jump measurement. The result is the distance (cm) that was jumped vertically and it is normalized by dividing the distance to length of subject in order to get percentage of jump distance.
Higher values mean better vertical jump performance. Participants were assessed after using the insoles for 8 weeks in order to get compliance.
Measurements were taken in the same day with and without insoles in shoes. Difference between with and without insole was calculated by subtracting the result with insole from the result without insole.
Therefore, positive changes mean better score with insole.</description>

Semi-custom Insole: Plantar surfaces of each patient’s metatarsophalangeal joints were marked with a thick broad marker, and the participants were asked to stand on a clean paper. The borders of the foot were then drawn, and the medial longitudinal arch length was marked from the anterior aspect of the heel to the first metatarsophalangeal joint.
