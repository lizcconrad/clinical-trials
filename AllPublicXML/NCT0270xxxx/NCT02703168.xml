    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up study with patients, who participated in the Straumann clinical study
      CR06/03. The objective is the assessment of long-term data (8 and 10 years after
      implantation) on the performance of immediate and early (28-34 days post implantation)
      non-occlusal loaded Straumann Tissue Level Implants with SLActive surface when used to
      support single crowns or 2-4 unit fixed dental prostheses in the posterior maxilla and
      mandible.

      The primary objective is of the study is to analyse the change in crestal bone levels 8 and
      10 years post-surgery compared to 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years post-surgery in the
      immediate and early loading group.

      This is a prospective, post-market, open label, follow-up multicenter study with patients who
      participated in the Straumann clinical study CR06/03. The total study duration for each
      patient should be 2 years.

      In total 2 visits are scheduled in this study. Bone level changes, implant success and
      survival, performance of the restorative components, and adverse events (AEs) will be
      assessed.

      The study device is a CE-marked product and FDA approved.

      Three centres, one in Portugal and two in Germany, will participate.

    <description>To evaluate the changes in crestal bone levels (in millimetre) in relation to defined implant reference point and different time points (between baseline at implant insertion and follow-up time points at 8 and 10 years after implant insertion) in the maxilla and mandible of the immediate and early loading groups.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the implant survival rate by clinically and radiographically count of implants still in place in the subject's jaw bone at the time of assessment (8 and 10 years post-surgery). The implant survival rates will be compared between the treatment groups (immediate loading and early loading).</description>
