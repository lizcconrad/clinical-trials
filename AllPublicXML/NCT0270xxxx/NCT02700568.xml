    <textblock>
      Aim of the FavorAx study is to evaluate preliminary efficacy and safety of Axitinib in
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with favorable IMDC prognostic factors who had
      progressed on sunitinib or pazopanib in the first-line setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Axitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor,
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Î±, and c-kit. The trial of comparative effectiveness
      of axitinib versus sorafenib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (AXIS) was an international
      randomized Phase III study designed for registration purposes. This trial randomized 723
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with any prognostic features to axitinib or
      sorafenib in the second-line setting and demonstrated significant clinical benefit of
      axitinib.

      Aim of present FavorAx study is to evaluate preliminary efficacy and safety of Axitinib in
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients with favorable IMDC prognostic factors who had
      progressed on sunitinib or pazopanib in the first-line setting.

        Principle Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic confirmation of Renal cell carcinoma with a clear cell component

          -  Patients must have measurable disease

          -  Previous treatment with sunitinib or pazopanib

          -  Favorable prognosis according to IMDC criteria

          -  Must have available tumor tissue for submission

          -  Subjects must also meet various laboratory parameters for inclusion

          -  Patients must give written informed consent prior to initiation of therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any underlying medical condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator, will make
             the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse
             events

          -  Patients who have history of uncompensated diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that
             might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at
             high risk from treatment complications.
