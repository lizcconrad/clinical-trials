    <textblock>
      This is a pre-Phase 1 prospective, non interventional clinical assessment study to evaluate
      XLMTM subjects aged 3 years and younger. Many of these clinically relevant measures have not
      yet been routinely assessed in this population and may provide important insight on the
      natural history of XLMTM and for future evaluation of potential therapies.

          -  Subject is male

          -  Subject is aged less than 4 years

          -  Subject requires some mechanical ventilatory support (eg, ranging from 24 hours per
             day full time mechanical ventilation, to noninvasive support such as continuous
             positive airway pressure [CPAP] or bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP] during
             sleeping hours)

          -  Access to subject's medical records

          -  Signed informed consent by the parent(s) or legally authorized representative(s) (LAR)
             (when applicable)

          -  Subject and parent(s) or LAR are willing and able to comply with study visits and
             study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is participating in an interventional study designed to treat XLMTM

          -  Subject born &lt;35 weeks gestation who is still not to term as per corrected age

          -  Subject has a clinically important condition, or life-threatening disease other than
             XLMTM, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Subject has received pyridostigmine or any medication to treat XLMTM within 30 days of
             enrollment
