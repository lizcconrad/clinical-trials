  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various centers around the world are currently investigating the feasibility and yield of
      surveillance for pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals. Evidence is beginning to
      accumulate that surveillance may lead to the early detection of non-invasive precursor
      lesions and asymptomatic early stage cancer. Ultimately, the goal of surveillance is to
      reduce mortality in these high risk individuals, but before this can be confirmed many
      research questions need to be answered. While the numbers of high-risk individuals screened
      in each separate screening facility are likely too small to properly address many of these
      questions, pooling data comprises a sizable sample size providing unique research
      opportunities. The objective of this study is retrospectively review all cases of high-risk
      individuals participating in our pancreatic surveillance program in whom 1) a suspicious
      precursor lesions was detected for which a pancreatic resection was performed and 2) in whom
      an advanced malignant disease was diagnosed. The de-identified information will be entered
      into an international multicenter database registry.
