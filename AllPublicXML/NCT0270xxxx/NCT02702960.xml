    <textblock>
      This trial is a phase II, single arm, open-label, single center study to assess a
      reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, bone marrow transplantation and high dose PTCy in
      recipients of a partial liver allograft from a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched or
      -haploidentical living related donor in patients with HCC.

      The primary objective of this trial is to characterize recurrence-free survival at 1 year
      following bone marrow transplantation among recipients of prior partial liver transplantation
      from the same donor.

      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of sequential
      partial liver transplantation followed by bone marrow transplantation from the same living
      related donor. This treatment applies to patients whose cancer remains confined to the liver
      but is too widespread to be removed by surgery or treated by a liver transplant from a
      deceased donor. The purpose of this combined treatment is to reduce the risk of the cancer
      coming back after the liver transplant The bone marrow transplant may reduce the risk of
      cancer relapse in two ways. First, patients who have combined bone marrow and solid organ
      transplants may be able to get off all anti-rejection drugs, which inhibit the immune system
      from destroying cancer cells. Second, the donor's bone marrow contains cells of the immune
      system, which can attack any cancer cells that remain after the liver transplant.

      This trial is a phase II, single arm, open-label, single center pilot study to assess a
      reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, bone marrow transplantation and high dose
      post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in recipients of a partial liver allograft from
      a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched or -haploidentical living related donor in patients
      with HCC. The trial includes analyses of tumor characteristics and the number and phenotype
      of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the explanted tumor. The trial also includes periodic
      monitoring of circulating hepatocytes to correlate with tumor response.

      The study is expected to take two years to complete accrual of six patients, and the primary
      objective of this trial is to characterize recurrence-free survival at 1 year following bone
      marrow transplantation among recipients of prior partial liver transplantation from the same
      donor. Secondary objectives include documenting percentage of patients who become tolerant of
      the transplanted liver, i.e. off immunosuppression for &gt;6 months without biochemical evidence
      of liver rejection, and characterizing the relationship between donor chimerism and
      transplantation tolerance.

        RECIPIENT

          1. Histologic diagnosis of liver-confined fibrolamellar or non-fibrolamellar HCC.
             Ineligible for curative resection or deceased donor liver transplantation by virtue of
             NOT meeting the Milan criteria or down-staging criteria:

               1. Single viable tumor ≤5 cm in size or ≤3 tumors each ≤3 cm in size based on CT or
                  Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging

               2. Pretransplant alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level of ≤400.

          2. Available human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched or -haploidentical, living related
             donor who is willing to donate bone marrow and part of liver. The donor and recipient
             must be HLA identical for at least one allele (using high resolution DNA based typing)
             at the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1. Fulfilment of this
             criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share
             one HLA haplotype.

          3. Age 16 to 65 years.

          4. Normal estimated left ventricular ejection fraction ( &gt;30% ) and no history of
             ischemic heart disease requiring revascularization, unless cleared by a cardiologist
             (as per normal liver and bone marrow (BM) transplant eligibility requirements). Those
             with an ejection fraction between 30-40%, will require a cardiology consultation and
             clearance for transplantation.

          5. Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt; 40% of predicted at

          7. For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with
             sensitivity less than 50 milli-International unit (mIU)/m within 72 hours before the

          8. Use of two forms of contraception with less than a 5% failure rate or abstinence by
             all transplanted participants for 12 months after the first dose of study therapy. For
             the first 60 days post-transplant, recipients should be encouraged to use non-hormonal
             contraceptives due to the potential adverse effect of hormones on bone marrow
             engraftment.

          9. Ability to receive oral medication.

         10. Ability to understand and provide informed consent.

        DONOR:

          1. HLA-matched or -haploidentical, parent, child, sibling, or half-sibling of the
             recipient

          2. Meets all requirements for live liver donation based on established criteria

          3. Ability to understand and provide informed consent for all study procedures including
             partial liver transplant and bone marrow harvest.

          3. Anti-donor HLA antibody with a level that produces a positive test on flow cytometric
             crossmatch. [Note: patients with a positive flow cytometric crossmatch may undergo
             desensitization and may become eligible, at the discretion of the protocol
             investigators, if desensitization decreases the antibody concentration to a level that
             produces a negative flow cytometric crossmatch.]

          4. Ineligible for liver transplantation per institutional criteria (see Appendix 1)

          5. Women who are breastfeeding.

          6. History of positive HIV-1 or HIV-2 serologies or nucleic acid test.

          3. History of blood product donation to the recipient

          4. Significant cardiovascular disease (per cardiology consultation)

          5. Significant pulmonary disease (per pulmonology consultation)

          6. Significant renal disease

          7. History of diabetes mellitus

          8. Ongoing malignancies

         15. Positive HBV PCR

         16. Positive anti-hepatitis C (HCV) antibodies and a positive serum HCV RNA PCR. All
             positive HCV antibody results must be assessed by an electroimmunoassay enzyme-linked
             immunosorbent assay (EIA) assay and confirmed by a quantitative serum HCV RNA assay.
             Participants with positive HCV antibodies but undetectable serum HCV RNA may be
             considered for eligibility. Participants with negative anti-HCV antibodies but
             unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities must undergo a quantitative serum RNA assay to
             rule out false negative HCV serologies.

         17. Autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive drugs for maintenance.

         18. The presence of any medical condition that the Investigator deems incompatible with
             participation in the trial.
