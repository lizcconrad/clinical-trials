  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study aims to explore intrapleural low-dose Visudyne®-mediated photodynamic
      therapy (photo-induction) as a pathway to promote the uptake of systemically administered
      Lipoplatin™ in pleural malignancies of patients undergoing video-assisted talcage for their
      malignant pleural effusions. Photo-induction is expected to overcome the chemo-resistance of
      pleural malignancies for cisplatin-based chemotherapeutics and thereby improve local tumor
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intrapleural
      Visudyne®-mediated photo-induction as a means to selectively increase tumor uptake of
      systemically administered Lipoplatin™ in patients with primary or secondary pleural
      malignancies.

      The secondary objectives are:

      Assessment of treatment efficacy as measured by dyspnea reduction, pleural effusion free
      survival as well as local relapse rate, progression free and median overall survival.

      Analysis of the pleural intratumor penetration of Lipoplatin™ by repeated biopsies for
      Lipoplatin concentration measurements before and after Visudyne® treatment as well as vessel
      modulation related parameters (pericyte coverage, vessels morphology).

    <description>200 mg/m2 Lipoplatin™ will be delivered as iv perfusion. Then, intrapleural photo-induction will be realized through a classical video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) approach using 3 mg/m2 Visudyne® activated at 689 nm. At the end of the procedure, the patients will receive chemical pleurodesis by VATS as per standard-of-care treatment for malignant pleural effusion.</description>
