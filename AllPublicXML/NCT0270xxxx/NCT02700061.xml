  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the effects of upper limb training with
      Induced Constraint Therapy (ICT) or robotic therapy. No placebo therapy is used. Motor
      function, neurological evaluations and quality of life are assessed for the comparison of the
      therapies.

      The trial is being carried out in the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of
      the University of São Paulo since February 2012. The investigators are including patients
      with clinical diagnosis of Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.

      The patients are being randomized in blocks of four, six and eight, in two arms: ICT:
      patients are undergoing 60 minutes physiotherapy and occupational therapy twice a week for
      ten consecutive weeks. Other therapeutic services as phonoaudiology, psychology, nutrition,
      physical conditioning are prescribed upon the patients' medical demands. After the 10 weeks,
      the patients are undergoing two whole weeks of daily ICT as to reach 90% of the time under
      constraint, including weekends. During this last period, no other therapeutic service is
      offered, but the occupational therapy under ICT. Patients are not allowed to undergo robotic
      therapy.

      Robotic therapy: patients are undergoing robotic occupational therapy for 60 minutes, three
      times a week for twelve consecutive weeks. All other therapeutic services are prescribed upon
      the patients' medical demands. Patients are not allowed to undergo ICT.

      The investigator and the raters are blind to treatment.

      The evaluations are done prior to the beginning of the treatment and at the end of it. The
      follow up assessments are done at 3 and 12 months after the end of the treatment.

      The sample size was estimated to be 62 patients in each arm, a total size of 124 patients
