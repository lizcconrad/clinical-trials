    <textblock>
      This study mainly evaluate the clinical effect of Apatinib in the treatment of patients with
      pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.Half of participants will receive Apatinib
      and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapy in combination,while the other
      half will receive TACE therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib is a VEGFR targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has preliminary demonstrated
      the efficacy and safety in treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma by phase II stage
      research. Pulmonary metastasis of hepatocellular cancer is one of the difficulties in
      clinical practice,because it's not sensitive to systemic chemotherapy.This phase Ⅲ study aims
      to evaluates the efficacy and safety of the Apatinib in the treatment of advanced
      hepatocellular cancer with pulmonary metastasis.
