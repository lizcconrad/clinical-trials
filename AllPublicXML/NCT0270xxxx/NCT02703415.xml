  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of acute pain is one of the most important tasks of perioperative pediatric
      anesthesia. The alleviation of pain has been defined by the Society of Pediatric Anesthesia,
      on its 15th annual meeting as a basic human right, irrespective of age, treatment primary
      service responsible for the patient care. Pro-inflammatory cytokines increased by surgical
      trauma indirectly modulate pain through the release of substances like nitric oxide, oxygen
      free radicals, prostaglandins, and excitatory amino acids, inducing peripheral and central
      sensitivity and hyperalgesia. There has been growing interest in determining the possible
      immune consequences of analgesic administration for the management of postoperative pain

      60 children aged 3-10 years undergoing lower abdominal surgery will be randomized into 2
      groups (30 patients in each group) to receive caudal block with bupivacaine (0.25%) 1mg/kg
      (group 1) plus tramadol 1mg/kg (group 2) just after the induction of general anesthesia
      without premedication. All children will be assessed for the post operative immune response
      by measuring interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10) and Tumour Necrosing Factor-α (TNF-α)
      using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique one hour preoperatively and three
      hours after incision.
