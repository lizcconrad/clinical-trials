      The study analyses if cognition and gait speed can predict falls in a community-dwelling
      people and ambulant long term care residents
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are some of the most common events among elderly people. The odds of recurrent falls
      increase every year, which can cause impairment in basic activities of daily living, social
      isolation, fear of falling again and death. The aim of the present study is to analyze the
      role of cognition and gait speed as predictors to falls in institutionalized and
      non-institutionalized elderly people.

      Methods:Twenty-five individuals living in a long-term care facility and 25
      non-institutionalized individuals participated in the study. A questionnaire about their
      history of falls, tests to evaluate cognition (global and executive function) and a pedometer
      with an accelerometer to measure kinematic variables were applied.
