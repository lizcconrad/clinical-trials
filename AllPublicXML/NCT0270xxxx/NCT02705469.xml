        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males age ≥ 18 years

          2. Metastatic, castrate resistant, histologically confirmed prostate cancer; surgically
             castrated or continuous medical castration for ≥ 8 weeks prior to screening

          3. Serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL determined within 4 weeks of first administration of
             study drug

          4. Prior progression on one or more androgen-receptor/androgen-synthesis inhibitor
             therapies (e.g. abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, TAK-700 and/or galeterone) by
             Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria. Prior progression on
             bicalutamide/nilutamide/flutamide/ketoconazole alone is not allowed.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          6. Adequate laboratory parameters [absolute neutrophil (ANC), platelets, aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, creatinine
             and coagulation parameters] at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any history of brain metastases or prior seizure or conditions predisposing to seizure
             activity

          2. Have previously received an investigational BET inhibitor (including previous
             participation in this study or Study ZEN003694-002)

          3. Have received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy or investigational therapy within 2
             weeks or five half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to the first administration of
             study drug

          4. Failure to recover to Grade 1 or lower toxicity related to prior systemic therapy
             (excluding alopecia and neuropathy) prior to study entry

          5. Radiation therapy within 2 weeks of first administration of study drug

          6. Have received prior chemotherapy in the metastatic castration-resistant setting (prior
             chemotherapy in the hormone-sensitive setting is allowed provided last dose was at
             least 6 months prior to study entry)

          7. Currently receiving medications known to be strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4
             with a narrow therapeutic window. Strong inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 with narrow
             therapeutic ranges must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to the first
             administration of study drug.
