      Virtual Occupational Therapy Application (VOTA) combines low-cost human motion tracking,
      commercial game engine technology, and evidence-based Occupational Therapy (OT) practice in a
      computer-based virtual world in which stroke patients practice activities of daily living
      (ADLs). The protocol investigates the efficacy of VOTA therapy for Upper Extremity (UE) motor
      recovery and assesses system usability and user acceptance.

    <description>All enrolled subjects are in this arm. After pre-assessment subjects have an 8-week waiting period, after which a mid-assessment takes place. Subject then participate in VOTA therapy for 8 weeks, followed by a post-assessment . The pre-/mid-assessment difference is used to control for spontaneous recovery. The mid-/post-assessment difference is used to ascertain efficacy.</description>

    <intervention_name>VOTA Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>During sessions of approximately one hour in duration, participants practice performing virtual activities of daily living (ADLs) using the VOTA system. During this practice, the participant's real-world motion is replicated by an avatar's motion in the virtual world. To complete the activities, participant's must perform a wide range of functional arm movements while interacting with virtual objects. Individuals are asked to perform three such one-hour virtual ADL practice sessions per week over a participation period of approximately eight weeks.</description>

          -  Time since last stroke at least 3 months;

          -  Participant has antigravity strength at the elbow to at least 45 degrees of active
             flexion in the stroke affected arm;

          -  Participant has antigravity shoulder strength to at least 30 degrees each in active
             flexion, abduction/adduction, and 15 degrees in active rotation from an upright seated
