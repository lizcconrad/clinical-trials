    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, non-randomised, open label clinical study to assess the safety of
      the Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved (PV) conduit (PV-001) in subjects &gt; 2 years and &lt; 22 years
      of age, undergoing Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) reconstruction. It is a first in
      man feasibility study which will include 10-12 patients in up to 6 sites in Europe.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the survival rate of subjects at 6 months
      following implantation of the Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved Conduit (PV-001).

      Secondary objectives:

        1. The survival rate of subjects at 12 months following implantation of the Bioabsorbable
           Pulmonary Valved Conduit (PV-001)

        2. The percentage of conduit failure at 6 months and 12 months, where conduit failure
           includes the need for reintervention or reoperation.

        3. The pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve will have an acceptable level at 12
           months follow up.

        4. The pulmonary regurgitation measured will not exceed a moderate grading at 12 months
           follow up.

        5. To evaluate the usability of the Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved Conduit (PV-001) during
           the surgical procedure, using exploratory parameters

      Long term safety will be assessed up to 60 months post implantation.

    <description>The Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved (PV) Conduit (PV-001) is a polymer-based medical device, with a total length of 8 cm with inner diameters of 16 or 18 mm. The valve itself is formed by three leaflets, incorporated within the conduit wall.
The PV conduit is used for correction or reconstruction of the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) in patients with any of the following congenital heart malformations:
Tetralogy of Fallot
Truncus Arteriosus
Pulmonary Atresia
Transposition of Great Arteries with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)
Pulmonary Stenosis in combination with other defects in congenital heart defect (CHD) syndromes
The PV conduit can also be used for replacement of previously implanted, but dysfunctional, pulmonary homografts or valved conduits.</description>
