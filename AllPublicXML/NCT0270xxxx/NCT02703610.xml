      To perform a randomized, double blind 2-arm clinical trial of the comparative efficacy of 2
      oral analgesics in the the management of acute pain in elderly patients who present and then
      are discharged from the ED.. The 2 groups are as follows:

        1. Oxycodone/acetaminophen (5/325)

        2. Ibuprofen/acetaminophen (400/500)
