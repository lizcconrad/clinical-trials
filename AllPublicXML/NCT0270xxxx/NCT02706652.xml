  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      People's genetic markers and other genetic characteristics can affect their response to drug
      therapy. Researchers want to screen people for these markers and characteristics. They want
      to do this before the people are screened for studies at the National Cancer Institute. That
      should save time that can be lost when people go through the whole screening for a study only
      to find out they cannot join. The data collected may also be used to select the proper dose
      of anticancer agents that are being studied.

      Objective:

      To screen people for genetic markers and/or baseline characteristics. These will be used to
      determine if they can enroll in a clinical trial. They may also be used to select the proper
      dose of anticancer agents that are being tested.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 and older who are being considered for or being treated in a National Cancer
      Institute study

      Design:

      Participants will have their blood drawn for genetic tests.

      Some participants will have a cheek swab.

      Participants genetic data will be stored for future research. It could be shared with other
      researchers.

      Background:

        -  Genetic sequence of drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters/receptors, transcription
           factors, drug targets, and patient baseline characteristics often affect an individual s
           response to drug therapy. Expression of such genes is also influenced by the epigenome
           and regulation by a variety of other factors: RNA expression, protein expression,
           disease state, comorbidities, concomitant therapies, etc. Therefore, inter-patient
           variability in drug pharmacokinetics and outcome is often a function of these factors.

        -  Inter-individual differences in efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy are
           especially important given the narrow therapeutic index of these drugs.

        -  During analysis of investigational agents, inter-individual variability in
           pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical outcome, and toxicity are often noted. Many
           of these differences are potentially clinically actionable and depend on the
           aforementioned markers.

      Objectives:

      - To screen patients for genomic markers, epigenomic markers, RNA markers, protein markers,
      and/or baseline characteristics that are used inform either enrollment in therapeutic
      clinical trials or dose selection of investigational anticancer agents.

      Eligibility:

      - All individuals seeking enrollment on National Cancer Institute clinical trials that
      include a priori assessment of a patients genome, epigenome, proteome, or baseline
      characteristics as eligibility criteria for enrollment or dose selection.

      Design:

        -  This study will be used as a screening protocol to enroll patients for a priori
           screening that is necessary for inclusion in IRB-approved clinical trials taking place
           at the NCI.

        -  As the rationale for ascertaining the status of a marker prior to study inclusion will
           be presented in the associated clinical trial, the present study will be amended on a
           case-by-case basis.

        -  The accrual ceiling for this study is 900 patients.
