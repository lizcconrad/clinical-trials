      The proposed study seeks to establish the feasibility of universal screening for depression
      in an adult primary care safety net setting, measure the effectiveness of a culturally
      appropriate depression education intervention to reduce stigma and increase uptake in
      depression treatment among Hispanics, and implement a Measurement-Based Integrated Care
      (MBIC) model with collaborative, multi-disciplinary treatment and culturally tailored care
      management strategies.

      Specific Aim 1: Examine the specific effects of a Depression Education Fotonovela (DEF) to
      increase knowledge of depression, reduce stigma and increase engagement in depression
      treatment among Hispanic patients.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of Measurement-Based Integrated Care (MBIC) for the
      treatment of depression in one community-based Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) in
      North Texas whose patient population is majority Hispanic.

      Specific Aim 3: Examine the feasibility of universal screening and accurate detection of
      depression among adult primary care patients utilizing innovative iPad Depression Screening
      technology.
