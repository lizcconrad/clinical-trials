    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further clarify existing research on the early identification
      and documentation of suspected deep tissue injury (sDTI). Basic principles of physiology
      along with prior research suggests that sDTI has quantifiable amounts of heat (or lack
      thereof) relative to surrounding tissue that will exhibit characteristic thermal signatures
      (temperature). These signatures will be measured and quantitatively recorded using long-wave
      infrared thermography (LWIT) to not only identify sDTI, but to also learn more about their
      pathophysiological evolution. Additionally, the LWIT physiological data will be
      cross-compared to the gold standard of visual assessment and other current standards of wound
      evaluation.
