  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to establish whether ultrafiltration by peritoneal dialysis is a clinically
      effective treatment for patients with severe heart failure and moderate chronic kidney
      disease, thus improving quality of life and symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a multi-centre, prospective, randomised, unblended, controlled trial of
      intermittent PD with a single daily exchange of icodextrin plus best standard care versus
      best standard care for the treatment of severe HF and moderate CKD. A second exchange with
      glucose based solution may be given, should it be required in the investigator's/clinician's
      opinion. Investigators will randomise 130 participants for 32 weeks with randomisation
      stratified by participating centre. Participants will be recruited from specialist-led
      outpatient HF services in 6 NHS trusts and be managed by both cardiologists and
      nephrologists.

      PD catheter insertion will occur according to the participating centre's institutional
      protocol. Treatment begins 1 week after catheter insertion and consists of a single nightly
      exchange.

    <description>One week after insertion of a PD catheter the intervention group will received a single nightly exchange, using dialysis fluid containing icodextrin; a variable proportion of participants may require a second exchange as directed by the consultant nephrologist as part of routine care. The second exchange would use dialysis fluid containing glucose, not icodextrin. Support and training will be given to each participant by the PD specialist team.</description>
