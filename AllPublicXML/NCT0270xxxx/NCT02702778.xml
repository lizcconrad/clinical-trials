  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A four-week, randomized, controlled, open-label trial of DR prednisone in which patients
      receive in period 1 one of three-night time doses of treatment (4mg, 7mg or 10mg) for two
      weeks followed in period 2 by treatment with 15mg IR prednisone in the morning for two weeks.
      Period 1 is randomized and open-label and period 2 is open label. Before enrollment and
      randomization patient diagnosis and responsiveness to 15mg IR prednisone in the morning is
      established. 45 patients will be randomized, 15 patients in each treatment arm.

         12. Significant renal disease (creatinine greater than150 Âµmol/L)

         13. Significant hepatic impairment (ALT/AST greater than twice upper limit of normal)

         14. Immunization with live vaccines within 8 weeks before the first administration of the
             study drug or plan to have an immunization with a live vaccine within 2 weeks after
