      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the Low-frequency Rotating
      Magnetic Therapy System(with systemic anti-tumor therapy) compared to systemic anti-tumor
      therapy in patients suffering from advanced lung cancer.

    <intervention_name>Low-frequency Rotating Magnetic Therapy System</intervention_name>
    <description>Two pairs of fan-shaped NdFeB permanent magnets were attached to a circular iron plate and arranged to establish magnetic field. The bottom two magnets rotated at certain frequency driven by a step motor, which was controlled using a functional signal generator. The top two magnets rotated synchronously due to the strong magnetic interaction. Magnetic flux density was measured at the target site using a gauss meter. The entire magnetic apparatus was located in a hood with humidity and temperature controller.</description>

    <intervention_name>Systemic anti-tumor therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Systemic anti-tumor therapy includes targeted therapies, chemotherapy and best supportive care, according to NCCN non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer(SCLC) guidelines. SCLC patients will receive six cycles of cisplatin and etoposide. NSCLC patients will receive EGFR and ALK test. With sensitive result the first-line therapy will be Erlotinib/Gefitinib/Crizotinib. If insensitive, the patient will receive six cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed. Then the patient will receive tumor response evaluation. The patient with response or stable disease will receive maintenance therapy with one or some of the drugs including bevacizumab, pemetrexed, gemcitabine and docetaxel until disease progression. During experience all patients will receive clinical observation. Once proven for disease progression the patient will finish the experiment.</description>
