  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young female counselees (18-30 years) belonging to HBOC families with a known mutation on
      BRCA-genes or not, receive a lot of information regarding their cancer risk. Information
      sources are numerous and sometimes contradictory. Unfortunately, these women face these
      issues at a key moment of there identity construction (self, relationship, sexuality) while
      they are not yet concerned by health prevention measures. A special psychoeducational
      intervention was designed to help these women to better cope with these difficulties.

      Intervention consists in a week-end session in a thermal center (SPA) during which they will
      attend short conferences given by specialists (prevention measures, prophylactic surgery,
      assisted procreation, epidemiology...) and participate to role games and group sharing.

      Intervention will be evaluated using self-questionnaires completed before intervention and
      during the following year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Young women exposed to a high hereditary breast/ovaries cancer (HBOC) risk are
      particularly vulnerable: they are ignored by health prevention measures; they are embedded in
      a stream of contradictory information ( medicine, media, internet); they may feel concerned
      by surgical prevention issues at a key moment of there identity construction (self,
      relationship, sexuality). A special psychoeducational intervention was designed to help these
      women to better cope with these difficulties.

      Methods/design: the study consists in a prospective randomized trial including childless
      young female counselees (18-30 years) of CCC Jean Perrin oncogenetics department, belonging
      to HBOC families either BRCA-mutated or not. They will be invited to attend a weekend group
      session in a SPA resort and participate to a series of short expert conferences and to focus
      group activities (group sharing, Moreno role game) supervised by a psychotherapist. Two
      sessions separated by a 6-month delay (waiting list) will enable us to evaluate the
      intervention effect, by comparing the evolution of questionnaires scores between inclusion
      and 6-month post-intervention. Main end-point is an increase of the Hert Hope Inventory of at
      least one standard deviation. Secondary endpoints investigate self-esteem, anxiety-trait,
      anxiety-state, ways of coping and quality of life. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the
      first or the second session so that groups are comparable. Session will be cost-free for
      participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in expectations measured using the Hert Hope Inventory questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>changes of global score from baseline to 6-month post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Hert Hope Inventory global score [Herth, 1992, 2000] is used to evaluate expectations of participants. It contains only 12 simple proposals quoted using a 4-point Likert scale ranking from 1 = &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to 4 = &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Its internal structure is composed of three dimensions: temporality and future, positive readiness and expectancy, and social/spiritual connectedness [Farran, 1995]. This questionnaire has been translated and validated in French by Lafrance [2013].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dimensions of coping evaluated by the Ways of Coping Checklist (WCC) [Folkman, 1980].</measure>
    <time_frame>inclusion - 6-month post-intervention - 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The WCC French version contains 27 items quoted by Likert scales (answers within &quot;no&quot;, &quot;rather no&quot;, &quot;rather yes&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;). Three specific dimensions are described:
the focus on the problem
the focus on emotions
the search for social support Dimensions will be used separately using their scores as no global score can be calculated (dimensions are divergent). This questionnaire has been validated in French in 1996 by Bruchon-Schweitzer et al.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dimensions of perceived control measured using the Internal Powerful others and Chance scale (IPC) [Levenson, 1973].</measure>
    <time_frame>inclusion - 6-month post-intervention - 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Control of IPC tests two locus of control: either in the self, or outside with two origins: fate/luck and &quot;powerful others&quot;. Scores qualifying each locus of control will be used for statistics. This 24-item scale has been validated in French by Loas et al. [1994].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of Anxiety, either fundamental (as a trait of character) or superficial (depending on circumstances) evaluated by the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI A-B) [Spielberger, 1983]</measure>
    <time_frame>inclusion - 6-month post-intervention - 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI A-B questionnaire evaluates anxiety in a way it cannot be confused with depressive syndrome. It comprises 40 items rated on a 4-point scale from &quot;almost never&quot; to &quot;almost always&quot;. The 20 first ones evaluate the anxiety as a state, that is a labile/contextual form. The last 20 items estimate anxiety as a personality trait, independent of the environment. It has been translated and validated in French by Schweitzer &amp; Paulhan [1990].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score of the Self-Esteem Scale (SES) [Rosenberg, 1965]</measure>
    <time_frame>inclusion - 6-month post-intervention - 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It is a short 10-item questionnaire that evaluates the global self-worth by questioning positive and negative feelings about the self. The uni-dimensionality of the scale has been validated [Gray-Little, 1997]. The global score of the scale will be used as an indicator of self-esteem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subscales and global score of the WHO Quality of life questionnaire ( World Health Organization WHOQOL) [Harper, 1998].</measure>
    <time_frame>inclusion - 6-month post-intervention - 1-year post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is worldwidely used. It contains four main dimensions: physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. These dimensions have been confirmed in the French version by Leplège et al. [2000]. The global QoL score (means of subscales) will also be used for statistics.</description>

    <description>group participating to the first psychoeducational intervention: it consists in a week-end session in a SPA center including several conferences about HBOC familial risk, cancer prevention, prophylactic possibilities (surgery), recommendations about nutrition and physical activity a risk modulators, assisted medical procreation and embryo selection, social support...). Besides conferences, Moreno role games and group sharing are organized under the supervision of a psychotherapist.</description>

    <description>delayed intervention: group participating to the second psychoeducational intervention (6 months later). Intervention is same as in the intervention arm but it is delayed. Because questionnaires are completed before this second intervention in both arms and allocation to arms are randomized, it represents an adequate control group.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>psychoeducation</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will attend conferences where experts present the state of the art in various domains:
Latest knowledge in oncogenetics
Recommendations and morbidity of prophylactic breast surgeries and annexectomy
Epidemiology of HBOC and comparative mortality risks with other syndromes/life habits
How to perform the periodic breast screening
Assisted medical procreation and embryo selection
Importance of nutrition and physical activity as risk modulator
Life habits: how one can increase or lower the cancer risk (tobacco, alcohol...)?
Description of the assistance program (GENAUV) to help counselees exposed to a high cancer risk follow their medical screening.
The remaining time after this information, i.e. about half of the week-end, will comprise group activities, in particular role games (Moreno psychodrama approach) and group sharing under the supervision of a psychotherapist.</description>
