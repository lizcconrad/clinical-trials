      This study is an exploratory open-label clinical trial of Rosuvastatin in patients with
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). This is an outpatient trial with the goal of enrolling 10 evaluable
      adults with genetically confirmed FRDA who are between the ages of 18-65. Subjects will
      receive 10mg of oral Rosuvastatin daily for three months.

    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of children and adults
      for which there is presently no therapy. Much of the current work in FRDA is aimed at finding
      new targets for drug therapies. Recent work at the University of Pennsylvania has discovered
      that serum ApoA-1 protein levels are lower in people with FRDA when compared with control
      levels. ApoA-1 is the main protein found in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and
      individuals with FRDA frequently have low HDL levels; the current study proposes to assess if
      administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for 3 months alters ApoA-1 protein levels in
      FRDA. Although the significance of ApoA-1 levels among FRDA patients is currently unknown,
      this study is proposed as an exploratory study to further examine this protein. If ApoA-1
      protein levels increase over the course of treatment, future studies may additionally focus
      on examining this as a potential therapeutic treatment.
