      This study aims to examine the role of weight gain in adipose tissue immune cell influx and
      development of obesity related cardiometabolic disorders. Adipose tissue-mediated chronic
      systemic inflammation is implicated in the development of cardiometabolic disorders in
      obesity. Therefore, resolution of adipose tissue inflammation may be key to ameliorating
      obesity-associated dyslipidemia, insulin-resistance, and cardiovascular disease.
      Proinflammatory cytokines contribute to the initial influx of immune cells into adipose
      tissue during weight gain. However, mechanisms regulating these cytokines in the adipose
      tissue milieu and the effects of weight gain on adipose tissue are not completely understood.

      The study proposes to investigate the molecular events contributing to increased infiltration
      of macrophages and T-cells into adipose tissue during weight gain. The central hypothesis is
      that in lean subjects (with low body fat mass), healthy fat gain which is associated with
      decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. However, in obesity (high body fat mass),
      adipose tissue is altered, which permits increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and
      further fat gain results in influx of immune cells. To test the hypothesis, adipose tissue
      from well characterized lean (control, with low body fat) and obese individuals (with high
      body fat) at baseline and after a modest 5% weight gain will be used. Adipose tissue samples
      after subsequent weight loss will also be examined.

      For this study, obesity will be defined by body composition rather than body mass index
      (BMI), as several studies have shown that BMI does not adequately define obesity and several
      individuals with normal BMI may indeed have high body fat mass. Individuals with body fat
      content ≤25% for men, &amp; &lt;35% for women) will be considered lean and individuals with body fat
      content &gt;25% for men, ≥35% for women will be considered obese.
