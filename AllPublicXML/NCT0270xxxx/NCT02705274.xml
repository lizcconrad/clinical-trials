  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol S by DRCR.net has shown that receive Ranibizumab as anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor (anti-VEGF) therapy with deferred panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) are non-inferior
      to those in eyes that receive standard prompt PRP therapy, however with some visual
      functional benefits and less complications with Ranibizumab arm.

      Applying Protocol S in real world scenario may add cost burden to the patient as patients
      need about 7 injections per year which will cost the patient about 7000 US dollars a year as
      minimum The primary objective of this protocol is to determine the visual acuity outcomes at
      1 year in eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) using Bevacizumab 1.25 mg
      instead of Ranbizumab to lower the cost burden

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

          -  Presence of PDR which the investigator intends to manage with PRP alone but for which
             PRP can be deferred for at least 4 weeks in the setting of intravitreal Bevacizumab ,
             in the investigator's judgment.

          -  Best corrected Snellen equivalent 20/320 or higher on the day of randomization.

          -  Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and study participant cooperation sufficient to
             administer PRP and obtain adequate fundus photographs and OCT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          -  Myocardial infarction, other acute cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 4
             months prior to randomization

          -  Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to randomization.

          -  For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 3 years.

          -  Tractional retinal detachment involving the macula. -- A tractional retinal detachment
             is not an exclusion if it is outside of the posterior pole (not threatening the
             macula) and in the investigator's judgment, is not a contraindication to intravitreal
             Bevacizumab treatment and also does not preclude deferring PRP for at least 4 weeks in
             the setting of intravitreal Bevacizumab

          -  Macular edema is present that is considered to be related to ocular surgery such as
             cataract extraction orclinical exam and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface
             abnormalities disease (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the
             primary cause of any macular edema.

          -  An ocular condition is present (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, might alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g.,
             retinal vein or artery occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,
             neovascular glaucoma,

          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity
             to 20/40 or worse if eye were otherwise normal).

          -  History of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment at any time in the past 2 months.

          -  History of corticosteroid treatment (intravitreal ) at any time in the past 4 months.

          -  History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or anticipated within the
             next 6 months following randomization.

          -  Exam evidence of severe external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis,
             chalazion, or substantial blepharitis

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma (in investigator's judgment).
