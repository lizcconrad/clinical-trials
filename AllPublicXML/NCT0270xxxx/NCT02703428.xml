      The LUCY Study is a prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center
      post-market study to evaluate the Ovation Abdominal Platform when used in the endovascular
      treatment of female patients.

      The primary endpoint is freedom from access-related vascular complications and freedom from
      AAA-related mortality through 30 days.

      Secondary endpoints of the study will be achieved by demonstrating the benefits in female
      patients despite the fact that historically fewer female patients have been eligible for
      EVAR, and they have experienced a higher rate of access-related complications and higher
      mortality rates. Secondary endpoints will be evaluated through 1 year (365 ± 60 days)
      post-procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age.

          2. Patients who are non-pregnant female (females of child bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment into the study).

          3. Patient has signed an Ethics Committee (EC) approved Informed Consent Form.

          4. Patient is considered by the treating physician to be a candidate for elective open
             surgical repair of the AAA (i.e., category I, II, or III per American Society of
             Anesthesiology (ASA) classification; refer to Appendix II: ASA Classification System).
             ASA category IV patients may be enrolled provided their life expectancy is greater
             than 1 year.

               -  Aneurysm has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6 months; or

               -  Maximum diameter of aneurysm exceeds 1.5 times the transverse dimension of an
                  adjacent non-aneurysmal aortic segment.

          6. Patient has suitable anatomy that allows use of the TriVascular Ovation Abdominal

             in intended treatment zone.

          6. Patient has a known thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection that will require treatment
             (surgery or endovascular intervention) within the study period.

          7. Patient has a mycotic aneurysm or has an active systemic infection.

          8. Patient has unstable angina (defined as angina with a progressive increase in
             symptoms, new onset at rest or nocturnal angina, or onset of prolonged angina).
