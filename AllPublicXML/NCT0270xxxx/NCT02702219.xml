  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobility training in the form of stretching and flexibility training of our skeletal muscle
      is a common exercise. However, the evidence are scare and there are only a few studies
      comparing the effect of prolonged static stretching (&gt; 90 sec) and dynamic flexibility
      training as to which of these methods has the best length-enhancing effect over time.
      Further, in clinical practice concerning low back pain, the possibility of a thigh hamstrings
      muscles to affect movement control of the spine is often mentioned, a link not fully explored
      in a controlled condition. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of eight weeks
      of dynamic flexibility training versus prolonged static stretching on mobility in the
      hamstring muscles in adults with reduced mobility in the muscles at the back of the thigh.
      The aim is also to compare the sustained effect of flexibility training between the two
      groups, eight weeks after completion of the intervention. Furthermore, the aim is to explore
      how different forms of flexibility training affects movement patterns of the lumbar spine in
      adult persons with reduced mobility in the hamstrings.
