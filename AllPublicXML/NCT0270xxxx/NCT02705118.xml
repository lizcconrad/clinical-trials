  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fusion imaging of US and MRI is very helpful for interventional procedure such as
      radiofrequency ablation in liver. However, manual registration of US and magnetic resonance
      (MR) imaging is somewhat time-consuming and difficult for less-experienced physicians.
      Recently, automatic registration function was developed to help the fusion of US and CT/MRI
      imaging. The purpose of this trial is to compare the registration time and accuracy of manual
      registration system and automatic registration system.

      1. Patients will be randomized and assigned.

        2. For automatic registration group, automatic image fusion will be done by RS80A US unit
           and RF ablation will be performed. Image fusion time will be measured.

        3. For manual registration group, manual image fusion will be done by LOGIQ-E9 US unit and
           RF ablation will be performed. Image fusion time will be measured.

      3) After radiofrequency (RF) ablation, immediate, contrast enhanced CT will be performed to
      evaluate technical success and complications 4) Accuracy of registration will be measured by
      home-made software using 3D techniques.

      5) After one month, technical effectiveness will be evaluated by contrast enhanced CT 6) F/U
      of CT images will be obtained until one year after RF ablation with a interval of 1-3 months.
