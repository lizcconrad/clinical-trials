  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Labor and delivery is a unique physiological experience of women. Inappropriate length of
      labor progress during vaginal delivery may produce great risks for mother and fetus.
      Especially the slow progress is one of the most important reasons for the occurrence of
      cesarean section during vaginal delivery, which still with a high incidence in recent
      years.Previous studies have found that there was a significant correlation between the
      genetic polymorphisms of β 2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and the duration of vaginal
      delivery.Therefore, the researchers intend to investigate the distribution of β2-adrenergic
      receptor (β2AR) genetic polymorphisms among Chinese parturient and observe the relationship
      between the genetic polymorphisms and labor process after labor analgesia.
