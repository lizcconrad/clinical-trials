  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For too many women, childbirth results in devastating consequences: involuntary loss of feces
      or urine (fecal or urinary incontinence). In fact, up to 50 percent of women with severe
      tears during childbirth may develop these problems. These new mothers avoid leaving home in
      order to stay close to a toilet, wear protective pads every day, and avoid activities they
      previously enjoyed such as exercise and sexual intercourse. It is not surprising that many of
      these women suffer from postpartum depression, and bonding with their newborns is
      compromised.

      Fecal and urinary incontinence occur due to injuries to the pelvic nerves and muscles during
      childbirth. Many researchers have focused on what can be done to prevent these injuries;
      however, few have investigated how to help the countless women who have already suffered from
      these injuries to the nerves and muscles. In other fields such as orthopedics and neurology,
      research shows that electrical stimulation can provoke nerve regeneration after injury.
      Applying this technology to women who have recently suffered from nerve injury during
      childbirth could have profound and life-changing effects. Investigators hypothesize that
      electrical stimulation immediately postpartum will markedly help pelvic nerves regenerate,
      minimizing rates of fecal and urinary incontinence for this vulnerable population of new
      mothers.

    <description>Endovaginal ultrasound will be used to determine the relationship between levator ani muscle defects between the electrical stimulation and sham group.
For levator ani defects, the presence of absence of levator ani avulsion (separation from the pubic bone) will be noted on each side. Number of patients with and without these avulsions will be compared between the two groups.</description>

    <description>For anal sphincter muscle defects, the percentage of defect in the anal sphincter muscles (out of 360 degrees) will be reported. These percentages will be compared between the two groups.</description>

    <description>The ApexM Device (InControl Medical) is a cylindrical inflatable instrument with electrodes on the dorsal and ventral sides. It is a battery operated, non-implanted device which will be inserted into the vagina and will stimulate the pelvic floor muscles. This device has been shown to be safe and effective for clinical use. Stimulation will alternate between 13 and 50Hz. The initial intensity will be set by the clinician at the patient's initial visit and will be increased in a standard fashion over the duration of the trial.</description>

    <description>Vaginal electrical stimulation will be administered via the Apex M Device. During each session, the patient will be supine, place conductive gel on the device, insert the device into the vagina, and inflate it to comfort. Subsequently, the device will be turned on and set to previously determined setting. Stimulation session will last 10 minutes and occur 6 times per week for a total of 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>A sham Apex M device without electrical stimulation will be used. During each session, the patient will be supine, place conductive gel on the device, insert the device into the vagina, and inflate it to comfort. Subsequently, the device will be turned on and set to previously determined setting. Each session will last 10 minutes and occur 6 times per week for a total of 12 weeks.</description>
