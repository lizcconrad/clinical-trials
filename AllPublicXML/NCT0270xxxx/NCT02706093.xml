    <textblock>
      The overall objectives are to:

        1. Assess mechanisms underlying HIIT-induced improvements in insulin resistance at the
           whole-body, tissue, and cellular levels.

        2. Systematically compare different HIIT regimens to help identify effective &quot;doses&quot; of
           HIIT that may be optimal for improving metabolic health in obese adults.

        3. Assess the ability/willingness of obese subjects to adhere to a long-term HIIT program.

      Findings from these studies will greatly expand knowledge about the effects of HIIT on
      metabolic health, and will provide valuable information for development of programs aimed at
      maximizing key metabolic benefits of exercise.

      If subjects are eligible for the study, they will be randomized into one of four different
      exercise training groups. Before training (and twice after 3 months of training) subjects
      will participate in a &quot;clinical study&quot; in which they will be required to stay overnight in
      the hospital. During the clinical study, the research team will perform a series of metabolic
      tests. Before and after the 3 months of training, the research team will assess subjects
      &quot;free-living&quot; 24h blood sugar control using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM). The research
      team will measure several other relevant clinical markers (e.g., whole body and regional body
      fat assessments [Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) and Magnetic Resonance Imager
      (MRI)], hepatic lipid accumulation [MRI analysis], blood lipid profile, resting metabolic
      rate, glycated hemoglobin [hemoglobin A1c]). After the first 3 months of training, adherence
      to the subjects assigned training program will be tracked for the next 9 months (1 year of
      training in total). One year after initiating a training program, subjects will be asked to
      return to the clinic for a quick follow-up visit where the research team will complete some
      standard clinical assessments (e.g., body weight, body composition, blood pressure, and a
      blood sample).
