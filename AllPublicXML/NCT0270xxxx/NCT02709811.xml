    <textblock>
      Electrochemotherapy (ECT) is a non-thermal tumour ablation modality. It consists of the local
      potentiation, by means of local reversible electroporation of tumour tissues, of the
      antitumor activity of non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs already possessing
      intrinsic cytotoxicity. ECT has proved to be effective in the treatment of various cutaneous
      tumour nodules of any origin. Mostly ECT is offered to patients in case of multiple cutaneous
      metastases, when they cannot be excised, due to their number or localization. This study
      investigate the application of ECT in the treatment of liver metastases from colorectal
      adenocarcinoma, for which other thermal cytoreductive methods would be risky compared to the
      supposed expected clinical benefits.
