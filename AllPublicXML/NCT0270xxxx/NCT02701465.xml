  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is two-fold. Firstly to see if patients
      suffering Subacromial Pain Syndrome can improve blood flow in the supraspinatus muscle in
      their shoulder, and secondly to investigate how changes in this blood flow are related to
      pain experience and shoulder function.

    <description>participants abduct their shoulder up to 90 degrees in scapula's plane (scapularization) at a frequency of 0,5 Hz. Every minute the load is increased with 250 grams. The test is stopped if participant fails to maintain pace or movement quality, or experiences increased pain. Time at failure is noted as the result.</description>

    <measure>Regional blood flow in m. supraspinatus, using contrast enhanced ultrasound (concentration of white analyzed as decibels in region of interest)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline images will be taken with ultrasonic device to confirm an intact m. supraspinatus. An intravenous line will be inserted in the contralateral arm and the patient will be injected with a bolus of contrast dye (Optison, 3 ml bolus, 0.19 mg / mL perflutren). The injection is administered by a physician related to the research project. Measurements of regional blood flow at rest made are of the supraspinatus tendon. Then the participants perform a standardized training exercise to recruit the vasculature in m. supraspinatus (scapularization to 90 degrees, 80% of TTU weight (incremental), 3 minutes). Post-exercise images are taken immediatley after this.</description>
