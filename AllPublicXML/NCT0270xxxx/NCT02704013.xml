  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a single-center, prospective, interventional, single-arm study. Aim is to investigate
      which variables are significantly correlated with prolonged anticholinergic treatment (&gt;6
      months) in children with overactive bladder (OAB). Investigated variables will include
      urinary neurotrophins and inflammatory cytokines, sonographic biomarkers, symptom score
      scale, demographics, and urodynamic findings. Secondary aim is to analyze sensitivity and
      specificity of urinary biomarkers in diagnosis and management of OAB compared to urodynamics
      and treatment outcome.

    <time_frame>6 months after start of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Nonresponse is defined as a 0% to 49% decrease, partial response is defined as a 50% to 89% decrease, response is defined as a 90% or greater decrease and full response is defined as a 100% decrease or less than 1 symptom occurrence monthly. Symptoms include urgency, daily incontinence, increased daytime frequency, enuresis, nocturia. Symptom frequency will be assessed using validated diary.</description>
