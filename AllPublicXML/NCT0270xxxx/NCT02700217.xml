  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 1100 living donor nephrectomies are performed in the UK every year contributing to
      almost 35% of all the kidney transplants. Laparoscopic surgical techniques are general
      employed for donor nephrectomy as they are associated with a shorter hospital stay and faster
      return to normal physical functioning. Local anaesthetic infiltration technique with or
      without spinal anaesthesia in combination with a general anaesthetic is increasingly being
      used as part of enhanced recovery programme across general surgery. The impact of combined
      spinal and general anaesthesia along with local infiltration and rectus sheath blocks on
      acute pain has not been studied in patients undergoing hand assisted laparoscopic live donor
      nephrectomy.

      The investigators plan to investigate whether adding a spinal anaesthetic to a conventional
      general anaesthetic technique actually influences clinical outcomes of length of hospital
      stay and acute pain in patients undergoing hand assisted laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy.

      The investigators plan to randomise 90 patients undergoing hand assisted laparoscopic live
      donor nephrectomy over 24 month period at Central Manchester University hospitals and divide
      them in two groups of 45 each. Group A will receive a general anaesthetic (GA) with spinal
      anaesthesia (Spinal group) and Group B will receive a GA with a rectus sheath block (Rectus
      sheath group) and local anaesthetic infiltration

    <measure>Assessment of readiness for discharge from hospital to determine Length of stay, after renal surgery, using a blinded Nurse assessment of patient.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>From Day 2 a nurse blinded to both groups will assess the readiness for discharge at 10:00, 14:00 and at 18:00 hours. The patient would be considered suitable for discharge if the following criteria are met:
(i) Able to get in and out of bed, (ii) Able to get dressed, (iii) Able to go to toilet without walking aids, (iv) Pain manageable with oral analgesics, (v) Patient willing to be discharged.
Length of stay (LOS) would be calculated as the time from the end of surgery until the subject met the discharge criteria from the ward. The actual day and time the patient leaves the hospital would be noted as well.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Pain from surgery to discharge tested at intervals using an 11 point linear numerical rating scale utilised for assessment of pain.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores at rest and on movement along with PONV scores with anti-emetics will be assessed thrice daily at 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00 on Day 1. Total oxycodone consumption in the first 24 hours after surgery will be noted.
In the ward, the pain scores at rest and at movement would be assessed at 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours from the end of surgery using the NRS scoring system by a nurse who would be blinded to both the groups.</description>
