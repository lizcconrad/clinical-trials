  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, longitudinal study to evaluate the use of the SEM Scanner as an adjunct
      to clinical judgment for detection of early pressure ulcers in patients before skin
      assessments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demonstrate that the SEM Scanner can detect early pressure ulcers in patients before pressure
      ulcers are diagnosed through clinical judgment (&quot;diagnose pressure ulcers before clinical
      judgment&quot;).

      Determine the average number of days between detection of early pressure ulcers using the SEM
      Scanner and diagnosis of pressure ulcers through clinical judgment (&quot;time to detection&quot;).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Greater or equal to 55 years of age

          2. At risk of developing a pressure ulcer at time of enrollment as defined by one or more
             of the following:

               1. PU Risk Score - Braden &lt; 15; Waterlow ≥ 10; or Norton ≤ 18

               2. Poor mobility; e.g., Braden mobility subscore ≤ 2; Waterlow mobility subscore &gt;
                  2; Norton mobility subscore ≤ 2; or poor mobility according to clinical judgment
                  (chair- or bed-bound)

               3. Poor nutrition; e.g., Braden nutrition subscore ≤ 2; Waterlow nutrition subscore
                  &gt; 2; or poor nutrition according to clinical judgment

               4. Medical procedure (e.g. surgery, x-ray, etc.) involving immobility and inability
                  to change position lasting 4 hours or longer

          3. Evaluable by the study team for a minimum of 6 consecutive days upon enrollment

          4. Willing and able to provide informed consent (or by proxy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unhealed (including newly diagnosed) pressure ulcer at any anatomical site at the time
             of enrollment

          2. Broken skin at the sacrum and both heels that prevents collection of SEM Scanner
             readings from all three anatomical locations; possible assessment at only one or two
             locations is not grounds for exclusion

          3. Moisture lesion or incontinence associated dermatitis at the sacrum

          4. Physical, structural, or other limitations preventing assessments required in this
             study (e.g., suspected or actual injury preventing turning)

          5. Presence of any condition(s) or injury(ies) which compromises the subject's ability to
             complete this study

          6. Per clinical decision of the study Investigator, diminished decision-making capacity
             which might impact compliance or completion with study procedures

          7. Patient modesty concerns on the part of the subject (or their proxy) that might impact
             collection of SEM Scanner readings at the anatomical location (heels and sacrum) to be
             assessed
