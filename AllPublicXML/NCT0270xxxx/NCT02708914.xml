  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a 1:1 dose conversion from Eprex® to
      UB-851 in terms of clinical efficacy and safety in subjects with chronic renal failure
      receiving hemodialysis.

      This is a 52-week, phase III trial consisting of two parts:

      Part I is designed as a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of UB-851 in comparison to Eprex® in subjects with renal
      anemia on hemodialysis with a treatment period of 24 weeks.

      Part II is designed as a single-arm, safety evaluation period (from week 25 to week 52) to
      evaluate the long-term safety and immunogenicity of UB-851.
