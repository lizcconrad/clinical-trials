  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the functional and physiological effects associated
      with the use of High-resolution, relational, resonance-based, electroencephalic mirroring
      (HIRREM), as supplemental care, for symptoms of neurological, cardiovascular, and
      neuropsychological disorders. This is a non-randomized, open label, and unblinded
      before-and-after trial, evaluating the effect of HIRREM on an objective, physiological common
      denominator (heart rate variability, HRV), across a variety of relevant conditions, as well
      as changes in clinical symptoms inventories, to generate hypotheses and pilot data for
      investigation in future proposals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Data used for analysis of primary outcome is collected at the enrollment visit, and 1-2 weeks after the intervention is completed.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure and heart rate are acquired from 10 minute recordings of noninvasive finger arterial pressure measurements and ECG with participants lying quietly, supine. Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR intervals files generated via the data acquisition system (BIOPAC acquisition system and Acknowledge 4.2 software, Santa Barbara, CA), at 1000 Hz, are analyzed using Nevrokard BRS software (Nevrokard BRS, Medistar, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Analysis is conducted on the first complete 5-minute epoch that is considered to be acceptable for analysis. Heart rate variability is measured in the time domain as standard deviation of beat-to-beat interval (SDNN, milliseconds). For calculation of SDNN, the R-R intervals are visually inspected, and data considered as artifact is manually removed. The primary outcomes will be analysis for change from baseline to post-intervention, 1-2 weeks after intervention is completed.</description>

    <description>Blood pressure and heart rate are acquired from 10 minute recordings of noninvasive finger arterial pressure measurements and ECG with participants lying quietly, supine. Systolic BP and beat to beat, RR intervals files generated via the data acquisition system (BIOPAC acquisition system and Acknowledge 4.2 software, Santa Barbara, CA), at 1000 Hz, are analyzed using Nevrokard Baroreflex Sensitivity (BRS) software (Nevrokard BRS, Medistar, Ljubljana, Slovenia). Analysis is conducted on the first complete 5-minute epoch that is considered to be acceptable for analysis. Evaluation includes analysis for measures of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity, in the frequency domain as high frequency (HF) alpha index (ms2), and in the time domain as Sequence BRS (Up, Down and All, ms/mmHg).

    <description>HIRREM is a noninvasive, closed-loop, allostatic, acoustic stimulation neuro-technology to facilitate recipient-unique relaxation, auto-calibration, and self-optimization of cortical neural oscillations by reflecting auditory tones in near real time. After an initial HIRREM assessment, evaluating patterns of brain electrical rhythms, subjects get a series of 90-120 minute HIRREM sessions, including 5 to 9 individualized protocols. A protocol is a combination of sensor montage and specific software design, during which dominant brain frequencies, recorded at high spectral resolutions, are translated to audible tones, and reflected back via earphones with as little as 8 milliseconds delay. Protocols are received sitting or reclining in a chair, some with eyes open, others eyes closed.</description>
