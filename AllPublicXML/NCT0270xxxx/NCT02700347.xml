  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis of pyrazinamide in combination with allopurinol. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and whole
      blood bactericidal activity (WBA) will be measured in healthy volunteers following
      administration of pyrazinamide alone and in combination with allopurinol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The whole blood bactericidal activity (WBA) assay is an ex vivo model for measuring the
      combined effects of administered drugs, host factors and strain factors on mycobacterial
      sterilisation. If performed in parallel with PK measurements, the method can be used to
      evaluate the effect of drugs throughout the dosing cycle. The aim of this trial is to assess
      the WBA activity and PK data of pyrazinamide and its metabolites boosted with allopurinol in
      healthy volunteers.
