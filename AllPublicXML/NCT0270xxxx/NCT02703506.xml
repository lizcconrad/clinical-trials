      This project aims to study the effectiveness of a pain education program in the improvement
      of chronic pain and disability/impairment. Assuming the definition established in the United
      States in 1975 on the fourth working group of the National Conference on Preventive Medicine:
      &quot;Health education must be a process that informs, motivates and helps people to adopt and
      maintain practices and healthy lifestyles, environmental advocates changes necessary to
      facilitate these objectives and professional training and directs research towards the same
      objectives. &quot; Once the need of educating patients is stablished on subjects with diseases, it
      is necessary to encourage them to actively participate on the control of them and to achieve
      significant improvement of adherence

      BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:

      Patient education over the knowledge of pain causes and perpetuating psicosocial factos, so
      as a gradual physical therapy intervention may success in modifying habits, and consequently
      emotional state and behaviour in order to maintain or recover subject's social participation
      being this program effective in pain diminution over chronic neck pain.

      Main goal: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pain education program for patients with
      chronic neck pain, to decrease the intensity of pain in front of one physiotherapy program
      (TENS and exercise)

      Experimental group: Will receive five group sessions of 60-120 minutes twice a week with a
      maximum of 10 participants.

      Control group: Five individual sessions twice a week, will be performed of transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on neck area an exercises.

      OUTCOMES

      Primary outcome

        -  Intensity of pain, measured by the visual analog scale: VAS. The mean of the values wil
           be calculated described in the assessment, the mean of the last week was also compiled.

        -  The degree of neck disability/impairment measured using the Northwick Park Pain
           Questionnaire (NPPQ)
