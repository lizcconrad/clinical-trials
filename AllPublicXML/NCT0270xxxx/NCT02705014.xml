    <textblock>
      To investigate the hormone response of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis and spermatogenesis
      in male pituitary stalk interruption syndrome patients by pulsatile GnRH therapy. The
      hormonal response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis was assessed after pulsatile GnRH
      replacement by measurement of serum T, LH and FSH. A standard seminal fluid analysis was
      performed in men who could produce an ejaculate.

    <measure>Change of serum Luteinizing Hormone(LH) value</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 1m,3m, 6m, 9m and 12m post treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Luteinizing hormone (LH) is measured using commercial kits by chemiluminescent method (ACS 180 Automatic Chemiluminescence System; Bayer). Reference range: 1.24-8.62 IU/L. Initial efficacy is evaluated based on the values of serum LH and serum total testosterone. If a subject's serum LH value below 1.5 IU/L and serum total testosterone value below 100 ng/dL at 3m post treatment, it is defined as failure to pulsatile GnRH treatment and continuous treatment is stopped. Otherwise, pulsatile GnRH treatment is continued.</description>

    <description>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are measured using commercial kits by chemiluminescent method (ACS 180 Automatic Chemiluminescence System; Bayer). Reference range: 1.27-19.26 IU/L.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of serum total testosterone value</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 1m,3m, 6m, 9m and 12m post treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Total testosterone levels are measured using commercial kits by chemiluminescent method (ACS 180 Automatic Chemiluminescence System; Bayer). Reference range: 175-781 ng/dL.Initial efficacy is evaluated based on the values of serum LH and serum totaltestosterone. If a subject's serum LH value below 1.5 IU/L and serum total testosterone value below 100 ng/dL at 3m post treatment, it is defined as failure to pulsatile GnRH treatment and continuous treatment is stopped. Otherwise, pulsatile GnRH treatment is continued.</description>

    <measure>Change of testicular volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 1m,3m, 6m, 9m and 12m post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Testicular volumes are measured using Prader orchidometer. Prader orchidometer is a standard method to measure testicular volume. The normal range of testicular volume of each side in normal adult men is 15-25ml.</description>

    <measure>Change of sperm counts by routine semen analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 3m, 6m, 9m and 12m post treatment</time_frame>
