      ABSTRACT: Low back pain is one of the most frequent causes of incapacity. The prevalence of
      this syndrome is 60-85% for the survival of the individuals. Among the most promising
      strategies of low back pain intervention, is the physical activity that is usually associated
      with a long list of health benefits.

      Purpose: evaluate the efficacy of a protocol of exercises to low back pain rehabilitation
      under supervision of physiatry service and rehabilitation in the Hospital de Clínicas de
      Porto Alegre compared with same protocol performed at home in regards to pain.

      Methods: Randomized clinical trial with a sample of 122 subjects of the community of both
      sex, with ages between 30 to 55, with low back pain complain. These subjects will accomplish
      during 12 weeks protocol of exercises from &quot;Exercises to low back pain&quot; Physiatry and
      Rehabilitation service from HCPA, randomized in two groups: group 1 will complete all the
      protocol of exercises with orientation and attendance directly from a professional of
      physical education, in the Service of Physiatry and Rehabilitation in HCPA. Group 2 will
      complete one session of the protocol of exercises with orientation and attendance directly
      from a professional of Physical Education, in the service of Physiatry and Rehabilitation of
      HCPA, to clarify any doubts about the protocol. The further sessions will be completed at
      home, along weekly monitoring of the researchers through phone calls, the patients of this
      group will receive a manual with the sequence of the exercises.
