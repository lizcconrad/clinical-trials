  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) as monotherapy in
      participants with previously systemically treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Study
      participants may receive pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks for up to 35 administrations (up to
      approximately 2 years).

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of
      pembrolizumab given as monotherapy in participants with previously systemically treated HCC
