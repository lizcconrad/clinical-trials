    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study, aiming to evaluate patients with Deep Venous
      Thrombosis in lower limbs and the recanalization rates evaluated with DUPLEX ultrasound, as
      so the clinical outcomes in patients submitted to oral anticoagulation with Rivaroxaban
      versus Warfarin.

    <textblock>
      In this study the patients with lower limbs deep venous thrombosis are assigned and
      randomized in two groups: Group 1 - Patients are submitted to oral anticoagulation with
      Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for at least 6 months. Group 2 - Patients are undergoing oral
      anticoagulation with Warfarin for 6 months. These two drugs are approved by FDA in the
      treatment of deep venous thrombosis. The primary outcome is to assign the recanalization rate
      of the veins in the two groups, using Duplex ultrasound. The patients are also evaluated
      within symptoms, clinical signs, such as edema, limb swelling, pain, return to habitual
      activities. Inclusion criteria: deep venous thrombosis in patients that does not have other
      important diseases, such as cancer, thrombophilic states, until the age of 80. Exclusion
      criteria: cancer, thrombophilic states, mental disorders, age superior 80 years,
      contraindication to oral anticoagulation. The primary outcome is within 1 year after the Deep
      venous thrombosis.

    <time_frame>6 months after the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis.</time_frame>
    <description>The patients are evaluated within 6 months with Duplex ultrasound to assess the recanalization rate. The criteria to assess Deep venous thrombosis are defined as as visualization of thrombus and/or lack of complete compressibility of the vein. Thrombus involving popliteal and/or more proximal veins was classified as proximal Deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The US findings in DVT include: the presence of echoes within the vascular lumen; the veins in axial scans are not compressible. Pulsed Doppler and duplex Doppler combine the morphologic and functional study. Injury caused by DVT at the valvular level (postphlebitic syndrome) is visualized. Venous segments were examined whether they were occluded, partially recanalized, or totally recanalized, and the development of venous reflux was evaluated.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis.</time_frame>
    <description>The patients are evaluated within 6 months with clinical examination, to evaluate presence of pain in lower limbs, swelling and varicose veins. The post-thrombotic syndrome is characterized by aching pain on standing, dependent oedema, and the frequent develop-ment of brawny, tender induration of the subcutaneous tissues of the medial lower limb, a condition that has been termed lipodermatosclerosis. Pruritus and eczematous skin changes are frequently present, and a proportion of patients develop secondary superficial varicose veins as the syndrome evolves.Ulceration, often precipitated by minor trauma, arises in a considerable number of patients and is characteristically chronic and indolent with a high recurrence rate, once healing has been achieved. Uncommonly, patients with persistent obstruction may experience venous claudication, a bursting pain in the leg during exercise, which, in some respects,mimics arterial claudication (Immelman &amp; Jeffrey, 1984).</description>
