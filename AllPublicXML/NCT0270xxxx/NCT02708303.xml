      The Mayo Clinic Foregut Surgery Report Card Questionnaire has been created in order to have a
      consistent evaluation tool for patients undergoing foregut surgery in order to standardize
      and validate outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foregut surgery includes conditions of the esophagus, stomach and proximal small intestine.
      More specifically foregut surgery includes surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease,
      hiatal hernias, and paraesophageal hernias. Patients undergoing foregut surgery report having
      varying degrees of symptoms of reflux, regurgitation, dysphagia, and pain following surgery.
      Providers also note varying degrees of outcomes. Some of these issues can be assessed using
      pH probe testing, upper GI endoscopy, high resolution manometry, CT scans, and other testing.
      There are various validated questionnaires that have been used to assess problem areas of
      reflux, dysphagia, and pain such as the Promis Global Health Score, Mayo GER Score, Modified
      Dysphagia Questionnaire-30 Day, Zubrod Score, and pain scale. Each of these symptoms, tests,
      and questionnaires contributes to the provider's understanding of the patient's outcomes but
      there is currently no assessment tool that brings all of the test findings and information
      reported by the patient as symptoms or answers to the questionnaires in a format that that is
      usable for the clinician and understandable for the patient who has specifically undergone
      foregut surgery. The Mayo Clinic Foregut Surgery Report Card Questionnaire has been created
      in order to have a consistent evaluation tool for patients undergoing surgery in the foregut
      in order to standardize and validate outcome measures. Data will be used to establish the
      validation of the Mayo Clinic Foregut Surgery Report Card Questionnaire. Data will also lead
      to the establishment of &quot;normal&quot; or expected scores for patients undergoing each type of
      foregut procedure.

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete the Mayo Clinic Foregut Surgery Report Card Questionnaire at approximately 8-10 weeks following surgery and then with each surveillance clinic visit or a minimum of once per year for their lifetime. The questionnaire can be completed at their clinic visit, over the telephone, or by mail. The patient's medical record will also be reviewed to gather any other contributing information.
Data collected from the questionnaire will be entered into a database that will be maintained for future research.</description>
