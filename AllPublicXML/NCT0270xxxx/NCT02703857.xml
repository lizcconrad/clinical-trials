  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical site infection is one of the most important causes of postoperative morbidity.
      The appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is one of the most effective ways to prevent surgical
      site infections. The recommendations of the French Society of Anesthesia Resuscitation on
      antibiotic prophylaxis in long surgeries are based on low documentation, including frequency
      and dosage of reinjection.

      The main objective of the study is to describe the tissue and plasma pharmacokinetics of
      cefoxitin after repeated injections.

      This is an open monocentric study (phase 4) including adults aged 18 to 80 years in need of
      major abdominal surgery whose foreseeable time exceeds 4 hours and justifying an antibiotic
      prophylaxis by cefoxitin.

      They receive 2 g cefoxitin parenterally at least 30 minutes before the incision and then
      every 2 hours until closing.

      The primary endpoints are:

        -  Total and plasma free concentrations of cefoxitin 0, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes after
           start of each infusion cefoxitin

        -  Tissue free concentrations of cefoxitin every 20 minutes after the start of the first
           infusion cefoxitin until skin closure

        -  Urinary concentrations of cefoxitin
