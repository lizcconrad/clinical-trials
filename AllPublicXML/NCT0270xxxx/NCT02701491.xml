  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute gastroenteritis is a very common problem in children. The frequency and duration of
      this condition involves a high discomfort for the child and his family, and significant
      costs, in connection with the purchase of therapeutic aids, medical visits, days of work lost
      by parents, requiring hospitalization. Vomiting is a typical symptom of the majority of the
      cases of acute gastroenteritis and is very often the cause of failure of oral rehydration use
      and hospitalization.

      To limit vomiting and facilitate oral rehydration have been proposed several pharmacological
      strategies. Unfortunately, these therapies are unsuccessful (domperidone), expensive and side
      effects (ondansetron and metoclopramide) and therefore contraindicated in patients of
      pediatric age.

      The administration of some medicinal herbs is able to induce an effective anti-emetic power.
      Among the various types of plants studied, the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, commonly known
      as ginger is used as an antiemetic in various traditional systems of medicine for over 2000
      years. There are several scientific evidence on the beneficial properties of ginger,
      including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic . It was also
      demonstrated that ginger is effective in resolving the post-operative nausea and vomiting and
      in pregnant. A recent meta-analysis has confirmed that ginger is effective in
      non-pharmacological treatment of nausea and vomiting in the early periods of pregnancy.

      To date there are several formulations of the ginger on the market in Italy, and their use is
      fairly widespread in children for the treatment of vomiting by acute gastroenteritis in the
      absence of clinical evidence of efficacy.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of treatment with
      ginger in reducing episodes of vomiting associated with acute gastroenteritis in children.
