      Adhesive capsulitis is a common cause of shoulder pain, and the efficacy of most
      interventions is limited. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of hydrodilatation
      with hyaluronic acid under ultrasonographic guidance plus physical therapy (PT) with that of
      PT alone for treating adhesive capsulitis.

      Design: a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, clinical trial

      Patient and methods:

      Patients with adhesive capsulitis for at least 3 months were enrolled and randomly allocated
      into group 1 (hydrodilatation with hyaluronic acid under ultrasonographic guidance plus PT)
      and group 2 (PT alone). The patients were evaluated before treatment and were reevaluated 0,
      6, and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Outcomes measures included a pain scale
      (visual analog scale), range of motion, Constant shoulder score, Shoulder Pain And Disability
      Index, and the Short Form-36

    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.</description>
