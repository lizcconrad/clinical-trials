      Quantitative Physics: dosimetric comparison of doses in target volumes and organs at risk.
      The technique used is that of which the dose on the organs at risk is as low as possible, and
      whose dose to the target volume is the closest possible to the prescribed dose (100% of the
      prescribed dose).
