    <textblock>
      Dendritic cell-based cellular vaccine for tumor therapy has shown efficacy. This study is
      designed to perform a personalized clinical trial by first analyzing the expression of tumor
      associated antigens in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and then immunizing the
      patients with personalized DC-based cellular vaccine. In addition, allogeneic peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be used as cellular vehicle for immunization. Safety and
      efficacy will be observed in the study.

      This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I/II study designed to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular tumor vaccine for patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). Newly diagnosed GBM patients will undergo tumor
      resection. The tumors will be analyzed for the expression of a panel of glioma-associated
      antigens and immune-related genes. Post surgical treatment will be 6 weeks standard
      chemotherapy with temozolomide and concurrent radiotherapy and continue cycles of
      temozolomide within a 28-day window. Patients will undergo leukapheresis either after surgery
      or after concurrent radio/chemotherapy. Based on individual tumor antigen expression, in
      vitro transcribed mRNA will be generated and used to pulse in vitro generated DCs. The
      patients will be pre-conditioned for DC vaccination with either tetanus toxoid vaccine or
      imiquimod cream. Allogeneic PBMCs will be pulsed with tumor antigen mRNA. The patients will
      be immunized intradermally for a total of twelve times with DC or PMBC cellular vaccines.
      Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The primary objective is to assess the safety of the
      personalized cellular vaccines. The secondary objective is to assess the specific T cell
      response to immunized vaccines. In addition, the antitumor efficacy of the vaccines will be
      measured using iRANO criteria, progression-free survival and overall survival.
