  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this study is to investigate whether the beneficial effect of treadmill
      training on people with Parkinson's disease can be enhanced by repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-six participants with
      Parkinson's disease (PD) will be recruited from the Hong Kong PD association, a self-help
      group and movement disorder clinics of 3 local hospitals. Written informed consent in
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki will be obtained from all participants. Eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned into one of the three groups: 1-Hz, 25-Hz, and sham
      rTMS upon recruitment. Randomization was generated by a computer program and group assignment
      will be blinded to both participants and assessor. Participant will receive either 1-Hz,
      25-Hz, or sham rTMS which will last for about 20 minutes followed by 30 minutes treadmill
      walking training for 12 sessions, 4 times per week for 3 weeks. All assessments will be
      conducted 1 week before intervention and 1 day after completion of intervention, after
      1-month training and at 3-month post training. The sample size was calculated using G* power
      3 statistical analysis software. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA design with
      between-subject group effect (3 levels) and within-subject effect (4 levels) determines that
      20 subjects per group are required to achieve 80% power to test the interaction effect
      between group and time effect with a 5 % significance level and the effect size of 0.5. By
      assuming 10% dropout rate, 22 subjects will be required per group.

    <measure>Change in time taken to complete the instrumented Timed-Up-and-Go Test (iTUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are instructed to stand up from a chair and walk for 7 meters walkway and return back to the chair turn around and sit down in both single task and dual task conditions. In dual task condition, participants will repeat the 7-meter iTUG while continuing a serial three subtractions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in MiniBESTest scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Balance performance of participants will be assessed in 4 domains namely anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, sensory orientation and gait stability. Each item is rated from 0-2 with a total scores of 28. Higher scores indicate better dynamic balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cortical silent period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ten suprathreshold TMS stimulus will be delivered while participant performing a 20% isometric maximal contraction of Tibialis Anterior. Cortical silent period measures the duration of interruption of electromyography (EMG) activity in the contracting muscle produced by TMS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gradient of the recruitment curve ( also known as stimulus-response curve)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>TMS stimuli will be applied at 10% steps between 100% to 160% motor threshold. 10 stimuli will be delivered at each intensity. Peak to peak amplitude of 10 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) at each stimulus intensity will be averaged offline. A scatter graph will be generated with the average amplitude of MEPs as a function of stimulation intensity. The linear trend will be added to generate the linear recruitment curve slope.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short-interval-intracortical inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short-interval-intracortical inhibition is another measure of cortical inhibition. In a pair TMS pulse paradigm, a test pulse will be adjusted to produce MEPs of at least 0.5 micro-volts which will be delivered preceded by a brief conditioned pulse set at a lower intensity of 80% of the resting motor threshold with inter-stimulus interval of 2 milliseconds. Two stimulators connected via a Bistim module ( Magstim Co.,Whitland, Carmarthenshire, Wales) will be used in this test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in walking distance in a 2 -minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 2 minute walk test will be conducted along a 20 m x 2 m hallway. A line is marked at each end of the walkway to indicate where the person is to turn. Participants will be instructed to &quot; walk as far as possible in 2 minutes&quot;. They will be given standardised encouragement at 60 and 90 seconds during walk. Distance walked will be recorded to the nearest meter.</description>

    <description>Sham repetitive Transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied over the same site as for real rTMS , however, with the cables of the coil disconnected. Another figure-of-eight coil using the same stimulation parameters (intensity, time, and frequency) as 25-Hz group will be placed posterior to the subject's neck with the handle pointing backward to produce the same clicking sound effect as 25-Hz group. Sham rTMS will be followed by 30 minutes of treadmill training.</description>

    <description>Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is a painless and non-invasive technique for activation of cerebral cortex based on the principle of electromagnetic induction of an electric filed in the brain. rTMS will be delivered to the scalp over the leg area of the bilateral motor cortex by using a Magstim 200 magnetic stimulator. (Magstim Company, Whitland, UK) and 90 mm double cone coil.</description>

    <description>Participants will proceed to 30 minute of treadmill training after rTMS. A safety harness without body weight support will be provided. 80% of participant's over ground maximum walking speed will be halved and used for warm-up. After warming up, walking speed will be increased by 0.2 km/h every 5 minutes. Progression will be given if patients could tolerate the belt speed with appropriate step length and walk with good stability for 5 minutes. Maximum achieved speed will be maintained followed by 0.5 km/h decrements. Participants will maintain the rest of the treadmill session with this speed or further adjustment will be made if participants are unable to maintain. Positive verbal feedback will be given to encourage large strides and upright posture during training. The participants will be instructed to walk on treadmill without holding onto the handrails if possible. Participants will perform warm up and cool down exercise to minimize training related-injury.</description>
