      The purpose of this study is to determine if a financial deposit contract is a successful
      method of helping people to maintain their weight loss. A deposit contract is an agreement in
      which participants put their own money at risk, with the goal of &quot;earning&quot; it back by
      achieving a goal, in this case maintaining prior weight loss. The study will also evaluate
      the interventions using survey research to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the
      interventions.

    <textblock>
      Interested participants who can verify &gt;10lb weight-loss over the last year and a half will
      be randomly assigned to either the control group, in which they will be asked to attend
      weekly weigh-ins at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) over the course of a year, or to the
      deposit contract intervention group. Both the control group and the deposit contract group
      will complete the weekly weigh-ins for one year. The deposit contract group will additionally
      have a financial component: these participants will be asked to make a deposit of at least
      $100 each 10-week period over the course of one year (50 weeks), and can recoup this amount
      as detailed above. All participants will take baseline and end-of-study surveys.

      During an enrollment meeting, study staff will request via an authorization form that
      participants allow approved members of the research staff to examine their electronic medical
      record for the duration of the study if they receive their care at a BWH-affiliated practice.
      This will confirm their &gt;10lb weight loss.

      At the end of every 10-week period, DC participants will receive an email with how much money
      they recouped. Participants who did not recoup the full amount they deposited must bring in a
      check to the following weigh-in to cover the difference so that participants have at least
      $100 deposited for the following 10-week period. Additionally, participants will have the
      option to use their initial study baseline weight, or be re-weighed for a new baseline weight
      for the following 10-week period, for which they will then use as their target weight. They
      will also have the option to increase or decrease their deposit for the upcoming 10-week
      period as needed.

      Each subject may skip non-consecutive weigh-ins without losing their weekly contribution.
      However, if subjects skip two or more consecutive weekly weigh-ins, participants may only
      recoup up to one of those skipped weigh-ins if they are successful in their weight management
      in the week that they return for a weigh-in. Skipped weigh-ins will not roll over into a new
      10-week period.

    <description>Surveys at baseline and at follow-up will assess a variety of factors associated with weight maintenance, such as how participants have lost and are seeking to lose weight; how satisfied they are with their weight; their motivation and confidence in losing and maintaining weight loss; and behaviors such as diet, exercise habits, and screen time. These factors will be examined with basic descriptive statistics. Survey analysis will assess whether some of these factors, specifically confidence and motivation to lose or maintain weight, are associated with the primary outcome of weight change at 1 year, using linear regression models.</description>

    <description>The deposit contract group will also complete weekly weigh-ins and receive emails about how their current weight compares to their baseline weight. In addition, the deposit contract group will be asked to make a deposit of at least $100 each 10-week period over the course of one year (50 weeks). Each week, they will recoup 1/10 of their 10-week deposit if they are within two pounds of their baseline weight or lower. If they are more than two pounds above their baseline weight, they will forfeit 1/10 of their 10-week deposit. The money they forfeited for that week will go into a collective pool to be divided up at the end of each 10-week period by all deposit contract participants who successfully maintained their weight loss at the end of the 10-week period.</description>

    <description>A deposit contract (DC) is an agreement in which study participants puts their own money at risk, with the goal of &quot;earning&quot; it back by achieving a goal, in this case maintaining prior weight loss. If DC participants successfully maintain their weight, they get their money back. If they are not successful, they lose their money. For each 10 week period for one year, DC participants will make a deposit of at least $100 but will be allowed to increase their contribution if they would prefer.</description>
