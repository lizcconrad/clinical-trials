  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II trial is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of
      nimotuzumab injection combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for initially inoperable
      locally advanced cervical cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For locally advanced cervical cancer, radical radiation with concurrent chemotherapy remains
      the standard treatment recommended by NCCN. However, in more than 35% of cases, tumor
      persistence recurrence or metastasis would occur after chemoradiation. Nimotuzumab, belongs
      to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, has proved to be useful in multiple solid tumors, such as
      NPC, colorectal cancer, etc.

      In recent years, nimotuzumab was also applied in recurrence or metastasis cervical cancer. It
      was proved to be well tolerated and might have a role in the treatment of advanced cervical
      cancer. However, there is no publication about nimotuzumab used in locally advanced cervical
      cancer.
