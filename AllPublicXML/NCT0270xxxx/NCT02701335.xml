  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand is a major cause of pain and functional limitation, central
      sensitization of pain can be one of the causes: this hypothesis opens avenues for research in
      the modulation of pain pathways. The peripherally directed therapies may modulate pain
      perception bilaterally. This hypothesis opens avenues for future research in the modulation
      of pain pathways, perhaps offering targets to optimize peripheral manual and physical
      therapies for pain management in hand OA.

      Several studies have reported the outcomes of multimodal approach to central sensitization
      evaluated by generalized pressure pain hypersensitivity in patients with carpometacarpal
      (CMC) OA. Neurodynamic techniques are a form of manual therapy directed to the neural
      structures through positioning and movement of multiple joints. Recent technologies have
      facilitated the use of robots as tools to assist patients in the rehabilitation process thus
      maximizing patient outcomes. These robotic tools assist the patient with carrying out
      exercise protocols, optimal for the activity of the control group.

PPT will be assessed bilaterally over the hand (first CMC at the center of the anatomical snuffbox, and unciform apophysis of the hamate bone), the C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, the median, ulnar and radial nerves, and tibialis anterior muscle by an assessor blinded to the subjects condition.</description>

    <description>The first 6 exercises consist of active range of motion movements of the hand designed to improve joint flexibility. The remaining 3 exercises are designed to strengthen grip and pinch by using a non-latex polymer ball: the Thera-Band Hand Exerciser (The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH) Subjects began with 10 repetitions the first 4 sessions, progressed to 12 repetitions the next 2 sessions, then 15 (2 sessions), and finally 20, if able, during the last sessions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Osteoarthritis of the dominant hand. To be included in the study, the subjects need to
             have a history of repetitive use of their dominant hand (eg, ex-factory worker) and a
             diagnosis of hand OA in the dominant hand, according on radiographic findings.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If they score greater than 6 points on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or more
             than 30 points in the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Patients with a medical
             history of carpal tunnel syndrome, surgical interventions to the hand, DeQuervain's
             tenosynovitis, or with degenerative or non-degenerative neurological conditions in
             which pain perception is altered will be excluded. None of the individuals in this
             study will have received prior interventions for hand OA.
