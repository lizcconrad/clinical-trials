      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most important public health burdens, and its prevalence
      has rapidly increased worldwide over the past decades. One of the most important
      complications of DM is nephropathy.

      Resveratrol (3, 5, 4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenolic compound belongs to the
      large group of polyphenols found in different plant species. The richest natural source of
      resveratrol is Polygonum cuspidatum â€” a plant root extract of which have been used in
      oriental folk medicine. Considerable amounts of resveratrol were also found in skin of red
      grapes, peanuts, groundnuts, and red vine.

      Resveratrol is considered to have beneficial effects on glucose tolerance and insulin
      sensitivity, the cardiovascular system, as it has been found to improve vasodilatation,
      ischaemic preconditioning, both of which seem to be the result of the activation of the
      endothelial NO synthase enzyme, and to inhibit both platelet aggregation and vascular smooth
      muscle cell proliferation. Resveratrol itself is an efficient antioxidant, as evidenced by
      both in vitro and in vivo studies, and, it has also been shown to improve diabetes-related
      impairments in animals.

      We hypothesized that resveratrol may have a favorable effects on control of diabetic
      nephropathy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effects of resveratrol in
      treatment of diabetic nephropathy.
