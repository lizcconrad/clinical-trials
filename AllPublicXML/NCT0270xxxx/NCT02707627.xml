  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new era of outcomes for pediatric burn patients has begun as burn care continues to
      improve. Unfortunately, complete restoration of burn-injured skin may be limited by the
      development of hypertrophic scarring. Treatment with ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser
      therapy is one of the newest forms of scar therapy available. Although laser therapy has only
      been adopted by burn clinicians within the last several years, early evidence suggests that
      it may offer significant benefits. Thus, the proposed study will answer the following
      research question: In children aged 1 to 18 years with a hypertrophic burn scar, is the
      addition of ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser therapy to standard scar management more
      effective at improving the appearance and texture of the scar compared to standard scar
      management alone, as measured by the Vancouver Scar Scale from baseline to month 12?
      Ultimately, the completion of this study may lead to a fundamental change in the standard
      treatment of pediatric hypertrophic burn scars. In addition, the study findings will also be
      applicable to children and adults with scars resulting from other etiologies.

      This will be a pragmatic, single-centre, 2-arm parallel-group controlled trial to be
      conducted at the Hospital for Sick Children Burn Program in Toronto, Canada. Blinding of
      clinicians and trial participants will not be possible due to the nature of the intervention;
      however, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded.

In addition, each participant will receive three sessions of laser therapy scheduled at two month intervals that will be carried out by a single burn surgeon.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 1-18 years at presentation

          2. Patients with a hypertrophic burn scar that has been clinically diagnosed by a burn
             care specialist (physician, nurse, or rehabilitation therapist)§

          3. Hypertrophic burn scar resulting from any etiology

          4. Hypertrophic burn scar is ≥ 2 months post healing

          5. Ability to complete English- language POSAS questionnaire § Hypertrophic burn scars
             are characterized by their symptomatic presentation (scars are typically raised, red,
             and stiff). The individuals who will be involved in the diagnosis will be experienced
             burn care providers and highly familiar with diagnosing hypertrophic burn scars.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        11) Patients with concomitant skin disease (i.e. chronic skin conditions, herpes infection)
        2) Patients with a history of keloid scarring 3) Patients who cannot tolerate the
        intravenous (IV) sedation used to perform laser therapy procedures § 4) Patients who have
        had previous laser therapy procedures

        § A standard checklist that was developed by the Anesthesiology Department at SickKids will
        be used to determine whether a patient can tolerate the IV sedation needed for laser
        procedures.
