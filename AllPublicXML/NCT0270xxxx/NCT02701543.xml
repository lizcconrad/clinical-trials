  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare two different Paclitaxel coated balloons in the treatment of high grade stenotic
      or occluded lesions in Superficial femoropopliteal artery (SFA )and/or Proximal Popliteal
      Artery in Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) patients with Rutherford class 2-4.

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center 1:1 randomized trial. Patients will be stratified
      according to lesion length (≤ 10 cm/ &gt; 10 cm and &lt; 20 cm / &gt; 20 cm and ≤ 30 cm). Each strata
      will include approximately 138 patients.

      The trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the Ranger™ Drug Coated Balloon in
      comparison to the IN.PACT™ Drug Coated Balloon in patients with symptomatic femoropoliteal
      artery disease.

      All enrolled subjects will be followed through to 24 months to assess the incidence of
      restenosis by ultrasound and major adverse events (MAE). Follow-up visits occur at 1, 6, 12
      and 24-month intervals per local standard of care.

      Up to 414 patients will be enrolled at approximately 10-18 sites in Germany for comparison
      between the following two groups:

      Treatment with the Ranger™ Paclitaxel Coated Balloon Catheter (Boston Scientific Corporation,
      Natick, MA, USA) vs. the IN.PACT™ Drug Eluting Balloon (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MI,
      USA).
