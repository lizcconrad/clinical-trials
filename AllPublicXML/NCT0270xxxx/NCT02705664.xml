      The main objective of this study is to compare subject adherence and satisfaction for two
      modes of treatment toenails infection (Onychomycosis) with Loceryl Nail Lacquer (Loceryl NL)
      and a Fungal Nail Treatment Set containing Urea 40% ointment (Urea) and Bifonazole cream 1%
      (Bifonazole).

      A total of 20 subjects are to be included in 1 site in Iceland

      Methodology:

      Subjects will receive following treatments on the right or left toenails:

        -  Loceryl Nail Lacquer (Loceryl NL) to be applied once weekly for 7 weeks on all affected
           toenails of one foot (including great toenail)

        -  Fungal Nail Treatment Set to be used on all affected toenails (including great toenail)
           of the opposite foot in two phases:

             -  Phase I: Urea ointment (Urea) to be applied once a day under occlusion for 2-3
                weeks depending on the achievement of optimal diseased toenail plates removal

             -  Phase II: Bifonazole cream to (Bifonazole) be applied for 4 weeks on affected
                toenails (after the maximum 3-week treatment period with Urea ointment)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinically Distal and Lateral Subungual Onychomycosis (DLSO) due to
             dermatophytes and/or yeast (including Candida) on at least one great toenail of each
             foot at screening visit,

          -  Subjects with less than 50% of the toenail surface area from the Distal edge with
             disease involvement and without matrix involvement, no dermatophytoma, streaks
             (spikes) or subungual hyperkeratosis &gt; 2mm,

          -  Subjects should have the same number of affected toenails on both feet or no more than
             one additional affected toenail on one of the feet,

          -  Subjects with positive mycological results (direct microscopy and culture) of the most
             affected toenail (or great toenail) for dermatophytes or yeast (including Candida) at
             Baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with matrix involvement on the great toenails,

          -  Subjects with a surgical, medical condition or clinically important abnormal physical
             findings which might interfere with the interpretation of the objectives of the study

          -  Post-traumatic toenail, lichen planus, eczema, psoriasis, or other abnormalities of
             the nail unit, which could affect/influence the subject's compliance with the
             investigational products or mask the effects of treatment (cure),

          -  Known immunodeficiency, radiation therapy, immune suppressive drugs,
