      One of the most effective strategies to decrease radiation exposure during ureteroscopy is to
      use low dose. However, the quality of the image obtained is inferior to full dose image. The
      main concern is to maintain the stone free and complication rate despite the inferior quality
      of image obtained. Our aim was to evaluate if reducing the dose of fluoroscopy to ¼ instead
      of full dose would impact in a reduction of total radiation exposure despite a possible
      increase in fluoroscopy time. Also, if this strategy would impact in operation time, stone
      free rate and complication rate of unilateral semi-rigid ureteroscopy for ureteral stone
      treatment due too less than optimal fluoroscopy image. All patients over 18 years old
      diagnosed with ureteral stone from 5 mm to 20 mm in diameter by CT scan were counseled
      regarding their treatment options. Patients who failed spontaneous passage or medical
      treatment or chose endourologic treatment were included in this study. Patients with abnormal
      urinary anatomy such as horseshoe kidney, pelvic kidney or duplex system were excluded from
      the study.

      Several studies support an association between increasing cancer risk with increasing
      exposure to radiation. Typical radiation exposure for a patient submitted to ureteroscopy
      ranges from 2.5 to 100 mSv. The International Commission on Radiological Protection
      recommends an annual occupational radiation exposure limit of no more than 50 mSv per year.

    <description>Each group of patients (1/4 dose and full dose) will have assigned one dosimeter to assess the radiation exposure every procedure. The sum of radiation of each group will be compared at the completion of the study (2 years) , because individual radiation exposure is too low to be measured. Radiation exposure will be measured (data stored inside the dosimeter) by dosimeter in mSv units at each procedure and the total sum of radiation will be done at the end of the study (2 years).</description>
