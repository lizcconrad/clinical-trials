  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical clowns are known to assist in relaxing children and allowing better cooperation
      during performance of medical procedures.

      The ability of medical clowns to improve the motivation of children to perform active tasks
      was never examined to date.

      The investigators would like to examine the influence of the clowns' presence on the
      performance of pulmonary function test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to evaluate the performance of pulmonary function tests among
      preschool children aged 3-6 years.

      Overall 200 children will participate.

      The children will perform pulmonary function test without a clown present.

      About an hour later half of them will perform the exam again with a medical clown assistance
      and the second half will repeat the examination without a clown present the differences
      between the performance will be evaluated.
