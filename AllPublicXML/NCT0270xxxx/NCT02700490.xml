  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial, which aims to examine the short-term
      strategy of addressing treatment gap through increasing primary mental health service
      capacity. This study aims to compare after 6 months and 12 months, the effectiveness of a
      specialist model of mental health care and an enhanced usual care (task-sharing) framework,
      in terms of reducing mental health symptoms, reducing disability, and improving quality of
      life, as well as the health services costs (and potentially societal costs) associated with
      these outcomes in 400 patients.

    <textblock>
      Two primary mental health service frameworks in Yogyakarta are compared: the specialist
      framework and the enhanced usual care framework. Both frameworks have not been evaluated in
      the Indonesian context, despite their potential to be the framework of choice for other
      provincial and district governments to adopt. Extension to existing services has been
      planned, which provides us with the opportunity to implement in a random manner the enhanced
      usual care framework in new areas.

      This study aims to compare after 6 months and 12 months, the effectiveness of a specialist
      model of mental health care and an enhanced usual care (task-sharing) framework, in terms of
      reducing mental health symptoms, reducing disability, and improving quality of life, as well
      as the health services costs (and potentially societal costs) associated with these outcomes
      in 400 patients. This study receives ground-level support from the Centre for Public Mental
      Health, Universitas Gadjah Mada, which manages the specialist primary mental health framework
      in Yogyakarta province, regional and national-level support from the Ministry of Health of
      Indonesia, and will be hopefully funded by the LPDP, Ministry of Finance of Indonesia.
