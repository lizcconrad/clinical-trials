  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to determine if using FloTrac/EV1000
      system in neurosurgical patients undergoing craniotomies for aneurysm repair or tumor
      resection complicated by cerebral edema, or complex spinal surgery including multi-level
      scoliosis correction, is a more effective way of monitoring fluid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the ability to assess volume status and fluid responsiveness with
      information gained from Edwards FloTrac/EV1000 system coupled with a goal-directed therapy
      fluid management algorithm can make a difference in patient outcomes. Our specific aims are:

        -  Demonstrate goal-directed therapy (GDT) in fluid management improves peri-operative
           fluid balance

        -  Demonstrate GDT improves pulmonary function and organ oxygenation

        -  Demonstrate GDT reduces necessary therapeutic interventions in the peri- operative
           period

        -  Demonstrate GDT reduces hypotensive episodes in the peri-operative period

      Outcomes

      We will study the consequences of goal-directed fluid therapy that employs use of dynamic
      indicators seen on FloTrac/EV1000 system by measuring the following:

        -  Pulmonary status

             -  Time to extubation

             -  Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient of oxygen

             -  Requirements for supplemental oxygen

        -  Organ oxygenation

             -  Serum lactate

             -  Arterial blood gas values (pH, HCO3, CO2, O2)

        -  Length of stay (LOS)

             -  In hospital, defined as time from operation start to eligibility for discharge from
                hospital according to surgeon in accordance with pre-define criteria

             -  In ICU/PACU, defined as time from operation end to eligibility for discharge from
                intensive care according to attending intensivist in accordance with pre- define
                criteria

        -  Fluid Balance

             -  Inputs and outputs (I/Os) of all measurable fluids (i.e. blood, crystalloid,
                colloid) in peri-operative period, through and including duration of intensive care
                or the next 24-48 hours after completion of surgery

             -  Drugs administered for fluid management (i.e. mannitol, vasopressors)

             -  Pre-operative and post-operative body weights and twice-daily weights via bed
                weights

        -  Hypotension

             -  Number, duration and severity (i.e. minimum blood pressure) of hypotensive episode,
                defined as MAP &lt;65

    <description>Anesthesiologist will be able to see the dynamic indicators, and will be given a study algorithm to follow, based on the trending data, for the duration of the surgery. Anesthesiologist may choose to discontinue the study algorithm at any time based on his or her best clinical judgment. Clinical judgment can and must always override the study protocol if discrepancy exists. If this occurs, the patient would be considered to fail the protocol, and be considered in a separate group in data analysis.</description>

    <description>FloTrac will be connected to the monitor, the anesthesiologist will not be able to see the monitor although the data will be collected and stored for analysis. Anesthesiologist will be asked to choose from the same drug and fluid options used in the GDT group (phenylephrine, epinephrine, normal saline, albumin, Voluven), but to be used in accordance with their best clinical judgment without the aid of FloTrac data. If a discrepancy exists, the attending anesthesiologist may choose to use other therapies not included in the GDT protocol, in accordance with their best clinical judgment. If this happens, the subject would be considered to fail the protocol, and be considered in a separate group in data analysis.</description>
