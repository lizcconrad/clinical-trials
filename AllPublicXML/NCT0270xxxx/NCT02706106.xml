  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a controlled clinical trial randomized, double-blind evaluator. Will be considered
      eligible patients, individuals of both sexes, aged 40 -60, to submit at least four items of
      knee osteoarthrosis classification criteria, according to the American College of
      Rheumatology, pain above four points in the visual analogue scale (VAS), diagnosed with knee
      osteoarthritis and who sought physical therapy treatment.

      Patients will be randomized by a number sequence generated by a computer using Microsoft
      Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington), in opaque envelopes by researcher who
      will not attend the study.Patients will be divided into two groups: group with knee patellar
      hole or group without knee patellar hole. Shortly after the selection of the knee, the
      patient will have his eyes blind or cover in order to keep it '' blind '' regarding the type
      of knee brace that it would use.

      Finally evaluator 1 will cover the knee with a black cloak, making the second evaluator
      ''blind '' regarding the type of knee brace that will be used.

      Two investigators will carry out the data collection. The first evaluator will collect
      information on the clinical characteristics of patients, including evaluation form, numerical
      pain scale, which measures the intensity of pain, test Time Up and Go (TUG) test that
      measures the basic mobility of movement and test walking eight meters, whose purpose is to
      measure the time that the individual takes to walk a distance of eight meters.

    <description>Change on agility will be measured before wearing the knee brace (baseline) and compared to right after or maximum five minutes after wearing the brace knee evaluation. Agility will be assessed by 8 Meter Walk test. The time to complete this test will be recorded by the researchers and this time will be the result considered for comparison from baseline and after wearing the knee brace.</description>

    <description>Patients will be prepared to receive the device of knee brace with a hole in the sit position. This intervention will be blinded. Patients will receive a mask covering their eyes and the knee brace will be placed by the researchers, then the knee area will be covered with a dark clothing bag, so the patient will not be able to guess which type of brace is wearing (with or without a hole). Patient will perform the tests without the mask covering their eyes and only the dark clot bag on their knee.</description>
