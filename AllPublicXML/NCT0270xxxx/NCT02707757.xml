  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia in dialysis patients requires treatment with frequent dose adjustments. There are two
      current possible treatments for anaemia which are iron and erythropoietin stimulating agents
      (ESA). Dosages of these medications are currently guided by a patient's ferritin levels and
      haemoglobin, but these markers are known to be inaccurate. The current clinical protocol
      therefore tends towards overuse of both agents which can be associated with toxicity, and the
      reliance on these markers prevents retrospective assessment of treatment responsiveness. This
      study is designed to investigate the factors which predict which agent would produce a better
      response. Patients with a fall in haemoglobin will be given treatment with either iron or an
      increased dose of ESA as they are currently, but allocated at random rather than by poorly
      performing biochemical markers. The iron treated and ESA treated groups can then be analysed
      for factors which predict response in o

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All prevalent haemodialysis patients of the Imperial Renal and Transplant Centre will
             be eligible for inclusion if they have been on dialysis for more than 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a bone marrow disorder, active infection or active malignancy will be
             excluded as these are non-renal causes of anaemia. Patients unable to give informed
             consent will also not be included within the study.
