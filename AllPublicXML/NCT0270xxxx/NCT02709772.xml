    <textblock>
      10 Clinics within Stanford Health Care are randomized to receive or not receive provider
      alerts for 5 commonly overused tests and treatments.

      Thus there will potentially be 50 clinics enrolled across the 5 tests/treatment categories.
      However, it is expected that some clinics will meet criteria to be one of the 10 clinics in
      more than test/treatment category. Thus the total number of clinics involved will be between
      10 and 50.

      These 5 tests / treatments are taken from the Choosing Wisely list. All alerts will be
      provided using the electronic medical record and will be automated.

    <description>There are five primary outcomes for the five different alerts. For each alert study the outcome will be orders that would qualify for an alert per 100 patients.</description>

    <description>There will be five secondary outcomes which will be the alert candidate to order ratio. For both the control and intervention groups we will determine the fraction of orders that qualify for an alert.</description>
