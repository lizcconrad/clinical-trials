      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. determine if a smartphone enhanced treatment for LETS ACT (LETS ACT-SE) is associated
           with increased long term treatment engagement, and in turn, improved long term treatment
           outcomes, and

        2. use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the effects of LETS ACT-SE
           on the neuromarkers of reward sensitivity.

    <textblock>
      Comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) and depression is highly prevalent and associated with
      elevated rates of post treatment relapse to substance use, HIV risk behavior, and associated
      poor mental and physical health outcomes. Further, rates of substance use and depression
      disproportionately affect minority groups and those living in poverty. Although efficacious,
      the often complex, specialized nature of CBT poses problems in its integration into substance
      use treatment programs. Budget cuts for mental health and substance use treatment both
      nationally and in the state of North Carolina, reduce availability of publically funded
      treatment programs and staff to patient ratios. To address this limitation, a behavioral
      activation (BA) treatment, the Life Enhancement Treatment for Substance Use (LETS ACT), was
      developed to treat depressive symptoms among a predominantly African American sample of low
      income illicit drug users currently receiving residential substance use treatment.
      Collectively, two Stage I studies and 1 year follow-up data from the investigators Stage II
      R01DA026424 indicate that compared to a control condition, LETS ACT is associated with
      significantly better outcomes for treatment retention, post treatment abstinence, HIV sexual
      risk behavior, depressive symptoms, and environmental reward.

      Although these strong outcomes suggest that LETS ACT may be ready for a Stage III
      dissemination trial, it is of note that there was a significant indirect effect of LETS ACT
      homework compliance on post treatment substance use and HIV sexual risk behavior via the
      theoretically proposed BA mechanism of action, environmental reward. In the context of
      limited access to care, these findings point to the need to identify cost-effective
      delivery-vehicles to increase treatment engagement outside of clinician sessions. Further,
      identifying neuroscience based biomarkers (neuromarkers) underlying key theoretical aspects
      of BA (i.e., reward sensitivity), and their relation to heterogeneity in BA treatment
      response among substance users with depression, are critical for the identification of
      accurately targeted interventions.
