  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our past work it was found that many drivers had high blood pressure, and lifestyles that
      led to being overweight and not having cancer screenings performed. The investigators are now
      adding to the Health Fairs' usual program different ways of following up with drivers who
      attend our Health Fairs. The investigators are doing this because they want to find the best
      way to help drivers manage high blood pressure, and reduce cancer risk, by maintaining a
      healthy weight and increasing colorectal cancer screening.

      * If critically abnormal values are identified during the health fair, under the advisement
      of the clinician, the driver may be escorted by trained staff directly to a health care
      facility for immediate medical follow-up

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male

          -  Hypertensive-level readings over three weeks, with at least two of three elevated BP
             readings (systolic ≥140 and/or diastolic ≥90); OR

          -  One hypertensive crisis readings (systolic ≥165 and/or diastolic ≥100) {eligible for
             the study without having to return for second or third readings} OR

          -  have a known diagnosis of hypertension and have elevated values at one reading
             {eligible for the study without having to return for second or third readings}

          -  Over 19 years of age (we are selecting participants older than three years past the
             legal driving age of 16, as younger drivers tend to change jobs more often);

          -  Planning on remaining in NYC for at least 9 months (with no vacations or trips to
             exceed two months)

          -  Licensed taxi driver for at least 3 months;

          -  Speaks English, Spanish, Bengali, Urdu, or French;

          -  Owns a cell phone that can receive text messages and is willing to receive text
             messages for this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Part-time driver (drives fewer than 35 hours per week). Although it is highly unlikely
             for NYC taxi drivers to work for multiple garages at study baseline, drivers may
             switch jobs and/or their garage base affiliation while participating in this study.
             New jobs and/or garage base affiliations will be tracked during follow-up assessments
             and noted for potential limitations with study retention and intervention
             contamination. Drivers will be allowed to continue the study even if they are no
             longer working with the initial garage base.

          -  Driver currently has (or has a history of) any CVD including coronary artery disease,
             angina or aortic stenosis; this does not include hypertension.
