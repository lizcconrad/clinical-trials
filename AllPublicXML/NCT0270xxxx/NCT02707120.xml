  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurotrophic keratitis (NK) is a rare degenerative corneal disease caused by altered
      innervation of the trigeminal nerve that leads to rupture of the corneal epithelium, the
      regeneration deterioration and development of corneal ulceration, their fusion, and
      perforation The main characteristic in the NK is a decrease or absence of corneal
      sensitivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of treatment in the neurotrophic keratitis are prevent the progression of corneal
      damage, maintain eye structure and improve the transparency of the cornea. Therapy should be
      initiated early and based on the clinical stage of the disease because it depends on
      epithelial state and in the degree of corneal hypoesthesia.

      Plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) represent a new technology using autologous
      proteins, growth factors and biomaterials as therapeutic formulations for different
      regenerative purposes. Under strict pharmaceutical development, it is possible to develop
      biologically stable eye drops, which have been shown to be useful for treating diverse ocular
      surface diseases. PRGF-Endoret eye drops could be an alternative therapy for patients with
      NK, and thus the objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate its possible efficacy and
      its safety in patients with NK in stages 2 and 3.
