  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase IV, open-label, single-arm study to assess the safety and the necessity
      of dose adjustment after switching to FLOLAN injection prepared with the reformulated diluent
      in Japanese patients with PAH who are receiving higher doses of FLOLAN injection than in
      other countries. The objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the thermostable
      formulation of FLOLAN injection (that is [i.e.], FLOLAN injection prepared with the
      reformulated diluent) when switched from the existing FLOLAN injection treatment (i.e.,
      FLOLAN injection prepared with the currently marketed diluent). The study will include a
      screening visit, a run-in period of a maximum of 4 weeks with the existing FLOLAN treatment
      (i.e., FLOLAN injection prepared with the currently marketed diluent), a 4-week treatment
      period with the thermostable formulation of FLOLAN injection (i.e., FLOLAN injection prepared
      with the reformulated diluent) and a one-week follow-up visit. Adequate number of subjects
      will be enrolled in the study in order to have 10 subjects to complete assessments at 4
      weeks, including at least 5 subjects as a subset of subjects who consent to undergo right
      heart catheterisation (RHC) over 24-hour and at Week 4. FLOLAN is a registered trademark of
      the GlaxoSmithKline [GSK] group of companies.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical events which may require medical or surgical interventions. Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population: comprised of all participants who have received at least one dose of the thermostable formulation of FLOLAN.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study consisted a screening visit, a Run-in period of a maximum of 30 days observation, a 4-week treatment period with the thermostable formulation of FLOLAN, and a one-week follow-up visit.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Ten participants (par.) who gave consent and passed the screening assessments were enrolled in the Run-in period. After the Run-in period, par. underwent Baseline assessments and were switched to thermostable formulation of FLOLAN. All par. underwent right heart catheterisation (RHC) up to 24 hours and at Week 4 after switching to study treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Japanese par. with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) received FLOLAN prepared with the current marketed diluent (epoprostenol sodium + Potential of Hydrogen [pH] 10.2-10.8 diluent) for Injection in run-in period for a maximum of 30 days, and then switched to FLOLAN prepared with new diluent (epoprostenol sodium + pH 11.7-12.3 diluent) for Injection for 4-weeks in the treatment period. Par. received dose of 47.6 to 113.8 nanogram per kilogram per minute (ng/kg/min) during the treatment period.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical events which may require medical or surgical interventions. Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population: comprised of all participants who have received at least one dose of the thermostable formulation of FLOLAN.</description>

        <description>A safety 12-lead ECG was performed at Baseline (BL), 24 hr after switching to the new Flolan diluent and Week 4 (W4). Any abnormal clinically significant (CS) and not clinically significant (NCS) findings were reported. ECG abnormaility with respect to CS and NCS findings were judged by the investigator. The Baseline values are those collected within 0.5 hr prior to the first dose of the new diluent formulation (‘Visit 2 - Baseline’)</description>

The Baseline values are those collected within 0.5 hr prior to the first dose of the new diluent formulation (‘Visit 2 - Baseline’). Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose visit value and the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Number of Events to Adjust Dose of FLOLAN Based on the Change From Baseline to 3 Hours in Mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure (mPAP)</title>
        <description>To assess the frequency of dose adjustment requirements based on the changes from baseline in mPAP up to 3 hours after dosing.The Baseline values are those collected within 0.5 hr prior to the first dose of the new diluent formulation (‘Visit 2 - Baseline’). Participants who gave consent to undergo right heart catheterisation (RHC) over 24-hour and at week 4 were assessed. Change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the post-dose visit value and the Baseline value.</description>
