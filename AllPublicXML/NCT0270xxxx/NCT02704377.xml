    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies quality of life and supportive care preferences following
      radiation therapy in prostate cancer survivors. Studying quality of life and supportive care
      preferences in patients undergoing radiation therapy may help identify the effects of
      treatment on patients with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop an understanding of the impacts of prostate cancer on aspects of psychological
      stress, physiological stress and health related quality of life (HRQL) for men who are being
      treated with some level of radiation therapy (RT).

      II. To gain insight into the perceived needs of survivors depending on their disease stage,
      treatment regimen and side effects.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether biomarkers of stress, inflammation and autonomic control (heart rate
      variability [HRV]) can confirm or dispel the self-reported measures of psychological distress
      and HRQL of a unique population of aging men with prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete questionnaires about quality of life and preferences for supportive
      care treatment, undergo heart rate variability testing over 10-15 minutes while both lying
      down and standing, complete a walking test, wear an accelerometer for a period of 1 week, and
      undergo a single intelligent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (iDXA) scan over 10 minutes.
