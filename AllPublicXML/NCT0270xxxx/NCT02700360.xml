      A Randomized, Open-Label, Single -Dose, Crossover, Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the
      Effect of Food on the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of EC-18 after Oral
      Administration in Healthy Volunteers

    <textblock>
      In vitro and in vivo efficacy studies and clinical trials have shown that EC-18 has a mode of
      action of improving neutropenia by promoting neutrophil production from hematopoietic stem
      cells and at the same time, efficiently controlling STAT6/Complement 3(C 3), suggesting its
      potential to be developed as an orally administered new drug for treatment of neutropenia
      resulting from decreased neutrophils caused by administration of an anticancer agent.

      This study is a randomized, open-Label, single -dose, crossover, phase I clinical trial to
      evaluate the effect of food on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EC-18 after
      oral administration in healthy volunteers

    <description>This trial is conducted as a randomized, open-label, single -dose, crossover, phase I to evaluate the effect of food on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EC-18. EC-18 is given at an oral, once daily in condition of empty stomach and a high fat diet(900~1,000 kcal, contains 50~60%lipid).This trial is divided into Part 1(1,000mg dose) and Part 2(500mg dose and 2,000mg dose), 12 subjects are included in each dose and cross-over period is 7 days. After Part 1 study, If primary PK parameters of EC-18 is affected by food and AEs meeting study discontinuation criteria are not reported, Part 2 will proceed in consecutive order with registering new subjects.</description>
