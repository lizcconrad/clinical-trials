    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer survivors experience long-term negative physical and psychosocial
      consequences of their disease. There is a critical need to develop novel behavioral
      interventions for improving colorectal cancer survivor outcomes. The investigators have
      developed a pain management intervention for colorectal cancer survivors that focuses on
      addressing both pain and psychological distress. Colorectal cancer survivors who endorse pain
      and comorbid psychological distress as a concern during a clinic-based survivorship care
      consult will be recruited. Participants will be randomized into either: Telephone-Based
      Coping Skills Training (CST) for pain and comorbid psychological distress or standard care.
      The CST condition will receive 5 sessions of a cognitive behavior theory-based protocol that
      teaches coping skills (e.g., relaxation, activity pacing/planning, cognitive restructuring)
      relevant to managing pain and psychological distress. The standard care control condition
      will receive resources and referrals related to managing survivorship health.
