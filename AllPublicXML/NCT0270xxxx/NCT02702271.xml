    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center investigation to establish the
      safety and effectiveness of the WATCHMAN FLX™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device for
      subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are eligible for long-term
      anti-coagulation therapy to reduce the risk of stroke but who have a rationale to seek a
      non-pharmacologic alternative.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is of legal age to participate in the study per the laws of their
             respective geography.

          2. The subject has documented paroxysmal, persistent, permanent or long-term/longstanding
             persistent non-valvular atrial fibrillation (i.e., the subject has not been diagnosed
             with rheumatic mitral valvular heart disease).

          3. The subject is eligible for the defined protocol pharmacologic regimen of warfarin and
             antiplatelet therapy following WATCHMAN FLX Device implant.

          4. The subject is eligible to come off warfarin therapy if the LAA is sealed (i.e., the
             subject has no other conditions that would require long-term warfarin therapy
             suggested by current standard medical practice).

          5. The subject has a calculated CHADS2 score of 2 or greater or a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3
             or greater.

          6. The subject is able to understand and willing to provide written informed consent to
             participate in the trial.

          7. The subject is able and willing to return for required follow-up visits and
             examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly interfere with the current study, except when the subject is
             participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry
             with no associated treatments. Each instance must be brought to the attention of the
             sponsor to determine eligibility, regardless of type of co-enrollment being proposed.

          2. The subject requires long-term anticoagulation therapy for reasons other than
             AF-related stroke risk reduction, for example due to an underlying hypercoaguable
             state (i.e., even if the device is implanted, the subjects would not be eligible to
             discontinue warfarin due to other medical conditions requiring chronic warfarin
             therapy).

          3. The subject is contraindicated for warfarin therapy.

          4. The subject is contraindicated or allergic to aspirin.

          5. Subject is contraindicated for clopidogrel (P2Y12 inhibitor for Japan).

          6. The subject is indicated for clopidogrel (P2Y12 inhibitor for Japan) therapy or has
             taken clopidogrel (P2Y12 inhibitor for Japan) within 7 days prior to the WATCHMAN FLX
             Device implant.

          7. The subject had or is planning to have any cardiac or non-cardiac invasive or surgical
             procedure within 30 days prior to or 60 days after the WATCHMAN FLX Device implant
             (including, but not limited to: cardioversion, coronary angiogram with or without
             percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), cardiac ablation, cataract surgery,
             endoscopy, etc.).

          8. The subject had a prior stroke (of any cause, whether ischemic or hemorrhagic) or
             transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the 90 days prior to enrollment.

          9. The subject has had a myocardial infarction (MI) documented in the clinical record as
             either a non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) or as an ST-elevation MI (STEMI), with or
             without intervention, within 90 days prior to enrollment.

         10. The subject has a history of atrial septal repair or has an ASD/PFO device.

         11. The subject has an implanted mechanical valve prosthesis in any position.

         12. The subject currently or has had any documented history of, New York Heart Association
             Class IV Congestive Heart Failure.

         13. The subject is of childbearing potential and is, or plans to become pregnant during
             the time of the study (method of assessment upon study physician's discretion).
