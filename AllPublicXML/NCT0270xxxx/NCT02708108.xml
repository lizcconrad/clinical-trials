    <textblock>
      This study tests the ability of a focused dietary, exercise, and activity intervention to
      reduce fat gain during induction therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia to
      improve disease response and reduce toxicity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our previous study, we have observed that: 1) nearly half ALL patients are overweight or
      obese at diagnosis, 2) all patients, regardless of starting weight, gain significant fat mass
      over the first month of therapy (on average 20-30%), and 3) obesity at the time of diagnosis
      is associated with a higher likelihood of poor response to chemotherapy as evidenced by
      persistent leukemia (minimal residual disease) after induction therapy. Together, these data
      show that body fat is a significant risk factor for ALL treatment failure, and that its
      negative effects are evident within the first month of treatment. Recent laboratory and
      clinical data illustrates the ability of diet restriction and physical activity to improve
      chemotherapy efficacy, reduce treatment-related toxicities and better overall quality of
      life.

      Given the importance of successful induction therapy for ALL in predicting long term survival
      and the negative role of obesity on treatment success, this study tests a complete
      personalized dietary and exercise intervention for pre-adolescents, adolescents, and young
      adults newly diagnosed with B-precursor ALL (&quot;pre-B ALL&quot;) that aims to reduce fat gained
      during induction therapy and thereby improve treatment response, toxicity rates, and quality
      of life.
