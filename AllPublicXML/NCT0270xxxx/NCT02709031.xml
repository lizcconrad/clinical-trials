  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cicletanine, which has been approved and launched for hypertension in France and Germany, has
      promise beyond hypertension in critically-unmet needs such as diabetes. It is evident from in
      vitro, animal and human studies that cicletanine's optimal dose in diabetes and other
      challenging, critically-unmet needs is likely to be higher than that for hypertension.
      Cicletanine's maximum tolerated dosage is not known, but the drug's dose-limiting effects are
      documented to be potassium loss and sodium loss from thiazide-type activity (one of the
      therapeutic mechanisms the drug is known to have); such thiazide-type losses are known to be
      reversed safely by magnesium. This trial explores the ability of magnesium to enhance
      cicletanine safety at higher doses in a trial involving patients with hypertension
      complicated by diabetes.

    <description>Cicletanine is an orally-dosed furopyridine drug launched or hypertension in France in 1988 (and soon thereafter in Germany by IPSEN. While the drug's maximum tolerated dose is not known, the principal concern (and so far only material concern) at higher doses is the decrease in levels of sodium and potassium. Trials so far have take n the drug up to 400 mg QD (once daily); it was well tolerated at that dose. The drug has had an excellent safety profile in its ~1.8 million patient-years of post-launch experience,
Magnesium is being added to cicletanine in order to decrease losses of potassium and sodium, thereby enhancing cicletanine's safety at higher doses.</description>
