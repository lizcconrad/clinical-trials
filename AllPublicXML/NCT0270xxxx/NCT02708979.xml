  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity as well as metabolic and disease
      consequences, are well-documented. The positive energy balance underlying obesity is
      attributable to excess energy intake and/or insufficient energy expenditure. However, it
      seems that the increase in mean body weight can be sufficiently explained by increases in
      mean energy intake. It has been proposed that this overeating is partly caused by increased
      availability of highly processed energy dense, high reward foods. Psychosocial stress and
      sleep insufficiency is pervasive in industrialized societies. A growing body of evidence
      suggests stress to be involved in obesity, although it is unknown whether stress is a cause
      or consequence. Stress affecting dietary intake; skewing intake towards greater consumption
      of highly palatable energy dense foods, also referred to as high reward foods. A causal
      relationship between stress and reward seeking behavior is supported by findings from animal
      studies reporting rewarding behavior by consumption of sweet tasting food in response to a
      stressor.

      Our aim is to investigate differences in purchases of particular food-items in free living
      individuals, during a stressful (upcoming exam) and non-stressful (no upcoming exam) period.

      Hypothesis: Participants will purchase more high reward foods during the pre-exam period,
      compared to the control non-exam period.

      STUDY METHODS

      Study design:

      The study is a randomized controlled two-armed cross-over intervention study. The study is
      carried out in 50 healthy university students, both genders. In random order the participants
      will be investigated during stressful-period (prior to an exam) and a non-stressful (control
      period) period. Each participant will take part in all together four visits, two in the
      stressful period and two visits in the non-stressful period.

      The study will take place, at the Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports (NEXS),
      Faculty of Science at the University of Copenhagen, Rolighedsvej 26, 1958 Frederiksberg C.
      Recruitment will take place at the University of Copenhagen

      STATISTICAL ANALYSES Analysis of the primary outcome (food choices) will be based on an
      ANCOVA-type linear mixed model with the intervention and allocation order as the fixed effect
      and person as the random effect. Analysis will be performed using the software R, SAS, STATA
      or SPSS. Analyses, data processing and writing of the article are expected to extend over the
      study period and a year beyond.
