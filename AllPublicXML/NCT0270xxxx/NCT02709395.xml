      This study is designed as an open, prospective, single arm, multicenter study in order to
      investigate patient satisfaction, perception and compliance for the novel Navina Smart, a
      transanal irrigation (TAI) system. Approximately 30 male and female subjects who are
      currently practicing TAI, will be followed during a 4-week period of use of Navina Smart.
      Observational data on satisfaction, perception, compliance, bowel regimen, TAI therapy and
      TAI frequency will be collected via patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires.
