  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to determine whether mitochondrial function in circulating
      cells is related to that measured in the muscle fibers of the same subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data from human and animal models strongly suggests that reduced tissue mitochondrial
      function can be an early marker for detection of dysfunctional metabolism. It is unclear if
      tissue mitochondrial dysfunction can be detected using less invasive methodology. In this
      project, the investigators plan to study mitochondrial bioenergetics in circulating cells and
      paired muscle biopsies in two metabolic disparate groups of women; healthy lean vs. obese
      insulin resistant women of similar age. Women of similar age that are either healthy lean or
      insulin resistant and obese will be recruited to participate in one study that includes a
      blood draw and a muscle biopsy. Mitochondrial function in circulating blood cells and muscle
      tissue will be determined.

    <description>Skeletal muscle (m.vastus lateralis) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) mitochondrial respiration will be determined in response to substrate inhibitor coupling protocols using high resolution respirometry.
From this, mitochondrial respiration in leak and coupled states, and reserve respiratory capacity can be determined in mitochondria from skeletal muscle and from PBMCs. It will be determined whether mitochondrial function in circulating cells is related to that measured in the muscle tissue of the same subjects.</description>
