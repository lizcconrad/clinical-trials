  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility trial, testing the hypothesis that among sedentary mothers of
      behaviorally at-risk preschool-aged children, those who receive behavioral parent training
      (BPT) programs and concurrently increase their physical activity levels will demonstrate
      improved parenting and child behavior outcomes compared to those who receive BPT but remain
      sedentary.

      The investigators will randomly assign 20 participants to two groups: behavioral parent
      training plus contingency management to increase steps (BPT+CM) or behavioral parent training
      alone (BPT). Contingency management procedures will involve monetary rewards for meeting
      weekly step-count goals.

      The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1) assess the feasibility of the study
      design and procedures, 2) assess the acceptability of the BPT+CM condition to participants,
      and 3) determine whether a signal of an effect of increased physical activity exists (via
      preliminary comparisons of measures of fatigue, perceived energy, parenting behaviors,
      parenting sense of competence, parenting stress, and child behavior ratings between
      participants in the two conditions).

      This innovative pilot study will prepare us for a fully powered trial to test the efficacy of
      this approach.
