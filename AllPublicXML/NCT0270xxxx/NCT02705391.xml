  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We intend to investigate the clinical application of two emerging imaging modalities for
      which the technical capability is currently in place at Mayo Clinic. The treatment of Ewing
      Sarcoma (ES), Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients on this study
      will involve multi-disciplinary contributions from nationally recognized sarcoma experts in
      Radiation Oncology, Radiology, Orthopedic Surgery, Pediatric Oncology, Medical Oncology and
      Pathology.

      Patients will undergo additional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at the same time as the
      standard imaging.

      The ability to compare several imaging modalities within a single cohort of patients
      maximizes the potential of the study to impact the future management of sarcoma patients. The
      collaborative nature of this study, with essential contributions from many departments will
      undoubtedly improve the coordinated care of sarcoma patients and naturally disseminate the
      advanced imaging experience that is acquired.
