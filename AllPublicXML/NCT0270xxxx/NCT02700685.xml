    <textblock>
      This double blind, randomised controlled trial examines the effect of a commercially
      available nutritional supplement on behaviour of ADHD patients, as well as on their physical
      and psychiatric co-morbidities, and level of oxidative stress and immune activity, as
      compared to placebo and standard pharmaceutical treatment for ADHD.
