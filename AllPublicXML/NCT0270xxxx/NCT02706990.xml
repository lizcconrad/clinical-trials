    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the in vivo kinematics of TKA performed with two
      different prosthesis: a kinematic retaining (Physica KR) and a posterior-stabilized (Physica
      PS) design by means of fluoroscopic analysis during activities of daily living (rising from a
      chair, stairs climbing, leg extension). In comparison with asymptomatic knee. Patterns of
      femoral rollback will be analyzed to assess if they are motor-task dependent and correlated
      with clinical outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients submitted to Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with Physica KR or PS;

          2. Patients with an appropriate initial fixation and stability of the knee prosthesis;

          3. Patients achieving a minimum flexion of 100° or a Knee Society Score (KSS) ≥ 65
             (fair/good postoperative outcome) at 6-month follow-up;

          4. Patients affected by primary or secondary Osteoarthritis (OA) before surgery;

          5. Patients who understand the requirements of the study and are willing and able to
             comply with activities required for fluoroscopic examination;

          6. Patients who have signed the Ethics Committee approved study-specific Informed Consent
             Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with misalignment or axial malrotation of the knee prosthesis;

          2. Patients not able to achieve a minimum flexion of 100° or with a KSS Knee Score ≤ 65
             points at 6-month follow-up;

          3. Patients who had or have planned a surgery on their uninvolved knee within a year;

          4. Muscular insufficiency or absence of muscololigamentous supporting structures required
             for adequate soft tissue balance;

          5. Patients who have significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease
             that may adversely affect gait and compromise functional recovery and evaluation;

          6. Patients who have neuromuscular or neurosensory deficit which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device;

          7. Any psychiatric illness that would prevent comprehension of the details and nature of
             the study;

          8. Participation in any experimental drug/device study within the 6 months prior to the
             screening visit

          9. Female patients who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy due to x-rays
             exposition.
