    <textblock>
      Recovery Roadmap: A Collaborative Multimedia Tool for Person-Centered Recovery Planning is a
      highly interactive web-based tool that provides guidance for providers and people in
      recovery, and promotes widespread implementation of Person-Centered Recovery Planning (PCRP).
      The Recovery Roadmap prototype was developed and tested by the Center for Social Innovation
      (C4), in partnership with Yale University's Program for Recovery and Community Health (PRCH),
      under a Phase I Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant funded by the National
      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) (1R43MH100712). Phase II will refine the prototype Roadmap
      to streamline content, provide additional handouts and exercises for providers and clients to
      complete together, expand the audio/video vignettes and case studies, and add interactive
      online coaching and support for providers. Phase II also involves a robust evaluation of the
      Roadmap, using a quasi-experimental design in a fully powered trial. Approximately 26
      community-based mental health programs will be randomized into Recovery Roadmap (RR) or
      Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) conditions [in New York study sites, this practice is
      referred to as Wellness Self-Management (WSM)]. Participants will include both providers and
      clients, and data will include one pre-test and three post-tests with providers and clients,
      interviews with providers and administrators, network analytics, and administrative client
      data. This phase will culminate with the dissemination of findings and preparation for Phase
      III commercialization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Person-Centered Recovery Planning (PCRP; also referred to as Patient-Centered Care Planning)
      is a field-tested intervention designed to maximize consumer choice and ownership of the
      treatment and recovery process. In Phase I of Recovery Roadmap: A Collaborative Multimedia
      Tool for Person-Centered Recovery Planning, the research team developed a prototype online
      tool to train providers and persons in recovery to understand and implement PCRP. The tool
      provided in-depth information and included interactive components (e.g., videos, fillable
      forms, case studies) to prepare users to partner effectively. The tool was pilot tested in
      two sites (one received the Recovery Roadmap only; the other received the tool plus a two-day
      in-person training) to obtain feedback about the Roadmap and determine its impact. The
      purpose of this Phase II SBIR study is to expand the Recovery Roadmap and conduct a fully
      powered study to determine the tool's effectiveness in training providers and supporting
      people in recovery in the PCRP process.

      This Phase II study has three specific aims:

      Aim 1: Expand the development of the Recovery Roadmap tool. During Phase II, the research
      team will refine the Roadmap to improve user experience (e.g., include additional videos,
      case studies. and interactive features; add audio; make changes to how content is presented).
      In addition, an online coaching component will be added for providers.

      Aim 2: Evaluate Roadmap using a quasi-experimental design. Phase II of this study will
      include a fully powered trial. Investigators will recruit from approximately 26 programs
      within large community mental health organizations from the state of New York. To control for
      the internal validity threat of contamination (providers often share clients and resources),
      programs will be randomized into one of two conditions: 1) Recovery Roadmap, or 2) Illness
      Management and Recovery (IMR) conditions. IMR is an evidence-based practice that promotes
      skill development and goal-setting and is implemented regularly in the northeastern U.S.,
      making it an informative comparator.

      A total of 230 providers will be recruited (RR n=115; IMR n=115), for a target of 200,
      oversampling due to attrition. Each provider will recruit two clients to participate (RR
      n=230; IMR n=230), for a target of 400 total, oversampling due to attrition. Investigators
      will use mixed methods to assess provider knowledge, behaviors, and relationships related to
      PCRP via surveys, standardized instruments, interviews, and a Social Network Analysis. Client
      PCRP knowledge, recovery outcomes, treatment engagement, and provider/client relationship
      will be assessed via surveys, standardized instruments, and client administrative data.
      Investigators will also conduct administrator interviews.

      Aim 3: Disseminate findings and prepare for commercialization. Findings will be disseminated
      through conference presentations, peer-reviewed journal articles, and issue briefs. The
      research team will also lay the groundwork for Phase III by developing a plan to distribute
      the Recovery Roadmap through C4's online learning platform, t3, which has a large national
      and international audience and has developed the technology and staffing infrastructure to
      support the use of this tool.

      Hypotheses (for Aims 1 and 2):

      H1: Providers in the RR condition will show statistically significant improvements in PCRP
      knowledge, skills, and provider-client relationships, compared to those in the Illness
      Management and Recovery (IMR) condition.

      H2: Clients served by providers in the RR condition will show statistically significant
      improvements in treatment engagement and progress toward goals, compared to those served by
      providers in the IMR condition.

      H3: Providers with higher levels of connectivity with their peers online will report
      sustained PCRP practices, compared with those with lower connectivity.
