    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if the combination of apalutamide
      (also known as ARN-509 or JNJ-56021927), abiraterone acetate, and prednisone can be given
      with either ipilimumab or cabazitaxel plus carboplatin to control metastatic CRPC. The safety
      and effectiveness of these drug combinations and their effect on the immune system will also
      be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Apalutamide is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Prednisone is FDA-approved and
      commercially available as a corticosteroid. Ipilimumab is FDA approved to treat metastatic
      melanoma. Abiraterone acetate, cabazitaxel and carboplatin are FDA-approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of metastatic CRPC. It is considered investigational to give this
      combination of drugs for the treatment of metastatic CRPC.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 265 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study. Up to 265 will take part
      at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to Group 1
      and receive apalutamide, abiraterone, and prednisone. After 8 weeks of receiving treatment in
      Group 1, you will then have blood (about 4 teaspoons) drawn for biomarker testing. The result
      of this biomarker test will determine whether you will continue the study in Group 2 or Group
      3.

      If you are found to be eligible for Group 2, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of
      a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is
      better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance (50/50) of
      being assigned to either group:

        -  If you are assigned to Group 2A, you will continue to receive apalutamide, abiraterone,
           and prednisone alone.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 2B, you will receive apalutamide, abiraterone, prednisone,
           and ipilimumab.

      If you are found to be eligible for Group 3, you will receive apalutamide, abiraterone, and
      prednisone, plus cabazitaxel and carboplatin.

      After treatment in Groups 2 and 3 is complete, you will be assigned to Group 4 and you will
      go back to only taking apalutamide, abiraterone, and prednisone.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 21 days.

        -  You will take 4 tablets of abiraterone acetate and 4 tablets of apalutamide by mouth
           every day while you are on study. The tablets should be taken at the same time every
           day. Â°You will take all of these drugs throughout the entire study.

        -  You should not eat or drink anything except water from 2 hours before your dose until 1
           hour after your dose.

        -  You will also take 1 tablet of prednisone by mouth 2 times every day while you are on
           study. Prednisone should be taken with food.

      The study drug bottle will also include a small packet (called a desiccant) that is placed in
      the bottle to protect the study drug. Do not eat or remove the desiccant. You should store
      your study drug in the study bottle and not place your pills in a separate container, such as
      a pill container.

      If you are assigned to Group 2B, you will also receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on
      Day 1 of Cycles 4, 5, 6, and 7.

      If you are assigned to Group 3, you will receive cabazitaxel and carboplatin by vein on Day 1
      of Cycles 4, 5, 6, and 7. You will receive cabazitaxel by vein over 60 minutes and then
      receive carboplatin, also by vein, over 60 minutes.

      After Cycle 7, if you are assigned to Group 4, you will return to taking 4 tablets of
      abiraterone acetate and 4 tablets of apalutamide and prednisone by mouth every day, just like
      in Group 1.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, then every 2 cycles after that for one
      year, then every 4 cycles after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, for tests of your liver
           function, and to measure your PSA levels.

      Every 2 weeks for the first 9 weeks (Cycles 1-3) and every week of Cycles 4-7, blood (about
      3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your thyroid (Cycle 1 only).

      At Week 3 of Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, for tests of your liver
           function, and to measure your PSA levels.

        -  You will have a bone scan and either a CT scan or MRI of your abdomen and pelvis. If the
           doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have a chest CT scan.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for biomarker testing.

        -  A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be collected for biomarker testing.

      If you are in Group 2B, on Day 1 of Cycles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be
      drawn to test your thyroid and adrenal function.

      If you are in Group 2A, on Day 1 of Cycle 8:

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be collected for biomarker testing.

      If you are in Group 2B, about 3 weeks after your last dose of ipilimumab:

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing

        -  A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be collected for biomarker testing.

      If you are in Group 3, about 3 weeks after your last dose of cabazitaxel and carboplatin:

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be collected for biomarker testing.

      If you are in Group 2A or 2B, at Weeks 21, 33, 45, and every 16 weeks after that:

        -  You will have a bone scan, and either a CT scan or MRI of your abdomen and pelvis. If
           the doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have a chest CT scan.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for biomarker testing.

      If you are in Group 3, at Weeks 15, 21, 33, 45, 57, and every 16 weeks after that:

        -  You will have a bone scan, and either a CT scan or MRI of your abdomen and pelvis. If
           the doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have a chest CT scan.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for biomarker testing.

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you may have additional bone scans or CT scans or
      MRIs of the abdomen, pelvis, or chest to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You may no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      If the study drug becomes commercially available while you are on study, you may begin to
      receive it off of this study. It is also possible that you will continue to receive the study
      drug as part of an extension study, or from a government-sponsored or private health program.
      It is also possible that you and/or your insurance provider will have to pay for drugs after
      they become commercially available if you and your doctor wish to continue them. The study
      doctor will tell you more if any of these things happen.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 14 days after your last dose of the study drugs, you will return to the clinic for an
      end-of-treatment visit. At this visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine and biomarker testing.
           This blood will also be used to check your liver function, and PSA and testosterone
           levels.

        -  You will have a bone scan and a MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration will be collected for biomarker testing.

      About 30 days after your last dose of the study drug, you will be asked how you are doing. If
      you cannot return to the clinic, one of the study staff members will call you to check on
      you. This call should last about 5-10 minutes.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      A member of the study staff will check up on you to ask how you are doing every 6 months
      after your last dose of the study drugs. This could be either a phone call or a review of
      your medical and/or other records. If you are contacted by phone, the call will only last a
      few minutes.

             generation AR antagonist (e.g. enzalutamide), cabazitaxel or carboplatin.

          4. Patients treated with any Cyp17-lyase inhibitor, any 2nd generation AR antagonist
             (e.g. enzalutamide), cabazitaxel or carboplatin whose disease progressed while on
             treatment or within 3 months of its discontinuation. Patients who have received any of
             these treatments more than 12 months from study entry and whose disease did not
             progress while on treatment or within 3 months of its discontinuation are allowed on
             study.

          5. Patients whose disease is refractory (defined as evidence of disease progression while
             on drug or within 3 months of its discontinuation) to more than 2 lines of
             chemotherapy. Any number of chemotherapies to which the patient's disease is not
             refractory are allowed, as long as time on treatment did not exceed 6 months (counted
             from day 1 of cycle 1 to day 1 of the last cycle of treatment).

          6. Flutamide (Eulexin) treatment within 4 weeks of Cycle 1, Day 1 and Bicalutamide
             (Casodex) or nilutamide (Nilandron) within 6 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1 (Exceptions: if
             progression is documented prior to this time interval, or if patient is deemed by the
             treating physician to be highly unlikely to respond to AR inhibitor withdrawal (e.g.
             if PSA did not decline for &gt;/= 3 months in response to AR inhibitor given as a second
             line or later intervention, or if patient has symptoms attributed to disease
             progression) only a 3 day washout prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 will be required for any of
             them.

          7. Radiation therapy for treatment of the primary tumor within 6 weeks of Cycle 1, Day 1.
             Patients who have received palliative radiation to a single site and recovered are
             eligible.

          8. Any chronic medical condition requiring a higher dose of corticosteroid than 10mg
             prednisone/prednisolone daily. Use of inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular and topical
             steroids is acceptable, as is a short course (i.e. &lt;/= 1 day) of corticosteroids to
             prevent a reaction to the IV contrast used for CT scans.

          9. Active infection (requiring oral or IV antibiotics or antiviral therapy) or other
             medical condition that would make prednisone/prednisolone (corticosteroid) use
             contraindicated. Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

         10. A malignancy [other than the one treated in this study] which required radiotherapy or
             systemic treatment within the past 5 years, or has a &gt;/= 30% probability of recurrence
             within 24 months (except for non-melanoma skin cancer or Ta urothelial carcinomas).

         11. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP &gt;/= 140 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;/= 90 mmHg).
             Patients with a history of hypertension are allowed provided blood pressure is
             controlled by anti-hypertensive treatment.

         12. Prolonged QTc interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (&gt;/= 450 msec).

         13. Known active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease.

         14. Clinically significant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or
             arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, severe or unstable angina, history of
             clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia,
             ventricular fibrillation, or Torsade de pointes), New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             Class III-IV heart disease or cardiac ejection fraction measurement of &lt; 40% at
             baseline.

         15. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (including
             Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid
             arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic progressive
             sclerosis [scleroderma and variants], Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis] or autoimmune neuropathies (such as
             Guillain-Barre syndrome) are excluded from this study. Vitiligo and adequately
             controlled endocrine deficiencies such as hypothyroidism are not exclusionary.

         16. Patients who have had a history of illness which put them at current risk for bowel
             perforation such as acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI obstruction and
             abdominal carcinomatosis

         17. History of seizure or known condition that may pre-dispose to seizure (including but
             not limited to prior stroke or, loss of consciousness within 1 year prior to
             randomization, brain arteriovenous malformation; or intracranial masses such as
             schwannomas and meningiomas that are causing edema or mass effect).

         18. Gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption.

         19. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of adverse events.

         20. Untreated symptomatic spinal cord compressions.

         21. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.

         22. Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or
             physical (eg, infectious disease) illness.
