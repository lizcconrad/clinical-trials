  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized double-blind placebo controlled study of reduced B vitamins in patients with
      major depression who were positive for one or both of the common MTHFR polymorphisms was
      conducted between 8/1/2014 and 4/3/2015. Homocysteine levels and MADRS scores were used as
      primary measures. The study was designed to test safety and efficacy of reduced B vitamins in
      MDD associated with MTHFR. This study examines the data from the trial to see effects, effect
      sizes, and further, if demographic factors and other patient characteristics correlated with
      findings.

    <textblock>
      This original study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reduced B vitamins as
      monotherapy in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who were also positive for at
      least 1 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphism associated with depression,
      and further test the hypothesis that reduced (metabolized) B vitamins will lower homocysteine
      (HCY) in a majority of clinically responding patients. 330 adult patients with MDD (DSM-5),
      and positive for MTHFR C677T and/or A1298C polymorphisms were enrolled in a trial conducted
      between August 1, 2014, and April 3, 2015. 160 patients received placebo, while 170 received
      a capsule containing a combination of reduced B vitamins. Plasma homocysteine levels were
      measured at baseline and week 8. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was
      used to evaluate efficacy for MDD. This further analysis is conducted on the resultant data,
      with patient names withheld. It is an extensive look at the findings to determine if response
      is correlated with HCY reduction and if other factors may be associated with response or
      non-response.
