  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infection is an important cause of death in Thailand and in
      other countries worldwide. Increasing use of antibiotics in both animals and humans is one of
      the main drive that increase the incidence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in human,
      animals and environment.

      National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria aimed to have general
      population taking antibiotics less than 20% when they have common cold or diarrheal symptoms.
      However, there is little accurate information about behaviors of Thai people. Most studies
      were conducted in hospitals, clinics or pharmacy. Therefore, it did not include behaviors of
      those who had symptoms but did not present at hospitals, clinics or pharmacy.

      In this study, the investigators aim to use questionnaire to Thai adult population to ask for
      the the amount of antibiotic used and the periods they had symptoms of common cold or
      diarrhea over one year period of year 2017. The main aim is to estimate the total antibiotic
      usage per human population, and plan for the study in the future.

    <description>The investigator aims to have at least 100 adult people who could provide information for the total of one year. This expects that at least 20 of those 100 people would have common cold or diarrhea at least one time over one year period. This should provide more than 80% power to detect whether the proportion of having antibiotics when they have common cold or diarrhea was lower than 50% or not. The hypothesized proportion was 20% as stated by the national strategy against AMR in Thailand</description>

        This study aims to have at least 100 adult people who could provide information for the
        total of one year. This expects that at least 20 of those 100 people would have common cold
        or diarrhea at least one time over one year period. This should provide more than 80% power

        diarrhea was lower than 50% or not. The hypothesizjed proportion was 20% as stated by the
        national strategy against AMR in Thailand.

        MORU has a total number of staff for more than 200 people, and we suspect that the internal
        people in MORU should be enough for the study. We will also want to pilot whether the
        internet-based study can spread into the community well or not.
