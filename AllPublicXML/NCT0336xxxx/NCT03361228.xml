        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Phase 1, subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or
             metastatic solid tumors that have failed prior standard therapy (disease progression;
             subject intolerance is also allowable).

          -  For Phase 2, subjects with the following tumor types who meet protocol-defined
             criteria: advanced or metastatic NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial carcinoma, SCCHN, SCLC,
             and CRC.

          -  Presence of at least 1 measurable lesion by computed tomography or magnetic resonance
             imaging per RECIST v1.1.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1.

          -  Resolution of all toxicities and any toxic effect(s) of the most recent prior therapy
             to Grade 1 or less (except alopecia). Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an
             exception and may enroll.

          -  Adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic functions per protocol-defined laboratory
             parameters within ≤ 7 days before treatment initiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in any other study in which receipt of an investigational study drug or
             device occurred within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before first
             dose.

          -  Has received a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             shorter) before administration of study drug.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or targeted small molecule therapy within 2 weeks before
             administration of study treatment.

          -  Prior therapy with an IDO1 or arginase 1 inhibitor.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years.
             Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement
             therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of
             systemic treatment.

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Any history of serotonin syndrome after receiving serotonergic drugs.

          -  Use of protocol-defined prior/concomitant therapy.

          -  Known or suspected defect in the function of the urea cycle.

          -  History of gastrointestinal condition that may affect drug absorption.
