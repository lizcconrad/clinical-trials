  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa study with GA Depot in subjects with Primary Progressive MS. GA Depot
      will be administered intramuscularly (IM), once every four weeks for 52 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of GA Depot to slow the
      accumulation of disability progression in subjects with Primary Progressive MS.

      -  12 to 24 Subjects with a diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) who
           are not treated for PPMS at study entry (except for symptoms relief).

        -  Study product is GA long-acting injection (GA Depot) which is a combination of
           extended-release microspheres for injection and diluent (water for injection) for
           parenteral use. GA Depot will be administered intramuscularly (IM).

        -  The study duration for an individual subject in the core study will be 60 weeks,
           consisting of 4 weeks of screening evaluation (weeks -4 to 0), followed by a 52-week
           open-label treatment period, and a 4 weeks follow up period: through a total of 17
           visits.

        -  Vital signs and safety assessment will be performed at each visit during the study.

        -  Physical examination will be performed at screening, baseline, weeks 5, 12, 24, 36, 52
           (end of study) and follow up visit.

        -  MRI will be performed at screenings, week 24 and week 52 (end of study).

        -  Safety laboratory tests will be performed at screening visit, baseline, weeks 4, 12, 24,
           36 and 52 (end of study).

        -  Neurological assessment will be performed at screening visit, baseline, weeks 12, 24, 36
           and 52 (end of study).
