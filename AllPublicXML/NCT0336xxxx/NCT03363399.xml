  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) constitute a heterogeneous group of clonal bone marrow
      neoplasms that predominate in the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. MDS
      are characterized by peripheral blood cytopenia and morphologic dysplasia for one or more
      hematopoietic cell lineage, reflecting ineffective hematopoiesis.

      The diagnostic work-up of MDS includes a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, which is an
      invasive procedure, for cytomorphologic and cytogenetic evaluations. Because the prevalence
      of disease is lower than 20% in subjects referred for suspected MDS, many patients are
      exposed to unnecessary bone marrow aspiration-related discomfort and harms.

      An objective assay is highly desirable for accurately ruling out MDS based on peripheral
      blood samples, which may obviate the need for invasive bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in
      patients with negative results.

      Few studies have investigated the value of peripheral blood flow cytometric analysis for the
      diagnosis of MDS and/or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Although promising, these
      studies lacked replication of their results, used a case-control design, which was prone to
      spectrum bias, or yielded imprecise diagnostic accuracy estimates due to relatively limited
      sample sizes.

      Anecdotal evidence supports the potential of flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood
      neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression for the diagnosis of MDS and CMML. Myeloperoxidase is
      an enzyme synthetized during myeloid differentiation that constitutes the major component of
      neutrophil azurophilic granules. Myeloperoxidase expression may reflect neutrophil
      hypogranulation, which is a classical although subjective dysplastic feature of MDS. Flow
      cytometric analysis of myeloperoxidase expression in bone marrow neutrophil granulocytes has
      been used for discriminating low versus high grade MDS. Yet a study reporting on the accuracy
      of flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression for the
      diagnosis of MDS is still lacking, to our knowledge.

      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that flow cytometric analysis of neutrophil
      myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral blood may accurately rule out MDS and obviate the
      need for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, with sensitivity approaching 100%, in routine
      practice.

      In this observational diagnostic accuracy study, burden will be null for recruited patients.
      No specific intervention is assigned to participants. All diagnostic testing, procedures, and
      medication ordering are performed at the discretion of attending physicians. Flow cytometry
      analysis of peripheral blood neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression will not require
      additional blood sample. A test result will have no impact on patient management. No
      follow-up visits are planned in this cross-sectional study.

      The primary objective of MPO-MDS-pilot study is to estimate the accuracy of flow cytometric
      analysis of neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral blood for the diagnosis of
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and/or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. to provide accuracy estimates for prespecified thresholds of neutrophil myeloperoxidase
           expression in peripheral blood in ruling out MDS and/or CMML.

        2. to estimate the prevalence of alternate diagnosis established by bone marrow
           cytomorphology.

      The MPO-MDS-pilot project is a multicenter, phase II, cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy
      study of consecutive unselected patients referred for suspected MDS or CMML.

      Screening: All consecutive patients referred to the immuno-hematology lab at the study sites
      for suspicion of MDS will be screened for eligibility. A lab physician will review inclusion
      and exclusion criteria, using computerized medical and laboratory records.

      Recruitment: Participants will be included in the study once all the screening activities
      have been conducted and only if the patient meets all inclusion and none exclusion criteria.
      The consent for flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood sample and data collection
      through chart review will be sought under a regime of &quot;non-opposition&quot; (opt-out): after
      appropriate written information is delivered, cross-sectional data will be collected except
      in case of opposition from the patient. All patients included in the study will be assigned a
      unique patient identification number. This number will be used to identify the patient
      throughout the study.

      Index test: Flow cytometry analysis of neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral
      blood will be performed within 24 h of MDS diagnostic evaluation and blinded to the reference
      standard.

      Reference standard: The diagnosis of MDS will be established according to the World Health
      Organization (WHO) classification, based on clinical data, peripheral blood cytopenia,
      cytomorphology of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate, and cytogenetic analysis. The
      criteria for MDS diagnosis are 1) the presence of ≥10% dysplastic cells in any hematopoietic
      lineage, 2) the exclusion of acute myeloid leukemia (defined by the presence of ≥20%
      peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts), and 3) the exclusion of reactive etiologies of
      dysplasia. Cytopenia is defined by hemoglobin concentration &lt;10 g/dL, platelet count
      &lt;100x109/L, and/or absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.8 x109/L. Yet a diagnosis of MDS could be
      made with milder levels of cytopenia. Idiopathic cytopenia of uncertain significance (ICUS)
      is defined by unexplained mild persistent cytopenia for at least 6 months and the failure to
      establish the diagnosis to MDS according to published guidelines. Consistent with WHO
      classification, MDS subcategorization will rely on the degree of dysplasia (unilineage versus
      multilineage), blast percentages, presence of ring sideroblasts, and cytogenetic analysis
      (del(5q)). The criteria for CMML diagnosis are 1) the presence of persistent peripheral blood
      monocytosis ≥1 x109/L, and 2) monocyte accounting for more than 10% of the white blood cell
      differential count. Evaluation of bone marrow cytomorphology will be performed prospectively
      by experienced hematopathologists who are blinded to the index test results.

      Patients with confirmed suspicion of MDS: Participants for whom the diagnosis of MDS (or
      CMML) is confirmed by the reference standard will be categorized as patients with confirmed
      suspicion of MDS.

      Patients with unconfirmed suspicion of MDS: Participants for whom the diagnosis of MDS (or
      CMML) is ruled out by the reference standard will be categorized as patients with unconfirmed
      suspicion of MDS. This latter subgroup will include patients with ICUS, as defined in
      accordance with published guidelines

      Follow-up: No follow-up visit is planned in this cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study.

Peripheral blood samples will be collected in 5 ml (EDTA) anticoagulant plastic tubes and processed within 24 h maximum of collection. The samples will be stored at 4°C overnight.
Blood samples containing at least 105 neutrophils will be incubated with a panel of antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes, according to the manufacturers' recommendations.
At least 10,000 cell events will be acquired on a 3-laser, 8-color flow cytometer and analyzed using Becton Dickinson (BD) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Diva Software version 6. Each marker will be expressed as median, geometric and arithmetic mean, regular and robust coefficient of variation.</description>
