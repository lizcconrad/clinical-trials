  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project uses big data analysis techniques such as wavelet transform and deep learning to
      analyze physiological signals from neurocritical patients and build a model to evaluate
      intracranial condition and to predict neurological outcome. By identification of correlations
      among these parameters and their trends, we may achieve early detection of anomalies and
      enhance the ability in judgement of current neurological condition and prediction of
      prognosis. By continuous input of the past and contemporary data in the ICU, the model will
      be modified repeatedly and its accuracy improves as the model grows. The model can be used to
      recognize abnormalities earlier and provide a warning system. Clinicians taking care of
      neurocritical patients can adjust their treatment policy and evaluate the outcome according
      to such system.
