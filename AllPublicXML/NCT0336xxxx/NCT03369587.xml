      Background: Problems with handwriting are frustrating and debilitating and affect the
      majority of people with Parkinson's. Manifest as micrographia it is a distinctive feature of
      the condition characterised by small handwriting and/or a progressive reduction in size
      through a sentence[2] coupled with a reduction in writing speed and legibility.

      In Parkinson's impaired automaticity is thought to contribute to handwriting deficits and
      attention has been shown to improve both 'consistent' (small handwriting) and 'progressive'
      (progressive reduction in letter size through a sentence) aspects of the symptom. Moreover,
      recent interventional studies indicate handwriting may be improved through practice. This
      study is investigating a novel handwriting practice stimulus to improve symptoms of
      micrograpthia

      Question: Is a diverging line cued handwriting intervention potentially more effective at
      improving symptoms of mircograpthia than a parallel line cued handwriting intervention in
      people with Parkinson's?

      Specifically, an assessor blind randomised controlled exploratory trial will:

        1. Estatimate the effect of the intervention on measures of: Handwriting amplitude
           (consistent and progressive reduction), hand writing performance and percieved
           handwriting difficulties.

        2. Explore the appropriateness of these outcome measures

        3. Explore the approriateness of eligibilty criteria

        4. Explore intervention fidelity

        5. Explore participants views of the intervention

      Design: A phase II exploratory randomised controlled trial of a handwriting intervention with
      an active comparator control group and blinded assessments

      Setting: The intervention will be carried out at home

      Sample size: This study is not designed to determine efficacy. The aim to recruit a total of
      50 people (25 people per group) in order to estimate the effects on outcome measures and
      achieve the aims of this exploratory trial.

      Assessment: Participants will be asked to follow their usual Parkinson's medication regime
      and if they have ON and OFF periods, assessments will be carried out during ON state.

      Duration and follow-up: the assessment is schedule 0Weeks (baseline), 6weeks (end
      intervention) and 12weeks (follow up). Assessments will be carried out by a researcher blind
      to trial arm allocation using all outcome measures.

    <description>What: Handwriting practice at home delivered through handwriting workbooks. The workbook consists of diverging lines. Participants will be instructed to write a daily diary (a reflection of their day) aiming for letters letter size to be consistent with the lines. Participant will be instructed to take a long as they need to complete the daily diary and focus and concentrate the handwriting and achieving the size dictated by the lines. They will be asked to do this daily, but at least 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Tailoring and progression: The nature of the handwriting program is that it accounts for individual ability; participant will be asked to write as much as they can during the practice session, whilst concentrating on their handwriting.</description>
