  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the clinical trial is to evaluate the EndoRotor®'s ability to completely remove
      areas of Barrett's metaplasia considered refractory after 3 failed radiofrequency ablations
      (RFA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized study to compare the safety and performance
      of the EndoRotor® Mucosal Resection System with continued ablative therapy in subjects with
      refractory dysplastic Barrett's Esophagus. Subjects must have failed 3 RFA treatments
      (failure of Barrett's to respond to RFA with a decrease of at least 50% of its length) and
      following 3 RFA failures have no endoscopic and histologic evidence of esophageal
      adenocarcinoma at the time of therapy. The subjects are randomized and treated (up to 2
      times) with either the EndoRotor® which resects the affected mucosa and submucosa (down to
      the muscularis propria layer), or with cryotherapy or ablative therapy of the persistent
      lesions. Subjects will be followed with biopsies of the resected areas at the time of
      surveillance endoscopies every 3 months until they have 2 consecutive negative endoscopies
      and biopsies (6 months).

      The EndoRotor® Endoscopic Mucosal Resection System is an automated mechanical endoscopic
      mucosal resection system for use in the gastrointestinal tract for benign neoplastic or
      pre-malignant tissue removal by interventional gastroenterologists and GI surgeons. The
      EndoRotor® System performs both tissue dissection and resection with a single device through
      an endoscope's instrument biopsy channel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are &gt;30 and &lt;79 years of age; inclusive of males and females.

             high-grade) refractory to radiofrequency ablation 3 times.

          3. Residual Barrett's length is ≥1 cm and ≤6 cm.

             following treatment and failed eradication.
