    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lertal® as an add-on
      treatment for children affected by allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) is a common chronic disorder in children, especially in
      developed countries. It is not characterized by nasal symptoms only (such as congestion and
      sneezing), but may also cause general complaints such as fatigue and cough. AR can also have
      detrimental effects on mood, sleep, social activities and scholastic performance.

      Lertal® is a novel nutraceutical containing seed extracts from Perilla Frutescens, Quercetin
      extracted from Sophora japonica and Vitamin D3, all compounds that have demonstrated their
      ability to reduce allergy symptoms and the use of anti-allergy drugs in adults.

      The aim of this randomized, double-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study is to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lertal® as an add-on treatment for children affected by
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

    <measure>Total Symptom Score (TSS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and after Visit 4 (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline of Total Symptom Score (TSS) scores will be calculated after 4 weeks of treatment. The Total Symptoms score is a patient-reported evaluation of nine symptoms:
Nasal symptoms (Total Nasal Symptom Score): itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion
Ocular symptoms (Total Ocular Symptom Score): itching, hyperemia of conjunctiva, tearing
Throat symptoms (Total Throat Symptom Score): itching, coughing
With the help of their parents, patients will score symptoms on a 4-point scale: 0 = absent or irrelevant, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Patients are asked to assign a score to the symptoms experienced in the last 12 hours and over the previous two weeks.
The total symptom score is the sum of the scores of nasal symptoms, ocular symptoms and throat symptoms.
The between-group analysis will be performed by means of a t-test for independent samples or analogous non-parametric test.</description>

Changes from baseline of the Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire total score will be calculated at Visit 4 (Week 4) and at Visit 5 (Week 8) or Visit 6 (Week16). An analysis of variance for repeated measures will be adopted, isolating the variability due to type of allergy, treatment group, time of observation and their interaction.</description>
