  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is known as an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older cardiac
      patients . It is an important factor on the cardiologist decision between conservative and
      invasive treatment in older patient with acute coronary syndrome, and is usually made
      subjectively by the cardiologist known in the literature as eyeball testing.

      in this study the investigators will compare the cardiologists eye ball testing to objective
      frailty assessment based on Fried score and Edmonton frailty scale.

      elderly patients admitted to Meir hospital with acute coronary syndrome will be assessed for
      frailty twice: the first frailty assessment will be a subjective eye ball testing made by the
      cardiologist, the second assessment will be an objective one based on Fried frailty score and
      Edmonton frail scale.

      The cardiologist will not be aware of the objective frailty assessment result.

      The eye ball testing will be compared to the objective frailty assessment (Fried score and
      Edmonton frailty scale).
