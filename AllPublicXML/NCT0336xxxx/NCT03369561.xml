  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cardio renal syndrome generally focuses on left ventricular function, and the importance
      of the right ventricle as a determinant of renal function is described less frequently.
      Although the risk of AKI is similar for patients with isolated LVD and isolated RVD, the
      severity of AKI and the associated risk of hospital mortality is highest among those with
      isolated RVD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The right ventricle seems to affect renal function through different mechanisms, including
      Venous Congestion, tricuspid regurgitation, And potential inhibitory effect on left
      ventricular function The most important mechanism is venous congestion, a manifestation of
      sodium avidity and fluid expansion, as Directly increasing renal venous pressure causes
      sodium retention, lowers urinary output, and decreases glomerular filtration and widely
      thought to explain AKI Venous pressure is directly associated with renal dysfunction,
      independently of ventricular function, and admission peripheral edema is associated with
      greater risk of AKI. Such awareness of a primary role of renal venous congestion reshapes our
      understanding of renal function as not simply a reflection of arterial perfusion, but rather
      a balance between arterial supply and venous drainage.
