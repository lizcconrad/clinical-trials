  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HER2-positive cancer is a cancer that tests positive for a protein called human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 promotes the growth of certain cancer cells. This study
      will test an experimental drug called DS-8201a that has not been approved by the health
      authorities yet.

      DS-8201a will be tested for safety in Chinese patients with certain types of stomach and
      breast cancer that test positive for HER2. It also will test how DS-8201a moves within the
      body (pharmacokinetics).

      The expected time from the first subject's enrollment until the last subject's enrollment is
      approximately 8 months. The screening period is 28 days and each cycle of treatment is 21
      days.

      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Subjects who continue to derive
      clinical benefit from the study drug in the absence of withdrawal of consent, progressive
      disease (PD), or unacceptable toxicity may continue the study drug.
