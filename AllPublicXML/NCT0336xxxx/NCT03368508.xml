  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simulation is becoming the main trend of training allied health students, several
      experimental studies have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various simulating
      interventions including virtual reality software and real-patient simulation (Ladyshewsky,
      Baker, Jones, &amp; Nelson, 2000; Mori, Carnahan, &amp; Herold, 2015; Schlickum, Hedman, Enochsson,
      Kjellin, &amp; Fell√§nder-Tsai, 2009). Although the outcomes of the training approaches have shown
      to be positive, the costs of creating the simulations are considerably high(Blackstock &amp;
      Jull, 2007; Watson et al., 2012) and the evidence to support the effectiveness of simulated
      interventions in healthcare training is yet to be sufficient (Mori et al., 2015).

      As a kind of virtual reality technology, 360-degree videos allow free control of a
      first-person panoramic view by the users (Qian, Ji, Han, &amp; Gopalakrishnan, 2016). Together
      with a VR goggle, the videos can provide a stimulating environment for the users for
      entertainment or learning (Hughes, Stapleton, Hughes, &amp; Smith, 2005). In addition, with the
      development of the 360-degree camera, the 360-degree videos can be produced in an economical
      way.

      Therefore, it is proposed the use 360-degree videos could be possibly a cost-effective way to
      be a form of simulation for training physiotherapy students.

      A group of year 1 BSc. (Hons) physiotherapy students will be recruited for the study. The
      students should have studied the anatomy of the spine and physiotherapy assessment to
      peripheral joints, but they are novices to physiotherapy assessment on the spine. They will
      be randomized into two groups; an experimental group will receive training material with a
      360-degree simulating video of lumbar spine assessment while a control group will have a
      traditional video of similar content.

      After that, the students will go for a structured objective clinical evaluation (SOCE) and be
      evaluated by a blinded examiner randomly. The SOCE will consist of several handling skills
      including positioning of the patient, localization of specific structures and mobilization of
      segments .

      Their performance in the SOCE will be quantified, compared and analyzed using the SPSS
      software.

A nurmeric grading system (3 excellent, 0 incorrect) is used to assess each item.</description>
