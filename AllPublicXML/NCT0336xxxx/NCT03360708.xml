      This pilot early phase I trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy and
      cytokine-induced killer cells in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back.
      Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins from another
      person's glioblastoma tumors may help the body build an effective immune response to kill
      tumor cells. Cytokine-induced killer cells are white blood cells with a powerful ability to
      kill tumor cells without any further modification. Giving vaccine therapy and
      cytokine-induced killer cells may work better in treating patients with glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous
      dendritic cell vaccine (autologous dendritic cell [DC] / allogeneic glioblastoma multiforme
      [GBM] culture lysate vaccination) combined with autologous cytokine-activated killer cell
      transfer in glioblastoma patients at first or second recurrence.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document survival and progression-free survival in glioblastoma patients at first or
      second recurrence receiving autologous DC / allogeneic GBM culture lysate vaccination
      combined with autologous cytokine-activated killer cell transfer and compare to historical
      data.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the ability of autologous DC / GBM culture lysate vaccination combined with
      autologous cytokine-activated killer cell transfer to generate multiple tumor-associated
      antigen (TAA)-specific immune responses in GBM patients at first or second recurrence.

      II. Assess the relationship between ability tumor induced TAA-specific immune responses and
      evidence of immunosuppression (peripheral blood immunophenotyping by flow cytometry)
      following autologous DC / allogeneic GBM culture lysate vaccination combined with autologous
      cytokine-activated killer cell transfer in GBM patients at first or second recurrence.

      III. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,
      tumor response) and tumor-associated antigen immune response following autologous DC /
      allogeneic GBM culture lysate vaccination combined with autologous cytokine-activated killer
      cell transfer.

      IV. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,
      tumor response) and evidence of immunosuppression at baseline and over time with autologous
      DC / allogeneic GBM culture lysate vaccination combined with autologous cytokine-activated
      killer cell transfer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cytokine-induced killer cells intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 13 of
      course 1. Patients also receive malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic
      cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 1, 3, and 5 of courses 2 and 3, and on day 1 of
      subsequent courses. Treatment with malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic
      cell vaccine repeats every 21 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
