  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will test the ability of the NIATx Organizational Change Model to
      improve patient no-show rates as compared to typical training approaches used in dental
      offices. The purpose of the pilot study is to improve no-show rates and, in the process, test
      an evidence-based organizational change model that can increase use of evidence-based
      practices in dental care.

      NIATx is not an acronym, it is a proper noun.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For designing the pilot study, it is assumed that the no-show rates in dental clinics will
      have similar characteristics and response patterns to previous studies.

      The preliminary summary data provided by the participating dental clinics, the current
      average no-show rate is approximately 20%, which would reduce to 10% using the upper limit of
      the confidence interval from the preliminary data. Based on a simulation study incorporating
      the above assumptions, with 5 sites each contributing 160 appointments before and after the
      intervention, the study will have 84% power to detect the hypothesized effect (OR=0.44) at a
      two-sided 5% significance level. The probability of observing a decrease in no-show rates in
      at least 4 out of 5 of the clinics is approximately 90%. We expect over 80 appointments per
      month in each clinic, so the target number of appointments would be expected to be available
      in 2-3 months.

      For the NIATx Fidelity Scale, if an organization has an average score of 2 or higher on the
      NIATx Fidelity Scale for 8 of the 13 measures that will be considered significant. In a
      previous study using a similar process, 73% of the organizations that achieved gains of +10%,
      had 8 measures or more with an average score of 2 or greater, compared to 40% of those who
      had gains at &lt;10%.

    <description>This study will test the NIATx model, an evidence-based behavioral intervention for implementing organizational change and quality improvement in community based health settings with a high proportion of underserved individuals. The goal of the study will be to use the model to identify and implement organizational changes in dental practices that will improve the no-show rate in underserved populations.</description>

    <description>The NIATx model engages organizations through a multi-clinic learning collaborative and coaching. NIATx teaches organizations how to implement change by using their own organization as the teaching mechanism. Key components of the model include:
educating executives on how to promote effective process change techniques
training staff teams in the theory and practice of organizational change techniques
training staff to develop and implement a process improvement intervention
implementing a sustainability plan to institutionalize change and avoid reverting to previous methods</description>
