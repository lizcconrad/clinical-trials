  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the resistance of Helicobacter pylori increasing, low and unsatisfactory eradication
      rate (64%) have been observed with standard triple therapy in European children. Which
      regimen is appropriate for Chinese children? There is no large scale, multi center studies in
      China about treatment, CYP2C19 gene polymorphism, resistance rate and resistance genotype.
      Investigators want to perform a research to compare four different treatment regimens（triple
      therapy, sequential therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy and concomitant therapy）as the
      first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori in Chinese children and investigation of
      resistance, impact factors and changes of microbiota after the therapy. The results of the
      study will provide theoretical basis to make the new guideline of diagnosis and therapy of
      Helicobacter pylori in Chinese children. It advance instruct and norm the clinical practice
      for Chinese pediatrician to increase the cure rate of Helicobacter pylori and decrease the
      resistance.

      Eligible children were randomly divided into four groups: standard triple therapy, sequential
      therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy and concomitant therapy. The course of treatment is 14
      days. The primary outcome measure was the Hp eradication rate at 4-6 weeks after completion
      of treatment which was confirmed by a negative of 13 UBT. Secondary outcome measures included
      side effects, impact factor and changes of microbiome after the therapy.
