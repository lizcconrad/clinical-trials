    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation (Segment 1) and expansion (Segment 2) study
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase two dose (RPTD), and
      to assess the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-744 for
      participants with metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) and
      relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
