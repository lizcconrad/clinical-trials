  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the initial efficacy of a multi-dimensional
      coaching intervention (&quot;Parentship&quot;) for parents of adolescents with High Functioning Autism
      (HFASD).

      The &quot;Parentship&quot; protocol is a short-term intervention program in occupational therapy that
      aims to promote parental resilience and enhance adolescents' participation in daily life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Parentship&quot; is a structured occupational therapy intervention for promoting parental
      resilience and enhance adolescents' participation in daily life The Parentship protocol uses
      OPC (Graham &amp; Rodger, 2010) as the primary treatment approach. Its primary goal is to lead
      parents into recognition and understanding of their adolescent's multi-dimensional personal
      profile that includes sensorimotor, cognitive-behavioral, and social-communicative and
      personal factors, as required by the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) model
      (WHO, 2007).

      The intervention will be administered by occupational therapists on an individual (or both
      parents) basis, once a week, over 3-4 months.

      10-15 families will be recruited through community advertising. Data will be collected at the
      onset and completion of the intervention. Data will be analysed using quantitative and
      qualitative methods.

      Adverse events, if occur, will be reported to supervising neurologist and the Helsinki
      Committee.
