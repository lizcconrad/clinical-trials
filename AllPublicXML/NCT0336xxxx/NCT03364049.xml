  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to: 1) determine the safety and tolerability of MK-7162 when
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475), 2) establish a preliminary
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MK-7162 when administered in combination with
      pembrolizumab, and 3) assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MK-7162 when
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab and other therapies to adult participants with
      advanced solid tumors.

    <measure>Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs) as Assessed Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (Up to 6 weeks)</time_frame>

    <measure>Ratio of Kynurenine (KYN):Tryptophan (TRP) Biomarker Plasma Concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening; Cycle 1 Days 1 &amp; 15: predose, 1, 2, 4 &amp; 8 hours postdose; Cycle 2 Day 1: predose; Cycle 3 Day 1: predose, 1, 2, 4 &amp; 8 hours postdose; Cycle 3 Day 15: predose (Up to approximately 9 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>MK-7162 is a selective inhibitor of Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) activity which, in turn, reduces the conversion of TRP to KYN. Venous blood samples will be collected after an overnight fast for measurement of plasma levels of KYN and TRP as a progressive disease (PD) biomarker of IDO1 inhibition. The ratio of KYN:TRP will be calculated at designated time points. A reduction (negative change from baseline) in KYN:TRP plasma concentration is indicative of a reduction in IDO1 activity.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 25 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the Investigator. The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ORR Based on Immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) as Assessed by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 25 months</time_frame>
    <description>For participants with radiological PD by RECIST 1.1 as determined by the Investigator, will undergo confirmatory imaging which will classify participant disease as confirmed progressive disease [iCPD]), or as unconfirmed progressive disease [iUPD]), or as disease stability or response (stable disease [iSD]/partial response [iPR]/confirmed response [iCR]). iCPD definition: Target lesions, worsening is a further increase in the sum of diameters of ≥5 mm; Non-target lesions, worsening is any significant growth in lesions overall; New lesions, worsening is any of these: an increase in new lesion sum of diameters by ≥5 mm; Visible growth of new non-target lesions; Appearance of additional new lesions; or any new factor appears that would have triggered PD by RECIST 1.1. Responses are classified as iSD or iPR (depending on the sum of diameters of the target lesions), or iCR if all lesions resolve. The percentage of participants who experience iSD, iPR or iCR will be presented.</description>
