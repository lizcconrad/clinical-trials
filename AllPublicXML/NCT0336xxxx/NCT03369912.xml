  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of using CSJ148 to prevent congenital
      human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in pregnant women with primary HCMV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, patient, investigator and sponsor blinded, placebo-controlled study in
      pregnant women with primary HCMV infection. The study has three periods: (I) screening (II)
      double-blinded placebo-controlled treatment and (III) post-delivery follow-up of women and
      neonates/infants. Pregnant women with confirmed primary HCMV infection will participate in
      periods I and II. Mothers and neonates/infants born to mothers enrolled in the study will
      participate in period III.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a patient, investigator and sponsor-blinded study. Patients, investigators and sponsor will remain blinded to study treatment throughout the study.
With the exception of any unblinded site staff identified below, all site staff (including study investigator and study nurse) will be blinded to study treatment throughout the study.
Drug product will be supplied in patient specific kits, so an unblinded pharmacist who is independent of the study team will be required in order to maintain the blind. Appropriate measures must be taken by the unblinded pharmacist to ensure that the treatment assignments are concealed from the rest of the site staff.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          2. Pregnant women â‰¥ 18 years of age with primary HCMV infection occurring between 6 and
             24 weeks of gestation

          3. Ability to receive study drug within 6 weeks of the presumed onset of primary maternal
             infection.

          4. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed or suspected fetal HCMV infection, defined as positive HCMV DNA in amniotic
             fluid or fetal ultrasound abnormalities suggestive of fetal HCMV disease.

          2. Prior treatment with any of the following within 30 days prior to enrollment:
             ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir, acyclovir (&gt;25 mg/kg/day IV),
             valacyclovir (&gt;3 gm/day oral), famciclovir (&gt;1500 mg/day oral), HCMV immune globulin,
             immune globulin (&gt;500 mg/kg), or any other medication with anti-HCMV activity.

          3. Any surgical or medical condition (other than pregnancy) which might increase the risk
             for thrombotic events if the patient is given immune-globulins. These conditions
             include cryoglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathies, and hypertriglyceridemia (fasting
             level &gt;1000 mg/dL). The investigator should make this determination based on the
             patient's medical history and laboratory data.

          4. History of chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             infection. Cured hepatitis C in not considered exclusionary.

          5. Patient request for medical interruption or termination of pregnancy before inclusion.

          6. Any surgical or medical condition which may jeopardize the patient or fetus in case of
             participation in the study. The investigator should make this determination in
             consideration of the patient's obstetrical history.

          7. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 half-lives
             of enrollment, or until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline,
             whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations.

          8. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or excipients or to drugs
             of similar chemical classes.

          9. Body weight &gt; 100 kilograms.
