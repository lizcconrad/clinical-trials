          2. Use of an insulin pump for at least 6 months with established parameters for basal
             rate(s), carbohydrate ratio(s) and insulin sensitivity factor(s) for at least 3
             months.

          3. Age 18.0 to &lt;75.0 years

             devices and is capable of adhering to the protocol

          8. Currently using no insulins other than one of the following rapid-acting insulins at
             the time of enrollment: insulin lispro (Humalog), insulin aspart (Novolog), or insulin
             glulisine (Apidra). Willingness to switch to lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) if
             using glulisine (Apidra).

          9. Total daily insulin dose (TDD) at least 10 U/day and â‰¤100 U/day
