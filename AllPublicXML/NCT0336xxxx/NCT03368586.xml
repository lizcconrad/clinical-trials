  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess accuracy, satisfaction and usability of the FGM among
      children and adolescents with T1DM. The primary outcome was to assess the accuracy of the FGM
      system. Secondary outcomes included satisfaction and usability of the device as well as
      assessment of sensor-related issues.

      The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy, satisfaction and usability of a Flash
      Glucose Monitoring system (FGM) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (T1DM) and attending a 1-week diabetes summer camp, supervised by a multidisciplinary team of
      health care providers. The camp comprised a structured daily routine with five fixed meals:
      breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner and evening snack. Capillary blood glucose (BG)
      values were measured in parallel with unmasked Flash Glucose measurements (FGM) using the FGM
      reader's built-in glucometer at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Additional measurements were
      taken before snacks, between the meals or overnight and BG was measured only in cases of low
      (&lt;4.0 mmol/L) or high (&gt;15.0 mmol/L) FGM values or when symptoms were discordant with sensor
      readings. Sensor-related issues were documented and a questionnaire assessing satisfaction
      and usability of the FGM was completed by patients and caregivers at study completion.
