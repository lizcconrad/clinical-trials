  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop the clinical methodology to characterize the efficacy
      profiles of an experimental 5% potassium nitrate (KNO3) and 0.454% stannous fluoride (SnF2)
      combination dentifrice and a marketed desensitizing 0.454% SnF2 only dentifrice for the
      relief of dentin hypersensitivity (DH), at multiple time points, over an 8 week treatment
      period.

      This will be a single center, 8 week, randomized, controlled, examiner blind, two treatment
      arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two
      selected test teeth), method development study, in participants in good general health, with
      pre-existing self-reported tooth sensitivity, and at least two sensitive teeth (diagnosed
      clinically) that meet all study criteria at the screening and baseline (pre-treatment)
      visits.

    <description>The examiner will assess the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which will allow application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force will reach. The tactile threshold for each tooth will be determined by asking the participants whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant will give two consecutive 'yes' responses will be recorded as the tactile threshold. Higher tactile threshold will indicate the less sensitive are the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force will be 20g; at all subsequent visits, it will be 80g. However, in situations where participants will not give a 'yes' response at force of 80g, the tactile threshold will be recorded as &gt;80g. Mean score will be calculated as the average score of the two test teeth on Baseline (Day 0).</description>

             requirements as follows: Achieved post-menopausal status, defined as follows:
             cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months, with no alternative
             pathological or physiological cause, and have a serum follicle-stimulating hormone
             (FSH) level confirming post-menopausal state, Have undergone a documented hysterectomy
             and/or bilateral oophorectomy, Have medically confirmed ovarian failure.

          -  AT Visit 1 (Screening): participant must have a) Self-reported history of DH lasting
             more than six months but not more than 10 years. b) Minimum of 20 natural teeth. c)
             Minimum of 2 accessible non-adjacent teeth (incisors, canines, pre-molars), preferably
             in different quadrants, that meet all of the following criteria: Signs of
             facial/cervical erosion, abrasion or gingival recession (EAR), Tooth with MGI score =
             0 adjacent to the test area (exposed dentin) only and a clinical mobility of ≤1, Tooth
             with signs of sensitivity, as evidenced by qualifying tactile (tactile threshold ≤
             20g) and evaporative air (Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2) sensitivity.

          -  AT Visit 2 (Baseline): participant must have a minimum of two, non-adjacent accessible
             teeth (incisors, canines, pre-molars), preferably in different quadrants, with signs
             of sensitivity, as evidenced by qualifying tactile (tactile threshold ≤ 20g) and
             evaporative air (Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2) sensitivity at both Screening and
             Baseline. All teeth which meet the sensitivity criteria (tactile threshold ≤ 20g;
             Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2) at Screening (Visit 1) should be assessed by tactile
             stimulus at Baseline (Visit 2). Those teeth which meet the required tactile threshold
             (Yeaple ≤20g) again at Baseline should then be assessed by evaporative air stimulus.
             The examiner will select two 'Test Teeth' from those which meet the tactile threshold
             and Schiff sensitivity score inclusion criteria at Screening and Baseline. Once these
             two teeth have been identified, no further testing is necessary. Test Teeth should not
             be adjacent to each other and preferably in different quadrants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An employee of the investigational site directly involved in the conduct of the study
             or a member of their immediate family; an employee of the investigational site
             otherwise supervised by the investigator; a GSK employee directly involved in the
             conduct of the study or a member of their immediate family.

          -  Participation in other studies (including cosmetic studies) involving investigational
             drug(s) within 30 days of study entry and/or during study participation.

          -  Participation in another tooth desensitizing treatment study within 8 weeks Screening.

          -  Acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes xerostomia.

          -  Pregnant female participant (as evidenced by a positive urine pregnancy test).

          -  Breastfeeding female participant.

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely
             related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients.

          -  Recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse.

          -  Dental prophylaxis within 4 weeks of Screening.

          -  Tongue or lip piercing or presence of multiple dental implants.

          -  Gross periodontal disease, treatment of periodontal disease (including surgery) within
             12 months of Screening, scaling or root planning within 3 months of Screening.

          -  Participant with evidence of gross intra-oral neglect or the need for extensive dental
             therapy.

          -  Teeth bleaching within 8 weeks of Screening.

          -  Participant with fixed or removable partial dentures.

             retainer.

          -  Specific exclusions for test teeth: a) Tooth with evidence of current or recent
             caries, or reported treatment of decay within 12 months of Screening, b) Tooth with
             exposed dentin but with deep, defective or facial restorations, c) Teeth with full
             crowns or veneers, d) Sensitive teeth with contributing etiologies other than erosion,
             abrasion or recession of exposed dentin, e) Sensitive tooth not expected to respond to
             treatment with an over-the-counter dentifrice in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Use of an oral care product indicated for the relief of dentin hypersensitivity within
             8 weeks of Screening (participant will be required to bring their current oral care
             products to the site in order to verify the absence of known anti-sensitivity
             ingredients).

          -  Daily doses of medication/treatments which, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             interfere with the perception of pain. Examples of such medications include

             sedatives, tranquilizers, anti-depressants, mood-altering and anti-inflammatory drugs.

             xerostomia.

          -  Participant who requires antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures.

          -  Participant who is unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle/Study Restrictions
             described in the study protocol.

          -  Participant who has previously been enrolled in this study.
