      Phase II, 2-cohort, single arm trial treated with the combination of the following two
      agents:

        1. Pembrolizumab (MK3475) 200mg, every three weeks, iv

        2. Docetaxel 75mg/m2, every three weeks, iv
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be divided into two cohorts.

      Cohort 1: salivary gland tumors without SOC treatment option Cohort 2: 'aggressive' thyroid
      cancer without SOC treatment option

      Both cohorts will undergo a biopsy and will begin immunotherapy plus chemotherapy.
      Pembrolizumab and steroid sparing taxane: docetaxel will be given every three weeks for 3 to
      6 cycles. For accessible tumors only, at week three patients will receive an on-treatment
      biopsy.

      Patients will move on to immunotherapy maintenance after completing their cycles.
      Pembrolizumab will be given every three weeks until disease progression or up to 35 cycles
      (about 2 years).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 2 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy in excess
             of prednisone 10mg/24h equivalent, or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Has hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab, docetaxel or any of its excipients.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 3 weeks prior to study
             Day 1, or targeted small molecule therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1, or who
             has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier, with the exception of lymphopenia or
             asymptomatic aberrancies of sodium, amylase, lipase or alkaline phosphatase.

          -  Has not recovered from prior surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy from adverse
             events due to a previous treatment/administered agent (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or return to
             baseline prior to treatment).

          -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy, any grade hearing loss or tinnitus, or
             typical side effects from radiotherapy are an exception to this criterion and may
             qualify for the study.

          -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical or other
             cancers that are not likely to influence life expectancy in the subsequent 3 years
             without active treatment (e.g. low grade prostate cancer in absence of therapy).

          -  Has known active (growing) central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or
             carcinomatous meningitis. Prior radiation or resection is acceptable if clinically
             stable for at least 4 weeks.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids in excess of prednisone
             10mg/24h equivalent or immunosuppressive drugs) and would represent significant
             morbidity risk in judgement of investigator. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine,
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (HIV 1/2
             antibodies). Patients with treated HIV, as evidenced by stable CD4 &gt; 200 for at least
             6 months, are eligible.

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

          -  History of organ transplant that requires use of immunosuppressives.

          -  Any condition that would jeopardize the safety of the subject or compliance with the
             Protocol.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease, including unstable angina, acute myocardial
             infarction within 6 months from Day 1 of study drug administration, New York Heart
             Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia requiring therapy
             Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines
             and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed within 30 days prior to initiation of
             treatment.
