  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing bariatric surgery often develop new vitamin and/or mineral deficiencies
      or exacerbate prior deficiencies after surgery. Several bariatric supplement products exist
      including oral tablets and transdermal patches. The purpose of this study is to observe the
      concentrations of serum micronutrients and determine how many deficiencies develop in
      patients who use a transdermal patch.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo either a sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass procedure. All patients
      enrolled will have previously chosen to use the Patch MD MultiVitamin Plus patch for vitamin
      and mineral supplementation versus oral or other dosage forms of vitamins after surgery. A
      conversation between the patient and provider will occur first during a pre operative
      appointment, at which time the patient will be presented with the option to use oral vitamins
      or the Patch MD MultiVitamin Plus patch after surgery. Only if the patient chooses the patch
      will he/she be made aware of the study and recruited. Pre operative blood draws will be used
      to determine baseline micronutrient serum concentrations and existing deficiencies. The
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) will be used pre operatively to determine
      baseline gastrointestinal symptoms. Post operative blood draws and GSRS data will be
      collected at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery.
