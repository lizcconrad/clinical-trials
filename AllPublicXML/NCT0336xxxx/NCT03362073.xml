      To establish the role of ketamine in hospitalized terminally ill cancer patients with
      refractory cancer pain, using continuous intravenous infusion of ketamine
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  There are approximately 20 percent patients of refractory cancer pain, which is troubled
           with uncontrolled pain though treatment including opioids.

        -  Ketamine has been showed the performance of Ketamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
           receptor blocker, in refractory cancer pain based on prior studies.

        -  We cannot yet confirm the role of Ketamine comparing the benefit and risk due to
           incompatible results of prior studies. Additionally, most of prior studies were studied
           in heterogenous groups, which are from beginning of palliative chemotherapy to terminal
           status, so role of ketamine was not assessed in homogeneous terminally ill cancer
           patients. And they has used mostly 'bolus intravenous infusion' or 'continuous
           subcutaneous infusion (CSCI)', relatively rare in continuous intravenous infusion
           (CIVI).

        -  The bolus intravenous method is convenient but is concerned with leading to relatively
           severe adverse events due to poor general condition of terminally ill cancer patients,
           the CSCI method is not recommended because of adverse events (AEs) such as skin
           irritation. On the contrary, the CIVI method using gradual increasing ketamine minimizes
           AEs and is free of skin irritation. Most of hospitalized terminally ill cancer patients
           has proper IV access using intravascular devices (chemoport or PICC). So, CIVI method is
           suitable to hospitalized terminally ill cancer patients.

        -  This study assess the efficacy and safety of 5-days CIVI gradual dose titration of
           Ketamine in terminally ill cancer patients with refractory cancer pain.
