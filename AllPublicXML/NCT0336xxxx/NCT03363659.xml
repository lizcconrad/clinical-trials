  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of Disulfiram antitumor effects suggested in preclinical studies is MGMT
      (methyl-guanine-methyl-transferase) inhibition. Disulfiram MGMT inhibitory effect is enhanced
      by addition of Copper. This study evaluates the impact of DSF + Cu combination when added to
      standard Temozolomide in the treatment of unmethylated GBM patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumor and one of the most devastating
      cancers. The current standard of care for glioblastoma includes maximal safe resection
      followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide, which results in a median progression-free
      survival of less than 7 months, and median overall survival (OS) of less than 15 months.
      Moreover, patients with unmethylated glioblastoma respond poorly to this current standard
      treatment. This clinical trial evaluates the potential role of continuous, upfront use of
      Disulfiram in combination with Copper gluconate in enhancing temozolomide effect in the
      treatment of unmethylated GBM patients.

Temozolomide will be administered following the standard Stupp protocol at a dose of 75 mg/m2 for 42 days with concurrent radiation therapy. Temozolomide maintenance dose will be 150 mg/m2 once daily on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle while DSF-Cu is continued twice daily, as tolerated, for the duration of the Temozolomide adjuvant treatment. Patients demonstrating continued benefit from the adjuvant temozolomide after 6 cycles can continue treatment to a maximum of 12 cycles</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Diagnosis of histologically confirmed glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). Subjects with an
             original histologic diagnosis of low grade glioma or anaplastic glioma (WHO grade II
             or III) are eligible if a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma is made
