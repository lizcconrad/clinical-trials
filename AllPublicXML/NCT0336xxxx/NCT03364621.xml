    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study investigating the disease course of patients with colorectal
      cancer that have had their cancer spread to their liver. The aim of this study is find
      potential biomarkers for disease recurrence and therapeutic targets for prognostic
      information.

      Colorectal cancer (CRC), the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality, often has a pattern of
      targeting the liver during initial metastases. The Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of
      Colorectal Cancer Patients with Isolated Liver Metastases to Understand Response and
      Resistance to Cancer Therapy (COMPARISON) study aims to assess the disease course of CRC by
      collecting primary tumor and metastatic liver specimens following pre-operative chemotherapy.
      If relapse occurs following surgical resection of the liver, biopsies will also be done for
      molecular analysis. As a result, these samples can be analyzed for chemotherapy resistance
      mechanisms and therapeutic targets to determine potential clinical outcomes for this
      particular subset of CRC patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligibility Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed CRC with isolated liver metastasis

          2. Patients must be planned for a hepatic metastasectomy

          3. Patients must have received at least 3 cycles of chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI with
             or without Bevacizumab) prior to the planned hepatic metastasectomy

          4. Primary tumor must be considered resectable with a plan for this to either occur
             concurrently with the liver resection or subsequent to this.

          5. If primary has already been resected before liver resection, archival tissue must be
             available for genomic analysis

          6. Patients must be 18yrs of age or older

          7. Ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with un-resectable or borderline resectable isolated liver metastases as
             judged by the multidisciplinary hepatobiliary tumor board at PM or BCCA after a course
             of pre-operative chemotherapy will be excluded

          2. Patients with evidence of possible metastatic disease at any sites outside the liver
             are not eligible

          3. Patients with any major co-morbidity or co-morbidities that will render liver
             resection very high risk in investigator's opinion

          4. Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures.

          5. Patients with a previous history of another primary cancer treated within 5 years of
             study entry are not eligible except those with basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin and intraepithelial neoplasia.
