  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological movement disorder, meaning
      that symptoms continue and worsen over time. Nearly 10 million people worldwide are living
      with Parkinson's disease. Finding cost-effective non-invasive monitoring techniques for
      detecting motor symptoms caused by Parkinson's disease are potentially of significant value
      for improving care. Of the PD symptoms, the motor symptoms are the most common and detectable
      signs that can be assessed unobtrusively for both diagnosis and for evaluating the
      effectiveness of the treatments.

      The goal of our study is to find methods for identifying and classifying the motor symptoms
      caused by Parkinson's disease. Focus of the study is on long-term motion tracking
      measurements conducted at home during normal everyday life. Both accelerometers connected to
      arm and leg and mobile phone inbuilt sensors carried in the belt are utilized in the study.
      The research has two main objectives / hypotheses:

        1. Can the motor symptoms related to different levels of Parkinson's disease be identified
           using motion tracking sensors? The first objective includes extracting and screening the
           motion differences of patients in early stages of the diseases in comparison with the
           patients in developed stages (patients having hypokinesia, dyskinesia and state changes)
           of the diseases and their differences with healthy control elderly adults using advanced
           signal and data analytics. Data from questionnaires and walking test conducted in the
           hospital environment are utilized as comparison points. Goal is to test the hypothesis
           that the amount of motor symptoms can be detected and the three groups can be reliably
           separated using sensor data.

        2. Can the time when the Parkinson medicine is taken be detected from the movement signals?

      A sample of 50 volunteer PD patients with early stage of the disease (no dyskinesia and state
      changes), plus 50 volunteer PD patients in the later stage of the disease (having dyskinesia
      and state changes), plus 50 volunteers who do not have Parkinson's disease will be recruited
      for the research.

      Study starts with a telephone screening and visit to the hospital. Background characteristics
      and stage of the Parkinson's disease is evaluated in the hospital using a UPDRS
      questionnaires (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; Finnish version) and a standardized
      20-step walking test. Before the walking test, accelerometer sensors are attached to the
      shank and on the nondominant wrist. In addition, the participant wears a smart mobile phone
      with embedded accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Based on the questionnaires and walking
      test study physiotherapist classifies the participant into one of the three study groups.

      The major part of the study involves a 3-day motion screening in a free-living setting in
      which the subjects are wearing the abovementioned sensors for as long duration as they
      comfortably can and are willing. This 3-day study starts immediately after completion of the
      20-step walking test in the hospital. During the 3-day study, subjects are free to live their
      lives without any additional tests. Subjects mark down the time when they take their
      Parkinson medication.

        Patients having Parkinson's disease will be recruited with two methods: A) Unit of
        Neurology at Satakunta Central Hospital searches from the patient records potential
        participants, who have visited the hospital during the past 5 years with ICD-10 code G20.
        B) In case not enough participants are found from the Unit of Neurology, advertisements in
        local newspapers, in local Parkinson's disease patient association newsletters and in the
        web site of the hospital will be utilized.

        For recruiting volunteers without Parkinson's disease into the reference group, an
        advertisement is placed in local newspapers and in the web pages of the hospital.
