  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to compare the transverse
      development of the arches and the incisor inclination comparing two different ligating
      systems (SL vs CL) with the same arch form protocol (Damon arch form) and the same
      disarticulation protocols after the alignment and leveling period of non-extraction patients.

      Materials and Methods: Fifty-four subjects were randomly with an electronic randomization
      program allocated to treatment with either a self-ligating bracket system (Damon Q-slot
      0.022&quot;, Ormco Corp,) or a conventional bracket system (Orthos-slot 0.022&quot;, Ormco Corp). All
      patients were treated following the same protocol and arch wire sequence: 0.014-inch,
      0.018-inch and 0.014x0.025-inch Damon copper nickel-titanium arch wires (Cu-NiTi; Ormco).
      Lateral cephalograms and study models, taken at prior to treatment (T0) and after alignment
      and levelling (T1), were used to compare the amount of arch expansion and incisor angulation
      changes that took place. In the analysis of results in a single observer analyzes the data
      blindly without knowing which group the patients belonged. Results: Models and cephalograms
      of the patients and both stages(T0-T1) were measured at the data were analyzed in STATA S.E.
      Treatment produce statistically significant increases in transverse arch dimensions
      especially in premolars maxillary (2.8-4.3mm) and mandibullary (2.0-4.2mm) of both group. The
      expansion in the maxillary arch was similar for both groups, but in the mandibular arch was
      greater in the self ligation group in about 2 mm more. Conclusions: The treatment with self
      ligation brackets produced more expansion in the mandibular arch than the conventional
      ligation brackets when used the same arch Damon protocols.

    <description>The maxillary and mandibular widths were measured between the cusp tips of the canines, the buccal cusp tips of the first and second premolars and the mesio-buccal cusp tips of the first molars . They were measured using a digital caliper (Starrett 799A-6/150 Digital Caliper, Athol, Massachusetts, USA) positioned parallel to the occlusal plane.</description>

    <description>incisor inclination , the maxillary incisors were measured in the lateral cephalogram, relative to the cranial base (U1-SN) and the palatal plane (U1-PP); the mandibular incisor were related to the mandibular plane (L1/Go-Gn) and NB (L1-NB).</description>
