  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are at higher risk for developing
      co-existing mental health conditions and consequently experiencing psychiatric
      hospitalization, compared to the general pediatric population. However, hospital environments
      can be exceptionally stressful for this population, given their social-communication
      deficits, ineffective emotional regulation skills and heightened physiological arousal. While
      the use of animal-assisted activities (AAA) show potential for various improvements in
      children with ASD in community settings, these &quot;stress-reducing&quot; and &quot;social-buffering&quot;
      benefits have not yet been studied within a psychiatric hospital setting for youth with ASD.

      Objectives: Evaluate whether an AAA with canines can lead to reduced physiological arousal
      and improvements in social-communication as well as aberrant behaviors in children and
      adolescents diagnosed with ASD in a specialized psychiatric hospital setting.

      Methods: Participants were recruited from the Neuropsychiatric Special Care (NSC) program's
      inpatient and/or partial day-treatment program. Prior to study participation, baseline
      demographic measures were acquired from caregivers and participants' ASD diagnosis was
      confirmed. Participants experienced two, randomly assigned 35-minute sessions (AAA and
      Control Condition) with a minimum two-day washout period between groups. Each session
      included a baseline 20-minute social skills group immediately followed by a 10 minute
      experimental or control condition. The AAA condition introduced a canine and volunteer
      handler for free interaction time while the control condition introduced a novel toy and a
      volunteer for free interaction. Participants' physiological arousal was continuously assessed
      throughout all conditions via the Empatica E-4 wristbands (Empatica Inc. 2014). All sessions
      were videotaped for behavioral coding using the Observation of Human Animal Interaction for
      Research - Modified, v.1.

    <intervention_model_description>To investigate the effect of canine animal assisted activities (AAA) on physiological arousal levels in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (ages 4 to 17 years) in a specialized psychiatric hospital program. It is hypothesized that children with ASD will demonstrate lower physiological arousal in the presence of canines, compared to a non-animal control.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Wristband device is worn by the participant for 90 minutes during the day of the experimental condition. Physiological measure of Galvanic skin response, heart rate, heart rate variability will be assessed at baseline through 90 minutes. Collection points during this day includes comparison from baseline, social group, and experimental condition.</description>

    <description>The Observation of Human-Animal Interaction for Research (OHAIRE) is a timed interval coding system intended to capture the unique interactions between humans and animals. It was originally developed and piloted with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) interacting with typically-developing peers in a small group school setting with guinea pigs compared to toys.</description>
