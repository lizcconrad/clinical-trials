             inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), diuretics and
             sacubitril/valsartan for 4 weeks or longer, without change in drug therapy or dosage
             regimen, prior to Visit 1 (and continued same HF therapy through Visit 2).

          4. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥ 10 to ≤ 35% as determined by Screening
             echocardiogram (ECHO).

          5. NT pro BNP ≥ 400 pg/mL.

          6. If subject has had coronary artery bypass surgery, then at least one conduit must be
             patent and therefore be amendable for test article.

          7. Women of child bearing capacity must have a negative pregnancy test before 2 days of

             methods of effective birth control include total sexual abstinence; a condom with
             spermicide (men) in combination with barrier methods (diaphragm, cervical cap or
             cervical sponge); hormonal birth control (oral or injectable contraceptives);
             intrauterine devices; or surgical sterilization (vasectomy and testing that shows
             there is no sperm in the semen for men and bilateral tubal ligation +/- oophorectomy

             percentile upper reference limit, and either ischemic symptoms, electrocardiogram
             changes, imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
             abnormality, or identification of an intracoronary thrombus by coronary angiography.

          6. Thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100,000 platelets/µL) or bleeding diathesis.
