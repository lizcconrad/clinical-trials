    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and phase I/II study, consisting of dose
      escalation in Part A and extension in Part B.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation and dose expansion to determine safety and tolerability of AZD3759, and
      explore RP2D in treatment of Chinese patients with EGFRm+ NSCLC with CNS metastasis. Three
      dose cohorts include: 150, 200 and 250 mg twice daily. Subjects will receive multiple doses
      of AZD3759 for consecutively 21 days each cycle. Dose escalation is planned to be performed
      in a single center, and dose expansion in multiple centers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects have to provide written informed consent

          2. Male or female Chinese patients â‰¥18 years old.

          3. With histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer with
             activating mutation in EGFR single gene (Exon19Del or L858R).

          4. Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage IV) with BM and/or LM.

          5. ECOG grade 0 to 1, without worsening in the past 2 weeks, If ECOG performance status
             is grade 2 due to LM disease, the patient can also be enrolled.

          6. Female subjects must adopt appropriate contraception measures and avoid breastfeeding.

          7. Male subjects must be willing to use barrier contraception (e.g. condom) until 3
             months after the last dose of study drug.

          8. LM patients should not receive EGFR TKI treatment previously. Patients without
             progression of disease other than intracranial disease after previous EGFR TKI
             treatment can also be enrolled.

          9. BM patients, asymptomatic BM patients who have not received treatment with any EGFR
             TKI previously and considered by the investigator to need no local treatment.

         10. BM patients must have at least one measurable intracranial lesion; in case of previous
             radiotherapy, patients must have progression or no response after radiotherapy.

         11. LM patients must be confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. Diagnosis only by
             MRI does not meet inclusion criteria. Patients with both BM and LM are considered as
             LM.

             drug. Patients who have received whole-brain radiotherapy within 4 weeks.

          7. Patients with a history of allergy to AZD3759 and its structural analogues or
             pharmaceutical excipients (whether active or not).

          8. Subjects who are receiving (or can not discontinue at least 1 week prior to initial
             dose of study drug) any drug or traditional Chinese medicine known to inhibit or
             induce CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 activity.

          9. Subjects who have received AZD3759 treatment previously.

         10. Unresolved adverse events of greater than CTCAE grade 1 caused by previous treatment
             at study initiation, not including hair loss.

         11. Any of the following criteria for cardiac disorders:

               -  QT interval (QTc) value &gt;470 ms.

               -  Any clinically significant arrhythmia, resting ECG conduction and morphological
                  abnormalities.

               -  Any factor that may increase risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmia,

               -  laboratory results indicate insufficient bone marrow reserve or organ
                  dysfunction:

         12. History of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung disease or
             radiation pneumonitis requiring steroids, or any evidence of clinically active
             interstitial lung disease.

         13. Severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases as judged by the investigator,

         14. Known intracranial hemorrhage not related to tumor.

         15. Subjects with nausea and vomiting hardly controlled by supportive treatment, chronic
             gastrointestinal disease, inability to swallow prescription drug or previous
             enterectomy that prevents sufficient absorption of AZD3759.

         16. Serious medical or psychiatric disorders that prevent subjects from following or
             tolerating study treatment.

         17. Central nervous system complications requiring emergency neurosurgical intervention
             (e.g. resection or shunt).

         18. LM patients: unable to undergo CSF collection through repeated lumbar puncture or
             Ommaya reservoir placement.
