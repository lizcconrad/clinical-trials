  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FLAG1 study will assess the diagnostic performance of biomarkers Glutathion
      S-Transferase-π (GST-π) and Peroxyredoxin 1 (PRDX1) to identify cerebral infarction of less
      than 4,5 hours in a population of patients with neurological deficiency of less than 12
      hours.
