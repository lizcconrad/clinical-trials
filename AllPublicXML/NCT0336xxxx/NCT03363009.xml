  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor physical performance and poor nutritional status increase the risk of complications
      after major surgery. Prehabilitation is the process of enhancing the functional capacity
      before surgery.

      A major problem is the adherence of the patients to the physical program. A controlled
      randomized study is therefore proposed to determine the impact of coaching on functional
      exercise capacity. All patients will wear connected devices to measure their physical
      activity. They will be randomized to either a group in which coaching will be adapted to the
      physical activity, or a control group in which coaching is performed without any information
      about physical activity
