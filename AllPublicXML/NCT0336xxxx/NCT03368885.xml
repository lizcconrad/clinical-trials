  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has two arms; both experimental and control areas will receive standard
      interventions given under polio eradication program of PCI. Participants in the experimental
      arm receive additional interventions on nutrition (improve diet diversity in pregnant women
      and children of 6-23 months) for exact 12 months. The study includes awareness generation
      (regarding nutrition) through community mobilization, counseling and capacity building of
      community mobilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental arm will receive the following interventions:

        1. Interpersonal communication (IPC) to reach target women (Women in their 2nd or 3rd
           trimester of pregnancy and women with 6-23 months old child) to deliver messages on
           maternal nutrition package and complementary feeding through home visits made by
           Community Mobilization Coordinator (CMC).

        2. Expanded community mobilization involving key influencers in family like husbands and
           mothers -in-law and community opinion leaders, religious leaders, Village Health
           Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC) members. The aims are to improve awareness,
           shift norms and perceptions, engage husbands and local opinion leaders to promote
           healthy behaviour practices related to maternal nutrition and complementary feeding.

        3. Strategic use of data to design a context-specific program and track the progress of the
           program with regards to impact on social norms and behaviors at household/community
           level and demonstrate the feasibility of integrating select MIYCN interventions in polio
           eradication platforms.

        4. Convergence: The convergence will mainly focus on three Cs - maintain consistency, avoid
           conflict and enhance cooperation. This will aid in passing consistent MIYCN messages to
           the target community and ensure effective teamwork, collaboration and mutual support
