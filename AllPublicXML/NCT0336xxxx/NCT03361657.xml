  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studying the arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference in children undergoing
      laparoscopic surgeries under different intra-abdominal pressures is of extreme importance.
      This is because both hyper and hypocarbia are detrimental in this vulnerable age group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capnography provides a non-invasive estimate of arterial CO2 levels and allows clinicians to
      modify mechanical ventilation settings in order to maintain normocapnia. Normally, a positive
      gap between arterial CO2 and ETCO2 of approximately 0.5 kPa is assumed in a healthy patient
      and ventilation settings are adjusted accordingly. However, the correlation between PaCO2 and
      PetCO2 during laparoscopic surgery is inconsistent mainly due to inter- and intra-individual
      variability. Discrepancies between arterial carbon dioxide and End-tidal carbon dioxide
      measures have been demonstrated in ventilated children with cyanotic congenital heart disease
      , infants with respiratory failure and during visceral and urological laparoscopic surgery.
      Moreover, as the increase in PaCO2 is directly proportional to the level of intra-abdominal
      pressure (IAP) used, variations in the arterial to end-tidal carbon dioxide difference can be
      also expected with different levels of IAP used.
