  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the antibiotic resistance increases, the eradication rate of triple therapy is decreasing.
      Recent guideline recommend the use of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy in areas where
      clarithromycin resistance is greater than 15%. However, the ideal treatment would be the
      tailored therapy which choose the antibiotics depending on the antibiotic resistance. This
      study compared the eradication rates, safety and complicance of tailored therapy compared
      with empirical bismuth quadruple therapy in the naive patients with H. pylori infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to be eligible for first-line H. pylori eradication therapy, at least 80% of
      eradication rate should be achieved by intention to treat (ITT) analysis. However, the triple
      therapy (PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin) is losing 1st-line therapy because of increasing
      antibiotic resistance. The most common cause of failure in triple therapy is clarithromycin
      resistance.

      In the past, clarithromycin resistance was rarely observed in Korea, but the resistance rate
      has increased rapidly during the last 10 years, up to 37.3%.

      As an alternative, Korean guidelines of Helicobacter pylori eradication in 2013 recommend
      that bismuth-containing antibiotics (not containing clarithromycin) should be considered in
      areas with high clarithromycin resistance as in Korea. However, there is a lack of research
      on the efficacy of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as a 1st-line therapy. The aim of
      this prospectivce randomized study is to investingate the efficacy, conpliance, adverse
      events and cost-effectiveness between bismuth containing quadruple therapy and tailored
      therapy in areas with high clarithromycin resistance
