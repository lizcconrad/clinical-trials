    <textblock>
      The creation of a database containing the medical data of patients followed in allergology at
      the University Hospital of Grenoble will permit to study allergic versus non-allergic
      hypersensitivity drug reaction as well as the risk of cross-reactions between medicinal drugs
      belonging to the same pharmacological class.

      The main objectives of the study are to estimate and to compare the proportion of allergic
      hypersensitivity drug reaction and the proportion of non allergic hypersensitivity drug
      reaction, and to characterize these two types of hypersensitivity drug reaction on clinical,
      biological and chronological aspects.

      In a second time, ancillary study will be conducted in order to :

        -  identify drugs that potentially induced histamine-liberation in patients diagnosed with
           non allergic hypersensitivity drug reaction

        -  investigate the risk of cross-reactions between drugs belonging to the same
           pharmacotherapeutic class in patients diagnosed with allergic hypersensitivity drug
           reaction.

      This study is an observational cohort study conducted at University Hospital of Grenoble. It
      include retrospectively and prospectively the patients followed in the allergology department
      for the realization of immunoallergological test after suspicion of hypersensitivity drug
      reaction. The data are collected in a database from medical consultation reports that are
      systematically reported to the pharmacovigilance regional center. An anonymization number is
      assigned for each patient included in the study.The data collected include patient's personal
      and family medical history, a clinical, biological and chronological description of the
      hypersensitivity reaction, the results of the immunoallergologic skin tests as well as the
      final diagnosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases where a non-iatrogenic cause was finally identified

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For the estimation and comparison of the proportions, the patients who haven't carried
             out all their immunoallergologic tests investigations at the University Hospital of
             Grenoble are not included (this concerns patient who have realized only oral
             rechallenge test at hospital)

          -  To realize the comparative analysis of allergic versus non-allergic hypersensitivity
             drug reaction : cases that are insufficiently documented on clinical, biological and /
             or chronological aspects are excluded. This concerns especially patients who realize
             immunoallergologic tests investigations after a skin reaction that occurred &quot;in
             childhood&quot;.
