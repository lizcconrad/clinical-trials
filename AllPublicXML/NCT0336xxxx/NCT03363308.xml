  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a health workforce capacity building and quality
      improvement intervention focused on integrated day-of-birth and post-pregnancy care at 16
      hospitals in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. The intervention package consists of a
      low-dose, high-frequency (LDHF) training of health workers, support for quality improvement
      teams, and provision of critical equipment, supplies and drugs within a quality improvement
      (QI) framework.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The health workforce capacity building and quality improvement intervention will be
      implemented in two phases: eight facilities will receive the intervention in phase 1 and the
      remaining eight facilities will receive the intervention in phase 2.

      Objective 1: For objective 2 on facility-based health outcomes, the study design is a
      cluster-randomized evaluation in phase 1. The intervention's effects will be assessed by
      comparing an intervention group and a control group of facilities. These will be selected
      from 16 Kinshasa health facilities. Intervention and control facilities' monthly reported
      health outcomes will be compared in a 12-month baseline period and 12-month period during and
      after the intervention implementation (Phase 1) in a difference-in-difference analysis. In
      Phase 2, all facilities will have their monthly service statistics and health outcomes
      reviewed for trends in improvement.

      Overall, in Phase 1, eight intervention sites will be matched to eight sites serving as
      controls. In Phase 2, the eight Phase 1 control sites will then receive the same package as
      the intervention sites in Phase 1. Sites will be stratified by case load, low and high (over
      90 births per month), and funding (public or private funding). Within each stratum, prior to
      start of the intervention, there will be random selection to intervention and control groups
      to allow for baseline comparability between groups.

    <description>Each observed structured clinical exam (OSCE) or knowledge tests has between 13 and 38 items. A participant needs to achieve 85% correct score to pass at post-training to assess provider competencies. The main indicator for analysis will be the mean number of items (or percent of items) correctly answered. This mean percent of items correctly answered will be done pre-training, post-training and after 6 months. This will be done in the 8 intervention group facilities only in Phase I and again in the 8 new facilities in Phase II.</description>
