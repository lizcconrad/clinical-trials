  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of the female population will suffer from fibroids, benign tumors of the uterus,
      before menopause, a third of whom experience significant symptoms which lower their quality
      of life. Fibroids can range from being extremely stiff tumors to soft, cyst-like, or mushy
      masses. Currently, surgical planning for fibroid treatment is done using ultrasound or MRI,
      which inform physicians of fibroid position and size, but omit any information regarding
      tissue stiffness or composition, which can impact surgical techniques and approaches.
      Elastography is a new, affordable imaging modality currently being used in cancer research,
      and is able to measure tissue stiffness non-invasively. We propose a preliminary assessment
      of elastography for application in screening fibroids in pre-menopausal women. This study
      will assess elastography as a valid and reliable tool for measuring fibroid and uterine
      tissue stiffness, with the long-term goal of classifying fibroid tissues to aid in surgical
      planning. We hypothesize that between-day and within-day measures of tissue stiffness taken
      using elastography will show excellent reliability and will correlate with experimental
      measures of tissue stiffness.

      Initial assessment: Consented women in the surgical stream will attend two pre-operative
      evaluations within one week of their planned hysterectomy. Consented women in the medical
      stream will attend one visit at their earliest convenience after recruitment, and another in
      three months. At each visit, women will undergo SWE and 3D US (Supersonic UltrafastTM
      AixplorerÂ®, Apexium Medical, Canada) assessments of their uterus as a whole, at 10 healthy
      sites and at all identifiable fibroid sites deemed viable for mechanical testing. SWE and
      volumes will be recorded in series of 5s clips. Morphologic measurements of the selected
      fibroids will be made and fibroids will be given identification numbers based on a 3D size
      and location map. SWE will be used to take relevant measures of tissue stiffness at all sites
      of interest. Three repetitions of each measurement will be performed.

      Surgical Intervention: The surgical approach (abdominal vs laparoscopic) will be recorded as
      well as secondary outcomes including operating time, blood loss, surgical technique
      conversions, failed/incomplete excisions, and additional procedures performed. These data
      will be used for descriptive purposes and contribute to the development of a database for our
      long-term research goal.

      Medical Intervention: Medical treatment will be recorded as well as secondary outcomes
      relating to patient symptoms and quality of life.These data will be used for descriptive
      purposes and contribute to the development of a database for our long-term research goal.

      Tissue Sampling: Consistent with TOH protocol, all uterine tissue from hysterectomy will be
      sent to pathology for evaluation. A pathologist will surgically excise ten 1 cm3 samples of
      healthy uterine tissue from the sites identified using US, and each fibroid will be dissected
      out, labelled with its identification number, measured, weighed, and then transported to the
      Ottawa Hospital tissue testing laboratory.

      Mechanical Testing: The mechanical testing protocol will occur within two hours of tissue
      transport. The healthy tissue samples will be cut to size while the fibroids will be tested
      intact. All samples will be tested (Biotester, CellScale, Waterloo, Canada) at room
      temperature, cyclically in compression (1 Hz, 6% pre-compression). The relevant measures of
      tissue stiffness, including the complex modulus of elasticity, loss factor, and stiffness
      contract ratio, will be calculated for each sample. All samples will be returned to
      pathology, where fibroid composition will be determined.

      Statistical analyses: Regression methods will serve to validate SWE stiffness measures (Aim
      1), with mechanically tested measures of stiffness, as the criterion standard, and map the
      relationship between SWE and ex-vivo mechanical testing outcomes. To analyze reliability (Aim
      2), ANOVA's, ICCs, and pairwise testing, where appropriate, will test differences between
      measures taken at uniform sites and planes over multiple sessions and visits to investigate
      site- and plane-specific stiffness differences. This testing will also investigate
      differences in mean and peak stiffness values between healthy tissue, normal fibroids and
      degenerative fibroids as appropriate. Post-hoc power analyses will evaluate the effect sizes
      for non-significant differences.
