    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib and nivolumab work in treating
      patients with endometrial that has come back or spread to other places in the body.
      Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and nivolumab may work better in treating
      endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical anti-tumor activity of XL184 (cabozantinib) and nivolumab based
      on progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic
      endometrial cancer previously treated with at least one line of platinum-based chemotherapy
      compared to patients receiving nivolumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of XL184 and nivolumab in terms of overall response rate (ORR)
      compared to nivolumab alone.

      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) of patients receiving XL184 and nivolumab compared to
      patients receiving nivolumab alone.

      III. To evaluate the safety of combination treatment using XL184 and nivolumab in patients
      with advanced, recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer.

      IV. To evaluate correlation between PD-L1 expression, CD3, CD4 and CD8 infiltrates and
      outcome (PFS, ORR, OS).

      V. To compare PD-L1 expression, CD3, CD4 and CD8 infiltrates in the primary tumor (archival
      tissue) and in the tissue from baseline biopsy.

      VI. To assess activity (PFS, ORR and OS) of nivolumab alone or in combination with XL184
      according to microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatched repair (MMR) status.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess activity (PFS, ORR and OS) of XL184 and nivolumab in patients progressed after
      previous exposure to anti PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2 agents or crossed-over from single agent
      nivolumab, and in patients with diagnosis of carcinosarcoma.

      II. To compare microsatellite (MS) and MMR status, in the primary tumor (archival tissue) and
      in the tissue from baseline biopsy.

      III. To assess the genomic and immune-markers landscape at baseline on tumor tissue and
      changes in immune landscape in peripheral blood during treatment and correlate with outcome.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm A: Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, then on day 1 beginning course 5.

      Arm B: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm A. Patients may cross-over to Arm A at the time
      of disease progression.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-37 days, then every 12
      weeks.

                       cabozantinib if there were wound complications

                    -  Minor surgery within 1 month of the first dose of cabozantinib if there were
                       no wound healing complications or within 3 months of the first dose of
                       cabozantinib if there were wound complications

               -  In addition, complete wound healing from prior surgery must be confirmed at least
                  28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib irrespective of the time from
                  surgery

          -  Known active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
             (AIDS) related illness, or hepatitis B or C infection

          -  Administration of a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy

          -  Subjects with diagnosis of immunodeficiency or who are receiving systemic steroid
             therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the
             first dose of trial treatment; the following are exceptions to this exclusion
             criteria: intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroids injections (e.g.
             intra-articular injection); systemic corticosteroids at physiologic dose not to exceed
             10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity
             reactions (eg, computed tomography [CT] scan premedication)

          -  History of autoimmune disease, such as, but not restricted to: rheumatoid arthritis,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematous, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis requiring treatment within the last two years;
             patients with vitiligo or diabetes are not excluded; replacement therapy (e.g.
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or
             pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment;
             patients with recent history of thyroiditis; subjects with remote history (greater
             than 5 years) of thyroiditis are not excluded

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt;
             500 ms within 28 days before randomization; Note: if initial QTcF is found to be &gt; 500
             ms, two additional electrocardiogram (EKG)s separated by at least 3 minutes should be
             performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =&lt; 500 ms,
             the subject meets eligibility in this regard

          -  Patient is not able to swallow pills

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with XL184 and nivolumab
