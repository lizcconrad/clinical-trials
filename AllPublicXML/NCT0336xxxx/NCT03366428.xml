    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effect of DS-8201a on heart rate and the movement of the drug
      through the body (pharmacokinetics) in participants with a certain type of breast cancer
      (HER2).

    <time_frame>Samples collected: Cycles 1 and 3 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8,15, 22); Cycles 2, 4, 6 and 8 (Days 1 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>Categories: DS-8201a, total anti HER2 antibody, and MAAA-1181a
AUCinf is calculated as the area under the curve from time 0 to infinity</description>

    <measure>Half-life (T1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples collected: Cycles 1 and 3 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8,15, 22); Cycles 2, 4, 6 and 8 (Days 1 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>Categories: DS-8201a, total anti HER2 antibody, and MAAA-1181a
T1/2 is the time it takes for half of the drug to leave the body</description>

    <measure>Clearance (CL) of DS8201a</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples collected: Cycles 1 and 3 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8,15, 22); Cycles 2, 4, 6 and 8 (Days 1 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>CL is derived from the curve of concentration versus time</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of DS-8201a at steady state (Vss)</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples collected: Cycles 1 and 3 (Days 1, 2, 4, 8,15, 22); Cycles 2, 4, 6 and 8 (Days 1 and 22)</time_frame>
    <description>Vss is the apparent volume of distribution at steady state</description>
