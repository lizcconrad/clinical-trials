      for Adolescents and Adults, which aims at promoting Sharing, Mind and Enjoyment (SME) and
      enhancing mental wellbeing. The Mental Wellness Project is financially supported by the
      Health Care and Promotion Fund from Food and Health Bureau and led by the School of Public
      Health, University of Hong Kong (HKU). Joyful Adventure Day - A Pilot Project aims to promote
      the SME related behaviors of adolescents through intervention of physical activities, and to
      promote their happiness, well-being and mental health knowledge.

      A cluster randomized controlled trial design will be adopted. The Project will organize two
      joyful adventure days in secondary schools in the form of physical activities and
      competitions with the following activities:

        -  Fitness assessment (enjoyment) and in-door games, which will be designed, supervised and
           supported by experienced social workers;

        -  Short interactive talk on SME, positive thinking and understanding of adolescent mental
           health problem (in particular the anxiety disorders) and mental well-being;

        -  Issue achievement / improvement stickers to students, and attractive prizes to the 10
           fittest students by chairperson / members of Parent-Teacher Association (sharing);

        -  Provide physical activity diary after 1st session of adventure day, and invite family
           members / peers to join the competition at the 2nd session.

      The major subjects of Joyful Adventure Day Pilot Project RCT study are 200-300 students. 3
      schools will be included in the evaluation. The classes in the same school will either be
      assigned into intervention group or waitlist control group (the intervention won't be
      provided during evaluation period and will be provided after the evaluation period.).

      There will then be 4 assessments (pre-intervention, immediate post intervention, one month
      and three months after baseline) to evaluate the effects of the intervention programme. In
      the assessments, students will be asked to complete questionnaires to measure the changes in
      fitness enjoyment, physical activity frequency, happiness, well-being and knowledge and
      attitude towards mental health. The satisfaction towards the intervention, as well as the
      level of participation and ratings for the intervention will be evaluated.
