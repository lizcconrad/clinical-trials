      Introduction: The Experience Sampling Method is a research tool to study what people do and
      feel in their day to day. It allows to analyse temporal relationships between variables and
      has a high ecological validity.

      Aim: To evaluate fluctuations of depressive symptoms and subjective well-being and to analyse
      the factors related to these fluctuations.

      Methodology: Longitudinal study that will follow up for two weeks a representative sample of
      the population aged 18 to 65 years living in Madrid using the Experience Sampling Method. An
      interviewer will visit the participants at their home to carry out a structured interview on
      mental health and well-being and to install a mobile app on the smart phone of participants
      in order for them to fill out information about their emotional state during the following
      two weeks. Participants will use the smart phone screen to fill out a brief questionnaire
      about their feelings, the activities they are doing and the people with whom they are
      interacting. Multilevel analysis based on lineal hierarchical models will be employed for
      data analysis as well as methods based on machine learning.
