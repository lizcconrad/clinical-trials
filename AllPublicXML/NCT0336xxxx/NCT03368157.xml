  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop a detailed pregnancy registry of patients with
      Multiple Sclerosis in the New England states. Women with a diagnosis of MS that are either
      pregnant or actively planning to become pregnant are eligible to participate.

      The study will solely take place through phone interviews. One of the study coordinator at
      the Partners MS Center will contact the participant for an intake phone interview where
      general information about the individual, their pregnancy and their MS will be collected.
      Thereafter the coordinator will contact the participant every 3 months for 20 minutes follow
      up interviews. After birth, the coordinator will collect information on the growth and
      development of the participant's baby. Pediatric interviews will be conducted at 2, 4, 6, 9,
      12, 18, 24, 36 months. Information from the participant's neurologist and obstetrician, as
      well as information from the baby's pediatrician, will be made available to the study staff
      at regular intervals throughout the duration of the study.

      Through this study, the investigators hope to learn more about the effects of MS on pregnancy
      and pediatric development, and about the effects of pregnancy on the course of MS.
