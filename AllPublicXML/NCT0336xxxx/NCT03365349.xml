      This randomized prospective pilot study aims at comparing the impact of a &quot;living theater&quot;
      session with a simple &quot;writing workshop &quot; on emotional distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes
      Questionnaire PAID) and illness perception ( Illness Perception Questionnaire IPQR) during a
      5 day education course on Functional Insulin Therapy (FIT). Questionaries at T0 (course day 1
      ) and T1 (3 months later). qualitative interviews in a sub group of patients random G1 and G2
      subgroup at T1, with a general inductive approach to capture all representations

    <measure>Change from baseline IPQR (Illness Perception Questionnaire) score at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQR) There is no total score for IPQR Nine subscales are reported for IPQR. High scores on the identity, timeline, consequences, and cyclical dimensions represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed to the illness, the chronicity of the condition, the negative consequences of the illness, and the cyclical nature of the condition. High scores on the personal control, treatment control and coherence dimensions, represent positive beliefs about the controllability of the illness and a personal understanding of the condition. Minimal and maximal score are respectively 0 and 14 for identity, 0 and 30 for timeline, consequences, personal control, and emotional representations, 0 and 25 for treatment control and illness coherence illness, 0-20 for timeline cyclical</description>

    <time_frame>3 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A psychologist conducted qualitative interviews according to a blinded process in a subgroup of 6 patients at T3 months, with a general inductive approach to capture all representations on diabetes and the session. Transcribed Interviews were analyzed regarding inductive coding and 2 independent investigators built and tested a coding schedule.</description>
