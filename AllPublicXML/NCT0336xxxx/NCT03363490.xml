  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic disabling disease,the importance of patient's
      self-management in chronic disease has been paid more and more attention internationally.
      Currently, the self-management of OA patients in China is lack of instructions from
      professional clinicians, and leads to inappropriate excise, irregular drug medication. OAKP
      (Osteoarthritis of the Knee Self-Management Program) is a program initiated from University
      of Southern Denmark, follows clinical guidelines of OA, formatted for easy use by patients
      and clinicians, including customized neuromuscular exercise therapy, educational sessions of
      what is OA and how to control body weight to protect the knee.

      The main purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of neuromuscular exercise
      therapy and OAKP, see whether it can help patients to relief the symptom and improve life
      quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to enroll patients above 50 years old who suffered from knee OA, but patients
      meets any of the exclusion criteria will not be enrolled. 400 patients of knee OA will be
      randomly divided into A, B, C, D four parallel groups with fully informed, each group will
      enroll 100 patients, A for control group, B for neuromuscular exercise, C for self-management
      program, D for neuromuscular exercise and self-management program, respectively. Each
      collaborate hospital would enroll patients as a multicenter clinical trial. Patient will
      receive a baseline and 3m, 6m, 12m follow-up evaluation of their knee physical function.
      Primary outcome measure is KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), secondary
      evaluation include VAS, EQ-5D, Arthritis self-efficacy score, 6-minutes Walk test, TUG test,
      20 meters quick walk test,Stand up test in 30 seconds, Balance test, Kellgren&amp; Lawrence（KL）,
      Pain medication. Outcome will compare the mean difference between baseline survey and 12
      months of follow-up in each group, using t-test or chi-square test,respectively.

    <description>WOMAC grade is a reliable knee osteoarthritis patients' self-reported therapeutic effect evaluation system, including three dimensions: pain, stiffness, daily activities and quality of life, and each dimension includes several questions scale from 0(worst) to 4(best) , total score of each dimension range from zero (worst) to 100 (best). Score of each question add together will be the total score. Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, through visit or telephone follow-up will be recorded. Compare the mean difference of WOMAC grade between baseline survey and 12 months of follow-up in each group.</description>
