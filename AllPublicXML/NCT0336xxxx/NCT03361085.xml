    <textblock>
      This project aims to design, implement and evaluate a modular bundle of prevention measures
      for non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia (nvHAP). It is a single-center
      project, taking place at the University Hospital in Zurich (UHZ). For effectivity reasons,
      only departments and their related wards with a substantial nvHAP rate (nvHAP/patient
      discharge or death) will be included. Intermediate care wards (IMC) will be included,
      intensive care units (ICU) will be excluded.

      The five work packages (WP) are:

        1. Design bundle of prevention measures for nvHAP - The nvHAP-bundle

        2. Implementation of nvHAP-bundle

        3. Evaluation of nvHAP-bundle concerning effectiveness to prevent nvHAP

        4. Evaluation of adherence to nvHAP-Bundle elements

        5. Evaluation of implementation strategy, i.e. satisfaction, protocol fidelity, and
           sustainability

      For this project, the investigators work with the theoretical conception that interventions
      are composed of 'core components' (the central and crucial elements of the intervention) and
      an 'adaptable periphery' (the features of the intervention that can be adapted to the
      specific context to which it is being implemented). During WP1 of this project, the
      investigators will work together with experts to establish the core technical components of
      the nvHAP-Bundle. In WP2, the investigators will collaborate with frontline providers during
      a series of Implementation learning laboratories, and support them in developing unique
      implementation plans adapted to their local contexts, representing the adaptable periphery of
      the intervention. The five dimensions of the Consolidation framework for implementation
      Research (CFIR) framework will serve as a theoretical guide to describe the implementation
      strategy. Implementation will happen according to the principals of change management

      Work package 1 (WP1): Design nvHAP-Bundle The goal is developing a prevention bundle for
      nvHAP in an interdisciplinary and inter-professional &quot;nvHAP-Bundle Group&quot; consisting of
      experts in hospital epidemiology, nursing care and physiotherapy. The elements of the
      nvHAP-bundle are chosen based on 1) the existing, although scarce, scientific literature
      about nvHAP prevention measures and 2) the presumed feasibility and effectiveness of
      prevention measures. Feasibility is evaluated in interviews with involved healthcare
      providers and is an important dimension for inclusion of the prevention measure in the
      bundle.

      The bundle will also include assessments to evaluate every patient's need for certain
      respective prevention measure, if necessary.

      Work package 2 (WP2): Implementation of nvHAP-bundle The implementation strategy will first
      be &quot;tested&quot; in one pilot-ward (break-through method) as part of the development of the
      intervention.

      The nvHAP-bundle will be implemented in the 6 departments and their related wards with
      considerable nvHAP rates. As the study takes place in only one hospital with close proximity
      of wards, the risk of contamination is high. Therefore, the investigators plan to employ a
      stepped wedged study design approach (Figure 1) with sequential randomization of the
      departments to start the intervention (implementation of nvHAP-bundle). This also allows
      optimal coaching of the implementation during a one-month active implementation phase.
      Participants are all patients of the respective wards attributed to the 10 included
      departments.

      Work package 3 (WP3): Evaluation of nvHAP-bundle concerning effectiveness to prevent nvHAP

        -  Primary outcome variable: NvHAP rate (nvHAP/patient discharge or death)

        -  Secondary outcome variables: In-hospital mortality rate (death/patient discharge or
           death) and length of stay

      NvHAP is defined according to Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection Control through
      Surveillance/Improving Patient Safety in Europe (HELICS/IPSE) case definition which was
      adopted also for the European and Swiss point prevalence studies of healthcare associated
      infections.14, 15 NvHAP-rate is calculated by Episode of nvHAP per patient discharge or
      death.

      In-hospital mortality rate is defined as mortality during current hospitalization per patient
      discharge or death. Length of stay is defined as duration of current hospitalization in days.

      Sample size calculation assumed an nvHAP-rate of 1.7% of patients (derived from coding data
      and after applying a correction factor, a factor that adjusts for coded Ventilator-associated
      Pneumonia (VAP) and miscoded nvHAP and community acquired pneumonia) and a 30% reduction of
      nvHAP-rate caused by the intervention based on existing published literature. The
      investigators calculated that approximately 18'000 patients must be enrolled in the study to
      achieve statistical power of 80% with a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Expected
      duration is 12 months for control and intervention phase each.

      The difference of the nvHAP rate, mortality rate and length of stay between control patients
      and patients after implementation of nvHAP-bundle is evaluated.

      Work package 4 (WP4): Evaluation of adherence to nvHAP-Bundle elements

        -  Evaluation of documented prevention measures in electronic patient records (EPR)

        -  Direct non-participatory observations

        -  If appropriate: Questionnaires and/or interviews For prevention measures that are
           documented in each patient's EPR, adherence is evaluated by extracting data from EPR.
           Direct observations of the execution of prevention measures are applied to assess
           quality of execution and for measures that are not documented in patient records. By
           these two methods adherence rates are assessed, defined as: correctly applied prevention
           measure per patient/moment qualifying for prevention measure.

      Work package 5 (WP5): Evaluation of the implementation strategy The investigators plan to
      assess the implementation procedure by interviews and/or questionnaires. Interviews will be
      conducted with involved healthcare providers, with the study and implementation team, and
      with key persons from the hospital leadership to identify barriers and facilitators for
      adherence and describe the overall success of the intervention.

      The investigators will prospectively analyze the implementation strategy through regular
      interviews with key individuals, before, during, and following implementation of the nvHAP
      intervention. Further, key individuals who champion the implementation of the nvHAP bundle in
      each department will be invited to keep a journal of activities undertaken relevant to
      implementation. At the conclusion of the project, these journals will be analyzed as a means
      of indirect observation, following qualitative content analysis.
