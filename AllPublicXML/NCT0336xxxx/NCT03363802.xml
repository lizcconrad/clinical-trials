      Assessment of Pubertal Growth Spurt in Growing Egyptian Females Using Modified Middle Phalanx
      of The Middle Finger Stages and Its Correlation With Development Stage of Mandibular Second
      Molar

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sample will be selected randomly from different schools in the government.

        -  Digital periapical radiograph for the middle finger for each participants will be taken
           using Digital x-ray portable machine.

        -  Radiographical images will be stored in a digital sensor to be transferred to computer
           then we asses growth spurt in girls and correlate it with devlopemt stage of mandibular
           second molar
