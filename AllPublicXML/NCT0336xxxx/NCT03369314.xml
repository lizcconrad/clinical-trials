      This observational study enrolls patients who have received at least one infusion of
      octaplasLG®. OctaplasLG® will be administered standard of care and observation occurs during
      the treatment and 24 hours after the end of treatment. Characteristics of the use of
      octaplasLG®, tolerance criteria, and efficacy criteria will be collected.

    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-interventional, multicentre study meeting a post-marketing need. The data
      will be collected in all patients who have received at least one infusion of octaplasLG®.

      The duration of follow-up is limited to the duration of treatment with octaplasLG® plus 24 h
      of monitoring after cessation of treatment.

      Characteristics of the use of octaplasLG® (indication for the transfusion, degree of urgency,
      characteristics of plasma infusions, patient characteristics, number of iso-group and/or
      compatible units administered, tolerance criteria (adverse effects), and efficacy criteria
      (for patients with confirmed diagnosis of TTP--time to normalization of platelet count) will
      be collected.

        Analyses will be carried out on all patients included, i.e. who have received at least one
        unit of octaplasLG®. This population will be stratified based on the different product
        indications.

        For the population defined as that of patients with TTP, only those patients for whom the
        investigator has indicated a confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic TTP will be included in the
        efficacy analysis (see secondary objective).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is treated with octaplasLG® (receiving at least 1 unit of 200 ml
             octaplasLG®)

          2. In accordance with Reference Methodology MR-003, the patient of legal age must be
             individually informed through an information sheet, and must not oppose participating
             in this non-interventional study (with no collection of consent). If the patient is
             unable to receive the information and express any opposition, family members or the
             trusted person receive the information and must not oppose the collection of data*.
             For minor patients, each of the holders of parental authority receive the information
             and must not oppose the collection of data.

               -  However, the patient in question will be informed if his/her condition later
                  allows.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Patient's refusal to participate
