    <measure>Change in Patient Global Assessment -CIT (PGA-CIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Patient Global Assessment-CIT (PGA-CIT) scores on Day 1, 8 and 15 within 2 consecutive cycles.
A 4-item instrument designed to assess global change in quality of life and symptoms over time (since the previous clinic visit).
b. The amount of change is rated using a 7-point Likert-style scale ranging from 1 (very much worse) to 7 (very much better). Items are scored as single items with higher scores indicating a greater degree of improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Patients with Thrombocytopenia (FACT-Th18)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in FACT-TH18 scores on Day 1, 8 and 15 of 2 consecutive cycles.
The FACT-Th18 is a 45-item instrument that includes 28 FACT general items covering 4 domains (physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being) with an additional 17 items covering Additional Concerns, 15 of which specific to thrombocytopenia. b. Scale scores range from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very Much) and can be derived for each of the 4 FACT--G domains, a FACT-G total score, a thrombocytopenia subscale score, and a FACT-Th total score. The FACT-Th has been evaluated as a reliable and valid measure for assessing the impact of thrombocytopenia on patients' lives that can distinguish cancer patients with and without thrombocytopenia and is responsive to increase in platelet count over time.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in European Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scores on Day 1, 8 and 15 of 2 consecutive cycles.
The EQ-5D provides a simple descriptive health profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ-5D descriptive health profile comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension comprises 3 levels (no problems, some/moderate problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-3L health state is defined by combining one level from each of the 5 dimensions.
EQ-5D Index values range from -0.59 to 1.00. In addition, the EQ-5D includes a single item visual analogue scale item that records the subject's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 to 100) line. Higher EQ-5D index and visual analogue scale scores represent better health status.</description>
