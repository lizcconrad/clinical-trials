      Background:

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are two eye diseases. They were studied
      in the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS2) and the AREDS2 Follow-On study. These studies
      followed the natural course of the diseases. They also provided data on the long-term effects
      of certain oral supplements on AMD.

      Objective:

      To study the long-term effects of oral supplements on several things. These include
      incidences of lung cancer, development of late AMD, cataract surgery, cognitive function, and
      cardiovascular events.

      Eligibility:

      Former AREDS2 and AREDS2 Follow-On participants

      Design:

      Participants will have 1 visit. It will include:

      An eye exam that tests how well participants can see, measures eye pressure, and checks eye
      movements. The pupil will be dilated with eye drops. Pictures will be taken of the retina and
      the inside of the eye.

      Participants will grip a device in their hand to measure their grip strength.

      A blood sample will be taken. This will be stored for future genetic research. Cells may be
      created from the sample.

      A small sample of skin will be taken.

      Objective: The overall objective of this extended follow-up study is to provide data
      regarding the incidence of late age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract surgery and
      lung cancer in the approximately 1,200 AREDS2 study participants enrolled in the Follow-on
      study. The specific objectives for the study are to:

        -  Study the rates of progression to late AMD, neovascular AMD, or geographic atrophy
           associated with AMD.

        -  To seek incidences of lung cancer, by treatment assignment.

        -  To assess cognitive understanding by phone prior to coming into the clinic.

        -  To seek incidences of cardiovascular events.

      Study Population: Up to 3,200 participants who were previously enrolled in the AREDS2 and
      AREDS2 Follow-on protocols are currently followed by telephone contact every six months for
      the past four years. It is expected that 1,200 of these 3,200 participants will be eligible
      to participate in the study. Up to 83 participants will be enrolled at the NEI.

      Design: This is an extension of the multicenter, randomized trial of lutein, zeaxanthin and
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the AMD AREDS2 trial. Data for this extension will be
      collected by staff at selected AREDS2 clinical sites via an in-clinic visit.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes of the study will be the rates of progression to late
      AMD, neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy associated with AMD. Also of interest are the
      long-term rates of progression to late AMD, incidents of lung cancer and cataract surgery.
      Participant reports of incident cardiovascular events will be collected as secondary
      outcomes.
