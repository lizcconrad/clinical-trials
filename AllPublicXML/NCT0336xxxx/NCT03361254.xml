  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a worldwide recognized treatment of acute and chronic
      mild to moderate graft versus host disease (GVHD), in second or further line of treatment.
      Contrary to immunosuppressive drugs, ECP is not associated with side effects such as
      opportunistic infections, and is not associated with a higher frequency of relapse of the
      initial hematological disease. High intensity of ECP regimen (1 to 3 sessions per week, in
      case of chronic or acute GVHD) seems to be correlated to a higher efficacy. However, high
      intensity of ECP treatment is often difficult to sustain, because of frequent logistical
      problems to perform aphereses, such as venous access failure, infections of central line,
      deep blood cytopenias that require many transfusions before performing aphereses. Merlin et
      al. first described the feasibility of white blood cells cryopreservation before UVA
      irradiation, in vitro, then in vivo. We also recently reported the feasibility and efficacy
      of cryopreserved ECP in a series of 20 patients (adults and children), with acute and chronic
      GVHD, who had recurrent contraindications to aphereses, that prevented the realization of an
      intensive program of ECP. No adverse events occurred, and efficacy seemed to be similar to
      &quot;classical&quot; ECP (35% of complete overall response, and 40% of partial response). White blood
      cells (WBC) were divided after collection on Optia or Cellex apheresis machines: one was
      immediately treated with 8-MOP (methoxsalen) and ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation, while the
      other was cryopreserved, and further (a few days later) thawed, sensitized with 8-MOP and
      irradiated before injection to the patient.

      The aim of this study is to analyze this method in a prospective way, with complete
      biological data collection, of apoptosis, cytokines release etc…, necessary to the full
      description of cryopreservation of white blood cells before their irradiation and reinjection
      to the patient.

      We will propose this technique of cryopreservation to every patient with an indication of ECP
      for acute or chronic GVHD in Nancy Hospital for 18 months.

      The main objective of this prospective interventional pilot study is to demonstrate the
      ability of this technique to follow high intensity regimen recommendations, as mentioned
      above:

        -  3 ECP sessions (thawed or fresh) per week during 3 months for grade III to IV acute
           GVHD, then

        -  2 ECP sessions (thawed or fresh) per week during 3 months for grade II acute GVHD

        -  1 ECP session per week for chronic GVHD during 3 months

      The other objectives are:

        -  To describe the safety and efficacy of cryo ECP. Efficacy will be assessed with a
           composite criteria test, comporting 5 items, which will be compared for each patient
           with a paired cohort of historical patients treated in Nancy University Hospital since
           2010 (match will be made on type and grade of GVHD, and age under and over 18 year-old)

        -  To fully describe the biological consequences of cryopreservation of WBC before UVA
           irradiation: apoptosis rate and time, lymphocyte functional tests (lymphoblastic
           transformation test), cytokines release, number of lymphocytes, and monocytes at the
           time of reinjection, bacteriological tests, residual diméthylsulfoxyde (DMSO)
           quantification

        -  To demonstrate the decrease in red blood cells and platelets transfusion number, due to
           the sparing effect of cryo ECP on aphereses number.
