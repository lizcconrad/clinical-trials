  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in women, with about
      50% of women experiencing at least one UTI in their lifetime.

      The main pharmacological treatments of cystitis usually involve the use of antibiotics, in
      particular quinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), fosfomycin, second-generation
      and third-generation cephalosporins, and b-lactam antibiotics associated with b-lactamase
      inhibitors.

      This is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluating the
      effect of the probiotic on recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in adult women recently
      treated for UTI.

      Primary objective The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation
      with probiotic on the frequency of UTI during six months from start of intervention in adult
      women with recurrent UTI.
