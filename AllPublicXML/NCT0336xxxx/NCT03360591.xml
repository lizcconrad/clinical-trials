      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcome of patients with severe aortic valve
      stenosis and associated significant coronary artery disease treated with TAVI and a
      percutaneous myocardial revascularization dictated according to two different strategies:

        1. the Angiographically-guided strategy;

        2. the Physiologically-guided strategy.

    <textblock>
      Nowadays there are no clear recommendations about treatment of coronary in patients with
      severe aortic valve stenosis eligible for percutaneous valve replacement, and those available
      rely on a &quot;common sense&quot;, class C, level of evidence. No randomized trials debride the skein
      about the best strategy of revascularization in this complex group of patients. In
      particular, it remains unclear whether it is preferable a preventive treatment or an
      ischemia-driven revascularization and, in addition, if it is safer and better for patient's
      health a simultaneous or a staged strategy.

      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcome of patients with severe aortic valve
      stenosis and associated significant coronary artery disease treated with TAVI and a
      percutaneous myocardial revascularization dictated according to two different strategies.

      The Angiographically-guided strategy is that of aiming the most complete degree of
      revascularization based on angiographic evaluation (stenting all coronary stenosis of major
      branches &gt;2.5mm, with a %DS&gt;50% as evaluated by visual estimation).

      The Physiologically-guided strategy is that of treating only lesions with FFR ≤0.80, and
      leaving on optimal medical treatment lesions with FFR &gt;0.80. The iFR values will be recorded
      in all patients, and verified in the core laboratory to allow a post-hoc analysis correlating
      the 0.80 FFR cut-off with different iFR cut-off values, according to recent observations and
      using the same study end-points.

      Particular attention will be dedicated to the eventual occurrence of clinical events in
      patients deferred on the bases of FFR values &gt;0.80 that show a discrepancy with positive
      (&lt;0.89) iFR values to investigate the reliability of the FFR in the Aortic Stenosis setting.

      Both groups will receive the same TAVI strategy and optimal medical therapy. The study is
      designed as randomized, prospective, multi.center, open label, experimental trial with
      medical device. After discharge patients will be contacted at 30 days, 6 - 12 and 24 months
      after the procedure to assess the general clinical status and at 12 months to assess the
      occurrence of events included in the primary and secondary endpoints. The duration of study
      participation is 24 months for enrolment, ad 24 months for final follow-up.

    <description>Patients randomized in this group will undergo stenting of coronary lesions showing FFR values ≤0.80 only.
Lesions showing positive FFR measurements (&lt;0.80) must be treated with PCI, before or after TAVI.
Lesions showing clearly negative values (FFR &gt;0.80) will not be treated with PCI before TAVI, and repeated FFR and iFR measurements after TAVI are strongly recommended.
Lesions showing &quot;borderline&quot; FFR measurements before TAVI (FFR 0.80-0.83), should be measured again (both FFR and iFR) after TAVI, and the decision of treating of deferring treatment in a given lesion will be based on the FFR value obtained after TAVI.
In all cases iFR values will be recorded for a post hoc analysis and for validation of the study endpoints according to iFR values.</description>

    <description>Patients allocated in this group will undergo stenting of all coronary stenosis ≥50% as assessed by visual estimation in vessels ≥2.5mm. PCI can be performed before in a previous procedure, or after TAVI, but always within one month, ± 5 days of the valve implantation.PCI in the group randomized to the angio-guided procedure can be performed therefore, either before or after valve implantation, in the same or in different procedures. Implantation of second-generation drug eluting stents (DES) in all interventions is advised, but not mandatory, and the brand of the stent is left to the operators and center's choice.</description>
