    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate and validate of endogenous markers for the assessment of
      change in CYP3A activity by route of administration in Korean healthy subjects using
      metabolomics. In addition, we aim to screen novel endogenous marker, which could determine
      the total or intestinal CYP activity.

      This study is an open-label, one-sequence, three-period study. A total of 16 healthy male
      subjects will be enrolled. In period 1, subjects will be administered midazolam IV 1 mg, and
      co-administration of midazolam IV 1mg and grapefruit juice 500 mL. In period 2, subjects will
      be administered midazolam PO 5 mg, and co-administration of midazolam PO 5mg and grapefruit
      juice 500 mL. In period 3, subjects will be administered clarithromycin 500 mg for 3-days in
      b.i.d regimen prior to admission. Subjects will be administered midazolam IV 1mg and PO 5mg
      after admission.
