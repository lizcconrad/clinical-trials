  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe hypoxemia following trauma may happen in many circumstances (aspiration,
      ventilation-associated pneumonia, lung contusion...), most of which are not exclusively
      associated with a direct injury to the lungs. Severe trauma and associated musculoskeletal
      injuries result in the acute release of Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) in
      plasma, many of which are made of nucleic acids. DAMPs then bind leukocytes and trigger
      NETosis (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps), the release of nuclear material coated with
      proteolytic enzymes, which ultimately promotes remote lung injury and acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS).

      Considering that many DAMPs and all NETs are made of nucleic acids, we hypothesize that
      dornase alfa, a commercially available recombinant desoxyribonuclease (DNAse) could reduce
      DAMPs and NETs-induced lung injury in severe trauma patients under mechanical ventilation in
      the intensive care unit (ICU).

      The primary objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of moderate to severe
      ARDS in severe trauma patients during the first seven ICU days from 45% to 30% by providing
      aerosolized dornase alfa once during the first two consecutive ICU days and compared to
      equivalent provision of placebo (NaCl 0,9%).

      The secondary objectives are to demonstrate, by using aerosolized dornase alfa compared to
      placebo:

        -  an improvement in static lung compliance

        -  a reduction in mechanical ventilation duration / an increase in ventilation-free ICU
           days

        -  a reduction in the length of ICU stay

        -  a reduction in the hospital length of stay

        -  a reduction in multi-organ failure

        -  a reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

        -  a reduction in mortality at day 28
