    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of navitoclax and how well it
      works when given together with vistusertib in treating patients with small cell lung cancer
      and solid tumors that have come back. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as navitoclax, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Vistusertib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving navitoclax and
      vistusertib may work better in treating patients with small cell lung cancer and solid
      tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of navitoclax and vistusertib
      in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of navitoclax and
      vistusertib. (Phase I) III. To determine the objective response rate (ORR), defined as
      complete plus partial response, of the combination of navitoclax and vistusertib in patients
      with recurrent small cell lung cancer (SCLC). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of navitoclax and vistusertib when administered together.
      (Phase I) II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) III. To confirm the safety
      and tolerability of navitoclax and vistusertib at the RP2D. (Phase II) IV. To estimate
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the combination of navitoclax
      and vistusertib at the RP2D. (Phase II) V. To estimate disease control rate (DCR) of the
      combination of navitoclax and vistusertib at the RP2D. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pharmacodynamic changes in levels of phosphorylated 4EBP1 (p4EBP1) the ratio of
      p4EBP1 to total (p4EBP1/4EBP1) in paired pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies at the RP2D.
      (Phase II) II. To correlate changes in BAX and MCL-1 with response. (Phase II) III. To
      estimate the baseline inter-patient variability in p4EBP1, pS6, BAX, and MCL-1. (Phase II)
      IV. To explore exposure-response relationships between navitoclax and vistusertib exposure
      and the pharmacodynamic endpoints (safety, efficacy, and laboratory correlatives). (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of navitoclax followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) and vistusertib PO twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.

             factor; G-CSF], sargramostim [granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor;
             GM-CSF]) within 14 days prior to receiving study treatment

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements

          -  Patients who have received a live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of
