  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of early deep venous complex ligation (eDVCL)
      in patients affected by clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing robot-assisted
      radical prostatectomy with or without pelvic lymph node dissection. Overall, 312 patients
      will be randomized to the standard technique vs. eDVCL. The primary endpoint is represented
      by early urinary continence recovery. The secondary endpoints are perioperative outcomes,
      erectile function recovery and positive surgical margins.

    <description>During robot-assisted radical prostatectomy after the posterior isolation of seminal vesicles, the Retzius space will be accessed and the endopelvic fascia will be incised. The DVC will be identified and incised. The DVC will be then selectively ligated using a V-lok 3/0 barbed suture. After the early DVC isolation, incision and ligation, the bladder neck will be incised and preserved when possible. A posterior nerve sparing approach will be then performed. During apical dissection, the urethral sphincter will be identified and carefully preserved. Posterior reconstruction and anastomosis will be then performed.</description>

    <description>After the posterior isolation of seminal vesicles, the Retzius space will be accessed and the endopelvic fascia will be incised. The bladder neck will be then incised and preserved when possible. An inter-fascial or intra-fascial nerve-sparing technique will be then performed and the posterolateral aspect of the neurovascular bundles will be preserved. The DVC will be then isolated and selectively ligated using a V-lok 3/0 barbed suture. The anterolateral fibers of the neurovascular bundles will be then identified and preserved when possible. During apical dissection, the urethral sphincter will be identified and carefully preserved. Posterior reconstruction and anastomosis will be then performed.</description>

    <description>After the posterior isolation of seminal vesicles, the Retzius space will be accessed and the endopelvic fascia will be incised. The DVC will be identified and incised. The DVC will be then selectively ligated using a V-lok 3/0 barbed suture. This approach would allow for the preservation of the external urethral sphincter and for the identification and preservation of the neurovascular bundles that are located in the anterolateral aspect of the prostate. After the early DVC isolation, incision and ligation, the bladder neck will be incised and preserved when possible. A posterior nerve sparing approach will be then performed. During apical dissection, the urethral sphincter will be identified and carefully preserved. Posterior reconstruction and anastomosis will be then performed.</description>

          4. On stable dose of current regular medication for at least 4 weeks prior to trial entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The participant may not enter the trial if ANY of the following apply:

          1. Life expectancy of less than 12 months

          2. Previous chemotherapy

          3. Previous brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy

          9. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the trial, or may
             influence the result of the trial, or the participant's ability to participate in the
             trial
