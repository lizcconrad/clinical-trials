  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study I1F-MC-RHBH is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel-group study examining the effect of 2 dose regimens of ixekizumab versus placebo in
      participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (Ps) during an induction dosing period
      with dosing for 12 weeks and the primary endpoint measured at 12 weeks, followed by a
      randomized, 48-week maintenance dosing period. During the maintenance dosing period, the
      study will evaluate the maintenance of response/remission, as well as relapse or rebound
      following treatment withdrawal, and response to retreatment following relapse.
