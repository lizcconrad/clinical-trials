  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the ninth most common cause of cancer in Australian women,
      with an estimated 1500 new diagnoses in Australia in 2015, and remains the seventh most
      common cause of cancer death in Australian women. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is
      the most common form of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, and accounts for the most deaths due to a
      gynaecological cancer.

      The majority of women diagnosed with High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer present with advanced
      disease, and are typically managed with a combination of cytoreductive surgery and
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite initial good response rates to chemotherapy, High Grade
      Serous Ovarian Cancer recurs in up to 70% of patients who present with Stage III/IV disease.

      The molecular characteristics of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer have recently been
      extensively described in multiple studies. One of the consistent features identified are four
      distinct molecular subtypes that are based on gene expression profiles.These four subtypes
      are associated with differential clinical outcome that are largely consistent across multiple
      datasets. The subtypes may also be predictive for benefit from certain types of treatment.

      The &quot;C1&quot; or mesenchymal subtype is pathologically characterised by an excessive fibrotic
      response of the stroma surrounding tumours, a process that is collectively referred to as
      desmoplasia. Patients with C1 High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer have an increased incidence of
      primary treatment failure and poor overall survival (OS).

      The purpose of this research project is to test how safe and effective the combination
      treatment of cobimetinib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab is as a treatment for patients with a
      C1 subtype of platinum resistant or refractory ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer.

      Cobimetinib is a drug that blocks a protein called Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK).
      MEK proteins are involved in the multiplication of cancer cells. By binding to the MEK
      protein, cobimetinib may help to stop the growth of your cancer cells.

      Bevacizumab is an antibody (a type of protein produced by the immune system) that is
      specifically designed to block a protein called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).
      VEGF is a protein that can increase the growth of tumour cells and binding to VEGF may help
      to stop the growth of tumours.

      Atezolizumab is a type of drug called a Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor.
      PD-L1 binds to PD-1 which is a type of protein found on the surface of cells in your body's
      immune system, and it controls the ability of your body's natural immune response to trigger
      the death of tumour cells. Tumour cells can hide from the immune system by using PD-L1, which
      stops your immune system from triggering tumour cell death.

      Atezolizumab is a drug designed to block this PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by binding to PD-L1 so
      that PD-1 cannot bind to it and stops it from turning off your immune cells. This helps your
      immune system to recognise and destroy tumour cells. In turn, this potentially can stop or
      reverse the growth of your cancer.

      Cobimetinib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab have been used alone or in combination in the
      treatment of many other cancers. Each of them are individually licensed for the treatment of
      cancers such as advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer in
      Australia. However, this treatment combination is experimental and is not approved to treat
      ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancers in any country.
