  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5% to 7% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for the
      treatment of coronary artery disease, require chronic oral anticoagulation on top of aspirin
      and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, mainly due to non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Advent of
      non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) increased treatment options, while there
      is cumulative evidence that dual combination of NOAC and P2Y12 receptor antagonist attenuates
      bleeding without compromising efficacy. Greek AntiPlatElet Atrial Fibrillation (GRAPE-AF) is
      an observational study of non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention, planning to enroll &gt;500 participants during 1 year period in Greece.
      Patients will be followed-up at 1, 6 and 12 months post hospital discharge. Key data to be
      collected pre-discharge include demographics, detailed past medical history, antithrombotic
      and concomitant treatment. Study's primary endpoint is clinically significant bleeding
      defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) ≥2) at 12 months, between vitamin K
      antagonists (VKAs) and NOACs-treated patients. All clinical events will be adjudicated by an
      independent endpoint committee.This study would provide &quot;real world&quot; information on current
      antithrombotic treatment patterns and clinical outcome of patients with non-valvular atrial
      fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention over 1 year period
      will be screened for participation. Discharge antithrombotic medication will be at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      Follow-up visits will be performed at 1, 6 and 12 months post-percutaneous coronary
      intervention by telephone contact or personal interview. All outcome and adverse events will
      be adjudicated by an independent endpoint committee. All data will be recorded in electronic
      forms and multiple quality controls will be performed both electronically and on-site to
      ensure data integrity.

      Platelet reactivity substudy:Patients receiving either clopidogrel or ticagrelor as part of
      their (dual or triple) combination therapy, will be eligible for sub-study of platelet
      function assessment with the VerifyNow assay at 1 month post-percutaneous coronary
      intervention in centers with test availability.

      Sub-study's endpoints will be platelet reactivity between groups and high platelet reactivity
      rate between groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation Non-valvular atrial fibrillation
        (paroxysmal, persistent or permanent) with indication for anticoagulation Written informed
        consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any clinically significant bleeding (BARC ≥2) at the time of screening or within the
             previous month

          2. Prior intracranial bleeding

          3. Dialysis or calculated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min at screening

          4. Known significant liver disease (eg, acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis,
             cirrhosis), or liver function test abnormalities at screening (confirmed with repeat
             testing): alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;5 times the upper limit of normal or ALT &gt;3
             times the upper limit of normal plus total bilirubin &gt;2 times the upper limit of
             normal

          5. A PT or INR test result that is higher than the upper limit of normal at the time of
             screening that suggests an underlying coagulation disorder (except for subjects taking

             may become the index event and is allowed)

          8. Planned coronary artery bypass grafting

          9. Contraindications to the use of clopidogrel or ticagrelor or NOAC, per prescribing
             information (e.gHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
             or co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin,
             nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir).
