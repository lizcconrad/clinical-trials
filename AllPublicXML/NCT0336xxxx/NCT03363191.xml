  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate fluticasone furoate/vilanterol compared with
      fluticasone furoate alone in subjects with asthma that is uncontrolled on low to mid dose
      inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) or low dose ICS/ long acting beta agonist (LABA) combination.
      This is a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study evaluating
      fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 micrograms (mcg) and fluticasone furoate 100 mcg once
      daily, delivered as an inhalation powder using the ELLIPTAÂ® device in subjects with
      uncontrolled asthma despite daily ICS or ICS/LABA therapy. The study will measure treatment
      response and asthma control using the Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) focusing on
      symptomatic control. In this study, proportion of subjects with an improvement in ACQ-7 score
      of &gt;=0.5 at Week 12 compared to Baseline for the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100 mcg/25
      mcg and fluticasone furoate100 mcg groups will be assessed. The total study duration for each
      subject will be 17 weeks including 4-week run in period, 12-week treatment period and 1-week
      follow up period. Approximately 1012 subjects will be randomized into the study. ELLIPTA is a
      registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

    <measure>Number of subjects with an improvement in ACQ-7 score of &gt;= 0.5 at Week 12 compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-7 consists of five questions about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity limitation, and shortness of breath, wheeze) in the previous week, along with one question on daily bronchodilator use in the previous week, and a measure of lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] % predicted). The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment) to six (total impairment) scale. The questions are equally weighted, and the ACQ-7 score is the mean of the 7 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). A score &gt;= 1.5 indicates asthma that is not well controlled, while a mean score of &lt;= 0.75 indicates asthma that is well controlled, with a change of 0.5 defined as the minimal clinically important difference.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be issued an electronic diary for use during the study. Subjects will record daytime asthma symptoms scores and the number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol used during the daytime period. Symptoms and rescue use will be recorded between Visits 1 (Week-4) and 4 (Week 12), once in the evening (reporting daytime symptoms) before taking any rescue medication or ICS. Each evening, participants will record an asthma symptom score using the following scale: 1 = no symptoms during the day 2 = symptoms for one short period during the day 3 = symptoms for two or more short periods during the day 4 = symptoms for most of the day which did not affect my normal daily activities 5 = symptoms for most of the day which did affect my normal daily activities, 6 = symptoms so severe that I could not go to work or perform normal daily activities.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be issued an electronic diary for use during the study. Subjects will record night time asthma symptoms scores and the number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol used during the night time period. Symptoms and rescue use will be recorded twice a day between Visits 1 (Week-4) and 4 (Week 12), once in the morning (reporting night time symptoms) before taking any rescue medication or ICS. Each morning, subjects will record an asthma symptom score using the following scale: 1 = no symptoms during the night, 2 = symptoms causing me to wake once (or wake early), 3 = symptoms causing me to wake twice or more (including waking early), 4 = symptoms causing me to be awake for most of the night, and 5 = symptoms so severe that I did not sleep at all.</description>

             (WOCBP); A WOCBP who agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance during the treatment
             period and for the duration of the study.

             ICS low to medium-dose fluticasone propionate 100 to 250 mcg twice daily or equivalent
             for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1; Subjects maintained on a stable dose of an
             ICS/LABA low-dose combination product (e.g., SERETIDE/ADVAIR 100/50 mcg twice daily or
             equivalent, via other combination products or via separate inhalers) for at least 4
             weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Subjects must have a best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of 50% - 80% of their predicted
             normal value. Predicted values will be based upon Global Lung Function Initiative
             (GLI) equations for spirometry reference values.

          -  Subjects must demonstrate &gt;=12% and 200 milliliter reversibility of FEV1 within 10 to

             Subjects that have documented reversibility meeting the criteria above within the last
             6 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening) will be eligible and do not need to repeat the
             reversibility assessment at Visit 1 (Screening). Reversibility measurements, including
             historical reversibility, should follow/meet the recommendations of the American
             Thoracic Society (ATS)/ European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task force: Standardization
             of Lung Function Testing.

          -  All subjects must be able to replace their current short-acting bronchodilator (SABA),

             used only on an as-needed basis for the duration of the study. Each subject must be
             judged capable of withholding albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 hours prior to

          -  Culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower
             respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of Visit 1

             geographical location which seems likely (in the opinion of the investigator) to
             impair compliance with any aspect of this study protocol.

          -  A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member
             of the participating investigator, sub investigator, study coordinator or an employee
             of the participating investigator.
