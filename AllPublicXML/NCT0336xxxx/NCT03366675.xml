      This study is a single arm, multi-center phase II study of AZD 2811 monotherapy in patients
      with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a second or third line therapy.

      Patients will continue to receive study treatment as described above, until they demonstrate
      objective disease progression (determined by RECIST 1.1) or they meet any other
      discontinuation criteria.

                  equation of ≥51 mL/min:

             Estimated creatinine clearance = (140-age [years]) x weight (kg) (x F)a serum
             creatinine (mg/dL) x 72 a where F=0.85 for females and F=1 for males.

          9. At least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed by imaging or physical
             examination.

         10. Evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential: A woman of
             childbearing potential must have a negative or urine pregnancy test at screening and
             confirmed prior to treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1

         11. Female patients who are not of childbearing potential and fertile female patients of
             childbearing potential who agree to use adequate contraceptive measures, who are not
             breastfeeding. Fertile female patients of childbearing potential should use enhanced
             methods of contraception from the time of screening until 6 months after discontinuing
             study treatment. Acceptable methods of contraception include: combined oral or
             transdermal contraceptives, copper-banded intra-uterine devices and vasectomised
             partner. All methods of contraception (with the exception of total abstinence) should
             be used in combination with the use of a condom by their male sexual partner for
             intercourse. Male patients should be asked to avoid unprotected sex with all sexual
             partners (by use of condoms) during the study, and for a washout period of 6 months
             after the last dose of study drug. Where a sexual partner of a male participant is a
             fertile female patient of childbearing potential, patients should avoid procreation
             for 6 months after completion of study drug treatment. Patients should refrain from
             donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months after discontinuing study
             treatment. If male patients wish to father children they should be advised to arrange
