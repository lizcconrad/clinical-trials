  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates which transfer strategy will result in a higher probability of pregnancy
      in patients whose single best day 5 embryo resulting from an IVF cycle is classified as
      expansion grade &lt;4 by Gardner and Schoolcraft classification. All cycles will be cultured to
      day 6 and half the patients will undergo a fresh embryo transfer and the other half a frozen
      embryo transfer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A lack of established markers for predicting blastocyst development increases the risk of
      having no embryos or embryos not-fully expanded available for transfer. Slower but
      non-arrested embryos are frequently found to have progressed to blastocyst stage by the time
      of a day 6 transfer. In the absence of a receptive endometrium, embryo selection for fresh
      transfer may be futile, and cryopreservation could be a better option. The objective is to
      determine which transfer strategy will result in a higher probability of pregnancy in
      patients whose single best day 5 embryo resulting from an IVF cycle is classified as
      expansion grade &lt;4 by Gardner and Schoolcraft classification. The investigators hypothesize
      that in bad prognosis patients with slow-developing blastocysts, vitrified-warmed embryo
      transfer will result in higher implantation, clinical and ongoing pregnancy and live birth
      rates than fresh embryo transfer.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will be randomized by an intention to treat approach. Randomization at the blastocyst stage is chosen to avoid cycle cancellation if randomized earlier. All components of the IVF/ICSI cycle including stimulation medications, monitoring protocols, etc. will be at the discretion of the participant's primary physician; while this information will be documented it will not constitute criteria for enrolment. The group allocation will take place the day of the embryo transfer. The clinician will randomize all included patients into one of the two study groups using an open computer-generated list. An interim analysis is planned and sample size will be plan accordingly, under the Pocok method, including 2 stages, with p-value as boundary scale, calculated to have 80% power to detect a 20% difference with a reference proportion of 25% clinical pregnancy rate and a one-sided (upper) alpha of 0.025</intervention_model_description>
