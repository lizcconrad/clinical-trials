  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is major problem among Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom
      (OIF), and Operation New Dawn (OND) Veterans. Insomnia impacts physical and mental health
      functioning and is associated with reduced quality of life. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
      Insomnia (CBT-I) is one of the most promising treatments for insomnia; however, access to
      CBT-I is severely limited by a lack of trained clinicians within the Veterans Health
      Administration (VHA) and Department of Defense (DoD). There is a critical need to offer
      innovative approaches to meet the demand and need for insomnia treatment. Leveraging
      technology to meet treatment demands is consistent with service delivery models based upon
      stepped care principles. This randomized controlled trial will determine whether a
      computerized, self-guided, web-based version of CBT-I is efficacious in reducing insomnia
      symptoms and improving functioning compared to a computerized program control.

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Symptom Severity as Measured by the Insomnia Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analyses will be the intent-to-treat comparison between groups of the change in insomnia symptom severity as measured by the ISI from Time 1 to Time 2. Statistical inference regarding the difference between intervention groups will be based on the estimated coefficient for a group indicator variable in each of three analysis of covariance models with the change from Time 1 to Time 2 for each outcome serving as the dependent variable. Additional covariates will include the baseline value of the outcome to improve precision of the estimate, and any potential confounders discovered in the randomization check.</description>
