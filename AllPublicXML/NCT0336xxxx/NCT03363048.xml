  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An experimental trial will be conducted whereby a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
      (SNAP)-like food benefit program will be implemented in 240 SNAP eligible households.
      Baseline and follow up measures will include three 24-hour dietary recalls; household food
      purchase receipt collection; and household food security questions. The individual level
      measures will be collected from the adult most responsible for food shopping and a child in
      the household. After baseline measures are completed households will be randomized to one of
      three conditions: 1) restriction (not allowed to buy sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked
      goods, or candies with food benefits); 2) restriction paired with an incentive (30% financial
      incentive on fruits and vegetables and restriction of purchase of sugar sweetened beverages,
      sweet baked goods, or candy with food benefits); or 3) control (no incentive or
      restrictions). Households in all conditions will be given a debit card that will have funds
      added monthly for a five month period. The dollar amount placed on the card monthly will be
      similar to the amount the household would receive if enrolled in SNAP. All participants will
      be instructed to use the debit card for food purchases only, and they'll be told they
      shouldn't use the card to purchase items currently non-eligible for purchase with SNAP
      benefits (e.g. alcohol, food from restaurants). Those in the restriction condition will also
      be told they cannot use the card to buy sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods, or
      candies. They may purchase these foods using their own money, but not the debit card. Those
      in the restriction plus incentive condition will receive the instructions provided to the
      restriction group plus they will be told that they'll receive a 30% bonus for fruits and
      vegetables purchased using their debit card. Analyses will determine whether the nutritional
      quality of the diet at follow-up differs between experimental groups.
