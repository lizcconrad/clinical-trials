  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) System is an investigational insulin delivery device
      being developed for use for participants with diabetes. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the safety of the AID system and to test whether the AID System functions as it was
      designed to.

      This study will last approximately 12-18 days, not including screening. Screening is required
      within 28 days prior to the start of the study.
