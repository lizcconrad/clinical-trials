  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LP-PLA2) is a good marker of cardiovascular risk and
      inflammation. This study aims at the characteristic and clinical significance of LP-PLA2 test
      in patients with type 2 diabetes(T2D).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We recorded clinical factors, serum levels of glucose, HbA1c, lipids and LP-PLA2 in patients
      with T2D who visited in the Department of Endocrinology at the Nanjing First Hospital from
      January 2015 to August 2016. The relationship between levels of LP-PLA2 and diabetic
      complications are analysed.
