  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of bb2121 in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. A leukapheresis
      procedure will be performed to manufacture bb2121 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T
      cells. Prior to bb2121 infusion subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligibility is determined prior to leukapheresis. Subjects must satisfy the following
        criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject is â‰¥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF).

               -  Must have received at least 3 prior MM treatment regimens. Note: induction with
                  or without hematopoietic stem cell transplant and with or without maintenance
                  therapy is considered a single regimen.

               -  Must have undergone at least 2 consecutive cycles of treatment for each regimen,
                  unless PD was the best response to the regimen.

               -  Must have received a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an
                  anti-CD38 antibody.

               -  Must be refractory to the last treatment regimen.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

          2. History or presence of clinically relevant central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

          3. Subjects with plasma cell leukemia.

          4. Subjects with solitary plasmacytomas or non-secretory myeloma without other evidence
             of measurable disease

          5. Inadequate organ function

          6. Ongoing treatment with chronic immunosuppressants

          7. Previous history of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or treatment
             with any gene therapy-based therapeutic for cancer or investigational cellular therapy
             for cancer or BCMA targeted therapy

          8. Evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          9. Seropositive for and with evidence of active viral infection with hepatitis B virus
             (HBV)

         10. Seropositive for and with evidence of active viral infection with hepatitis B virus
             (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV)

         11. Subjects with a history of class III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF) or severe
             non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, history of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial
             infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia within the previous 6 months.

         12. Subjects with second malignancies in addition to myeloma if the second malignancy has
             required therapy in the last 3 years or is not in complete remission

         13. Pregnant or lactating women.

         14. Subject with known hypersensitivity to any component of bb2121 product
