  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a major problem of public health in the French West Indies, with an
      estimated prevalence of 8%, twice more than in France. In Guadeloupe, according to the
      statistical data of hospital morbidity in 2004, 2643 hospital stays were diagnosed with
      diabetes. These cases mainly concerned woman (62%) and the elderly, from 45 to 74 years old
      (67%).

      The main objective of this research is to describe the insulin protocol used in Guadeloupe
      for treated type 2 diabetes patients and their characteristics:

        -  The duration of the type 2 diabetes

        -  Time elapsing between the diagnosis and the treatment by insulin

        -  Where the follow up care took place

        -  Existence of complications

      Secondary objectives were to describe the link between the HbA1c rate and the insulin therapy
      protocol. And also to present the main inconveniences expressed by patients and their degree
      of autonomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays the set up for insulin treatment is available in general practitioners' offices.
      However, it is restrained by the reticence of patients and physicians. For type 2 diabetes,
      insulin therapy is well managed and there is ongoing progress. But there are still some
      questions about the effect of the treatment in the everyday life of patients: culture, fear,
      material resources, necessity of education.

      Ignorance and prejudices on insulin injection are still prevalent and often it delays for
      more than a year the time when patients have to switch an insulin treatment for unbalanced
      chronic disorder.

      Type 2 diabetes patients think that the treatment is heavy, can lead to serious hypoglycemia,
      is uncomfortable for family and can cause fear.

      Education of the patients can reduce ignorance and prejudices about insulin treatment.

      Nowadays studies show that diabetes patients want to be more involved in the decisions linked
      to their treatment which impact their perception of the disease and the treatment.

      Auto measurement of glycaemia can help the patient better manage his disease and make him
      understand the importance of controlling his glycaemia levels.

      This study could allow to:

        -  Offer a new care organization for a better use of resources (network, patient
           therapeutic education…)

        -  Set up adequate training for professionals and for patients being cared for in medical
           offices.

        -  Improve the glycemic balance of patients and slower the growth of degenerative
           complications.

    <description>The physician or the endocrinologist will see the patient during his consultation. The pharmacist will see the patient when he goes to the pharmacy for an insulin treatment. In each case, the patient will be informed about the study, about the medical data that will be collected anonymously. The date will be strictly confidential and under medical secrecy. Then the patient will meet the physician during another consultation at the University Hospital Center of Guadeloupe, in order to collect information's on a questionnaire. Otherwise, the physician can meet the patient at his home, in case he can't move to the University Hospital Center of Guadeloupe.</description>
