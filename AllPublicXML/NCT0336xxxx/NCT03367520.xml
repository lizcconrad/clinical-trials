  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the high prevalence and great cost of smoking for individuals with serious mental
      illness, an effective smoking cessation intervention for this group of smokers that begins in
      the hospital and continues following discharge is needed. The investigators will develop and
      pilot test StayQuit, a multifaceted smoking cessation intervention for smokers with serious
      mental illness that begins in the hospital and continues for three months after discharge.
      StayQuit will provide a personalized and tailored experience for smokers with serious mental
      illness at different levels of motivation to remain abstinent. In the hospital, StayQuit will
      include a brief motivational intervention that will help smokers relate sustained smoking
      cessation to their values and preferences, shore up motivation to stay quit, and gain
      experience using nicotine replacement therapy. This will be followed by cessation-focused
      discharge planning to engage Veterans in continued smoking cessation services with StayQuit
      staff. After discharge, StayQuit will offer 13 weeks (spread out over 3 months) of smoking
      cessation telephone counseling. The investigators will examine the feasibility of StayQuit by
      collecting both quantitative data on attendance and qualitative data on participants'
      experiences.

    <description>StayQuit offers 3 meetings during hospitalization and up 13 telephone calls. StayQuit begins in the hospital with an assessment of motivation to remain quit after discharge and a brief intervention to develop discrepancy between values and behaviors and generate change talk. Participants are also encouraged to try nicotine replacement therapy during the hospitalization and after discharge. Telephone counseling is brief and focused on managing withdrawal from nicotine, coping with cravings, and supporting use of NRT. The investigators will work with hospital staff as needed to ensure that nicotine replacement therapy is offered to participants during the inpatient stay and prescribed at discharge.</description>
