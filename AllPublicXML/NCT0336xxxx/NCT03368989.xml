  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of osteoblastic bone lesions</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretreatment (about 30 days before treatment) and post treatment (about 4 weeks after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>number of lesions specified before and after the treatment with a bone scan</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>functional status as indicated by score on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretreatment (about 1 to 3 days before each treatment) for a total of 6 treatments</time_frame>
    <description>The ECOG scale describes a patient's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themself, daily activity, and physical ability (walking, working, etc.). The possible scores on the scale are 0 to 5, with 0 being the best outcome and 5 being the worst outcome, details of each score are listed below.
Grade 0 = Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction Grade 1 = Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light house work, office work Grade 2 = Ambulatory and capable of all selfcare but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours Grade 3 = Capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours Grade 4 = Completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair Grade 5 = Dead</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Platelet level</measure>
    <time_frame>pretreatment (about 1 to 7 days before each treatment) for a total of 6 treatments</time_frame>
    <description>A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets</description>
