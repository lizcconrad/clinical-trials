  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of oral administration of an
      Astaxanthin formulation compared to placebo after one month alone and after an additional 3
      months of exercise training on mitochondrial and skeletal muscle function in elderly subjects
      with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction/sarcopenia.

             influence either the results of the trial or the subject's ability to participate in
             the trial

          -  Hospitalization within 3 months for major atherosclerotic events (defined as combined
             incidence of myocardial infarction, urgent target-vessel revascularization, coronary
             bypass surgery and stroke) and for any hospitalization within 2 months.

             &gt;150 mm Hg, DBP &gt;90 mm Hg) or a SBP &gt; 150 mm Hg or DBP &gt; 95 mm Hg at the time of
             screening or baseline. If the initial BP reading is above these values, the reading
             may be repeated one time within 20 minutes of the initial reading.

             Investigator Clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination (as judged
             by the Investigator)

          -  History or evidence of renal, hepatic, pulmonary (including chronic asthma), endocrine
             (eg, diabetes, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), central nervous or
             neurologic disorders (MS, epilepsy, history of seisures), or gastrointestinal
             (cirrhosis or viral hepatitis) system dysfunction

          -  History of seizures or epilepsy

          -  Oral temperature &gt;37.5°C at the time of the physical

          -  Suspicion, or recent history, of alcohol or substance abuse or tobacco use, including
             positive results from the laboratory screening panels conducted at screening

          -  Donated blood or blood products within the past 30 days

          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the Investigator have a clinically significant abnormal
             12-lead ECG during the screening period. Presence of atrial fibrillation, varying
             degrees of AV block, existence of a left bundle branch block, or evidence of previous
             myocardial infarction.

          -  Subjects who are either unwilling to agree to refrain from using or found to be using
             supplementary antioxidant vitamins (eg, Coenzyme Q10) from 7 days prior to dosing and
             throughout the confinement period

          -  Are currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an investigational product or non
             approved use of a drug or device or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical
             research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Have
             participated, within the last 30 days from a clinical trial involving an
             investigational product. If the previous investigational product has a long half life,
             3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) should have passed
