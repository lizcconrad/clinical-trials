  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research into metabolic and hypoxic markers has found evidence of preclinical impact
      of exercise on prostate tumor blood flow and oxygenation in rodents . As radiotherapy is a
      frequently used and effective therapy for and that sufficient oxygenation is decisive to the
      effect of radiotherapy, an underlying hypothesis that aerobic exercise might improve
      treatment efficacy of radiotherapy in prostate cancer is put forward. This study has a
      potential challenging intervention, but a potential very high gain as it includes active
      patient participation to significantly improve outcome of radical radiotherapy.

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial with four to five weeks of moderate/high intensity aerobic
      exercise program compared with no intervention for 32 prostate cancer patients waiting for
      radical prostatectomy at the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN). 16 patients will
      undergo the intervention. The expression of the hypoxic marker pimonidazole in the prostate
      specimens of intervention groups and the control groups will be assessed. This method is
      considered a reliable tissue oxygenation measurement technique. These patients will also have
      their and blood flow and hypoxia measured in prostate cancers through magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRIs).

    <description>The exercise program will be varying between different aerobic activities indoor or outdoor as walking uphill and in stairs in intervals that will differ from session to session to build up the load and progression for these patients. In total, each session will be lasting approximately 45-60 minutes and a physiotherapist or personal trainer will supervise each session. Depending on the participants starting point, there will be 3 supervised session per week and two sessions where the participants do activity with low intensity (walk) by themselves and keep a log with duration (time) and intensity (using Borg scale).</description>
