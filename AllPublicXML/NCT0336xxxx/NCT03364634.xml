    <textblock>
      Observational study to investigate the natural course of intracranial pressure (ICP) after
      decompressive craniectomy (DC) using long-term telemetric ICP monitoring. Patients will have
      continuous ICP measurement performed during the admission to the neuro-intensive care unit
      (NICU) and after discharge weekly measurements sessions will be performed before and after
      cranioplasty.

      Several studies have investigated and documented the effect of DC in lowering ICP in
      intracranial hypertension following acute brain injuries, e.g. severe traumatic brain injury.
      But the natural course of ICP in these patients after the acute phase in the NICU has never
      been investigated. Clinical experience suggests that a DC affects cerebrospinal fluid
      circulation and ICP, e.g. causing hydrocephalus or subdural hygromas.

      The aim of this observational study is to document the natural course of ICP following DC and
      to investigate the effect of cranioplasty on ICP. This is done by implantation of a
      telemetric ICP sensor and weekly follow-up monitoring sessions after discharge from the NICU
      until 1 month after cranioplasty. The monitoring sessions will include standardized body
      positions to investigate postural ICP changes before and after cranioplasty. The project will
      also provide experience with telemetric ICP monitoring during the acute phase in a NICU
      setting.
