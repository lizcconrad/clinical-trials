    <textblock>
      A comparison of post-operative opioid use in Laparoscopic Colectomy patients receiving Opioid
      or Opioid-free Anesthesia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will be composed of 100 patients total, 50 opioid-free anesthesia
      laparoscopic colectomy patients and 50 opioid anesthesia laparoscopic colectomy patients at
      Tampa General Hospital. After consent is obtained patients will be electronically randomized
      using REDCap in a 1:1 ratio and assigned to a opioid anesthesia or opioid free anesthesia
      group. Patients will also consent to be asked survey questions preoperatively and be followed
      for 12 months postoperatively at specific intervals to evaluate pain, satisfaction, and
      opioid prescription use. This will be done through a data mining platform and service known
      as REDCap. REDCap is partnered with USF to allow for subject management, data collection and
      the distribution of surveys via mobile phone. All data collected by REDCap is stored on a
      HIPPA compliant server. Patients will receive automated push notifications to their mobile
      phones to fill out surveys regarding their pill usage, pain, and satisfaction for a year or
      until cessation of opioid use is confirmed. Confirmation of opioid cessation will be
      performed on a case by case basis by the principal investigator, Dr. Camporesi. In addition
      to the surveys performed, nausea and pain scores will be collected prospectively from
      observation in the PACU

    <time_frame>Once a week for up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>a standardized 9 question survey broken into pain severity and pain interference sections. The sections rank various items relating to their respective categorizations of pain on a scale from 0 to 10. The arithmetic mean of each section can then be utilized to determine Severity of pain and impact of pain on daily function during the past week.</description>

    <measure>PACU: Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 - 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores every 15 minutes on a 10 centimeter scale. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (cm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-10. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. no pain (0 cm), mild pain(1-4.4 cm), moderate pain (4.5-7.4 cm), and severe pain (7.5-10 cm). Normative values are not available. The scale has to be shown to the patient otherwise it is an auditory scale not a visual one.</description>

    <description>Doses/concentration of medications/agents used for the anesthetic management of the subjects enrolled in this trial may be adjusted when necessary to provide optimal subject care. Anesthesia will be induced with rocuronium, propofol, intravenous opioids, and other medication(s)/agent(s) at a concentration range/dose(s) based on the clinical need of the subject.
Depth of anesthesia will be measured with BIS-monitoring and a standard approaching 50% suppression will be maintained throughout the main duration of surgery. Reversal agent will be administered at a post-tetanic count of 1 or 2.
Anesthesia will be maintained with IV opioids, propofol and/or medication(s)/agent(s), including inhalation anesthetic agents, at a concentration range/dose(s) based on the clinical need of the subject.
Tracheal extubation will be performed at the end of anesthesia after administration of reversal agent. After extubation, the investigator will determine when the subject is OR discharge ready.</description>
