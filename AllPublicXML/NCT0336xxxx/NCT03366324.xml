  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For micro residual disease (MRD) positive patients who have undergone at least 2 cycles
      chemotherapies for their CD19+ B-cell malignancies, there would be much more risks for them
      to receive hematological stem cell transplantation (HSCT) than MRD- patients. In order to
      reduce HSCT-related adverse events for these kind of patients, investigators plan to conduct
      CAR-T therapies on them first to make them achieve MRD- statuses, and then transfer them to
      HSCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve prognoses for MRD+ patients who have undergone at least 2 cycles
      chemotherapies, patients will receive CAR-T therapy before HSCT, once they achieve MRD-
      remissions, they will subsequently receive HSCT if there are no contraindications.
