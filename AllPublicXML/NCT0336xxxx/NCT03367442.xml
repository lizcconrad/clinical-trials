  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic chest injuries are responsible for significant morbidity and the cause of
      trauma-related death in 20%-25% of cases. Thoracic trauma can include multiple injuries,
      mainly osseous (ribs, sternal fractures, flail chest), pulmonary contusions or lacerations,
      pneumothoraces and pleural effusions, and sometimes involve wounds to the heart and vessels
      (aortic dissection, cardiac contusion) or diaphragm. Following trauma, patients with thoracic
      injuries are at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This worsening
      of respiratory function can lead to requirement for mechanical ventilation. In addition,
      changes to gas exchange may also be generated or aggravated by mechanical ventilation as a
      result of barotrauma, biotrauma, or ventilation-associated pneumonia. Many mechanical
      ventilation strategies have been tried in trauma patients in the last 30 years to determine
      the optimal method of maximizing gas exchange with minimal lung damage. The driving pressure
      of the respiratory system has been shown to strongly correlate with mortality in a recent
      large retrospective ARDSnet study. Respiratory system driving pressure [plateau
      pressureâˆ’positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)] does not account for variable chest wall
      compliance especially in cases of chest trauma. Esophageal manometry can be utilized to
      determine transpulmonary driving pressure. A recent study suggests that utilizing PEEP
      titration to target positive transpulmonary pressure via esophageal manometry causes both
      improved elastance and driving pressures. Treatment strategies leading to decreased
      respiratory system and transpulmonary driving pressure at 24 h may be associated with
      improved 28 day mortality. However, currently no specific study with chest trauma patients
      exists. We propose to investigate the effect of hight transpulmonary driving pressure on
      duration on mechanical ventilation, length of stay and mortality in patients with sever chest
      trauma.
