    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase II, open-label, parallel-cohort study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with the combination of PDR001+LAG525 across multiple tumor types that are relapsed and/or refractory to available standard of care therapies. Patients will receive study treatment for a maximum of 2 years, All disease assessments will be performed locally by the investigator.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) at 24 weeks of PDR001+LAG525 by tumor type in multiple solid and lymphoma</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to assess clinical benefit rate after 24 weeks of treatment with PDR001+LAG525 based on local investigator assessment.
For patients with solid tumors the assessment criteria will be RECIST 1.1 and will include responses of CR or PR or SD. For lymphoma, assessment criteria will be the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, (Cheson et al 2007).There is only one hypothesis to be tested, only one primary outcome measurement, independent of the underlying disease (solid tumor or lymphoma): Is the observed Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) in this trial better than the historical CBR (from the literature)? These are all absolute numbers for each cohort, reported together and independent of how they were measured.</description>

The duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented response to the date first documented disease progression or relapse or death due to any cause.
