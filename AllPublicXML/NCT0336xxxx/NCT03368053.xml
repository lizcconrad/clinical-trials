    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term persistence of binding antibody
      responses against V1V2 and gp120 in subjects who were vaccinated with the envelope
      glycoprotein 120 (gp120)-negative factor (Nef)Tat/ Adjuvant System 01B (AS01B) (GSKSB732461)
      vaccine candidate. Other immune parameters like the HIV-specific cluster of differentiation
      (CD4+) T cell and CD8+ T cell responses will also be evaluated.

      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) contributes to the public-private pox-protein partnership (P5) which is
      currently assessing the safety, immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of a prime-boost regimen
      aimed at preventing HIV transmission (http://www.hvtn.org/en.html). The booster component of
      the candidate vaccine used in this program consists of two gp120 clade C proteins
      administered with an adjuvant. In order to inform the selection of the adjuvant in future
      studies, data on long-term persistence of immunity after vaccination with gp120/AS01 would
      prove useful. The present study was designed to address this question using a cohort of
      volunteers vaccinated several years ago with a candidate vaccine containing gp120 and AS01.
