  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is the major cause of hospital admission in infants under 6 months of age and
      usually viruses like Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumo virus, Adeno virus,
      para-influenza virus, Rhino virus and influenza virus are the main culprit. In the United
      States, acute bronchiolitis in infancy is responsible for approximately 150000
      hospitalizations each year at an estimated cost of $500 million. Globally in 2005 year it is
      estimated that atleast 33.8 million were affected with RSV alone and in the same year, RSV
      associated severe acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) were responsible for ~3.4 million
      hospitalizations and 66000 to 199000 deaths worldwide, with 99% of these deaths occurring in
      developing countries.

      In acute bronchiolitis there is cellular swelling and excessive mucus production. There is
      also proliferation of goblet cells, which also leads to increased mucus production. The
      excessive mucus produced is poorly cleared by non-ciliated (regenerating) epithelial cells
      leading to areas of narrowing and blocking of the bronchioles, causing the airway
      obstruction, hyperinflation, increased airway resistance, atelectasis and increased
      ventilation-perfusion mismatch that characterize acute bronchiolitis.

      Currently there is no medicine that has shown to be effective in treating acute bronchiolitis
      and as per the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines the management of acute
      bronchiolitis remains supportive care for the acute respiratory failure associated with acute
      bronchiolitis.

      N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant, anti-mucus compound that increases intracellular
      glutathione at the cellular level. It cleaves disulfide bonds by converting them to two
      sulfhydryl groups. This action results in the breakup of mucoproteins in lung mucus, reducing
      their chain lengths and thinning the mucus. Nebulized NAC is not studied well in acute
      bronchiolitis and is uncommonly used for the same. NAC has been studied in the treatment of
      various disease states, including those pulmonary in nature such as cystic fibrosis, chronic
      bronchitis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and found to be beneficial.

      With this background knowledge, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      nebulized mucolytic therapy in treatment of children with viral bronchiolitis. Currently
      there is only one study in literature by Naz F et el published in 2014 where nebulized NAC
      with nebulized Albuterol in acute bronchiolitis and it showed significant improvement in
      clinical severity scores as documented in that study

      A randomized clinical trial with blinding of person assigned for assessing and scoring the
      patients. The participants will include children less than 2 yrs. age admitted in PICU with
      diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis who will be randomized into either the NAC group or the
      non-NAC (Control) group.

      The participants will include children less than 2 yrs. age admitted in PICU with diagnosis
      of acute bronchiolitis who will be randomized into either the NAC group or the non-NAC
      (Control) group.

      Patients with acute bronchiolitis who require to be started on high flow nasal cannula
      support or any other noninvasive ventilator/BIPAP support are transferred/directly admitted
      to PICU. There is no time limit between when they are admitted and when they must sign
      consent or be randomized.

      After we identify a patient with acute bronchiolitis, a member of the study team will perform
      a chart review to assess eligibility as described by the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If
      eligible, parent(s)/guardian(s) will be approached and Informed Consent will be obtained.
      Using randomization software(www.randomizer.org) the enrolled patients will be randomly
      assigned to either the NAC group or the non-NAC (Control) group. The NAC will be ordered by
      the on call pharmacist and it will be administered by the on call Respiratory therapists.
      Between the two groups only the NAC group will get nebulized 2 ml of 10% NAC solution every
      12 hours during their stay in PICU.

      Our PICU uses HHFNC (humidified high flow nasal canula), Heliox and non-invasive ventilation
      such as RAM canula, Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and BIPAP. We also typically
      use Dexmetomidine infusion once the patient is on non invasive ventilation as a light
      sedation medication to avoid agitation and better ventilation patient synchrony. We will
      follow the scoring tool used by Seattle children's Bronchiolitis pathway. We will start HHFNC
      (humidified high flow nasal canula) for patients when their scores are ≥2. Depending on the
      clinical worsening the patient may require help with Heliox and escalation to non-invasive
      ventilation.

      There will be twice a day blind assessments done by experienced PICU/Transport nurses who
      were non-involved in patient care in PICU at that time. The pharmacist is going to use
      randomization software to randomly assign patients in their respective group (i.e control vs
      treatment). Also, she (the pharmacist) will order code called as &quot;Trial***&quot; in the EPIC (***
      denotes a number assigned) and depending on the randomization the patient may or may not get
      the trial medication (Nebulized NAC). This way all patients in the study will have an EPIC
      order which will be similar looking and help achieve blinding at this stage for the treating
      physicians and independent evaluators.

      All patients in the study will be receiving some kind of respiratory support like High flow
      nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilator/ BIPAP etc. and since the NAC neb can easily be given
      it through those circuits, no extra equipment will be required for patients who are in
      treatment (NAC) group. Since there is practically no difference in equipment in both
      treatment and control groups and the only way the double-blinded is broken in this scenario
      is NAC's smell.

      The smell of Neb NAC typically only stays in the room during the treatment (2-3 minutes) and
      should not last &gt;30 minutes after every administration. NAC is a sulfur compound and hence
      smells like &quot;rotten&quot; eggs&quot; so for precaution to maintain blindness, we will have the
      respiratory therapist spray a commercial rotten egg smelling solution approximately at the
      same time while they get the NAC treatments in the rooms of all patients involved in the
      study. Since the NAC neb will be delivered through a closed respiratory circuit and also
      since the respiratory therapist use filters for all their nebulization treatments, the
      chances of sticky residues will be overall less and hence very difficult to figure out by
      examination.

      We will time the 12 hourly neb treatments at 6:30-7:30 AM and PM respectively. This timing
      works in favor for blinding since both attending physicians and the independent evaluators
      have the least chances of being present during this time. The assessment will involve scoring
      the patients according to the bronchiolitis scoring data tool mentioned in next section.
      These assessments will be done for the duration of the PICU stay. The on service PICU
      attendings will only be involved in clinical management of patients and will be blinded from
      randomization. The blinding will be broken if one of the on service physician or
      PICU/Transport nurse doing assessments are aware of the currently admitted patient
      randomization details.

      Reasons subjects may be withdrawn from the study: patient gets transferred to another
      facility due to family's requests, family wishes to withdraw in the middle of the study.
