  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: In Brazil, a person who is sixty years old or more is considered elderly. The
      incidence of osteoporosis and osteopenia has been increasing, as have fractures resulting
      from falls. Vitamin D deficiency can cause muscular atrophy in type II fibers (fast
      contraction and strength), which can increase the risk of falls. The aging process produces
      reduction in the ability of postural control system to maintain postural balance, which may
      increase postural instability and consequently increase the elderly risk to falls. Objective:
      To evaluate if vitamin D supplementation associated with regular exercise in vulnerable older
      women improves muscle strength and postural balance in 12 weeks. Methods: This will be a
      randomized prospective clinical trial, double blind, placebo-controlled intervention. Will be
      part of the study 40 elderly women vulnerable, who meet the inclusion criteria and that will
      be coming from the community through calls made by radio and social network. The volunteer
      will undergoing to blood test, body composition and bone mineral density, Mini Mental State
      Examination, Geriatric Depressive Scale, Falls Efficacy Scale, WHOQOL-OLD and WHOQOL-BREF
      instruments, functional capacity tests (MiniBEST, Time up and Go, Chair Rising Test,
      Six-minute walk test), muscular strength assessment (isokinetic dynamometry, handgrip and 1RM
      test) and postural balance (AccSway force platform for static postural balance and NeuroCom's
      Balance Master for dynamic postural balance) before and after 12 weeks of intervention with
      vitamin D supplementation and resistance and postural balance exercise. The intervention that
      will be perform during the 12 weeks with a progressive resistance training program.

    <description>Evaluation of postural balance - AccSway force platform for semi static postural. The arithmetic mean of the results was calculated from the three tests conducted under each condition, and was processed using the Balance Clinic software. The following parameters were used to measure the stability of the participants: medial-lateral and anteroposterior amplitude (cm), the mean velocity calculated from the total displacement of the center of pressure (COP) in all directions (cm/s), and the elliptical area encompassing 95% of the displacement from the COP (cm2). The following parameters were used to measure the stability of the participants: medial-lateral and anteroposterior amplitude (cm), the mean velocity calculated from the total displacement of the center of pressure (COP) in all directions (cm/s).</description>

    <description>Evaluation of dynamic postural balance - The postural balance assessment (posturography) will be perform on the NeuroCom Balance MasterÂ® force platform system (NeuroCom International, Inc., Clackamas, OR, USA). The variables will be the mean sway speed (cm/s) on a stable surface and an unstable surface; and the mean sway in the anteropoterior direction and mediolateral (cm) direction at the same conditions. The variables will be the mean weight transfer index (%), mean movement time (s) and mean impact index.</description>
