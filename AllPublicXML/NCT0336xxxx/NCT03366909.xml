  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis use can lead to addiction in about 5 to 10 % of users in France. Currently,
      behavioral interventions are the most dependable but effectiveness is still reduced.
      Mindfulness meditation has demonstrated an effectiveness in several meta analysis (anxiety
      and depressive disorder) and seems to be relevant to reduce anxious and impulsive symptoms
      found in cannabis use disorders.

      This study proposes to determinate the mindfulness effectiveness in reduction of cannabis use
      in regular consumer. The consumption decrease is estimated with a retrospective diary, TLFB
      (Timeline Follow Back) which collect cannabis use every week until the 12th. Urine (week
      0/baseline, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) and hair (week 0/baseline, 10) analyses are regularly
      effected.

      Patients included in control group get classic cares in an addictology center in CHRU of
      Nancy. Patients included in mindfulness group receive one session a week during eight weeks
      (MBRP protocol : Mindfulness -Based Relapse Prevention). The study process goes on for 12
      weeks.

      An ancillary study measures the impact of cannabis decreases on retinal electrophysiological
      and architectural markers, usually disturbed by cannabis uses.
