  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and increases the risk of
      ischemic stroke 4-5-fold. The prevention of complications is based on oral or antiplatelet
      anticoagulant treatment. The first choice of anticoagulant therapy (AT) is the vitamin K
      antagonist (VKA). Contraindication to VKA or poor control of the International Normalized
      Ratio leads to the administration of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). There is a
      trend towards inadequate AT in non-valvular AF (NVAF) patients.

      The Objective of the study is evaluate the impact of the implementation of a decision support
      tool linked to digital clinical history on the adequacy of AT, the incidence of complications
      and the mortality in patients with NVAF in primary health care of the Catalan Institute of
      Health (ICS).

    <description>The CDS-NVAF is intended for patients diagnosed with NVAF and treated with VKA. This tool calculates the time in the therapeutic range (TTR) using the Rosendaal method considering the last International Normalized Ratio (INR) data. The INR data are found in the clinical history of NVAF patients. The CDS-NVAF will be activated when the physician introduces the last INR value. At this time the TTR will be calculated automatically. If the TTR value is &lt; 65%, a pop up screen with a warning text will open suggesting a change to DOAC therapy. The physician can decide whether to change or not the previous prescription. If the TTR value in &gt; 65% the pop up screen will not appear. The TTR value will remain registered on the screen of the follow up of oral anticoagulant use and can be consulted in future queries. The diffusion of the CDS-NVAF will be made by an announcement on the first day of the intervention when the health care professional opens the electronic clinical history.</description>
