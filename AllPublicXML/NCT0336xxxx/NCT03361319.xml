      A PHASE I/II TRIAL OF COMBINATION NAB-PACLITAXEL AND NINTEDANIB OR NAB-PACLITAXEL AND PLACEBO
      IN RELAPSED NSCLC ADENOCARCINOMA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 is the Phase Ib portion of the trial and Part 2 is
      the Phase II portion of the trial. Once the Trial Steering Committee has completed the dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment for Part 1 and confirmed RP2D for Part 2, Part 2 enrolment
      will proceed. The objective(s) for each part are as follows:

      Part 1: The objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination
      nab-paclitaxel and nintedanib in patients with stage IIIb and IV adenocarcinoma of the lung
      in second and third treatment line setting and to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of nintedanib when given with nab-paclitaxel at
      100mg/m2 d1, d8 q21.

      Part 2: The primary objective of Part 2 is to explore the efficacy of combination
      nab-paclitaxel and nintedanib versus nab-paclitaxel and placebo in the same patient
      population, with nintedanib/placebo given at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) as defined
      during part 1 of the study.
