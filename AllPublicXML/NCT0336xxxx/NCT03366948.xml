  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
      recently identified Internet gaming disorder as a new potential psychiatric disorder which
      need further research. Several studies showed the important prevalence of psychiatric
      disorders among patients suffering from internet gaming disorder. Investigators hypothesize
      that on an other side the prevalence of internet gaming disorder among patients suffering
      from psychiatric disorders shall be high but it has never been studied yet.

      The main goal of this trial is to examine the prevalence of internet gaming disorder using
      the Internet Gaming Disorder Test-10 (IGDT-10) among inpatient aged from 12 to 17 of 4
      psychiatric units of French region Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes.

      Secondary goals will be to assess a parental version of the IGDT-10 (IGDT-10-P) and to
      compare the two versions.

      IGDT-10 will be passed during 6 months to every inpatient and IGDT-10-P to their parents
      within the 21 first days of the hospitalisation.

    <description>The 10-item Internet Gaming Disorder is a 10 dichotomous items self-assessment scale corresponding to the 9 diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 IGD (the last item is split in two but should only be counted once). In agreement with DSM-5, a diagnosis of IGD is considered positive if 5 criteria are validated. Each criterion is filled by the patient as &quot;never&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; or &quot;often&quot;, a criterion is validated if it is reported to be present &quot;often&quot; in the last 12 months according to DSM-5 guidelines. The Ten-Item Internet Gaming Disorder Test (IGDT-10) by Király et al. was validated in English for a population of 14 to 64 years10 then in French in adults by Laconi et al.29. This is a valid and reliable scale.</description>
