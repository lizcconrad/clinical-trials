  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of these researches is to explored the role of motivational parameters,
      including: automatic and controlled psychological processes and self-regulatory capacities,
      in physical activity and sedentary behaviors adoption and maintenance. Precisely
      investigators are interested in change in motivational and self-regulatory processes during
      rehabilitation programs and their prospective influences on self-reported and objective
      behaviors among persons with chronic diseases.

      Automatic processes refered to implicit attitudes measured through the implicit association
      test (IAT) and single category (SC-IAT). Controlled processes refered to the variables of the
      Theory of Planned Behavior measured by questionnaire. Self regulatory capacities refered to
      the concept of impulsivity measured by questionnaire and executive functions measured through
      the STROOP task and Wisconsin Card Sorting Task.

      Physical activity and sedentary behaviors are measured by questionnaire and accelerometry.

    <time_frame>This measure will be performed 6 months after the program during one week.</time_frame>
    <description>Objective physical activity and sedentary behaviors are measured with accelerometers. Time spent in sedentary behaviors (less than 1,5 Metabolic equivalents) ; light physical activity (1,5 to 3 Mets), moderate physical activities (3 to 6 Mets) and high intensities (up to 6 Mets) are recorded by the monitors.</description>

    <description>Executive functions: the STROOP task and Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) design on computer. For the STROOP task a subtraction of the mean reaction time of two specifics blocks is computed (unity: millisecond). The WCST provide a score in percentage of errors.</description>

    <measure>Self-report physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>this measure will be performed 6 months after the program</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report physical activity is measured by questionnaire. The scoring procedure requires to make the sum of the frequency by week (0 to 7days/weeks) with a score in minutes for those activities (1 point : less to 15 min ; 2 point : 16 to 30 ; 3 point : 31 to 60 ; 4 point : more than 60).</description>
