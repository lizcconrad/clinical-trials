  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular septal defects (VSD) are the most common cardiac congenital heart defect (about
      1/3 of patients with congenital heart disease). VSD management is related to hemodynamics and
      anatomical localization and the occurrence of complications. Small perimembranous VSD without
      pulmonary hypertension and without significant left to right shunting are tolerated, whereas
      large VSD with pulmonary hypertension require early surgical management in the first months
      of life. The management uncertainties concern the medium-sized perimembranous VSD causing a
      significant left-right shunt but without pulmonary hypertension, which are of variable
      treatment (surgical correction, percutaneous treatment, medical or abstention). There are no
      recommendations or consensus on the preferred indication of a therapeutic attitude.

      The Pediatric and Congenital Cardiology Subsidiary, within the French Society of Cardiology,
      set up an observatory of perimembranous VSD with significant shunting, without pulmonary
      hypertension the objectives of this study are:

        -  To study the incidence of cardiovascular events in perimembranous VSD and search for
           predictive anatomical markers of events.

        -  To study the evolution of echocardiographic and functional data of patients having
           percutaneous or surgical closure compared to patient managed medically.

      This observatory will provide a better understanding of the therapeutic algorithm in the
      management of VSD with pulmonary overload without pulmonary hypertension.

endocarditis,
aortic stenosis (mean gradient&gt; 20 mmHg)
aortic insufficiency
left ventricular outflow tract stenosis (mean gradient&gt; 20 mmHg)
tricuspid insufficiency ≥2
surgery or cardiac interventional catheterization for an abnormality in relation to the VSD (other than simple closing)
persistent supraventricular arrhythmias, sustained ventricular arrhythmia,
stroke
Complete atrioventricular block (AVB)
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)
heart failure
cardiovascular deaths,
severe haemolysis (= requiring transfusion or interventional catheterization or surgical).</description>

    <description>It is an observational study, no intervention or examination will be realized for the sole purpose of the study. Patient management will be at the discretion of referral cardiologists according to the practices of the centers.
As part of the usual follow-up of these patients, the participating centers collect the clinical and echocardiography data from inclusion and the following year, as well as data from a functional assessment at baseline and at one year. and the collection of cardiovascular events at 5 years and 10 years of follow-up.
Data from a possible percutaneous or surgical closure procedure will be collected. The indication of VSD closure will be left to the discretion of participating centers. There will be no recommendation for percutaneous or surgical closure of VSD for the sole purpose of this observatory.</description>
