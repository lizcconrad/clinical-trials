    <textblock>
      Adult patients undergoing elective outpatient, upper extremity, orthopedic surgeries will be
      randomized to view one of two educational programs: 1) a 2-video series regarding
      post-operative pain management or 2) a video regarding wound care and activity. The effect of
      this educational program on pain medications used, pain control efficacy, and other measures
      of satisfaction and recovery will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Four hundred (400) adult patients undergoing elective outpatient, upper extremity, orthopedic
      surgeries will be recruited by the surgeon-investigators. Patients will be randomized to view
      one of two educational programs: 1) a 2-video series regarding post-operative pain management
      or 2) a video regarding wound care and activity.

      These patients will be encouraged to review the video online in the week before surgery. An
      intake enrollment form will be completed by an investigator using demographic information
      available in the chart.

      Participants in both arms will complete their Patient Education Study Diary daily, for 7 days
      following their surgery. There are two versions of this diary: the Wound Education Version
      asks patients to report daily pain mediation use. The Pain Education Version does not include
      this section as patients in the pain management arm of the study record this information in
      their Recovery Diary.

      The patient will be contacted again by phone and/or mail 1 year after surgery (12-14 months)
      using the contact information available in EPIC to determine the self-reported prevalence of
      chronic pain and pain medication use.
