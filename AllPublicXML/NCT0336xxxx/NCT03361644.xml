    <textblock>
      The study will compare the effects of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) with Moderate
      Intensity Continuous Training (CMIT) as part of a lifestyle intervention program on BMI
      change in adolescents age 12-16 with obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents will be randomized to a 12-week lifestyle intervention including behavioral and
      dietary interventions, and one of two exercise training conditions, HIIT or CMIT).
      Adolescents in the HIIT treatment will participate in treadmill exercise in 1-minute
      intervals of challenging intensities with recovery periods in between, gradually increasing
      the number of intervals over the course of the study. Adolescents in the CMIT treatment will
      participate in a constant moderate intensity treadmill exercise, gradually increasing the
      duration of the exercise over the course of the study.

      Both parents and teens will have height and weight measurements taken, complete behavior
      questionnaires and wear an activity monitor for one week at baseline, 12 weeks and 16 weeks.

      Adolescents will have a physical exam by a study medical provider before starting the
      intervention. Adolescents will also have blood work, an oral glucose tolerance test, an
      electrocardiogram, body composition measurements and a maximal graded exercise test done at
      baseline, and again at one or more time points. Adolescents will also complete a detailed
      food log at those time points.

      Adolescents will exercise at the study gym 3 evenings a week for 12 weeks. On one of those
      evenings teens will also attend a 60-minute individual behavioral weight management session.
      Nine of these are with a behavior coach, and 3 with a dietitian. Parents will also attend one
      introductory session with the behavior coach, join the teen for the 3 sessions with the
      dietitian, and review adolescent individual goals and identify parent support goals at the
      end of each behavior session.
