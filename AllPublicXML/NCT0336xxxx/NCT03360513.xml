  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the shape and dimension of dental arches from a lingual
      perspective, and determine shape and size used for lingual Orthodontics.

      The study sample comprised 70 Caucasian Brazilian individuals with normal occlusion and at
      least four of Andrew's six keys. Maxillary and mandibular dental casts were digitized (3D)
      and the images were analyzed by Delcam Power SHAPET 2010 software. Landmarks on the lingual
      surface of teeth were selected to determine the shape and size of dental arches.

    <description>The sample comprised maxillary and mandibular dental casts of 70 Caucasian Brazilian individuals (28 men and 42 women) with an average age of 16.4 years, all of which had natural normal occlusion with at least four of the six keys to normal occlusion. 14 The first item of the first key was considered essential for sample selection(Angle Class I molar relationship). Another inclusion criterion was that individuals should be at least 15 years of age with no odontogenic abnormalities and all permanent teeth in occlusion.</description>
