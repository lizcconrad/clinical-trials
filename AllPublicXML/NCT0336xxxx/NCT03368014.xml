  <detailed_description>

      A cluster randomized controlled trial design will be adopted. The major subjects are 720-900
      students. Four secondary schools in Hong Kong will be included in the evaluation. Schools
      will either be assigned into lyrics-writing and singing show intervention group or wait-list
      control group (the intervention won't be provided during the evaluation period and will be
      provided after the evaluation period).

      The intervention mainly included 1) Lyrics-writing and Singing Competition with student and
      family entries: [a] lyrics-writing workshop and a short talk on SME focusing on praising
      family members and knowledge of adolescent mental health problem (in particular the anxiety
      disorders) and mental well-being; [b] use SME as theme for lyrics-writing and submit records
      of SME during lyrics-writing and singing; and [d] all entries are submitted in the form of
      audios. 2) SME Lyrics-writing and Singing Show and Award Ceremony (sharing): live performance
      by awarded entries and prize presentation ceremony.

      There will then be 4 assessments (pre-intervention, immediate post intervention, one month
      and three months after baseline) to evaluate the effects of the intervention programme. In
      the assessments, students will be asked to complete questionnaires to measure the changes in
      SME related behaviors, happiness, well-being and knowledge and attitude towards mental
      health. The satisfaction towards the intervention, as well as the level of participation and
      ratings for the intervention will be evaluated.
