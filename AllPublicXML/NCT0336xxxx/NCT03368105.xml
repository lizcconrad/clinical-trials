  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to analyze whether the use of the LP299v strain reduces the risk of
      Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) among patients receiving antibiotics and hospitalized
      in the nephrology and transplantation ward.

      Patients from risk group (receiving immunosuppressive drugs and treated with antibiotics)
      were enrolled into study.

      Participants will be divided into two groups. First group will receive one capsule of
      Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v) orally per a day. Second group will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile is currently the most frequently identified pathogen causing
      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and the main cause of nosocomial diarrhoea. In regard to
      observed worldwide increase rate of infection and mortality from CDI the prevention of
      Clostridium difficile infections seems to be crucial, especially in patients at CDI high
      risk. So far, it has not been unambiguously proven that probiotics are effective in the
      prevention of Clostridium difficile infection among patients undergoing antibiotic therapy.

      The Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v) is a Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria that
      naturally occurs on the surface of human intestinal mucosa. Specific properties to the gut
      mucosa colonization are due to mannose-dependent adhesion of LP299v to the epithelium of
      human intestines.This ability of LP299v leads to reduction of bacterial translocation from
      the intestinal lumen into the blood vessels, can prevent adhesion of many pathogens to
      intestinal epithelium and modulate the inflammatory response of the epithelium. The strain
      299v of Lactobacillus plantarum has been found to decrease the severity of gastrointestinal
      adverse effects during antibiotic therapy. Limited data are available regarding the efficacy
      of LP299v for preventing Clostridium difficile infections.

    <description>Patients treated with antibiotics and at high CDI risk (patients after organ transplantation or receiving immunosuppressive therapy for any other reason) will be enroll to study.
We will divide participants into two group. Group 1 will receive one capsule of LP299v orally per a day during the entire period of antibiotic therapy. Group 2 will receive one capsule of placebo during the entire period of antibiotic therapy.</description>
