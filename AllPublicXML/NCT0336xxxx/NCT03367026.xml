    <textblock>
      REHSI is a prospective, multi-center, open label, randomized, controlled two arms, to
      evaluate the ability of ivabradine to reduce an elevated heart rate in septic shock patients.
      The primary end point is the reduction of heart rate within 24 hours. This trial will
      randomize 70 patients (men and women, aged ≥ 18 years) with newly diagnosed Septic Shock
      (despite adequate fluid resuscitation, were still requiring high-dose norepinephrine (NE) to
      maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mmHg , and had a tachycardia &gt;100 beats per
      minute (bpm). Treatment period will last 4 days. All patients will be followed for up to six
      months.
