  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is of a modular study design allowing an investigation of the optimal monotherapy
      dose and combination doses of CT7001 with other anticancer treatments with intensive safety
      monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. Module 1 (monotherapy) will be performed
      initially, with further modules added at a later date as protocol amendments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Module 1 is comprised of 2 sequential parts:

        -  Part A: Dose Escalation, investigating the safety and tolerability of CT7001 to identify
           the minimum biologically active dose (MBAD) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Part A
           will also have cohort expansion/s for breast cancer patients only, once MBAD is defined
           and will include sequential tumour biopsies for evaluation of
           pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) and tumour responses.

        -  Part B: To refine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic
           (PD) profiles of CT7001 in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

      Module 1 Part A: CT7001 will be administered to subjects with advanced solid malignancies at
      a starting dose of 120 mg and will be escalated to reach the MTD as defined by dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs).

      Module 1 Part B: Up to an additional 25 evaluable subjects in a maximum of 4 tumour specific
      cohorts may be treated with CT7001 at a dose(s) defined in Part A.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 with no
             deterioration over the previous 2 weeks.

          3. Estimated life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          4. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to practice effective contraception
             (defined as: abstinence if consistently employed as the patient's preferred and usual
             lifestyle , sex only with person of the same sex, sex only with vasectomised partner,
             medroxyprogesterone injections [e.g., Depo-Provera], levonorgestrel intrauterine
             system [e.g., Mirena], intrauterine device (IUD), or barrier method [e.g., condom,
             diaphragm] for the duration of the study and for 6 months after the last dose of
             CT7001.

             The drug-drug interactions of CT7001 are not fully characterised so contraceptives
             that are prone to drug-drug interactions may not be effective because of a potential
             CYP3A4 interaction with CT7001.

          6. Women not of childbearing potential is defined as women who are postmenopausal
             (defined as ≥50 years of age, amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months after cessation of
             all exogenous hormonal treatments, and have serum follicle-stimulating hormone,
             luteinizing hormone and plasma oestradiol levels in the testing laboratory's
             postmenopausal range). Women under 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if
             they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous
             hormonal treatments and with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone
             (FSH) levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or women who have been
             amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months and are less than 50 years of age. Women who are
             surgically sterilised (defined as documented irreversible surgical sterilisation by
             hysterectomy or by bilateral tubal ligation, oophorectomy, or salpingectomy).

          7. Sexually active male subjects must be willing to use condoms with all sexual partners
             for the duration of the study and for 3 months after the last dose of CT7001. If a
             female partner is a woman of childbearing potential who is not using effective
             contraception (as defined in Inclusion Criterion Section 4.2.1), the subject must use
             a condom with spermicide during the study and for 6 months after the last dose of
             CT7001.

          8. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent before any study-specific
             procedures, sampling, or analyses, including access to archival tumour tissue.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any other malignancy which has been active or treated within the past 3 years, with
             the exception of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and nonmelanoma skin cancer.

          2. Any unresolved toxicity (except alopecia) from prior therapy of ≥ Grade 2 according to

          3. Spinal cord compression or brain metastases, unless asymptomatic, stable, and not
             requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks before the first dose of IP (if stable and
             requiring no intervention, the subject can be enrolled in the study).

          4. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic GI diseases or previous significant bowel
             resection, with clinically significant sequelae that would preclude adequate
             absorption of CT7001.

          5. Uncontrolled seizures.

          6. Active infection requiring systemic antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral medication.

          7. Severe or uncontrolled medical condition (e.g., severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease, severe Parkinson's disease, active inflammatory bowel disease) or psychiatric
             condition.

          8. Active bleeding diatheses.

         15. Receipt of any small-molecule investigational medicinal product (IMP) within 28 days
             before the first dose of IP.

         16. Receipt of any biological IMP (e.g., immune checkpoint blockers, antibodies,
             nanoparticles) within 42 days before the first dose of IP.

         17. Receipt of St John's Wort within 21 days before the first dose of IP or of another
             concomitant medication, herbal supplement, or food that is a strong inhibitor or
             inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or P-glycoprotein (PGP) activity within 14 days

         21. Liver function deteriorating in a manner that would likely make the subject meet the
             AST, ALT, or bilirubin levels specified above in at the time of the first dose of IP.

         22. Other evidence of impaired hepatic synthesis function.

         23. Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function as demonstrated by any of the
             following laboratory values:
