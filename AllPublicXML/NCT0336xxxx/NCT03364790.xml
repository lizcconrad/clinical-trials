    <textblock>
      The study has before mentioned the concept of &quot;knee - spine syndrome&quot; domestically, on the
      basement of which, the new study intends to perform another further study on the relationship
      between lumbar and lower extremity degenerative diseases.

      A prosepective, single-center, factorial design, randomized study will be performed. In this
      study, the 120 participants with degenerative lumbar and knees disease coped with the
      standard were included, then were assigned into 4 groups randomly. The patients in 3
      operation groups were treated with posterior lumbar interbody fusion(PLIF or PLF) or total
      knee arthroplasty (TKA) or both of them in one stage respectively and the forth group with no
      surgery. The comparison between observation and operation group and the difference on
      self-control pre-and post-operatively in operation group within 6 months were measured and
      valuated. The result will be formed by the correlation and causal relationship on sagittal
      parameters on photograph, biomechanics, neuroelectrophysiology and molecular biology and the
      conclusions drawn by the use of modern medical basic research methods will formulate the
      treatment principles on it.
