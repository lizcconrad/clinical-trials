  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival fissures (GF) have been suggested as risk indicators for clinical attachment loss
      (CAL) and gingival recession, especially in free surfaces and in patients with low plaque
      scores. The major factors related to the GF occurrence are high daily brushing frequencies,
      excessive force to brush, malpositioned teeth, use of abrasive dentifrices, and stiffness of
      the toothbrushes bristles. In this scenario, in order to better understand the pathogenesis
      and progression of GF, this study aim to evaluate the incidence and behavior of GF in young
      adults using soft and medium brushes, in a cross-over randomized clinical trial along 6
      months.

      Material and Methods: A two-blinded cross-over randomized clinical trial will be conducted
      with 48 patients from a Military Organization at Bento Gonçalves city, southern of Brazil.
      Male patients, aged between 18 to 25 years old, having at least 20 teeth, without previous
      history of periodontitis (CAL ≥ 3mm), and good systemic health will be included if they do
      not have orthodontic appliances or dental implants, or dental caries or restorations at
      cervical surface. Data collection will performed by two trained, calibrated and blinded
      examiners, and will comprehend a brief interview regarding oral hygiene and deleterious
      habits, full-mouth exams (6 sites/tooth) of Plaque Index (PI), Pocket Probing Depth (PPD),
      and CAL, and clinical pictures (from 1st and 2nd premolars and 1st molar area in all
      quadrants) under disclosing solution (2Tone®) to evaluate GF. After baseline data collection
      the participants will be randomized in one of the experimental groups according the
      toothbrush bristles stiffness: G1) soft; or G2) medium. No oral hygiene instruction will be
      provided to groups, and the patients will not be informed about the type of brush that will
      be provided. Re-exams will be conducted at 30, 60, 90, 100, 130, 160 and 190 days. At day 90
      the 1st phase will be finished, and the participants will have a 30-days period of wash-out.
      At day 100, the 2nd phase will start, and the participants will change the groups. At day
      190, the study will be finished. The participants will be oriented to return the toothbrushes
      used at the end of each experimental phase.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the number of GF observed over the study period. Also,
      the incidence, size and duration of the GF will be compared regarding the variables: type of
      bristle, self-reported toothbrushing frequency, toothbrush deformation, and deleterious
      habits. Chi-square test and ANOVA for repeated measures, with post hoc tests, will be used to
      compare the frequencies and mean numbers of GF observed between and intra-groups. Uni- and
      multivariate regression models will be conducted to determine associations between the
      outcome and independent variables. The mean number of new fissures, GF that decreased, and GF
      that stabilized over time will be compared inter-groups as secondary analysis.
      Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted, considering the individual the unit of
      analysis and a α-error of 0.05.

    <description>Standardized photographs, under disclosing solution (2Tone®) from 1st and 2nd premolars and 1st molar area in all quadrants, will be taken at baseline and at days 30, 60, 90, 100, 130, 160 and 190 for evaluation of gingival fissures. The disclosing solution is safe, without contra-indications in the literature and facilitates visualization of gingival lesions and plaque. After, the photographies will be analyzed in an image software in order to determine the mean number of new fissures, fissures that decreased, and those that stabilized over time. If, at any time during the study a gingival fissure become greater than 3mm, the patients will stop the use of the specific toothbrush and will be follow until the regression of the lesion.</description>

    <description>The participants will be oriented to return the toothbrushes used at the end of each experimental phase. The toothbrush deformation/wear will be investigated by comparing the dimensions of height, width and length, in anterior, middle and posterior parts of the toothbrush (measured with a digital caliper), before and after its use by the participants, in each phase of the study.</description>
