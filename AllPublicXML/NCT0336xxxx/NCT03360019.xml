  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase II SBIR project we will enhance a wireless WiFi-based insole that was designed
      and successfully tested during a Phase I trial with elderly persons with dementia and their
      caregivers, and then investigate its efficacy in terms of caregiver activity, burden, and
      quality of life in Phase II. Evaluation will use semi-structured interviews and participant
      observation data collected from professional and family caregivers of patients with moderate
      or mild dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of the Activlink system offering localization information to improve caregiver
      will be evaluated in two studies. Study 2a will use the insole system with dementia patients
      residing in skilled or memory care. Data regarding caregiving activity will be collected from
      their paid professional care providers. Study 2b will use participant localization data
      collected on 80 independently dwelling mild dementia patients. In this case data will be
      collected from their unpaid family caregivers. Both studies will result in evaluating the
      efficacy of the WiFi-based insole to provide caregivers with augmented patient awareness,
      helping to improve their immediate quality of life by reducing their direct burden of
      continuous oversight of their person in care.
