  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is associated with substantial burden in terms of both mortality and morbidity
      for survivors of this illness. Pre-clinical sepsis studies suggest that mesenchymal stem
      (stromal) cells may modulate inflammation, enhance pathogen clearance and tissue repair and
      reduce death. Our team has completed a Phase I dose escalation and safety clinical trial that
      evaluated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patients with septic shock. The Cellular
      Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial established that MSCs appear safe and that a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) is feasible. Based on these data, the investigators have
      planned a phase II RCT (CISS2) at several Canadian academic centres which will evaluate
      safety, signals for clinical efficacy, and continue to examine potential mechanisms of action
      and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a devastating illness and the most severe form of infection seen in the
      intensive care unit (ICU). It is characterized by cardiovascular collapse, failure of organs
      and is common with severe repercussions including a mortality of 20-40%. Survivors suffer
      long-term impairment in function and reduced quality of life (QOL). Despite decades of
      research examining different immune therapies, none has proven successful and supportive care
      remains the mainstay of therapy, at a cost of approximately 4-billion dollars in Canada
      annually. MSCs represent a potentially novel treatment for sepsis because in animal models,
      MSCs have been shown to modulate the immune system, increase pathogen clearance, restore
      organ function, and reduce death.

      The Phase II multi-centre Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock RCT (CISS2) will continue
      to evaluate safety, assess if there are signals for clinical efficacy and determine
      mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock. To answer these aims,
      CISS2 will randomize 114 patients who are admitted to the ICU with septic shock to 300
      million cryopreserved, allogeneic, bone marrow derived MSCs or placebo across 10 Canadian
      centres over approximately 2 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A participant must meet all three inclusion criteria to be eligible:

          1. Admission to an Intensive Care Unit AND

          2. Cardiovascular failure that is present within the first 24 hours of admission to the
             ICU and is defined by the requirement for at least 15 mcg/min of norepinephrine or at
             least 200 mcg/min of phenylephrine or at least 0.03 U/min of vasopressin, or a
             combination of norepinephrine and phenylephrine that is equivalent to the total
             required doses (e.g. norepinephrine 8 meq/min and phenylephrine 100 mcg/min) for at
             least 4 consecutive hours. Participants must still require vasopressor(s) at the time
             of MSC infusion to be eligible. AND

          3. At least 1 additional organ failure, or organ hypoperfusion, as defined by the
             modified Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS). Criteria for organ dysfunction or
             organ hypoperfusion must be met within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. These
             include:

               1. Respiratory failure: mechanically ventilated with a positive end expiratory
                  pressure (PEEP) of at least 5 cm H20, and a partial pressure of oxygen/fractional
                  inspired oxygen concentration (P/F ratio) less than or equal to 200 on 2 separate
                  occasions.

               2. Hematological failure: platelet count of less than or equal to 100 X 109 /L that
                  has decreased by at least 50 x 109/L.

               3. Acute renal failure: acute renal insufficiency with a creatinine of greater than
                  200 umol/L that has increased by at least 50 umol/L, or the requirement for
                  continuous renal replacement therapy, or for participants with known chronic
                  renal failure but not on dialysis, a 50% increase in their baseline creatinine
                  concentration.

               4. Organ hypoperfusion: a lactate of at least 4 mmol/L

        Acute organ failures that meet eligibility criteria cannot have been present for more than
        48 hours prior to admission to the ICU.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Another form of shock (cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive) that is considered by
             the treating critical care staff physician as the dominant cause of shock.

          2. History of known chronic pulmonary hypertension with a WHO functional class of III or
             IV

          3. History of severe chronic pulmonary disease requiring home oxygen

          4. History of chronic severe cardiac disease including congestive heart failure or
             valvular dysfunction with a New York Heart Association Functional Class of III or IV,
             or severe ischemic heart disease with a Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class
             score of III or IV.

          5. History of severe chronic liver disease (Child class C)

          6. Malignancy in the previous year (excluding resolved non-melanoma skin cancer).
             Participants will be excluded from the CISS2 trial if they have received any surgery,
             chemotherapy, or radiation for a malignancy in the previous 12 months.

          7. Chronic immune suppression (chronic steroid use or chemotherapy)

          8. Pregnant or lactating

          9. Enrolment in another interventional study

         10. Treating physicians' impression is that the participant is moribund and that death is
             imminent within the subsequent 12 hours of meeting eligibility criteria

         11. Family, participant, or physician not committed to aggressive care. Any limitation of
             care will exclude the patient from enrolment in the CISS2 trial (ex: no intubation, no
             use of vasopressor agent(s), no renal support therapy).

         12. Less than 18 years of age
