      This trial studies the best dose and side effects of utomilumab (4-1BB agonist monoclonal
      antibody PF-05082566) with trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab in treating patients with
      HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as utomilumab, trastuzumab emtansine, and trastuzumab may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the recommended dose (RP2D) of
      utomilumab in combination with ado-rastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) or trastuzumab in subjects
      with HER2 positive advanced breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective tumor response (ORR)

        -  Determine the time to tumor response (TTR)

        -  Determine the duration of response (DR)

        -  Determine progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of utomilumab in combination with ado-trastuzumab
           emtansine or trastuzumab

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT 1: Patients receive trastuzumab emtansine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 0
      of course 1 and day 1 of subsequent courses, and utomilumab IV over 1 hour on day 1.

      COHORT 2: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on day 0 of course 1 and day 1 of
      subsequent courses, and utomilumab IV over 1 hour on day 1.

      In both cohorts, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 60 days, then every 9 weeks
      for up to 6 months. Tumor assessments per the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) v1.1 criteria.
