  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder characterized by
      oligo-ovulatory menstrual dysfunction, androgen excess and polycystic ovaries. It affects ten
      to fifteen percent of reproductive-age women and has been associated with complications in
      reproductive, metabolic and cardiovascular health. Current Clinical Practice Guidelines
      suggest exercise and weight loss for PCOS, although their specific roles in improving
      PCOS-related symptoms are uncertain.

      Non-pharmacological treatments are appealing to many reproductive age women. There is
      preliminary evidence that exercise in PCOS may increase menstrual regularity, ovulation,
      cardiorespiratory fitness, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and self-esteem, and
      decrease body fat and insulin resistance. These studies have been limited by short durations
      and lack of randomization or appropriate control groups.

      High-intensity interval training (HIIT), which involves brief intervals of near-maximal
      exercise alternating with lower-intensity exercise, is becoming increasingly popular in the
      exercise community. In some non-PCOS trials, HIIT resulted in improved cardiovascular fitness
      and greater fat loss compared with continuous aerobic exercise. No other trials are currently
      on-going that are comparing HIIT with continuous aerobic exercise training in women with PCOS
      (as confirmed by searches of the literature and the clinical trials registry maintained by
      the US NIH).

    <description>Participants randomized to this group will complete three high intensity interval training sessions per week, two of which will be supervised.

    <description>Participants randomized to this group will complete three continuous aerobic training sessions per week, two of which will be supervised.

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>High Intensity Interval Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The exercise prescription is as follows:
Type: High-Intensity Interval Training on a treadmill, elliptical trainer or cycle ergometer.
Intensity: 30 seconds of high-intensity alternating with 90 seconds of low intensity for a total of 10 cycles
High intensity for most individuals will occur at approximately 90% of maximum heart rate. Using the rating of perceived exertion scale, participants should be exercising at a 9/10, which is very difficult to maintain the intensity and results in only being able to speak a few words at a time.
Low intensity is defined as light activity and rated as 2-3/10 on the rating of perceived exertion scale. Participants should be able to carry on a conversation and maintain the pace for hours.
Duration: 30 minutes Frequency: 3 times per week</description>

  </intervention>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Continuous Aerobic Exercise Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The exercise prescription for the continuous aerobic exercise group is as follows:
Type: Aerobic exercise including walking, running, cycling or using the elliptical trainer.
Intensity: Moderate intensity, defined as 50-60% of the participant's maximum heart rate. On the rating of perceived exertion scale, this corresponds with a 4-6/10, which allows participants to hold a conversation while breathing heavily.
Duration: 50 minutes Frequency: 3 times per week</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be eligible for inclusion if they are females between the ages of 18
             and 40 years with a diagnosis of PCOS according to the 2003 revised Rotterdam
             criteria, confirmed by a qualified member of our research team. Participants will have
             at least two of the three following criteria:

               1. Oligo-ovulation or anovulation. Oligo-ovulation is defined as menstrual cycles
                  greater than 35 days or less than 8 menstrual cycles per year. Anovulation is
                  defined as no ovulation in more than 90 days.

               2. Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism. Clinical hyperandrogenism
                  is defined as a modified Ferriman Gallwey score greater than or equal to 8.
                  Biochemical hyperandrogenism is defined as a free androgen index greater than or
                  equal to 5.1.

               3. Polycystic ovaries defined as the presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary
                  measuring 2-9 mm in diameter, and/or increased ovarian volume (&gt;10 mL).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must not have a diagnosis of or clinical evidence of Cushing's syndrome,
             androgen-secreting tumours, congenital adrenal hyperplasia including classical and
             non-classical, uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, hemoglobin A1c greater than
             or equal to 6.5%, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, premature ovarian insufficiency, or
             hyperprolactinemia.

          -  Participants must not be pregnant or breastfeeding within the three months prior to
             enrolment and must not be using or have used a hormonal contraceptive within three
             months of enrolment.

          -  Participants will be excluded if they are taking any medications to treat insulin
             resistance including metformin, medications likely to increase insulin resistance such
             as corticosteroids, or any medications that may affect ovulation including clomiphene
             citrate, letrozole, or gonadotropins. They must not be taking medications to treat
             hirsutism including spironolactone.

          -  Participants must not be habitually exercising more than two times per week for more
             than twenty minutes per session.

          -  Participants must be able to participate in the exercise intervention, therefore will
             be excluded if they have a physical injury, illness or disability that prevents them
             from doing so.
