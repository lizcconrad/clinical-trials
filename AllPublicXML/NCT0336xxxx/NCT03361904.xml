  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current recommendations for colonoscopy screening programs usually involve patients older
      than 50 years of age. However, little is known about polyp or adenoma detection rates under
      50. We compared these detection rates according to age in a large series of patients in
      common practice.

      Methods: All colonoscopies performed in 2016 in our unit were prospectively recorded. We
      determined adenoma detection rate (ADR), polyp detection rate (PDR), mean number of polyps
      (MNP), and advanced neoplasia detection rate (ANDR).

      Patients All consecutive patients who were scheduled for colonoscopy were included. Exclusion
      criteria were: patients scheduled for partial colonoscopy, interventional colonoscopy (for
      stent insertion, stenosis dilation).

      Data collection The following data have been prospectively collected: age, gender, indication
      for colonoscopy, preparation procedure and quality of the preparation (assessed by the Boston
      Bowel Preparation Scale; BBPS) [19-20], caecal intubation (yes/no), withdrawal time, number
      and size of polyps and polyp histopathology.

      All clinical data were collected during the procedure by a nurse and an endoscopist on a
      dedicated software. The database was then supplemented by the Clinical Research Associate for
      histopathological data.

      We determined adenoma detection rate (ADR; percentage of colonoscopies with at least one
      adenoma), polyp detection rate (PDR: percentage of colonoscopies with at least one polyp),
      mean number of polyps per colonoscopy (MNP), large polyp detection rate (LPDR; percentage of
      colonoscopies with at least one polyp of 1 cm or more) and advanced neoplasia detection rate
      (ANDR: percentage of colonoscopies with at least one advanced neoplastic lesion as defined
      below).

        During the study period, 6335 colorectal endoscopic procedures were realized in the
        endoscopy unit. We excluded 278 sigmoidoscopies and 30 interventional procedures for stent
        insertion or stenosis dilation. Only diagnostic colonoscopies were recorded, performed in
        3308 women (54.9%) and 2719 men (45.1%) with a median age of 57 (range, 15-96: IQR 18).
