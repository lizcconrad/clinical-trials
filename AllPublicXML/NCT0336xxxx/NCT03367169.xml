  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment consists in comparing the osteosynthesis plate with minimally invasive
      technique versus open reduction and internal fixation.

      The aim of study is to compare (period of bandage, efficacy, safety), these two types of
      surgical technique by using a prospective, randomized analysis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several surgical techniques exist and among plate osteosynthesis, there is a minimally
      invasive method and the open reduction method.

      Investigators think that the minimally invasive method with intern plate is more efficient
      than the open reduction method.

      These techniques may better preserve perifracture soft tissues, hematoma. It may lead to a
      smaller muscle detachment.

      The minimally invasive technique allows a more efficient vascularization of the fracture
      site, what would increase bone healing and the functional prognosis of tibial pilon lesions.

      It's all these issues investigators would like to assess with a randomized study.

    <description>The Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) was designed to assess functional limitations related to foot and ankle conditions. Subjective reports of function are classified as generic or specific measures, which include condition-specific, population-specific, and patient-specific instruments. The FADI have a total point value of 100 points, more the value is better brought up is the score</description>
