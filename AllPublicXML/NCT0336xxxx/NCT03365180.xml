  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept consists of an initial period (two weeks) of intensive data capture by use of
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) during basal insulin initiation, followed by a second
      period (variable duration) of basal insulin titration guided by self monitored blood glucose.
      Data captured during the first period are used as input to an algorithm that estimates the
      optimal daily dose for the individual patient. The estimated optimal daily dose is used to
      guide the titration of the basal insulin during the second period. The goal is to safely and
      successfully achieve blood glucose targets. The concept is based on the use of basal insulin
      degludec (Tresiba, Novo Nordisk A/S).
