    <textblock>
      In neonatal resuscitation, the majority of deaths currently occur after a Life Limitation or
      Discontinuance (LAT) procedure. In the 1990s, the approach was different, as Marina CUTTINI
      put it in a European study that highlighted some French peculiarities: doctors and nurses
      found it legitimate to have life stops in certain circumstances, and wanted to keep parents
      away from these decisions deemed guilt. Civil society has changed the thinking in recent
      years by the so-called Kouchner then LEONETTI laws. The palliative approach, which is defined
      as the search for a fair and reasonable balance, constantly reevaluated, between curative
      care and care of comfort and support, has become a constant concern in neonatal resuscitation
      services. However, we did not find a recent study that specifies in France the modalities of
      deaths in neonatology, especially their proportion after LAT. Also, shortly before the
      adoption of the CLAYES-LEONETTI law, the authors wished to make an inventory of the practices
      of all the neonatal intensive care units of Ile de France, one of the main centers of French
      fertility.

      The objectives of the study were to describe the organization of collegial meetings (CR), the
      decision-making process and implementation of LATs, with particular attention to stopping
      artificial nutrition and hydration, and sedation / analgesia. The place of the parents in
      these different processes (gathering their opinion, information on how to withdraw
      life-saving treatment, leading in the event of disagreement) was also studied. Finally, some
      questions about euthanasia were asked, in order to measure the evolution of ideas and
      practices more than 15 years after EURONIC and 10 years after the LEONETTI law.

      This is a survey carried out among all neonatal resuscitation services in the Ile-de-France
      region, from January 1 to 31, 2016. All professionals in contact with children were
      interviewed: doctors (senior and intern), paramedics (managers, pediatric nurses, auxiliaries
      and nurses, psychomotor therapists) and psychologists. The survey was based on a
      questionnaire, which was offered to all professionals, both medical and non-medical. All
      questions were closed, and a free comment area was proposed at the end. The questionnaire was
      preceded by a comment recalling the objectives of the study, the voluntary and individual
      nature of participation, and insisted on respect for anonymity. It consisted of 49 questions,
      allowing 197 possible answers. For most questions, several answers could be chosen. An
      additional questionnaire was sent to the heads of the services, medical and care settings.
      The questions sought to describe the 2014 activity (number of admissions and number of
      deaths, number of collegiate meetings and number of deaths resulting from an LAT), medical
      and paramedical staff to calculate the response rate, the existence of reflection and / or
      training on palliative and end-of-life care in the service, as well as the existence of a
      mobile team or palliative care unit in the facility.

    <description>To measure the implementation of the limitations and shutdowns of active therapies, with particular attention to stopping artificial nutrition and hydration, as well as stopping sedation. To measure precisely this data it will be necessary to answer the questionnaire of the study. Questions about death patterns will account for the number of deaths associated with an interruption of artificial nutrition, a cessation of hydration or cessation of sedation. This will allow the data to be encrypted for use.</description>
