      Objective:

      The small bowel volvulus is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction which may occur in utero
      and whose prenatal diagnosis is difficult.Sonographic signs are mainly indirect and non
      specific.The aim of this study is to present a retrospective analysis of prenatal
      sonographicfindings in fetal segmental midgut volvulus.Thanks to this series the
      investigators could highlight the more specifics signs of the volvulus included a new
      pattern.

      Objective:

      The small bowel volvulus is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction which may occur in utero
      and whose prenatal diagnosis is difficult. Sonographic signs are mainly indirect and
      nonspecific. The aim of this study is to present a retrospective analysis of prenatal
      sonographic findings in fetal segmental midgut volvulus. Thanks to this series the
      investigators could highlight the more specifics signs of the volvulus included a new
      pattern.

      Methods:

      Unicentric retrospective analysis of cases of prenatal midgut volvulus between 2006 and 2017.
      The primary inclusion criteria was postnatal diagnosis of prenatal volvulus based on
      post-natal findings and prenatal imaging findings. The exclusion criteria was the absence of
      prenatal imaging assessment. The investigators collected the clinical history and the
      echographic mode B and color Doppler. They have searched for some specific sign like &quot;
      whirlpool sign &quot; representing the winding of the mesenteric vein around the superior
      mesenteric arterywith color Doppler with arciform pattern of the midgut, hydro-meconium level
      in the dilated loops and position of mesenteric vessels for evaluation of the intestinal
      (mal) rotation. Gold standard was surgery or foetopathology if performed.
