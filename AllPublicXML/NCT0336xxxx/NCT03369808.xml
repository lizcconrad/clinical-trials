  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of the inactivated
      whole-virion vaccine for teenagers and adults.

      The investigators will test the vaccine in participants aged 12-60 years, for a randomized,
      blind, placebo-controlled, age-stratified clinical study. The investigators designed three
      dosage groups: 7.5 μg,15 μg and 30 μg of hemagglutinin antigen. According to the age of the
      subjects, Each group was divided into different age subgroups. Phosphate buffer solution and
      Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant as placebo controls were both set up in the
      subgroups.Participants will receive 2 doses of vaccine at 21-day intervals.Safety up to 6
      months and changes in hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers at 21 days after each vaccination
      were determined.
