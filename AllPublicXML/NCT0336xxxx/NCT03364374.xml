      This study evaluates the relationship between seated posture and fine motor performance in a
      drawing task in people with stroke and in healthy control subjects.

    <textblock>
      Current stroke rehabilitation practice guidelines support an interprofessional approach which
      integrates discipline-specific goals into a comprehensive plan of care. However, there has
      been a failure to implement interprofessional guidelines into today's stroke rehabilitation
      clinical practice. Instead it is common that one discipline focuses on recovery of posture,
      while another discipline focuses on recovery of fine motor skills. The investigators argue
      that control of the hand is not independent from postural control. In fact, treating them
      separately ignores the kinematic and muscular linkages connecting the trunk to the hand via
      the scapula and proximal arm. It also ignores evidence that postural and hand muscles have
      overlapping cortical representations thus likely have similar neural control networks. Hence,
      the overall goal of this project is to demonstrate the relationship of posture and fine motor
      skills to advance stroke rehabilitation.

      The study will include two groups, stroke survivors and neurologically healthy controls, and
      both will perform a tracing task while seated on a backless bench. The task will be performed
      twice, at baseline and after giving participants cues to improve their posture. Both task
      repetitions will be performed in a single session on the same day. Kinetic and kinematic data
      will be collected to evaluate posture, postural stability and fine motor performance. Data
      collected at baseline will be used to examine the relationship between postural impairments
      and fine motor deficits. Additionally, we will evaluate the effects of postural cues on body
      segment alignment, stability and fine motor performance.

        Stroke patients will be recruited from the MUSC Center for Rehabilitation Research in
        Neurological Conditions database (approved IRB PRO# 15991, PI Kautz) that currently
        contains contact information for ~120 stroke survivors who have agreed to be contacted for
        research participation.
