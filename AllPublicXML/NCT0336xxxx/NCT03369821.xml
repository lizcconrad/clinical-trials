      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the
      pancreas by the body's own immune system (autoimmunity). We do not fully understand what
      causes this type of diabetes and why there is variation in age of onset and severity between
      people who develop the disease. The aim of this work is to study very unusual people who
      develop T1D extremely young, as babies under 1 year of age. We think that, for the condition
      to have developed that early, they must have an unusual or extreme form of autoimmunity.

      Studying people with very early-onset diabetes will enable us to look at exactly what goes
      wrong with the immune system because they have one of the most extreme forms of the disease.
      We may be able to learn a lot about the disease from a small number of rare individuals. We
      aim to confirm that they have autoimmune type 1 diabetes and then try to understand how it is
      possible that they have developed diabetes so young by studying their immune system genes,
      the function of their immune system, and environmental factors (such as maternal genetics)
      that may play a role in their development of the disease.

      People with diabetes diagnosed under 12 months are very rare and they live all over the
      world. We will take advantage of the fact that they are usually referred to Exeter for
      genetic testing. As part of their wider clinical team, we will contact them via their
      clinician to ask for more information about their diabetes and their family history. We will
      collect samples to study whether they still make any of their own insulin and whether they
      make specific antibodies against their beta cells in the pancreas. Separately, we will study
      their immune system in depth using immune cells isolated from a blood sample. We will then
      study these cells using cutting edge techniques by Dr Tim Tree at King's College London, by
      Professor Bart Roep at the Diabetes Metabolism Research Institute Faculty, City of Hope
      National Medical Center, California (USA), and Dr Cate Speake, Benaroya Reseach Institute,
      Seattle (USA). Some of these tests have never been used in people of young ages around the
      world, so an aim of this project will be to develop methods that can be used to study people
      even if they live far away.

    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease that causes destruction of pancreatic,
      insulin producing beta cells, leading to high blood glucose. T1D is regarded as a childhood
      disease with an average age of diagnosis of 13 years, but the age presentation is very
      variable from young infants until late adulthood.

      In Exeter, a group of rare children who have developed T1D in the first year of life (Patel)
      is described as having Extremely Early-onset Type 1 Diabetes (EET1D). Studying these rare
      patients is important because they are presenting with autoimmunity right at the beginning of
      life when the immune system is not yet fully developed and at a time when pancreatic
      autoimmunity first emerges (Krisher) and so this study may give novel insights into the cause
      of T1D.

      The Exeter Molecular Genetics Laboratory is a world referral centre (www.diabetesgenes.org)
      for Neonatal Diabetes (NDM). Most cases of diabetes diagnosed under 6 months do not have
      EET1D but have genetic mutations in beta cell genes that lead to impaired insulin production
      (NDM)(Ellard; De Franco). Exeter is able to identify the remaining &lt;20% without a mutation in
      a beta cell gene who actually have EET1D. Exeter uses a novel measure of T1D risk genes,
      called the T1D Genetic Risk Score (T1D GRS), showing that a proportion of the remaining
      patients have very high T1D risk and therefore EET1D(Patel). Understanding the mechanism for
      very early presentation could be highly important as immune strategies to intervene before or
      after people get T1D may differ by age of onset.

      The results may focus the research community on events that occur before birth and may then
      inform new efforts to prevent or intervene in the underlying destruction of beta cells in
      T1D.

      Hypotheses:

      i) Extreme early-onset T1D (EET1D) is associated with classic biomarkers of T1D, such as
      islet specific autoantibodies, autoreactive islet specific CD8 T cells, and loss of beta cell
      function, whereas monogenic neonatal diabetes will not be associated with these markers.

      ii) EET1D will be associated with more rapid beta cell loss than T1D presenting at older
      ages.

      iii) The mechanisms for EET1D will be due to rare changes in immune genes or due to a
      particularly potent, early response of the immune system to beta cells, as measured by
      autoreactive T cells or immune gene expression when compared to older onset T1D.

      Study Aim: The EXE-T1D study will take people with T1D diagnosed before the age of 12 months
      and compare them to people with T1D diagnosed at more typical ages (1-20 years) and people
      diagnosed with non-autoimmune diabetes at a similar very young age (children with neonatal
      diabetes [NDM]).

      EXE-T1D is an observational study organised into two sub-studies:

      Study 1: Cross-sectional study of existing patients with EET1D (n=100 v 100): Assess islet
      autoantibodies, islet T cell autoimmunity, C-peptide, genetics and clinical features of EET1D
      compared to T1D in selected patients referred over the last 15 years to the Exeter genetics
      team who are of varying ages and durations of diabetes.

      Study 2: Newly referred patients (n=20 v 20): Recruit newly diagnosed patients with EET1D who
      are referred to Exeter for diagnostic testing to allow assessment of immune phenotype in
      patients close to diagnosis(Abreu; Unger; Velthuis). Assess immune function longitudinally by
      collecting a blood sample for serum and peripheral lymphocytes, islet autoantibodies and
      C-peptide assessment shortly after referral, and approximately 2 years later.

      UK participants will be recruited under UK wide ethics. Exeter will recruit patients from
      international centres in collaboration with local clinicians that have specific Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) approval.

      The Exeter Clinical Laboratories encompass the Exeter Blood Sciences Laboratory and Exeter
      Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust and will
      perform C-peptide, islet autoantibody and genetic tests.

      Peripheral lymphocyte (PBMC) analysis for autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells will be performed
      by Bart Roep (City of Hope, CA, USA) and Tim Tree (King's College London). RNAseq will be
      performed by Cate Speake and the Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle (USA).

      All participants (or their legal guardian) recruited to the study will be required to give
      written informed consent and will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study at
      any time without prejudice or jeopardy to any future clinical care.

      Patients identified and screened as being suitable for this study will have a blood sample
      and optional urine sample collected by the clinical team at a time and location suitable for
      the patient, clinical and study teams.

      Study 2: In addition to the first visit, Fingerprick samples for RNA analysis:

      Parents of participants will perform repeated home collections of a capillary tube of blood
      from a standard fingerprick used to take their blood glucose (15 microlitres per sample) into
      a special tube containing a tempus solution (30 microlitres) that fixes RNA(Speake 2017). The
      repeated measurements are to ensure accurate measurement of immune gene expression over time.
      Fingerprick blood samples will be stored in the participant's freezer until couriered to
      Exeter at the end of the sampling period.

      Another blood sample for PBMC, C-peptide and Autoantibody analysis will be collected in an
      identical manner to the first sample, approximately 2 years (+/-6 months) later.

      Non-UK samples will be collected by collaborating international centres with their own IRB
      approval. The local team will spin and freeze the EDTA plasma sample and store it on site
      while the PBMCs are extracted as per Exeter's SOP. All tubes will then be couriered to
      Exeter. If no local team is available to extract PBMCs, all tubes will be couriered to Exeter
      for analysis.

      End of Study Definition: last participant's final study visit plus 6 months to enable
      follow-up data capture.

      Sample Receipt/Chain of Custody/Accountability The Exeter Clinical Laboratories have an
      established pipeline for receiving and processing all research samples, including
      documentation of chain of custody. Surplus samples will be processed, logged and frozen at
      -80°C within 24 hours of receipt. All samples will be appropriately labelled in accordance
      with the 1998 Data Protection Act. Biological samples collected from participants will be
      transported, stored, accessed and processed in accordance with national legislation relating
      to the use and storage of human tissue for research purposes.Participants will have the
      opportunity to consent to gift samples at the end of the study for future research.

      Results of analyses undertaken by the Exeter Clinical Laboratories will be electronically
      uploaded directly to the study database and linked to Study IDs.

      Safety, Definitions and Reporting Risks Blood samples will be collected by staff trained in
      venepuncture. Any potential discomfort or side-effects will be equivalent to that experienced
      in routine clinical care.

      Benefits The C-peptide and autoantibody results may help to confirm a diagnosis of T1D so
      will be reported back to clinicians responsible for the patient's diabetes care. Decisions
      about ongoing clinical care and treatment will be made externally to the research study but
      treatment will be recorded.

      Adverse effects Should any unforeseen adverse events arise that are possibly, probably, or
      definitely related to a study procedure, they will be reported to the Sponsor and CI/central
      coordinating team within 24 hours of the CI or PI or co-investigators becoming aware of the
      event.

      Confidentiality All information related to study participants will be kept confidential and
      managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, NHS Caldicott Guardian, The Research
      Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and Research Ethics Committee Approval.

      Participant data will be held in a link-anonymised format, with personal identifiable data
      only accessible to personnel with training in data protection who require this information to
      perform their study role.

      Record Retention and Archiving When the research study is complete, it is a requirement of
      the Research Governance Framework and Sponsor Trust Policy that the records are kept for a
      further 15 years.

      Local investigator site files must be archived at the external site according to local R&amp;D
      requirements. They will not be stored at the coordinating centre's archiving facility.

      Statistical Considerations Sample Size Total recruitment target is 240: Study 1: 100 with
      EET1D plus 100 controls (N=200); Study 2: 20 EET1D plus 20 controls (N=40) Feasibility: The
      sample size has been selected to assess feasibility rather than on the basis of statistical
      power. In reality with these extremely rare but potentially very interesting patients, every
      single patient recruited could contribute on their own to a novel discovery. The immune, beta
      cell or autoantibody differences the study may reveal are unknown but a group of 20 v 20
      gives an 80% power (alpha 0.05) to detect a difference of 10% v 50% in a proportion between
      the two groups and a power of 85% (alpha 0.05) to detect a 1 SD difference in a continuous
      variable.

      Statistical analysis: The EET1D as described are unique and findings in the various studies
      are difficult to predict given the novel nature of this study. The study using 100 EET1D v
      100 controls gives a 90% power (alpha 0.05) to detect a difference in proportions of a binary
      variable of 50% v 30% and a 0.6SD difference in a continuous variable, and similarly a group
      of 20 v 20 gives an 80% power (alpha 0.05) to detect a difference of 10% v 50% in the two
      groups and a power of 85% (alpha 0.05) to detect a 1 SD difference in a continuous variable.

      Monitoring of this study will ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice. The
      Investigators will permit monitoring, audits, REC review, and regulatory inspections by
      providing the Sponsor(s), Regulators and REC direct access to source data and other
      documents.

      No financial and other competing interests to disclose for the Chief Investigator, PIs at
      each site and committee members for the overall study management.

      NHS Indemnity will apply to UK participants and UK public liability insurance is provided by
      the University of Exeter.

      Accidental protocol deviations can happen at any time and must be adequately documented and
      reported to the Chief Investigator and Sponsor immediately.

      Access to the final study dataset The Exeter study team will have access to the final
      dataset. Of the multiple analyses done during the study, relevant co-investigators for each
      analysis (e.g. RNAseq for Cate Speake) will have access to the datasets they have contributed
      to.

      Public and Patient Involvement The CI's direct contact with patients with a diagnosis of
      diabetes in the first 12 months of life led to the study design. Patients, relatives and
      clinicians agree there would be significant benefit to knowing why and how T1D can present so
      young and whether understanding this could help with treatment or prevention.

      This work is funded by a patient-focused charity, Diabetes UK. Publication Policy On
      completion of the study, the data will be analysed and a Final Study Report will be prepared
      and submitted to the Funder, Sponsor and REC. Results will be written up and submitted for
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal(s). Abstracts will be submitted to national and
      international conferences. Written information in the form of a letter/newsletter outlining
      the key findings of the study will be posted on the study website.

        -  The University of Exeter owns the data arising from the study.

        -  There are no time limits or review requirements on the publications.

        -  The Funder will be acknowledged within publications but does not have review or
           publication rights.

        -  After the Final Study Report has been compiled, participants may specifically request
           results from their PI.

        Review the following exclusion criteria carefully at time of appointment as some details
        may have changed since initial contact:

          -  Recreational drug use (excluding cannabis use more than 1 week prior to blood
             sampling) - drug abuse may alter T cell function

          -  Alcohol related illness (excessive alcohol consumption may alter T cell function)

          -  Renal failure: Creatinine &gt;200 (as may alter T cell function)

          -  Any other medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect
             the safety of the subject's participation.

        Factors that if temporary would lead to rearrangement of study visit but if long duration,
        may lead to exclusion subject to the CI's discretion:

          -  Pregnant or lactating (as this may limit blood sampling and affect T cell function)

          -  Any infectious illness within the last 2 weeks if it was a febrile illness, or within
             2-3 days if it was non-febrile (as this may activate T cells non-specifically)

          -  Taking steroids or other immunosuppressive medications (as these may alter T cell
             function)

          -  Received any immunoglobulin treatments or blood products in the last 3 months (as
             these may alter T cell function).
