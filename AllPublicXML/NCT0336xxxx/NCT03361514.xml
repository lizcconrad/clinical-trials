      To investigate the effectiveness of the combination of Supported Protocolized Discontinuation
      (SPD) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in comparison with SPD alone in
      successful discontinuation of long-term use of antidepressants in primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressant use continues to rise, mainly explained by an increase in the proportion of
      patients receiving long term treatment. Although treatment guidelines recommend
      discontinuation after sustained remission, discontinuing antidepressants appears to be
      challenging for both patients and general practitioners. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy
      (MBCT) is an effective intervention that reduces the risk of relapse in recurrent depression
      and might facilitate discontinuation by teaching patients to cope with withdrawal symptoms
      and fear of relapse. The current study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the
      combination of Supported Protocolized Discontinuation (SPD) and MBCT in comparison with SPD
      alone in successful discontinuation of long-term use of antidepressants in primary care.

      Methods/Design This study involves a cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in primary
      care patients with long-term use antidepressants with baseline and 6, 9 and 12 months
      follow-up assessments. Patients choosing to discontinue their medication will be offered a
      combination of supported protocolized discontinuation (SPD) and MBCT or SPD alone. Our
      primary outcome will be full discontinuation of antidepressant medication (= 0 mg) within 6
      months after baseline assessment. Secondary outcome measures will be the severity of
      withdrawal symptoms, symptoms of depression and anxiety, psychological well-being, quality of
      life and medical and societal costs.

    <description>Patients who choose to discontinue their medication will make a personal tapering schedule with their GP based upon a discontinuation protocol with tapering suggestions. The protocol offers suggestions to taper within a maximum of 6 months describing all types of available dosages per antidepressant so individualized schedules can be constructed. In addition, they will be offered supportive meetings with the GP's mental health assistant. The assistant will receive basic information about discontinuation guidance, i.e. the information brochure, decision aid, discontinuation protocol and a short guideline how to organise consultations.</description>

    <description>In addition to the SPD patients are offered Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in homogeneous groups of patients willing to withdraw from their medication. MBCT will be offered according to the treatment protocol developed for recurrent depression, adaptated to the specific needs of patients discontinuing their antidepressant medication. The mindfulness courses will be provided by teachers qualifying the advanced criteria of the Association of Mindfulness Based Teachers in the Netherlands and Flanders. All teachers will receive additional training in using the specific study protocol at the start of the project.</description>
