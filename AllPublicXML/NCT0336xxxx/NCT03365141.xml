    <textblock>
      A randomized split-body pilot study was planned to confirm efficacy of intralesiona
      triamcinolone injection in patients with vitiligo
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intralesional corticosteroid injections have been a long-standing treatment for refractory
      vitiligo, with some patients showing significant improvement without surgical intervention.

      The investigators will perform a randomized split-body pilot trial to test the exact efficacy
      of intralesional triamcinolone injections. The paired symmetric vitiliginous lesions will be
      randomized to either control or injection groups. All lesions will be treated with narrowband
      UV-B phototerapy or excimer laser weekly and twice daily application of topical tacrolimus
      ointment for a total of 12-week period. Intralesional injections of 0.4mg/cc triamcinolone
      once a week are given to the experimental group. The degree of repigmentation will be
      assessed as % from baseline.
