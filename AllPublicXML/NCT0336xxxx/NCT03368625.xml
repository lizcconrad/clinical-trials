      This study will be a non-randomized phase II trial for patients with one to six brain
      metastases, at least one of which is appropriate for surgical resection. Upon registration,
      patients will be assigned to receive neo-adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (NASRS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a novel treatment strategy for large brain metastases was described whereby lesions
      appropriate for resection were treated with a single fraction of SRS pre-operatively. In a
      retrospective analysis, of 51 lesions with a median tumor size of 3 cm, 1-year LC was 86%.
      This neoadjuvant approach resulted in lower rates of leptomeningeal failure (3 vs. 17%) and
      symptomatic radiation toxicity (1.5 vs. 14.6 %) compared to a comparative cohort of lesions
      treated with post-operative cavity boost SRS (POCBS).

      Based on promising results, we believe that a prospective trial to establish the value of
      neoadjuvant SRS (NaSRS) for the treatment of BM appropriate for resection is warranted.

      This study will be a non-randomized phase II trial for patients with one to six brain
      metastases, at least one of which is appropriate for surgical resection. Upon registration,
      patients will be assigned to receive neo-adjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (NASRS).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Lymphoma, small cell carcinoma, and seminoma are excluded

          -  A lesion appropriate for resection, not previously treated with SRS. Lesions should be
             &gt; 2 cm and &lt; 4 cm in largest dimension, and require resection ( e.g. due to mass
             effect or to obtain a tissue diagnosis). Index lesions will be treated with SRS and
             surgery, as outlined in the treatment section of the protocol.

          -  Seen by a neurosurgeon or radiation oncologist and judged to be appropriate for
             participation in this study, including the ability to tolerate NaSRS, e.g., the
             ability to lie flat in a stereotactic head frame.

          -  Any unresected lesions or lesions for which there is no planned immediate resection
             (non index lesions) must measure &lt; 3.0 cm in maximal extent on the contrasted MRI or
             CT brain scan obtained ≤ 35 days prior to pre-registration. Unresected lesions will be
             treated with SRS as outlined in the treatment section of the protocol. .

          -  ECOG ≤ 2

          -  MRI confirmed 1-6 lesions, one of which is the index lesion. Each non-index lesion (up
             to 5) must measure ≤ 3.0 cm in maximal extent on contrasted MRI scan, and not
             otherwise require resection.

        Note: The pre-registration MRI may be obtained ≤ 35 days prior to enrolment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment plan respecting normal tissue tolerances using dose fractionation specified
             within the protocol cannot be achieved.

          -  pregnancy

          -  Prior cranial radiotherapy targeting the index lesion, or any prior WBRT.

          -  Inability to complete a MRI with contrast of the head, or a known allergy to
             gadolinium.

          -  Cytotoxic Chemotherapy within 7 days prior to SRS (molecularly targeted therapies ,
             including immune-modulatory drugs, can be given within seven days of SRS at the
             discretion of the treating physician)

          -  Metastatic germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or lymphoma or any primary brain
             tumor

          -  Imaging Findings:

               -  Widespread definitive leptomeningeal metastasis.

               -  A brain metastasis that is located ≤ 2 mm of the optic chiasm

               -  Evidence of midline shift

               -  Fourth ventricular narrowing, concerning for hydrocephalus
