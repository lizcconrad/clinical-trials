  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of cognitive training with transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) for children and adolescents (ages 10 - 16 years) with prenatal
      alcohol exposure (PAE).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has profound detrimental effects on brain development and, as
      a result, has permanent consequences for cognition, learning, and behavior. Individuals with
      Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) commonly have a range of neurocognitive impairments
      that directly lead to practical problems with learning, attention, working memory, task
      planning/execution, and decision making, among other areas of functioning. Despite the
      profound public health burden posed by FASD, there have been very few treatment studies in
      this population. This study will examine the effects of a cognitive remediation training
      augmented with tDCS in children and adolescents with PAE. Functional magnetic resonance
      imaging will be collected to provide preliminary data of brain circuitry changes created by
      this intervention. The study involves a baseline visit with cognitive testing, MRI, 5
      sessions of tDCS (including the baseline visit), and a 6th visit for cognitive testing and
      MRI. All sessions will be completed within a 28 to 56 day time window.
