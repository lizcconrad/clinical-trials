  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that children with dyslexia present proprioceptive disorders
      and the purpose of the present study is to better understand relationships between motor
      control, proprioception and academic learnings. The investigators compare a group of French
      students with and without dyslexia aged 10-12.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2 groups of children (dyslexics and control) will be evaluated on 2 tasks:

        -  Evaluation of the proprioception: Perception of the speed and Perception of the position

        -  Evaluation of the motor learning: Estimation of state in the framework of a motor
           perturbation

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of proprioception through velocity perception</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to perceive motion at 3 different velocities for 3 different joints is assessed using a motorized ergometer. A passive movement is performed by the ergometer and children are tasked to press a button as soon as they feel the movement. We calculate the angle of detection for each speed and compare it between Dyslexic and healthy children.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of proprioception through position perception</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to perceive position is assessed using an ergometer that produces passive movements of 3 different amplitudes on the dominant arm. In a second time, the ergometer produces a passive movement of the same arm and children are tasked to press a button as soon as they feel they are in the exact previously-experienced position. We calculate the angular error and compare it between Dyslexic and healthy children.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor learning</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to learn new motor tasks is assessed using virtual reality and motor acquisition systems. First we evaluate the motor accuracy and the state estimation by pointing tests. Then visual perturbations are introduced during pointing. Finally, we evaluate motor accuracy and state estimation again.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Text reading</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to read aloud a text is assessed using the French standardized test &quot; Alouette &quot;, which provide accuracy in reading aloud age-normed texts (ratio between words that have been correctly read and all the words that have been read).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phonological awareness: phonemic blending and phonemic elision</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to derive a phonemic pattern from distinct phonemic units or to substitute a phonemic pattern for another is assessed using the French standardized test &quot; Nepsy2, phonological process &quot; which provide standard deviation in reading aloud by the investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identifying words</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>The ability to identify words is assessed using the French standardized test &quot; Timé3 &quot;, which provide lexical level and delay reading in silent reading age-normed words.</description>
