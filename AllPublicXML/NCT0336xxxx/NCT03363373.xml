  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adults diagnosed with high risk neuroblastoma and refractory osteomedullary
      disease will be treated for up to 93 weeks with naxitamab and granulocyte-macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Participants will be followed for up to five years after first
      dose.

      Naxitamab, also known as hu3F8 is a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting GD2
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will receive treatment for up to 93 weeks following the first hu3F8
      administration and remain in the trial for 101 weeks. After the end of trial visit, each
      patient will enter a long-term follow-up where they will be monitored for up to 5 years after
      first treatment cycle.

      Each investigational cycle is started with 5 days, days -4 to 0, of Granulocyte-Macrophage
      Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) administered at 250 µg/m2/day in advance of the start of
      hu3F8 administration. GM-CSF is thereafter administered at 500 µg/m2/day on days 1 to 5. As
      standard treatment, hu3F8 is administered at 3 mg/kg/day on days 1, 3, and 5, totalling 9
      mg/kg per cycle.

      The first 5 cycles are repeated every 4 weeks up to week 21 and after that the frequency
      decreases to every 8 weeks through a total of 93 weeks. End of treatment will take place
      around 8 weeks after the last cycle and thereafter long-term follow-up will continue.
