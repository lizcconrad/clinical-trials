  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with MS commonly experience extreme fatigue that negatively impacts their ability to
      engage in a full range of daily activities, quality of life, and employment. A new website
      called MS INFoRm (Multiple Sclerosis: An Interactive Fatigue Management Resource) allows
      people with MS to take a personalized and active approach to learning about and managing
      their fatigue. The aims of this study are:

        1. To determine to determine whether 3-month use of the MS INFoRm website can reduce the
           impact of fatigue on daily life among persons with MS.

        2. To determine whether 3-month use of the MS INFoRm website results in improvement in
           self- efficacy/ confidence for managing MS fatigue, self-reported cognitive function,
           participation and autonomy/ independence, and depression.

        3. To determine whether benefits are maintained among the MS INFoRm users after 6-months.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will use a randomized controlled trial design to test the efficacy and effectiveness of MS INFoRm. Two hundred participants from at least three sites across Canada will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental (MS INFoRm) group or usual care control group. After completing the study, participants in the usual care control group will be given access to MS INFoRm in order to provide them with any benefits of the website, if any are uncovered. Both groups will be evaluated on primary (fatigue impact) and secondary (self-efficacy, cognitive function, participation and autonomy, depression) outcomes at baseline (week 1), after 3-month use of the MS INFoRm website (week 12), and after 6-month follow-up (week 36).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Both the MS INFoRm group and the control group will receive a login and password, although participants in the groups will be directed to a different webpages (i.e. a MS INFoRm page or usual care control webpage). This will facilitate blinding of participants to their allocation. The research assistant will complete the scheduling, data collection, and data entry blinded to the group allocation.</masking_description>
