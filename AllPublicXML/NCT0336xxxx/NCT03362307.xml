    <textblock>
      Subjects were assigned in two groups: In group 1, subjects received LLL and LED 20 min/day
      for 10 days after implant insertion, subjects in group 2did not undergo LLL and LED. implant
      stability quotients(ISQs) were measured in 0,10,21,42 and 63 days after implant placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects eligible for study inclusion had an edentulous area at the first molar of the
      mandible and needed a dental implant. Subjects were excluded from study enrollment if they
      had any diseases that affect bone, smoking, insufficient bone in the edentulous area which
      needs bone augmentation, failed to return for follow-up, or refused study enrollment.

      All implants were placed at least 3 months after tooth removal. The size of implants was 4.8X
      10 mm (Zimmer, USA) Subjects were aligned based on computer randomization in two groups: In
      group 1(intervention), subjects received LLL and LED after implant placement and in group 2
      (control) the same device was used while device was off.

      A portable device was applied for irradiation of the intervention group with combination of
      810nm laser and 632nm LED.

      Subjects in group 1 underwent LLL 15 mw/cm2 and LED 10 mw/cm2 20 min every day for 10 days.

      The mesiodistal and buccolingual directions were measured and the mean implant stability
      quotients (ISQs) were determined. The RFA measurements were performed in immediate after
      insertion (time0) 10 days (time1), 3 weeks (time2), 6 weeks(time3) and 9(time 4) weeks after
      implant placement.
