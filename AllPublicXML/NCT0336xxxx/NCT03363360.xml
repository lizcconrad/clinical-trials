      Background: With the continuous improvement of living standards in the past 30 years, the
      lifestyle and diet of Chinese people have undergone significant changes, leading to a
      significant increase in the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and lipid metabolism
      disorders. Prevention and control work is also increasingly valued. At present, there is no
      research on the awareness rates and control rates of blood glucose, blood pressure and blood
      lipids in diabetic patients in Jiangxi Province. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the
      country has vigorously promoted the grading system of chronic non-communicable diseases, but
      there is a big gap between the levels of disease management in different levels of hospitals.

      Methods:The province's multi-center, sub-center control, cross-sectional survey, the number
      of cases planned to be included in 10000 cases. Patient Access: Within 2 years from the date
      of the study (December 2016), eligible patients were screened out of outpatients in the
      participating hospitals, and patients were reviewed and informed of the informed
      consent.Inclusion criteria: in line with the WHO1999 diabetes diagnostic criteria; age 20-80
      years; duration of 1 year or more; signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria: at the same
      time using other experimental drugs or in other clinical trials; gestational diabetes, other
      special types of diabetes; in acute infection, trauma and other stress conditions and the
