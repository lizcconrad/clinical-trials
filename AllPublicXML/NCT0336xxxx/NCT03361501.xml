  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of CaPre 4 g daily, compared
      to placebo, in lowering fasting TG levels in subjects with fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL and
      ≤1500 mg/dL (≥5.7 mmol/L and ≤17.0 mmol/L) after 12 weeks of treatment.

      Approximately 615 subjects will be screened to obtain 245 randomized subjects following a
      treatment allocation ratio of 2.5:1 (CaPre:placebo).
