  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational case-control study investigators aimed to assess the serum levels of
      adipokines such as Apelin, Chemerin and adiponectin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), and compare it with healthy controls. Furthermore, investigators evaluated the
      possible correlation of these adipokines with IBS-QoL, IBSSS, GI symptoms and other clinical
      and psychological disorders.

    <measure>IBS severity score system (IBSSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>in recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>Irritable bowel syndrome severity score system is validated for use in IBS patients, which included five clinically relevant items during a 10-day period: (i) severity of abdominal pain, (ii) frequency of abdominal pain, (iii) severity of abdominal distention or tightness, (iv) dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and (v) interference of IBS with life in general. Each item was scored on a scale from 0 to 100, and the sum of these five items was the score of IBS severity (range 0-500). Scores of 75-175, 175-300, and &gt;300 indicated mild, moderate, and severe cases, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>in recruitment</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful.Higher PSS scores were associated with a greater vulnerability to stressful life-event-elicited depressive symptoms.
PSS scores are obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all scale items. A short 4 item scale can be made from questions 2, 4, 5 and 10 of the PSS 10 item scale.</description>
