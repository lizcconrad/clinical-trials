  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Myeloma or CLL with severe secondary hypogammaglobinemia and recurrent
      infections will be included in this study; for whom an IgSC treatment was prescribed. The
      IgSC prescription will be the decision of the treating physician. Patient care and follow up
      will be performed according to the current clinical practice and the recommendations of HAS.
