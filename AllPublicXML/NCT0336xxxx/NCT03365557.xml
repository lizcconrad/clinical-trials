  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to explore the effects of airway peak pressure (Ppeak) guidance on
      the least laryngeal mask airway (LMA) intracuff pressure setting during general anesthesia
      and the effects on postoperative complications in the throat. Sixty patients (American
      Society of Anesthesiologists grades I or II) scheduled for elective gynecological
      laparoscopic operation under general anesthesia were enrolled in our study. The patients were
      divided into pressure-regulated group (group P) and control group (group C) randomly. Size 4
      Supreme LMA was inserted in after general anesthesia induction. Air was injected into the
      cuff to make the intracuff pressure (ICP) achieve 60 cmH2O. Volume-controlled ventilation was
      selected and Ppeak was recorded. In group P, all the gas in the LMA cuff was sucked out, and
      then air was injected in during expiration phase to make ICP achieve the level of Ppeak. If
      there's any leakage, increase 5 cmH2O every time till there's no air leakage from the mouth.
      After pneumoperitoneum, the cuff was inflated to make ICP achieve 60 cmH2O and Ppeak was
      recorded once more. Then all the gas in the LMA cuff was sucked out, and air was injected
      into the cuff during expiration phase to make ICP achieve the level of Ppeak as the above
      method till the end of operation. During pneumoperitoneum, the pressure of CO2 was set at 10
      cmH2O. In group C, ICP was maintained at 60 cmH2O. Ppeak, ICP and the intracuff gas volume
      were recorded before and after pneumoperitoneum. ICP during inspiratory phase in the two
      groups was measured. Tidal volume during inspiration (VTI) and expiration (VTE) in the two
      groups were recorded, and the leakage rate was calculated as [(VTI－VTE)/ VTI×100%]. Throat
      complications of all the patients in 24 hours after surgeries were also recorded.
