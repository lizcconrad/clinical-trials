  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will test whether using wearable fitness trackers with or without a
      social incentive, delivered through a game-based mobile health intervention, increases
      physical activity and quality of life in ovarian cancer survivors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 50% of ovarian cancer survivors experience poor quality of life, fatigue, and anxiety
      after completing surgery and chemotherapy to treat their disease. Moreover, many ovarian
      cancer survivors become deconditioned during treatment; 40% report significant drops in
      activity during the year after diagnosis, and only 20% meet the recommended guidelines for
      physical activity.

      Randomized trials of interventions are urgently needed to determine whether increasing
      physical activity improves outcomes in ovarian cancer survivors. In other cancers, physical
      activity improves quality of life and mental health, while reducing the risk of cancer
      recurrence and death. To date, however, most studies have focused on patients with curable
      breast and prostate cancers. The effects of physical activity on understudied populations,
      including ovarian cancer survivors, are unknown. Furthermore, although ovarian cancer
      survivors report an interest in participating in home-based walking programs, few formal
      programs exist.

      Stepping into Survivorship is a randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness
      of wearable fitness trackers with or without a game-based mobile health intervention that
      leverages social support to increase physical activity in ovarian cancer survivors. At the
      start of the study all participants will track their daily step counts using a wearable
      fitness tracker (e.g. Fitbit) to determine how many steps they walk in an average day. Next,
      they will set an increased step-goal and receive daily, individualized feedback based upon
      their performance.

      Participants randomized to the game-based intervention will also choose a team partner (i.e.
      family or friend) to receive a wearable fitness tracker and together they will track their
      steps, earning non-financial micro-incentives (e.g. points, levels, badges) when they achieve
      their collaborative goals. This game-based mobile health intervention is designed to enhance
      collaboration, accountability, peer support, and ultimately physical activity among ovarian
      cancer survivors and their friends/family members.

      This research is being done to improve participants' quality of life. The investigators hope
      that the use of wearable fitness trackers with or without a game-based mobile health
      intervention will help participants increase their physical activity and improve quality of
      life.
