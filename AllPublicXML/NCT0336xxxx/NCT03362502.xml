  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human/first-in-patient, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized,
      ascending dose, safety and tolerability study of a single intravenous infusion of PF-06939926
      in ambulatory subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Other objectives include
      measurement of dystrophin expression and distribution, and assessments of muscle strength,
      quality, and function.

      Two dose cohorts are planned with up to 6 subjects for each. In order to mitigate
      unanticipated risks to subject safety, enrollment will be staggered within and between the
      two cohorts and will include a formal review by an external data monitoring committee (E-DMC)
      prior to dose progression.
