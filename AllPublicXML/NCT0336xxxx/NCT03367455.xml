  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the association of the KCNJ11 (Potassium Voltage-Gated
      Channel Subfamily J Member 11) polymorphisms on diabetes risk in the Atherosclerosis Risk in
      Communities (ARIC) and Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohorts. The investigators also propose to
      test for an interaction between serum K and these genetic variants. By testing for such an
      interaction, it will be determined if, among participants with these genetic variants, a
      low-normal serum K was a stronger predictor of diabetes risk compared to those participants
      without these genetic variants.

        The ARIC study is a prospective cohort of 15,792 adults between the ages of 45 and 64 years
        at the baseline visit. Participants were recruited from four communities in the USâ€”Forsyth
        County, North Carolina, Jackson, Mississippi, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Washington
        County, Maryland. All participants attended an initial baseline visit between 1987-1989.
        JHS is a community-based, prospective cohort study of 5301 African-American adults, aged
        21-95 years at the baseline visit, from the Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area.
        Participants had baseline data collected between 2000 and 2004.
