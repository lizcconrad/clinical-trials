  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is a lack of knowledge on the effect of additional flushing after HIPEC on
      tumour platinum exposure, systemic platinum exposure and platinum concentration in drain
      exudate and thereby personal exposure. Therefore the investigators want to perform a study to
      investigate the effect of flushing after HIPEC on tumour exposure, systemic exposure and on
      wound exudate concentration.

    <textblock>
      Cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is
      standard care in the treatment of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis as a result of
      intra-abdominal cancers. In many (inter)national centres oxaliplatin is used for the primary
      HIPEC treatment. Although the oxaliplatin dose of 460mg/m2 is widely accepted, the exact
      procedure of HIPEC differs between institutions and surgeons. Due to a great variety in the
      volume of the abdominal cavity, platinum concentration in the perfusate might differ between
      patients. Moreover, there is no consensus about the usefulness of flushing the HIPEC system
      with crystalloids at the end of oxaliplatin administration. Flushing is predominantly
      performed with the idea to minimize both systemic exposure of ultrafilterable platinum and
      personnel exposure to platinum contaminated exudate. On the other hand, HIPEC without
      flushing might increase effectiveness because intraperitoneal tumour cells are exposed to
      high concentrations of oxaliplatin for a longer time period. The option of flushing is based
      on an individual preference of the surgeon. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge on the
      effect of flushing on tumour platinum exposure, systemic platinum exposure and platinum
      concentration in drain exudate and thereby personal exposure. Therefore the investigators
      want to perform a study to investigate the effect of flushing after HIPEC on tumour exposure,
      systemic exposure and on wound exudate concentration.
