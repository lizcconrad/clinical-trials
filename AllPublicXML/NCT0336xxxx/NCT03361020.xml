  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) has been a primary component in successful treatment
      of Hodgkin lymphoma, exposure to this treatment has been associated with significant
      cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and pulmonary morbidity in long-term survivors. Survivors of
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) are also at risk for fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness.
      Insufficient sleep is recognized as an important public health concern, and is associated
      with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, neurocognitive problems, and reduced quality
      of life and productivity.

      Survivors of HL, who are already at risk for cardiac and neurologic morbidity due to their
      treatment exposures, could face catastrophic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events with
      the added risk associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The investigators propose to
      examine indices of sleep quality using polysomnography, and associated neurocognitive
      performance, brain MRI, and structure and strength of neck muscles in 220 long-term adult
      survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma treated with thoracic radiation.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. To estimate the prevalence of OSA in adult survivors of HL treated with thoracic
           radiation, and compare the frequency to community controls matched on age, gender, race
           and body mass index.

        2. To identify specific therapeutic factors associated with OSA in adult survivors of HL
           treated with thoracic radiation.

        3. To identify biomarkers of OSA in adult survivors of HL treated with thoracic radiation.

        4. To examine associations between OSA and cardiac morbidity and brain integrity in the
           adult survivors of HL treated with thoracic radiation.

      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors being following at St. Jude within the SJLIFE protocol cohort
      who were treated with TRT will be recruited to complete a comprehensive neurocognitive
      evaluation, overnight polysomnography evaluation, brain and neck MRI, cervical strength
      testing, and serum biomarkers related to cardiac disease. As part of their standard SJLIFE
      evaluation, they will also complete an echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests and
      questionnaires designed to evaluate broad health, emotional, socioeconomic and environmental
      factors that impact everyday life.

      The investigators will also recruit a comparison sample of healthy individuals matching on
      age, sex, race and body mass index. The comparison group will complete the comprehensive
      neurocognitive evaluation, overnight polysomnography, neck MRI, and cervical strength
      testing.
