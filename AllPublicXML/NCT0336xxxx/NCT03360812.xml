      This study evaluates whether an online training resource can improve the performance of
      medical students in recognising imminently dying palliative care patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians are routinely asked to provide survival estimates for palliative care patients,
      but recognition of imminent death (last 72 hours of life) is often inaccurate. We developed
      an online training resource, based on a previous study that identified the symptoms or signs
      that were most influential in forming expert palliative care doctors' prognostic decisions
      about imminent death.

      This double-blind randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of this online
      training resource in improving the performance of medical students in recognising imminently
      dying palliative care patients.

      Participants are asked to visit the study website and review three series of vignettes
      describing patients referred to palliative care. For each vignette, participants are asked to
      provide an estimate (0-100%) about the probability that the patient will die in the next 72
      hours. After the first series of vignettes, students randomised to the intervention arm are
      given access to an online training resource showing how experts weighted the relative
      importance of symptoms and signs. All participants are asked to complete a second series of
      vignettes. After two weeks, all participants are asked to return to the website and complete
      a third series of vignettes to assess if any effect has been maintained.

    <description>The intervention is an online training resource to improve the recognition of imminent death in palliative care patients. The intervention should take approximately 15 minutes to complete. During this time, the participants who are in the intervention arm will be shown the results of a previous study which identified how expert palliative care doctors recognise imminently dying palliative care patients. The intervention will be implemented via the website, immediately after participants have completed the first set of vignettes.</description>
