  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is one of the most common epidemics occurring in India during winter months. Most
      of the commonly used antiviral have limited efficacy and safety in influenza treatment. Flu
      Care polyherbal consist of antiviral, antitussive and anti-inflammatory herbal medicine. If
      this Flu care intervention is shown to be effective, there will be major potential benefits
      to general population.
