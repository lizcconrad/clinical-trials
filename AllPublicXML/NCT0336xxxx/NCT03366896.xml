      Validation of the Malay version of 3D-CAM, involving two-staged process.

        1. Translation and cultural adaptation of 3D-CAM into the Malay language.

        2. Testing for Validity and Reliability of the translated 3D-CAM tool to detect
           postoperative delirium.

      1. Translation and Cultural Adaptation

           The research panel, who consisted of experts in the clinical field of anesthesia, did
           the meticulous process of translation and cultural adaptation of 3D-CAM.

           This process included independent translation by the research panel, reconciliation of
           two independent translated 3D-CAM, ethics approval prior to pilot study on 20 relevant
           subjects, back translation into English and finalizing the Malay version of 3D-CAM for
           the next phase of testing.

        2. Testing for Validity and Reliability of the translated 3D-CAM tool

      Patients were recruited pre-operatively after reading the patient's information sheet and
      signing the informed consent.

      Post-operatively, two trained assessors separately administered the Malay 3D-CAM on the
      recruited patients. One of the trained assessors administered the original 3D-CAM on the same
      patients at a different time. Standard reference of diagnosing delirium was made by a
      psychiatrist using the DSM V criteria, after interviewing the patients.

        1. For validity, the diagnosis of delirium made using the Malay 3D-CAM tool was tested
           against the standard reference for diagnosing delirium according to the DSM V criteria
           made by a psychiatrist

        2. For inter-rater reliability, the diagnosis of delirium made by two trained assessors
           using the Malay 3D-CAM tool were statistically compared.

        3. For parallel reliability, the diagnosis of delirium made using the Malay 3D-CAM was
           compared to the original English version of 3D-CAM.
