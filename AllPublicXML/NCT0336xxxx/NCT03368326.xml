  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain injured patients are at high risk of pain due to the illness itself and a variety of
      nociceptive procedures in intensive care unit. Since the disorder of consciousness, speech,
      and movement, it is usually difficult for them to self-report the presence of pain reliably.
      The Critical-Care Pain observation Tool (CPOT) has been recommended for clinical use in the
      critically ill patients when self-report pain is unavailable. Besides, it seems that the
      bispectral index (BIS), a quantified electroencephalogram instrument, can be used for pain
      assessment along with the CPOT tool in some nonverbal critical ill patients (e.g., intubated
      and deep sedation). However, the validity and reliability of CPOT and BIS for pain assessment
      in brain injured patients are still uncertain so far. So the aim of this research is to
      investigate the value of CPOT and BIS for pain evaluation in this specific patient group.

    <description>The BIS monitor is a noninvasive technology, which measures different electrocortical indices through electrodes placed on the patient's forehead. Its main variable, the BIS index, consists of a single number computed from a complex algorithmic equation based on the EEG data. Its value can range from 0 (complete EEG suppression) to 100 (fully awake).</description>
