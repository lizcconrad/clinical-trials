  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their
      families facing the problem associated with life-threatening illness such as cancer, through
      the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and treatment of pain
      and other physical and psychosocial problems. Despite the rising incidence of cancer, the
      availability of comprehensive palliative care services across Sub Saharan Africa is extremely
      limited. The current study will test the efficacy of the newly developed smart phone based
      symptom evaluation app (application), in improving the management of the palliative care
      needs of patients with advanced cancer in Rwanda.

      RPCHO is the Rwanda Palliative Care and Hospice Organization that provides palliative care
      services to advanced cancer patients in Rwanda. About 80 patients enrolled under the RPCHO
      will be enrolled in the current study. Those who agree to take part in the study will be
      randomly assigned to either a standard care group or intervention group. Patients in both the
      arms will continue to receive the standard palliative care currently provided at the RPCHO.
      Additionally, patients in the intervention group will receive new smart-phone application
      based alerts, bi-weekly, on their mobile phone to fill out the short symptom assessment form.
      In addition, patients will also be able to complete a symptom assessment at any time they
      feel that their symptoms are poorly controlled or getting worse. The team at RPCHO will have
      desktop based dashboard where they will be able to track all patient's information. This will
      assist them in early identification and response to any worsening symptoms. Patients enrolled
      in both standard arm and intervention arm, will be asked to make three visits at the RPCHO at
      baseline, at 6 weeks, at 3 months. During this visits the RPCHO research staff will conduct
      their physical and psychological assessment.

      We hope to find significant improvement in pain score, other symptoms and quality of life, as
      measured by standard validated scores, for patients enrolled under the intervention arm
      (using the smart phone app) as compared to standard care arm at 6 weeks and at 3 months. Thus
      we hope to demonstrate that the new smartphone-based app can be successfully used for both
      the assessment and management of pain and other symptoms and providing palliative care
      services for advanced cancer patients in low and middle income countries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to conduct a preliminary efficacy study of a smartphone based symptom
      management app in a small pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      We will enroll 80 advanced cancer patients with moderate to severe pain needs (10 per month)
      with estimated 40% females. Following informed consent, study staff will administer baseline
      assessments. Subsequently, patients will be randomly assigned via computer-generated
      randomization, to standard care or to the smartphone intervention plus standard care for 3
      months.

      In the intervention arm participants will receive twice-weekly smartphone reminders to fill
      out the APCA POS on their phones. When prompted, participants will be asked to respond to the
      questions with a numerical value on the 5-point scale. Responses of 2 or higher will be
      highlighted on the provider's dashboard and identified, as &quot;needs follow-up.&quot; Providers will
      respond to the &quot;needs follow-up&quot; messages (via call or text) and will advise the patients as
      indicated during business hours. The APCA POS score and any adjustment in medications and
      advice given will be noted in the medical record and the study software as outlined.

      In the standard Care arm patients will get the current palliative care provided at the RPCHO.
      This standard care includes regular follow-up phone calls and home visits, though the timing
      of these calls is variable and is selected by the discretion of the team. Patients can also
      contact RPCHO providers on a landline number available during business hours and staffed by
      an on-call palliative care provider.

      For after-hours emergency assistance, patients in both study arms will still have the option
      of contacting the on-call palliative-care physicians for assistance, as they do now.

      A trained study interviewer, who is blinded to patient assignment, will administer the
      baseline, 6-week and 3-month assessments for patients in both arms. In the baseline
      assessment information on patient and disease characteristic (age, sex, marital status,
      diagnosis, place of care, performance status) and family context (living situation) will be
      collected. On follow-up visits at 6 week and 3 month, patient's physical and psychosocial
      assessment will be done through expanded APCA POS (African Palliative Care Outcome Scale).
      APCA POS have been previously validated in the African setting. The APCA POS includes ten
      questions in total, two focused on physical symptoms including pain and assessment of general
      symptoms, five focused on psychosocial needs and three questions focused on the care-giver
      perspective of needs. Because our study is focused on the tracking and monitoring of physical
      symptoms of patients, three additional questions from the Palliative Outcomes Scale - Symptom
      List (POS-S) are added to the APCA POS which include shortness of breath, nausea and
      vomiting, fatigue and constipation.

      The assessment will be completed via paper and pencil and entered by the project coordinator
      into a password-protected, de-identified database, using double data entry, and uploaded to
      an encrypted, password protected, shared database which the PIs will be responsible for
      maintaining. All information pertaining to smartphone messages, including patient and
      provider responses will also be uploaded into the encrypted password-protected software
      maintained by Cornell Tech.

      Primary outcome for the study is difference in pain score as measured by the expanded APCA
      POS in two arms. Secondary outcomes are difference in other symptoms and quality of life
      (QOL) scores from the remaining portion of the expanded APCA POS individually and as
      composite score between the two arms. We will examine the efficacy of the app to improve
      these outcomes at 6 weeks and 3 months, adjusting for baseline scores with intension-to-treat
      analysis. These data will help us determine effect size used for sample size calculation of a
      future large scale RCT.

    <intervention_model_description>We will enroll 80 advanced cancer patients with moderate to severe pain needs (10 per month) with estimated 40% females. Following informed consent, study staff will administer baseline assessments, assess eligibility and obtain consent. Subsequently, eligible consenting patients, will be randomly assigned via computer-generated randomization, to standard palliative care (currently provided at Rwanda Palliative Care and Hospice Organization) or to the new smartphone intervention (with biweekly and SOS symptom assessment and response) plus standard care for 3 months. The probability of being assigned to either group will be equal (50%).
With 36 patients per group, we will have 85% power to detect a clinically significant difference of 1 point on the pain score [SD=1.4] between the two treatment groups at 3-months with an alpha of 0.05. Based on prior studies and assuming an attrition rate of no more than 10%, we increased our sample size to 40 patients per group.</intervention_model_description>

The composite QOL will be generated by totaling scores from each question, and the production of a rating against a range of scores from 0-50 for patients (0-35 for the 7 patient related questions in the original APCA POS and 0-15 for additional 3 symptom related questions we added from POS-S) and 0-15 for family members/caretakers. To ensure that all scores are correctly directed (i.e. the lower the score the better the outcome against an item, the higher the score, the more severe the outcome), we will reverse the scores for questions 4-9 in the original APCA-POS for the purpose of data analysis.</description>
