  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has identified differences in the quality of mother-child interaction and
      gene expression of six key molecules involved in stress response and neurobehavioral
      development in preterm infants (born &lt;32 weeks of gestational age) with early skin to skin
      contact after birth compared to infants with visual contact at six months corrected age. We
      hypothesize that these differences are still identifiable at the age of 6 to 8 years and that
      quality of bonding in preterm infants born &lt;32 weeks of gestation differs significantly from
      late preterm infants and full-term infants.

      Quality of bonding in former preterm infants born 2012 to 2015 who participated in the
      &quot;delivery room skin to skin study&quot; (deisy), moderate to late preterm infants born 2010 to
      2011 who participated in the &quot;trauma and depression in late preterm parents study&quot; (TraDelPP)
      and full-term infants at 6 to 8 years of age is assessed using the German version of the
      attachment story completion task (ASCT). Additionally, gene expression of six key molecules
      involved in stress response and neurobehavioral development (the corticotropin releasing
      hormone receptor 1 and 2 genes (CRHR1 and CRHR2), arginine vasopressin gene (AVP), the
      glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1), the serotonin receptor 2A gene (HTR2A), and the
      serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4)) are quantified in in mucosal epithelial cells from
      buccal swabs of children of all four groups. Maternal and infant co-factors such as maternal
      depression, perceived social support, parental stress, infant health development and behavior
      are assessed by self-reporting questionnaires.
