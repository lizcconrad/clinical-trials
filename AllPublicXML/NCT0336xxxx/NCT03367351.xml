  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to produce a high-quality, theory-driven, therapeutic,
      web-based intervention that provides extended training and peer support to adolescents and
      young adults with type 1 diabetes who are newly implementing CGM. Overall, this web-based
      intervention represents an efficient way to bring together professionally-supported CGM
      educational materials and social support to overcome known barriers and address factors
      associated with inconsistent CGM use.
