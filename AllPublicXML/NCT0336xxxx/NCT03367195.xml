  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm, prospective, double-blind double-dummy, randomized-controlled study
      comparing DLBS2411 at a dose of 250 mg twice daily with omeprazole at a dose of 20 mg twice
      daily, given before morning and evening meals, for an 8-week course of therapy. Subjects
      should avoid taking meals 2-3 hours before bedtime.

      The bioactive fraction of DLBS2411 has been proved at cellular and genetic levels to have an
      antiulcer effect through both suppressing the gastric acidity and enhancing gastric mucosal
      protection. The anti-secretory effect of DLBS2411 is exerted through the inhibition of H+/K+
      ATPase 'pump' as well as down-regulation of the H+/K+ ATPase gene expression, thus
      suppressing gastric acid secretion; while its cytoprotective defense mechanism works through
      the promotion of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) derived prostaglandin (PgE2) synthesis, thus
      promoting gastrointestinal submucosal blood-flow, stimulating secretion of gastric-epithelial
      mucous and bicarbonate; anti-oxidative activity; and endothelial-nitric oxide (NO) formation.

      Recent study of DLBS2411 which was conducted in healthy volunteers, demonstrated the
      effective role and safety of DLBS2411 in suppressing intragastric acidity. Having such
      mechanisms of action, DLBS2411 is hypothesized to benefit patients with gastric acid
      disorders such as in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

      There will be 2 groups of treatment; each group will consist of 129 subjects with the
      treatment regimens for 8 weeks:

      Treatment I : 1 capsule of Omeprazole 20 mg and 1 placebo caplet of DLBS2411, twice daily
      Treatment II : 1 caplet of DLBS2411 250 mg and 1 placebo capsule of omeprazole, twice daily

      Each study medication will be administered twice daily, 30 minutes before morning (the first)
      and evening (the last) meals.

      The eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive study medication (Treatment 1 or
      Treatment 2) for 8 weeks of treatment, in a double blind fashion. They will be asked to come
      to the clinic every 4-week interval throughout the study period. Treatment Group 1 will
      receive Omeprazole twice daily and Placebo DLBS2411 twice daily. While Treatment Group 2 will
      receive DLBS2411 twice daily and Placebo Omeprazole twice daily.

      Subjects will be evaluated for treatment efficacy at baseline and at interval of 4 weeks over
      the 8-week course of therapy. Throughout the 8-week therapy, subjects should record the
      frequency (presence and absence) of each of GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation,
      epigastric pain, nausea) daily in the provided Patient's Diary. The severity of each symptom
      experienced should also be self-evaluated and recorded.

      The safety profile of study medication other than vital signs and adverse event will be
      measured at baseline and end of study.

      Along the study, subjects should avoid taking meals 2-3 hours before bedtime. All subjects
      will be under direct supervision of a medical doctor during the study period.
