      This is an observational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of dronabinol for the
      treatment of anxiety and/or depression in older adults. Participants who are prescribed
      dronabinol as part of a voluntary inpatient stay in McLean's Division of Geriatric Psychiatry
      will be interviewed about their mood and cognition on a weekly basis while on dronabinol.

    <textblock>
      Recently there has been renewed interest in potential alternative medical applications of
      cannabis/THC and medical marijuana is now legalized in 23 states and the District of
      Columbia. Acute effects of THC can include subjective feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and
      sedation, and clinicians noted that THC is well tolerated for its approved indications. Given
      these subjective effects and relatively benign safety profile, some physicians have used
      dronabinol (synthetic THC) &quot;off-label&quot; to treat depression and/or anxiety.

      The investigators are doing this research to better understand how effective dronabinol
      treatment is when prescribed for depression and/or anxiety in older patients. The
      investigators also want to find out if dronabinol is safe to take without causing too many
      side effects. Dronabinol is is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
      treat loss of appetite in chemotherapy patients, but dronabinol is not approved by the FDA to
      treat depression and/or anxiety. Through research questionnaires on mood and cognition, the
      investigators can gather information that will help demonstrate how effective dronabinol
      treatment is at treating depression and/or anxiety.
