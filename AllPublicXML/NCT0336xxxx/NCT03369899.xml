      This study is a non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center study that is designed to evaluate
      the safety and effectiveness of the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring Systems in
      pediatric populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to six (6) clinical research sites in the United
      States. Subjects will wear two Sensors. Each Sensor will have a paired Reader that will be
      given to the subject. All Readers will be masked during the study (i.e. subjects will not be
      able to view glucose results obtained from the Sensor on the Reader screen). Subjects will be
      asked to perform at least 4 capillary Blood Glucose (BG) tests per day using the primary
      Reader. Interstitial glucose readings from each Sensor will be obtained with the
      corresponding Readers immediately following each BG test. Subjects will be instructed to
      report any problems with the device. Subjects will make two (2) to five (5) scheduled visits
      to the clinical study site, including the Enrollment/Screening Visit (Visit 1). Based on the
      subjects age and weight, subjects will have up to two (2) in-clinic visits during which
      intravenous blood draws and Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) reference testing will occur.

    <description>System performance will be characterized with respect to YSI reference venous plasma sample measurements for subjects aged 6 and older. Capillary blood glucose (BG) reference will be used for subjects aged less than 6 years of age.
For subjects age 6 years and older, point accuracy of the system will be evaluated as the proportion of System readings that are within ±20% of the YSI reference value for YSI glucose levels ≥ 80 mg/dL and within ±20 mg/dL for YSI glucose levels &lt;80 mg/dL. For subjects of age less than 6 years, ages 4 and older the system will be evaluated as the proportion of System readings that are within ±20% of the BG reference value for BG glucose levels ≥ 80 mg/dL and within ±20 mg/dL for BG glucose levels &lt;80 mg/dL.</description>
