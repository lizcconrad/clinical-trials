    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was evaluate the comparative effects of FO rich in EPA (FO-EPA) and
      FO rich in DHA (FO-DHA) on inflammation and neutrophil properties after a prolonged and
      strenuous exercise. The effect of soybean lecithin on the same parameters and conditions also
      was evaluated.

      The volunteers were not taking any medication during the study. All individuals signed an
      informed consent form to the study protocol. Both experimental procedure and informed consent
      form of this study were in accordance with Guide for the Care and Use of Humans.

      All volunteers performed two half-marathons. In the first half-marathon, all participants
      were not supplemented. Dietary supplementation was initiated immediately after the first
      race. The volunteers were randomly separated into 3 groups: Soybean lecithin group; Fish
      oil-DHA group and Fish oil-EPA group. The volunteers ingested 3 g daily of SL or FO-DHA
      containing 1.5 g DHA and 0.3 g EPA or FO-EPA containing 1.6 g EPA and 0.3 g DHA (EPA:DHA =
      5.4:1) during 60 days.

      Experimental design:

      First race - not supplemented, blood samples were collected before (Phase I) and immediately
      after race (Phase II).

      Second race - dietary supplemented, blood samples were collected before (Phase III) and
      immediately after the race (Phase IV).

      Results were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) and Tukey post-hoc
      test. The statistical analysis of the half-marathon effect was performed using nonparametric
      t tests. Results were considered statistically significant for P&lt;0.05.
