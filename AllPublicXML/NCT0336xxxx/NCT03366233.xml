  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the changes in brain activation and cerebral blood flow due to mental fatigue in a
      placebo-controlled study. More specifically we want to assess whether brain activation
      [measured with Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional resonance imaging (fMRI)] is
      decreased during a Flanker task in a mentally fatigued state and whether this coincides with
      a decline in cognitive performance. In addition we also want to evaluate whether cerebral
      blood flow [measured with arterial spin labeled (ASL) fMRI] in a resting state is reduced
      when mentally fatigued.
