    <textblock>
      This clinical trial program was established according to the ethical principles of the
      Helsinki declaration and the GCP guiding principle, and a randomized grouping method was used
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Compound Methyl Salicylate Liniment in the treatment
      of acute and chronic soft tissue pain with a positive control drug, named Diclofenac Sodium
      Liniment.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled multicenter clinical trial for
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Compound Methyl Salicylate Liniment in the treatment of
      acute and chronic soft tissue pain with a positive control drug, named Diclofenac Sodium
      Liniment. A total of 216 participants with acute or chronic tissue pain participated in this
      clinical trial. The clinical trial cases were equally allocated to each research center, and
      each center had 30-35 cases. The proportion of patients with acute soft tissue pain and
      chronic soft tissue pain was 1:1, and the proportion of the experimental group and the
      control group was 1:1.The observation index include self pain scale record, tenderness scale
      and swelling, the evaluation period was 7 days.

      The statistical analysis plan is prepared by the unit responsible for the statistics, and is
      prepared before the formal analysis of the data, and is discussed and identified at the blind
      audit meeting with the major researchers. Statistical analysis will use SAS8.2 statistical
      analysis software for data processing, and other statistical analysis plan to make detailed
      provisions. All the statistical tests were two-sided, and the value of P was less than or
      equal to 0.05, which would be considered statistically significant. Measurement data use case
      number, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median and four sub spacing description,
      counting data and grade data use case number, percentage description.

    <description>Self pain scale record (VAS). A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.Operationally a VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end, the patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks, the amount of pain that a patient feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain.</description>
