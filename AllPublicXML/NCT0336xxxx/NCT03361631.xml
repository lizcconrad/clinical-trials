  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major concern in public health because of its high frequency and its negative
      consequences. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is present, regardless of age, in 50 to 75% of men
      with diabetes. It is related to endothelial dysfunction and a decrease in smooth muscle and
      nerve cells. In type 1 diabetic patients, ED is part of the chronic complications of
      microangiopathy. Current therapies are exclusively symptomatic with moderate efficacy,
      estimated between 44 and 56%. The administration of culture-grown medullary mesenchymal stem
      cells (MSCs) would be a curative treatment and have the advantage of being single injection.

      However, the data in the literature do not allow to define the optimal dose of MSC in this
      indication. In addition, the feasibility of this procedure is not known at present.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerance and the efficacy of intracavernous
      injection of autologous MSC (bone marrow-derived MSCs) administered in a 4-dose-escalating
      design in patients from 18 to 50 years old with complicated type 1 diabetes mellitus and
      erectile dysfunction.
