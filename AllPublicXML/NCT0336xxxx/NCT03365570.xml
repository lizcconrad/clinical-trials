    <textblock>
      According to WHO Report (2002), iron deficiency anemia was considered to be the most
      important contributing factor to the global burden of anemia. Children and women in
      reproductive ages are more at risk factor for developing iron deficiency anemia (Suneeta,
      2007).No previous study has been held to assess prevalence of oral manifestations of iron
      deficiency anemia as a hospital-based cross-sectional study on a sample of Egyptian patients
      in hematology department (no previous data recorded).

      Study Design: An observational (cross-sectional study) .Patients diagnosed with Iron
      deficiency anemia that attending at the Hematology department at El Qasr Al-Einy Cairo
      University Hospital will be enrolled in the study. The data collected through a questionnaire
      taken through an interview between the investigator and the patient.Clinical examination
      performed for oral mucosa, the duration of symptoms and type of lesions will be recorded.
      Patients' age, sex, duration of illness, type of anemia, location of any oral lesion or
      abnormality, history of drug and alcohol consumption, and presence or absence of dentures,
      will be recorded. All participants will be asked to sign a study-related informed consent.
      Oral manifestations of these patients will be evaluated by an oral medicine master student
      (the investigator).Patients diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia based on their blood tests
      ,All ages of Males and females will be included. But Patients suffering from any other
      systemic diseases known to influence oral and maxillofacial manifestations will be
      excluded.and Patients on drug therapy that may have oral mucosal manifestations also will be
      excluded.
