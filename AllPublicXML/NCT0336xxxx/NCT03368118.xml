      This study is an open-label study aiming at evaluating the long-term safety and the efficacy
      profile of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in subjects who have been previously
      enrolled in the ABX464-101 clinical study (induction study) and who are willing to continue
      their treatment.

      This study is an open-label study aiming at evaluating the long-term safety and the efficacy
      profile of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in subjects who have been previously
      enrolled in the ABX464-101 clinical study (induction study) and who are willing to continue
      their treatment.

      All subjects will receive ABX464 given at 50 mg o.d irrespective of their previous treatment
      received in the ABX464-101 study (i.e. ABX464 or Placebo).

      The actual treatment received by a subject throughout the previous study (ABX464-101) will
      not be known at the time the subjects enter this follow-up study. This treatment group will
      be communicated (throughout the investigators) to the subjects at the end of the ABX464-101
      study (planned in Q3/2018).

      The enrolment in this follow-up study will be based on the willingness of the subject to
      carry on his/her participation and also based on investigator's judgement.

      Subjects will be treated with ABX464 for an overall period of 12 months. Subjects will be
      followed up weekly during the first month, every two weeks during the second month and then
      on a monthly basis.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if ALL of the following
        criteria apply:

          -  Subjects previously enrolled in the ABX464-101 clinical study who have completed the
             initial 2-month treatment phase;

          -  Subjects able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures;

          -  Subjects with hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters as follows at the
             D56 visit of the ABX464-101 study:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g dL-1;

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750 mm-3;

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000 mm-3;

               -  Total serum creatinine ≤ 1.3 x ULN (upper limit of normal);

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL min-1 by the Cockcroft-Gault equation;

               -  Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN;

               -  Alkaline phosphatase, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 1.5 x ULN;

          -  Subjects should understand, sign and date the written voluntary informed consent form
             at the enrolment visit prior to any protocol-specific procedures being performed;

          -  Subjects should be affiliated to a social security regimen (for French sites only);

          -  Females and males receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a
             highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 3 months after end of
             study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 3 months prior
             to study participation. Women must be either postmenopausal (at least 12 months of
             amenorrhea), surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly
             effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the
             study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective
             methods of contraception include: true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD),
             intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), hormonal contraception (estrogen and
             progestogen or progestogen only) associated with inhibition of ovulation, bilateral
             tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. In each case of delayed
             menstrual period (over one month between menstruations) confirmation of absence of
             pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or
             irregular menstrual cycle.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following criterion should be checked at the time of screening. If this exclusion
        criterion applies, the subject will not be included in the study:

        ▪ Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the subject's
        safety or the adherence to the study protocol.
