  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 untreated IgG4 related disease (IgG4-RD) patients with mild symptom are enrolled in this
      study, and will be treated with one dose of diprospan,then take Iguratimod 25mg, Bid orally.
      Patient's peripheral blood will be collected at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks of follow up.
      The clinical efficacy will be evaluated by the IgG4-RD responder index, serum immunoglobulin,
      IgG4 and IgE, cytokines, and peripheral blood T cell and B cell sub-populations will be
      measured at baseline and follow up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoid is the recognized first-line medication for IgG4-RD, but it has many side
      effects. In order to avoid long time glucocorticoids intake, patients with mild disease will
      be treated with Iguratimod combined with one dose of diprospan. 30 untreated IgG4-RD patients
      with mild symptom will be enrolled in this study, and be treated with one dose of
      diprospan,then take Iguratimod 25mg, Bid orally. 5 ml of patients' peripheral blood will be
      collected at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks of follow up. At baseline and each follow-up,
      the clinical efficacy of treatment will be evaluated by IgG4-RD responder index, serum
      immunoglobulin, IgG4, immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum cytokines, such as interleukin 1, 6, and
      tumor necrosis factor, will be measured by ELISA, peripheral blood T cell sub-populations, B
      cell sub-populations and plasma cells will be measured by flow-cytometry.

    <description>Patients with mild symptom IgG4-RD are enrolled and inject one dosage of diprospan ,then take Iguratimod (T614), 25mg, Bid orally for three months. Firstly, we evaluate IgG4-RD responder index of patients at baseline and follow-up time.We collect the laboratory parameters and blood for lymphocytes subpopulations by flowcytometry.</description>
