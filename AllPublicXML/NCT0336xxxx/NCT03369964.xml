  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety, pharmacology, and activity of atezolizumab in
      combination with immunotherapy agents with or without an anti-CD20 agent (i.e., obinutuzumab)
      in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). The first
      immunotherapy molecule investigated will be emactuzumab (Arm A) in two combinations.
