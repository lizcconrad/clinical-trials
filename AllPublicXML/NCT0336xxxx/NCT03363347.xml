  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common neoplasia in the thyroid gland. The
      combination of surgery, followed by radioiodine therapy (RIT) and thyroid-stimulating hormone
      (TSH) suppressive therapy is usually a curative option for differentiated thyroid cancer
      (DTC). Although DTC has a good prognosis generally, it is problematic when dedifferentiation
      is suspected and radioiodine refractoriness presumed. One possible therapy option for
      redifferentiation is the pretreatment with retinoids. From 2008 to 2014 there were 13
      patients with PTC who were treated with retinoids after thyroidectomy before a further course
      of radioiodine. A recent study has shown that the efficacy of Selumetinib, another option for
      redifferentiation depends on the mutational status of the treated patient. In this
      retrospective study the investigators looked for a similar association between BRAF V600E and
      redifferentiation therapy with retinoids. As retinoids have fewer side effects compared to
      TKI, it is worth performing studies to assess the importance of genetic marker for the
      response and to estimate the chances of this specific patient collective. BRAF V600E seems to
      be associated with better long-term response after redifferentiation therapy with 13-cis RA
      in RAI-R PTC. Therefore, evaluation of BRAF mutational status prior to redifferentiation
      therapy could be beneficial for predicting response.

    <description>Redifferentiation therapy was performed using 13-cis RA (Isotretinoin, Roaccutan®) with a daily dose of orally 1,5mg/kg for up to two months. For assessment of clinical outcome of 13-cis retinoic acid treatment three parameters, tumor size, thyroglobulin levels and radioiodine uptake were considered in a graduated model.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parameter tumor size</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor size was evaluated form CT, MRI, or FDG-PET/CT imaging, comparing results before and after redifferentiation and RIT, results were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>

    <measure>Parameter thyroglobulin levels (serum Tg)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Non-stimulated serum Tg level (in ng/ml) before redifferentiation therapy was compared with the first Tg level after redifferentiation and RIT. A stable Tg level was defined as ≤10% difference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parameter radioiodine-uptake (RI-Uptake)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Recovery of RI-Uptake was evaluated from the post-therapy whole body scan in comparison to the lesions in CT, MRI, or FDG-PET/CT imaging before redifferentiation. Optimal uptake was defined as intensive accumulation of radioiodine in all tumor lesions. When not all lesions accumulate radioiodine or the signal was weak it was considered as suboptimal uptake.</description>

        Twelve patients with radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer were treated with
        retinoic acid before a further course of radioiodine therapy. One patient had to be
        excluded from the analysis due to missing data in this retrospective analysis. Furthermore,
        they were compared with twelve patients with radioiodine-sensitive thyroid cancer who were
        considered as cured after a maximum of two radioiodine therapies.
