  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will design and rigorously evaluate the efficacy of Project Legacy, a five week
      positive youth development intervention to decrease sexual risk for unintended pregnancies
      and STIs among youth experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness aged 14-19. This
      randomized control trial will compare Project Legacy to a usual services control.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a multi-site randomized group trial (RGT) cohort design to evaluate the
      Project Legacy intervention curriculum for reducing sexual risk behaviors among homeless
      youth age 14-19. CHLA project staff will work with 6 homeless youth serving sites in Southern
      California (Los Angeles, San Diego) to recruit 600 youth. Randomization to the intervention
      or control condition will occur at the group level and will be stratified by site. Field
      staff will survey all eligible homeless youth who provide consent to participate in the study
      at baseline (before randomization and implementation) and at 3 and 9 months post intervention
      (5-5.5 and 11-11.5 months post-baseline). The program group will receive an additional
      intervention-based survey immediately upon completion of the program.

      Youth in the control condition will receive the normal standard of care provided at the
      recruitment sites. Services available as standard of care at the recruitment sites include:
      medical care; mental health services; substance abuse services; educational, career, and
      vocational services. Intervention participants will not be excluded from receiving these
      services as well. Surveys will capture mental and physical health care service utilization
      and services to reduce substance use across both groups. The study team will monitor HIV and
      pregnancy prevention programming and other similar goal-planning/decision-making
      interventions offered to homeless youth in the study areas during the program implementation
      and follow-up period via interviews with site staff. The study team will include selected
      program exposure items on the follow up surveys to assess youth's self-reported exposure to
      similar goal-planning/decision-making and sexual health (pregnancy prevention and STI/HIV)
      education.

    <description>Social support is measured using The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, &amp; Farley, 1988). The scale has 12 items and 3 subscales (family, friends, and significant other) with 4 items each. Total scores range from 7 to 84 and each subscale score ranges from 4 to 28, with a higher score indicating greater social support. which are averaged together to get the total score. The total score is calculated by averaging the 12 items on the scale, and subscales are calculated by averaging the 4 items in each subscale.</description>

The scale contains 6 items, but based on feedback from piloting, 2 items were omitted (&quot;You will be killed by age 21&quot; and &quot;You will get HIV or AIDS&quot;) leaving 4 items in the final scale. The scale is calculated by averaging all items and ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater future orientation.</description>

    <description>Work-hope is a positive motivation state that is directed at work and work-related goals and is composed of the presence of work-related goals and both the agency and pathways for achieving those goals (Juntunen &amp; Wettersten, 2006). The Work-Hope Scale (Juntunen &amp; Wettersten, 2006) measures work-hope and consists of 28 items. Eight items from the scale are used in this study, which are averaged to get a total score ranging from 8 to 56, with higher scores indicating greater work-hope.</description>

    <description>Possible selves are the hypothetical images (the self one would like to attain, the self one would like to avoaid) critical for motivating action (Oyserman &amp; Bybee, 2002). Open-ended questions from Oyserman, Bybee, Terry, and Hart-Johnson (2004) are used to assess number of possible selves, number of achievement strategies, and self-regulation scores. Responses are content-coded and then scored with higher scores indicating greater self-regulation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevention and promotion orientation (Regulatory Focus) (current)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, 5 months post-baseline, and 11 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Regulatory Focus refers to the theory that people are motivated by two different types of regulation goals: promotion (eager pursuit of gains or successes) and prevention (striving to avoid negative outcomes) (Higgins, 1997). This study uses two scales to assess regulatory focus: (1) Strauman (2006) and (2) Lockwood, Jordan, and Kunda (2002).
The Strauman (2006) scale has 12 items, of which 8 are used in this study. There are two subscales, prevention and promotion, which are scored by averaging responses and range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating a greater prevention or promotion orientation.
The Lockwood, Jordan, and Kunda (2002) scale has 18 items, of which 10 are used in this study. There are two subscales, prevention and promotion, which are scored by adding responses and range from 5 to 54. The total score is calculated by subtracting the prevention score from the promotion score, with a higher score indicating a stronger promotion orientation.</description>

    <description>Project Legacy - Project Legacy is a 5-week, twice a week, 10 sessions small group intervention that encourages homeless and at-risk of homeless youth ages 14-19 to imagine a positive future and discuss how current risk behaviors can be a barrier to a successful adulthood. The program includes thinking about the future, the importance of positive social supports, short and long-term goal planning, and decision making. The program also includes life skills building, addressing past and current risk behaviors, linking to resources and navigating service systems, information on contraception and condoms, a healthy life plan and self-sufficiency. The 5 content core elements are the following:
1. Thinking about the future
2. Present actions to achieve future success
3. Safeguarding one's future
4. Creating a Healthy Life Plan
5. Navigating service systems</description>
