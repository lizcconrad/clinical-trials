    <textblock>
      This study is investigational and is not designed to treat cancer. In other words, the study
      drug, entinostat, is not being given to treat cancer. Instead, the study team is looking at
      the effects of entinostat on tumor tissue for research purposes only.

      Approximately 246,660 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Its
      detection and treatment remains a major concern in women's healthcare. In particular, TNBC
      accounts for approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers. Research into treatment for breast
      cancer relies more and more on understanding how the cancer cells act when they are exposed
      to an anti-cancer drug. How most cancer cells act when exposed to anti-cancer drugs and which
      patients as a result may benefit the most from these drugs is not well known. Additional
      studies are required to determine the cells' reactions. The purpose of part 1 of this study
      is to better understand how TNBC tumors react to one particular cancer drug, entinostat.
      Entinostat is currently being studied across multiple clinical trials for the treatment of
      breast cancer, other solid tumors and blood cancers. Entinostat is investigational and has
      not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of cancer.

      Studies have shown that a good way to determine how cancer acts when exposed to anti-cancer
      drugs is a short-term preoperative window study. In this type of study, subjects receive a
      study drug a couple of days before surgery. Leftover tissue from surgery is then used to
      determine some of the effects that a study drug may have on the tumor. In this study,
      subjects will receive two doses of entinostat prior to undergoing planned surgery. Leftover
      tissue from this surgery will then be used to determine the effects entinostat has on tumor
      cells. For example, the study team will examine if the types of genes and proteins that the
      tumor expresses as a result of entinostat exposure increases or decreases the likelihood that
      the tumor will not continue to grow. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical
      structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e.,
      eye color, height and sex). This study will focus on discovering how entinostat affects a
      wide variety of genes in tumor cells.

      Primary Objective and Endpoint To identify decrease in Ki-67 mRNA following treatment with
      entinostat across TNBC breast cancers.

      Secondary Objectives and Endpoints To identify messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene
      expression changes following treatment with entinostat, across TNBC.

      To evaluate changes in the proliferation signature by mRNA expression following treatment
      with entinostat across TNBC.

      To identify differential kinome activation before and after treatment with entinostat across
      TNBC

      To correlate mutation and/or copy number variations by whole exome sequencing (WES) with mRNA
      gene expression changes and reduction of proliferation signature following treatment with
      entinostat across TNBC.

      To correlate protein lysine hyperacetylation in peripheral blood and tumor from pre- and
      post-entinostat treated TNBCs.

      To explore molecular subtype, Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and other immune checkpoint
      molecule expression, immune gene and innate anti-programed cell death-1 resistance (IPRES)
      expression signatures and phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, including delineation
      of effector and regulatory T cells, and define T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire prior to and
      following entinostat treatment in TNBCs. We will also explore mutation and copy number
      variation status, and predicted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I neoantigen
      burden.

      To document safety of entinostat in patients with TNBC prior to their scheduled surgical
      resection per National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE
      v4.0).
