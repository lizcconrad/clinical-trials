  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe haemophilia B is a bleeding disorder where a protein made by the body to help make
      blood clot is either partly or completely missing. This protein is called a clotting factor;
      with severe haemophilia B, levels of clotting factor IX (FIX) (nine) are very low and
      affected individuals can suffer life threatening bleeding episodes. HB mainly affects boys
      and men (normally one in every 30,000 males). Current treatment for HB involves intravenous
      infusions of factor IX as regular treatment (Prophylaxis) or 'on demand'. On demand treatment
      is highly effective at stopping bleeding but cannot fully reverse long-term damage that
      follows after a bleed. Regular treatment can prevent bleeding, however can be invasive for
      patients and also expensive. This research study aims to test the safety and effectiveness of
      a gene therapy which produces Factor IX protein in the body. The gene will be given using an
      inactivated virus called &quot;the vector&quot; ( FLT180a), in a single infusion. The vector has been
      developed from a virus known as an adeno- associated virus, that has been changed so that it
      is unable to cause a viral infection in humans. This &quot;inactivated&quot; virus is further altered
      to carry the Factor IX gene and to make its way within liver cells where Factor IX protein is
      normally made.

      Up to three different doses of FLT180a will be tested, in up to 18 patients with severe
      haemophilia B. Patients will be recruited from haemophilia centres in the EU and US. Patients
      will be in the trial for approximately 40 weeks and will undergo procedures including
      physical examinations, bloods tests, ECGs and liver ultrasounds.
