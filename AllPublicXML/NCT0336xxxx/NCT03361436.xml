      This phase Ib trials studies the side effects and best dose of eribulin mesylate when given
      together with radiation therapy in treating patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma that
      can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of radiation and eribulin mesylate
      (eribulin) when used in combination for the preoperative treatment of retroperitoneal
      liposarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of a preoperative chemoradiation protocol for retroperitoneal
      liposarcoma.

      II. to assess the surgical outcomes of retroperitoneal liposarcoma resections after
      preoperative chemoradiation.

      III. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of eribulin in combination with radiation in
      subjects with retroperitoneal liposarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of eribulin mesylate.

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 and
      undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week beginning on day
      8 of course 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may undergo surgery within 3-10 weeks after
      radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 9 weeks, and
      then every 6 months for 10 years.
