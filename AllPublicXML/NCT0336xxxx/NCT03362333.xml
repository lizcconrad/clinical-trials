      This study examined the effects of pain neuroscience education plus exercise when compared
      with exercise only in university students with chronic idiopathic neck pain.

      University students with chronic neck pain were randomly allocated to receive pain
      neuroscience education and exercise or exercise only and assessed at baseline, after the
      intervention and at 3 months follow up. Outcome variables were pain intensity (primary
      outcome), disability, fear of movement, catastrophizing, knowledge of pain neurophysiology,
      pressure pain thresholds and neck and scapular muscle endurance.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants could enter the study if they had chronic idiopathic neck pain, defined
             as pain felt in the neck at least once a week in the previous 3 months and for which
             no cause had been established. Furthermore, they were required to have a minimum pain
             intensity in the previous week of 2 in the visual analogue scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants were excluded if they had had physiotherapy for their neck pain in the 6
             months previous to the study, if they had rheumatic, nervous, cardiac and/or
             respiratory pathology that could prevent or make it difficult to do the exercises.
             Exclusion criteria were ascertained by self-report.
