  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SME (Sharing, Mind, Enjoyment) App, A Pilot Project is part of the Community-based Mental
      Wellness Project for Adolescents and Adults, which aims at promoting sharing, mind and
      enjoyment and enhancing mental wellbeing. The Mental Wellness Project is financially
      supported by the Health Care and Promotion Fund from Food and Health Bureau and led by the
      School of Public Health, University of Hong Kong (HKU). This project primarily aims to
      promote the SME related behaviors of adolescents through the App. The evaluation will be
      conducted during the programme implementation stage. The effectiveness of the intervention,
      as well as the level of participation and ratings for the intervention, will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized controlled trial design was adopted. The major subjects of SME (Sharing,
      Mind, Enjoyment) App Pilot Project RCT Study are 300-500 middle school students. Two schools
      will be recruited and randomized to each group. Schools will either be assigned to app
      intervention group or waitlist control group. The students in the intervention group will use
      the App for one month. Daily and Weekly tasks related to SME will be assigned through the
      App, and information related to mental health will be provided. The waitlist control group
      will be able to use the App after we finish all the assessments.

      There will then be 4 assessments (pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, one month
      and three months after) to evaluate the effects of the intervention programme. In the
      assessments, students will be asked to complete a questionnaire to measure the changes in SME
      (sharing, mind and enjoyment) related behaviors, changes of knowledge and attitude towards
      the anxiety disorder, changes of happiness and well-being.

    <description>The features in the App could be used in the future by linking with some platforms / existing services so that more SME messages can be sent to the students for sharing. One school workshop will be held to promote SME and introduce the function of SME App for students to download and use immediately to connect family members.
SME App promotes SME via:
Express gratitude to family members (sharing)
Deliver positive messages regularly (mind)
Record physical and other joyful activities (enjoyment)
Increase knowledge and understanding of adolescent mental health problem (in particular the anxiety disorders)</description>
