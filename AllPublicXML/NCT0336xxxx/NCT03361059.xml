      Introduction: the prevalence of falls in adults aged 65 years or older living in the
      community is 30%, being the second cause of accidental fatal injury and the fifth cause of
      death. About 20 to 30% of falls result in injuries: 10% constitute serious injuries, from
      which 5% are fractures. As a result, older adults decrease their mobility, are afraid of
      falling depressed and socially isolated, increasing the risk of later falls, death and health
      costs. Falls and their consequences can be prevented, so knowing and assessing the
      demographic, medical, self-perceived and functional characteristics constitutes an important
      information for health professionals. Given the high rate (29.59%) of older adults treated at
      the Physical Therapy outpatient consult of the &quot;Hospital Francisco Santojanni&quot; and the
      relevance of falls in this population, it is convenient to take a behavior and start by
      knowing their risk characteristics.

      Objectives: to determine the incidence of falls of adults aged 65 years and older, seen in
      the Physical Therapy outpatient consult of the &quot;Hospital Francisco Santojanni&quot;; to describe
      the characteristics of these population and to identify the potential risk-of-falling
      factors.

      Subjects and Methods: observational, prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Demographic (age
      and sex), medical (history of falls, visual alterations, medication and walking aids),
      self-perceived (fear of falling and instability perception) and functional characteristics
      (Test of Timed up and Go, Dynamic Index of gait and balance tests) will be evaluated in those
      patients of 65 years or more who initiate physical treatment in the outpatient consult of the
      of the &quot;Hospital Francisco Santojanni&quot; &quot;Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, from March 2017 to
      February 2018, with a follow-up of 6 months until August 2018, to verify the development of
      the fall event

    <description>an event that results in a change of body position that forces a person to make contact with the ground or other support surface at a lower level, unintentionally and unexpectedly, without being the consequence of an important intrinsic event (such as loss of consciousness, sudden onset of paralysis or epileptic seizure), or unavoidable external danger (such as the collapse of a chair or violent blow). The outcome variable will be measured by a phone call.</description>
