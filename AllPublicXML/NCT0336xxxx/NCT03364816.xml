  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different types of cervical disc prosthesis (Prodisc-C, Mobi-C
      and Prestige-LP) in the treatment of cervical spondylosis.

      A cohort, retrospective analysis will be performed of 150 patients who were in implementation
      of artificial disc replacement in our department from 2008 to 2012 and accepted a regular
      postoperatively follow-up up to 5 years, the sample will be divided into 3 groups according
      to prosthesis and 50 people in each group. The outcome will be measured among 3 groups
      respectively on the operation (such as operation time, intraoperative bleeding.),
      postoperative complications (such as prosthesis sinking, displacement and prolapse, adjacent
      segments degeneration and heterotopic ossification), photographic indicators and functional
      efficacy analysis and then a comparison for self-contrast pre- and post-operatively.
