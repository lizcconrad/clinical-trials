  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence suggesting that olive oil may have a positive impact on
      conditions involving cognitive deficits, such as MCI and AD. More specifically, these
      beneficial effects are mostly attributed to some phenolic compounds in olive oil, such as
      oleocanthal, oleuropein and ligstroside. Oleocanthal is deeper studied than the rest of olive
      oil phenol components and it shows promising results in neuroprotection against AD through
      various suggested mechanisms, such as the enhancement of amyloid-beta clearance in the brain
      and the inhibition of neurofibrillary tangles formation. For this reason, it would be
      interesting to study the effects of freshly-pressed extra virgin olive oil, as it is known
      that it contains oleocanthal in higher concentrations than the normal extra virgin olive oil.
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the beneficial effect of extra virgin olive oil in
      comparison to freshly-pressed extra virgin olive oil on patients diagnosed with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI).

      OBJECTIVES OF THE TRIAL

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To investigate the efficacy of freshly pressed EVOO as a disease course modifying
           treatment for mild cognitive impairment in a phase III double-blind placebo-controlled
           study.

        -  To investigate the effects in objective measurements in patients with mild cognitive
           impairment.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a Greek, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study group of
      EVOO compared with placebo. Qualifying patients will be randomly assigned to receive 50mL of
      freshly-pressed EVOO or placebo (EVOO) or mediterranean dietary protocol on a daily basis for
      24 months. Patients undergo assessments at baseline,12 and 24 months +/- 7 days after
      beginning treatment.

      Duration The total study duration will be 30 months. Patients will receive study medication
      for 24 months.

      Number of Subjects 150 subjects total will be enrolled. ; 50 in the experimental group
      (freshly pressed EVOO); 50 in the Control Group 1(EVOO) and 50 in control Group 2(same
      dietary habits-mediterranean dietary protocol).

      Patient Eligibility Screening Form (ESF)

      An eligibility form documenting the patient's fulfillment of the entry criteria will be
      completed by the assessor. The following information will be included in the ESF:

        -  Patient identification: Initials (First initial of first name and First initial of
           surname), date of birth and Patient Identification Number.

        -  Eligibility Screening; Checklist of inclusion and exclusion criteria

        -  Eligibility Statement; for patients found to be ineligible, the reason for ineligibility
           must be stated

        -  Written informed consent will be obtained from the subject . The informed consent form
           must be co-signed by the physician. The nature of the study and the potential risks
           associated with the trial will be explained to all subject candidates and their
           responsible informants.

        -  Signature and date: the ESF may be completed by an assessor but it is required that the
           principal investigator/study clinician sign and date the ESF to verify eligibility of
           the patient for inclusion.
