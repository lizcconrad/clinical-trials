  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyaline membrane disease, now commonly called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and
      feeding intolerance, which can lead to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), are two key
      morbidities found in premature neonates which resulted in high mortality rate in Indonesia.
      Cochrane meta-analysis proved that antenatal steroid therapy can reduce the morbidity and
      mortality rate of premature neonates. But there is still different outcomes and severity of
      disease in preterm newborn receiving the same dose of antenatal steroid therapy. This raises
      questions whether there are other factors influencing the development and maturity of lung
      and gut in preterm newborn, aside from steroid therapy. Vitamin A, D and zinc are already
      known for their function in fetal lung and gut development. To our best of knowledge, no
      study has evaluated the effect of these vitamins levels on HMD and feeding intolerance in
      premature neonates. Therefore, the aim of this study want to evaluate the effect of antenatal
      steroid therapy versus co-administered β-carotene, vitamin D3, zinc and antenatal steroid
      therapy on the presence and severity of HMD and feeding intolerance in premature neonates.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial and held in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital.

      Pregnant women 28-34 weeks of gestational age, who fulfill the inclusion criteria, divide
      into two groups. Subjects from both groups receive the hospital protocol of preterm birth, 4
      doses of 6 mg of dexamethasone, intravenous 12 hours apart to support lung maturation.
      Subjects in intervention group receive oral single-dose beta-carotene 25,000 IU, oral
      single-dose vitamin D3 50,000 IU and oral zinc 50 mg/day for 3 days. The maternal dan cord
      blood sample are obtained for zinc, vitamin A and 25(OH)D levels before and after
      intervention. After the premature neonates was born, observation will be done for maximum
      period of 4 weeks. The presence and severity of HMD and feeding intolerance or NEC will be
      recorded. Neonates showing any signs of HMD and/or abdominal distension will need to undergo
      additional chest/abdominal x-ray procedures.

    <intervention_model_description>The research will be held in Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital. Each participant of each group will be given dexamethasone 2x6 mg intravenous for 2 days which aims to support lung maturation followed by planned delivery within 1 week due to indication of maternal or fetal. The maternal dan cord blood sample are obtained for zinc, vitamin A and 25(OH)D levels examinations. Randomly, subjects will be divided into 2 groups which are group who is given the oral beta-carotene 25,000 IU, oral vitamin D3 50,000 IU and oral zinc 50 mg/day for 3 days, and group who is not given the intervention. After the premature neonates was born, observation will be done for maximum period of 4 weeks. The presence and severity of HMD and feeding intolerance or NEC will be recorded.</intervention_model_description>
