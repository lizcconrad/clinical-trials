      This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive - behavioral
      therapy for the control of psychopathological stress and the disease of people with Retinitis
      Pigmentosa (RP) on aspects such as vulnerability to stress, perceived stress,
      psychopathological state, general self-efficacy, resilience, satisfaction with social support
      and visual field. This study has two groups: 1) cognitive - behavioral therapy group, and 2)
      Standard intervention or control group. The two interventions will be conducted for 3 months
      (with a total of 12 sessions), one session per week, with a duration of 90 minutes per
