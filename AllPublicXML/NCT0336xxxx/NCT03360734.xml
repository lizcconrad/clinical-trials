  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase Ib study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of a combined therapy with Tomuzotuximab and Gatipotuzumab in patients with solid
      tumors expressing EGFR, for whom no standard treatment is available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tomuzotuximab (CetuGEX®) is an improved second-generation anti-EGFR antibody that
      specifically binds to EGFR and acts as a competitive antagonist at the ligand binding site of
      EGFR.

      Gatipotuzumab (PankoMab-GEX®) is a novel glyco-engineered humanized monoclonal antibody,
      which recognizes the tumor-specific epitope of mucin-1 (TA-MUC1). Gatipotuzumab targets and
      binds to the TA-MUC1 epitopes on the surface of tumor cells, which may potentially activate
      the immune system to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the TA
      MUC1 expressing tumor cells.

      Based on the compelling preclinical evidence suggesting a complex interaction between EGFR
      and TA-MUC1 expressed on the tumor cell surface in driving cancerogenesis, this study aims to
      assess the tolerability, safety and preliminary activity of targeting EGFR and TA-MUC1 with
      glyco-engineered antibodies.

      The initial recruitment will be staggered to allow assessment of the tolerability of the
      initial dose. In order to continue enrollment, the number of DLTs will be evaluated in the
      first 6 patients. If observed number of DLTs is &lt;2, the dose will remain unchanged and
      further patients will be recruited at this dose level. Otherwise the step-wise dose reduction
      approach will apply.
