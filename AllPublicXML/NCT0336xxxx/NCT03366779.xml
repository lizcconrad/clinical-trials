  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center study to monitor the early safety and performance
      of one iteration of the Barricaid Anular Closure Device (ACD) - 6mm anchor width, when used
      as an adjunct to limited discectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned to collect information on use of the Barricaid ACD with an anchor width
      of 6mm. Other iterations of the device are made with an 8mm wide anchor. The narrower anchor
      was designed to optimize surgeon visualization during implantation, is CE-marked, and has
      undergone all appropriate rigorous testing prior to release. Safety will be evaluated to
      demonstrate acceptable levels of device-related and procedure-related complications. This
      limited market release will allow its performance to be evaluated by examining the effects on
      reoperation, device deficiencies, patient pain scores and disability after discectomy with
      ACD.
