      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of alemtuzumab (IV) in pediatric patients
      from 10 to &lt;18 years of age with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) who have
      disease activity on prior Disease Modifying Therapy (DMT).

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), anti-drug antibody (ADA)
      formation, and potential effects of alemtuzumab on other multiple sclerosis (MS) disease
      characteristics such as cognition and quality of life (QoL).

             Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG) criteria for pediatric Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and the

          -  At least 1 of the following:

               -  1 new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesion or gadolinium enhancing lesion* while

             deficiency, clotting factor deficiency).

          -  Prior history of invasive fungal infections.

          -  Active infection, eg, deep-tissue infection, that the Investigator considers
             sufficiently serious to preclude study participation.

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, patient is at high risk for infection (eg, indwelling
             catheter, dysphagia with aspiration, decubitus ulcer, history of prior aspiration
             pneumonia or recurrent urinary tract infection).
