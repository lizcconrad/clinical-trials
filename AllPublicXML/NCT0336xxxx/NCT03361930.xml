  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if ankle-foot orthoses affect changes in muscle
      activity of children with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy during walking.

      To minimize investigator variability, the same orthotist CO, clinical gait analyst GA and
      physiotherapist PT will perform their designated functions for all participants.

      Each subject will be required to attend three appointments.

      First appointment: CO takes a lower leg cast of the involved side; the cast is taken with the
      ankle and hindfoot corrected to neutral position.

      Second appointment: CO fits the tone-reducing ankle-foot orthosis which entails trimming the
      device to fit footwear, checking the orthotic device restricts plantarflexion and ensuring
      comfortable and functional fit. The device is modified with holes for electrode placement at
      locations for tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius identified by PT.

      The child receives the tone-reducing ankle-foot orthosis and is instructed to use this
      orthotic device on a daily basis for the next four weeks to grow accustomed to the
      tone-reducing stimuli which may require some acclimatization.

      Third appointment: A clinical examination is conducted by PT. Surface gel electrodes are then
      attached while the participant is instructed in individual muscle activation tests; SENIAM
      guidelines will be followed for electrode placement and skin preparation, aside from
      hamstrings and rectus femoris which will follow amended instructions in line with the
      scientific literature.

      GA quality checks the raw electromyography (EMG) signals by visual inspection during the
      isolated muscle activation tests and during a dynamic trial for movement artefacts,
      cross-talk, baseline drift and good noise-to-signal ratio.

      Reflective markers are then applied in accordance with Plug-in Gait lower body model by PT to
      collect kinematic and kinetic data.

      A resting trial is collected to establish the baseline activity level for each muscle.

      The participant is instructed to walk at a self-selected speed along the walkway. Dynamic
      trials continue until two clean strikes to the middle force plate are collected for the
      involved leg. Barefoot data is collected first while any additional modifications necessary
      for electrode placement are made to the ankle-foot orthoses. The order of the orthotic
      conditions is randomized.

      Data will be recorded confidentially using reference codes for participants and stored on a
      secure server with designated space allocated by the hospital.

    <description>Linear electromyography profiles of muscle activity (high-pass filtered, rectified and low-pass enveloped) for medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, medial hamstrings, rectus femoris and vastus lateralis during walking. For each condition, gait cycles from two trials will be averaged. Signals will be synchronized to the gait cycle by foot contact/foot off events and normalized to max dynamic peak. On/off times will be defined as a percentage of max dynamic peak.</description>

    <description>Two custom ankle-foot orthoses for the involved lower leg; cast, rectified and fitted by same certified orthotist to reduce clinician variability.
The cast is rectified according to the specifications of Hylton (1987) to produce tone-reducing features in the foot plate; the tone-reducing ankle-foot orthosis is manufactured on this cast. The orthotist then remodels the cast with a flat foot plate; the plain ankle-foot orthosis is then manufactured.</description>
