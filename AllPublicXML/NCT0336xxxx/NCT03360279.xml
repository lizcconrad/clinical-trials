  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent stenosis in hemodialysis access graft (AVG) is difficult to treat. For recurrent
      stenosis in the anastomotic junction can be treated by stent graft to improve long-term
      patency. However, there is no data regarding treatment of stent graft restenosis in AVG. This
      randomized trial is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of drug-coated balloon (DCB)
      versus regular balloon in AVG stent graft restenosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic arteriovenous hemodialysis access graft (AVG) has high incidences of venous
      anastomotic stenosis and access failure. A stent graft can be used in AVG with recurrent
      venous anastomotic stenosis to improve long-term patency rate. However, after stent graft
      implementation, the effective treatment for restenosis in a stent graft is still unknown.
      This randomized trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drug-coated balloon
      versus regular balloon for in-stent restenosis in stent graft. The investigators plan to
      enroll 40 patients who presented with prosthetic AVG in-stent restenosis, and then to
      evaluate the restenosis lesions by intravascular ultrasound. Patients will be randomized into
      two groups of treatment: drug-coated balloon angioplasty or regular balloon angioplasty.
