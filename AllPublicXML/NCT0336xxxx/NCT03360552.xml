  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a general practitioner
      (MG) management strategy guided by a multidimensional evaluation on the multidimensional
      score of fragility of patients with mild to moderately severe dementia, compared to those
      currently implemented (without the provision of such an assessment). The measurement of the
      respective effectiveness of the two types of care in primary care will itself be based on a
      multidimensional evaluation performed independently in the memory center having established
      the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The secondary objectives are the evaluation of the
      impact of the strategy on the functional abilities of patients, the incidence of geriatric
      syndromes, cognitive functions, quality of life of the patient and the burden of the primary
      caregiver. The efficiency of the strategy will be assessed through a cost-effectiveness
      analysis. A survey of opinions will also be conducted among primary health care providers,
      carers and CMs on the implemented system.
