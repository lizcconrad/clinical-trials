  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of hip replacement surgery is to re-establish the physiological hip function and to
      obtain a stable fixation between the prosthetic components and the native bone. Commonly, the
      fixation is obtained by bone ingrowth between the prosthesis and the native bone. Thus, the
      quality of the patient's bone stock is essential to achieve this aim. However, several
      clinical conditions may impair the bone stock; therefore, in these cases bone grafts are
      necessary to improve the prosthetic fixation. The gold standard is represented by autologous
      bone grafts (from iliac crest or from acetabular bone chips) or allogeneic bone grafts from
      cadaveric femoral heads. Nevertheless, the osteogenic potential of multipotent cells derived
      from different anatomical regions has never been examined.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to isolate multipotent cells from acetabular or femoral bone
      chips and from bone marrow aspirate of the same patient and to compare their osteogenic
      potential. The results of this study may reveal differences, which may have a clinical
      relevance for hip replacement surgery.
