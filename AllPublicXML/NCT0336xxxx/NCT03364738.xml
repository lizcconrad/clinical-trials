  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with hypoparathyroidism who complete the SHP634-101 study
      (PARALLAX Study). The purpose of this study is to see if rhPTH(1-84) is safe and effective in
      adults with hypoparathyroidism who previously participated in the SHP634-101 study. All
      participants enrolled in this study will receive rhPTH(1-84) once-daily for 52 weeks via an
      injection.

      Patients who complete the SHP634-101 study will have the option to screen for this extension
      study.

    <description>Participants will receive rhPTH(1-84) subcutaneous (SC) injection in the thigh (alternate thigh every day) once daily (QD) of an escalating dose from 50 microgram (mcg) to a maximum of 100 mcg increased in increments of 25 mcg no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks, with the goal of achieving or maintaining albumin-corrected serum calcium (ACSC) levels in the range of 2-2.25 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (8.0-9.0 milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]). Once a participant achieves a stable ACSC (2-2.25 mmol/L [8.0-9.0mg/dL]) and has minimized supplement doses, they will be maintained at that dose of rhPTH(1-84). If ACSC is greater than (&gt;) 2.25 mmol/L (&gt;9.0 mg/dL), a starting dose of 25 mcg will be administered.</description>
