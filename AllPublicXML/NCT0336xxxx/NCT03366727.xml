  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For years, first-line treatment of AVFs stenoses has been percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty. However, restenosis and reintervention rates remain incredibly high and occur,
      according to recent studies, in up to 60% and 70% of patients at 6 and 12 months,
      respectively. Drug-coated balloons delivering paclitaxel at the angioplasty site have proved
      their superiority in the treatment of coronary and peripheral arterial stenoses. Paclitaxel
      reduces neointimal hyperplasia and drug-coated balloons,therefore, it represents an
      attractive option for AVF stenoses. This trial is aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of DCB in treating AVF stenosis in chinese population.
