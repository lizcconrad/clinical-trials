      Evaluation of local control in buccinator muscle excision with the skin versus buccinator
      muscle excision without the skin in buccal squamous cell carcinoma: A randomized clinical
      trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative Multi Slice CT scan or MRI carried out for evaluation the lymph node of the
      neck. Also, ultrasound carried out for measuring the depth of invasion of the tumour in the
      cheek (The invasion in the buccinator muscle).

        -  Under general anaesthesia, the buccal squamous cell carcinoma which invaded the
           buccinator muscle will be excised with the skin of the cheek. This will be done by a
           safety margins in the soft tissue and the mandible may be resected according to the plan
           and the invasion of the tumour.

        -  A neck dissection will be done in all cases of negative or positive neck lymph node.

        -  Reconstruction of the soft tissue will be done immediately by a major pectorals flap
           with the skin, also bony reconstruction may be done by a reconstructed plate at the time
           of surgery then the patients will be prepared for bone graft in another surgery.
