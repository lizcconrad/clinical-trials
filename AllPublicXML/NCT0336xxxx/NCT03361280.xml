  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eight maintenance hemodialysis patients are given one of four beta blocker drugs (atenolol,
      bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol) three hours prior to a hemodialysis session. Blood
      samples and spent dialysate are collected during dialysis. On separate dialysis sessions,
      patients received the other study drugs until they have taken each of the four study drugs.
      Dialytic clearance is calculated.
