  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cell therapy has been confirmed
      effective for relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. However, its ability to keep patients
      in maintained remission is limited. In order to extend the remission time, investigators
      transfer patients who obtain remission through CAR-T therapy to hematological stem cell
      therapy (HSCT). The study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T therapy
      bridging to HSCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to keep patients in remissions as long as possible, patients who achieve remissions
      through CAR-T therapy will be transferred to HSCT if there are no contraindications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is pathologically and histologically confirmed as CD19 + B cell tumors,
             and has no effective treatment options currently, such as chemotherapy or autologous
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT); or patients voluntarily choose
             CD19 CAR-T cells as a first treatment;

          2. B cell hematological malignancies include the following three categories:

               -  B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL);

               -  Indolent B-cell lymphoma (CLL, FL, MZL, LPL);

               -  Aggressive B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, BL, MCL);

          3. &lt; 60 years old;
