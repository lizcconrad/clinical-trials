  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress-related mental disorders are today the leading cause of long-term sick leave in
      Sweden, and a large part of this increase is due to Clinical burnout, in Sweden called
      &quot;Exhaustion disorder&quot; (ED). Even though clinical guidelines recommend multi-professional
      rehabilitation (MPR) for ED, few studies have evaluated the effects of these treatment
      programs in clinical practice. This large-scale open clinical trial investigates whether MPR
      for ED seems to alleviate symptoms of ED and if it results in return-to-work.

      This study is carried out at two specialized stress rehabilitation centers in Stockholm. All
      patients included in the clinics stress rehabilitation program are asked to participate in
      the study and are recruited consecutively from October 2017 throughout December 2018. An
      estimate of 400 patients will be included. The treatment program is a 24-week
      Multiprofessional standardized CBT-rehabilitation consisting of a nine-session CBT group
      treatment (stress management) followed by a seven-session group treatment in applied
      relaxation. Parallel to the group treatments patients receives nine sessions of individual
      CBT, three visits to an MD (for medication, follow-up, and sick-listing), two individual
      sessions to a physiotherapist and a three session-exercise group. Also, vocational measures
      are taken through rehabilitation meetings together with the patient's employer (if an
      employer exists). Primary treatment outcomes will be return-to-work (RTW) and symptoms of ED,
      anxiety, and depression. Secondary treatment outcomes will be quality of life, pathological
      worry, psychological flexibility, clinical perfectionism, insomnia, burnout, and symptoms.
      Predictors of symptom development and RTW will be explored. Also, comorbidity of chronic
      pain, negative effects of psychotherapy and treatment credibility will be investigated.
