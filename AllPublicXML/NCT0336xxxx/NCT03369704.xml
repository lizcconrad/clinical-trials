    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab compared
      with placebo, on top of SoC (anti-histamine and nasal corticosteroid) in adult and adolescent
      patients with severe Japanese cedar pollinosis, whose symptoms were inadequately controlled
      despite the current recommended therapies (nasal corticosteroids plus one or more medications
      out of anti-histamine, leukotriene receptor antagonist, or prostaglandin D2/thromboxane A2
      receptor antagonist) in the previous 2 Japanese cedar pollen seasons.

             idiopathic rhinitis).

          -  With an active nose disease other than allergic rhinitis (e.g., acute or chronic
             rhinosinusitis or deflected septum) which is expected to affect the evaluation of
             efficacy of the study drug judged by the investigator.

          -  With elevated serum IgE levels for reasons other than allergy (e.g., parasite
             infections, hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome or clinical
             allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis).

          -  With a severe asthma treated with high dose inhaled corticosteroid (≥ 800 μg/day
             fluticasone propionate or an equivalent for aged ≥ 16 to &lt;75 years, &gt; 200 μg/day for
             aged ≥ 12 to &lt;16 years).

          -  Who are receiving operative treatment for allergic rhinitis (e.g., electrocoagulation,
             laser surgery, 80% trichloroacetic acid chemo-surgery, inferior turbinectomy or
