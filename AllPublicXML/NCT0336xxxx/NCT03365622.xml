  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether intravenous acetaminophen compared to enteric
      acetaminophen offers increased efficacy in patients who are scheduled for laparoscopic donor
      nephrectomy and for patients scheduled for robot-assisted, laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal
      cancer at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The standard surgical and
      post-operative care, including post-operative pain management will not be altered.

    <time_frame>20-24 hours post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The inspiratory capacity will be presented as a percentage of the subject's baseline (pre-operative) inspiratory capacity.Inspiratory capacity is measured using a Voldyne 5000 incentive spirometer (Hudson RCI, Teleflex Medical). Inspiratory capacity will be recorded pre-operatively and at the time of pain assessments (1-2 hours and 20-24 hours post-operatively). Inspiratory capacity will recorded in milliliters to the nearest 250 cc mark on the incentive spirometer. Proper use of the incentive spirometer will be demonstrated to the patient in the pre-anesthesia holding area by a study investigator</description>
