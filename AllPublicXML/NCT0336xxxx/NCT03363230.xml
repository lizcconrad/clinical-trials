    <textblock>
      Mindfulness training has proven to be a reliable treatment for patients with Borderline
      Personality Disorder (BPD).The present randomized-controlled study examines the effects of
      mindfulness training on emotion regulation and impulsitivy. In addition, fMRI data was
      collected pre and post intervention. 70 patients with BPD diagnosis were randomized to either
      mindfulness or interpersonal effectiveness skills training. Assessments were conucted
      pre-and-post-intervention.
