      The goal of the PREDICT trial is to apply a systems-biology approach to enable precision
      diagnostics for the key immunologic outcomes post-transplant. This approach will deepen the
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the most deadly post-transplant
      complications, and serve as a critical platform upon which to design evidence-based treatment
      paradigms for transplant patients.

      This research study will examine the immunology of different gastrointestinal disturbances
      such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), and Functional
      Gastrointestinal Disorder (FGID). The Investigators want to know why and how people develop
      these gastrointestinal disturbances using blood and tissue samples in order to better predict
      and treat the disease process.

      The Investigators hypothesize that they can define the mechanisms responsible for
      gastrointestinal (GI) acute GVHD and differentiate it from other inflammatory disorders by
      using advanced immunologic analysis.

      The Investigators further hypothesize that longitudinal systems-based immunologic analysis
      will enable the patient-specific determination of the molecular evolution of acute and
      chronic GVHD as well post-transplant defects in protective immunity, and determine which
      pathways, when perturbed, can cause clinical disease. The discovery of these pathways will
      lead to improved diagnostic, prognostic and treatment approaches, and to personalized
      therapeutic decision-making for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HCT).

      1. Hypotheses and Aims

           Hypotheses:

           Hypothesis #1: The Investigators hypothesize that they can define the molecular
           mechanisms responsible for gastrointestinal (GI) acute GVHD and differentiate it from
           other inflammatory disorders by using advanced immunologic analysis including flow
           cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and transcriptomics.

           Hypothesis #2: The Investigators further hypothesize that longitudinal systems-based
           immunologic analysis will enable the patient-specific determination of the molecular
           evolution of acute and chronic GVHD as well post-transplant defects in protective
           immunity, and determine which pathways, when perturbed, can cause clinical disease. The
           discovery of these pathways will lead to improved diagnostic, prognostic and treatment
           approaches, and to personalized therapeutic decision-making for patients undergoing
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).

           Specific Aim #1: To identify the mechanisms specific for GI acute GVHD and delineate it
           from other inflammatory disorders.

           Objective 1: Perform flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and whole transcriptome
           analysis on T cells purified from GI tissue samples taken from patients who undergo
           endoscopy for presumed GI GVHD, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and functional
           gastrointestinal disease (FGID).

           Objective 2: Perform flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and transcriptome analysis on T
           cells from the peripheral blood at the time of endoscopy in patients diagnosed with GI
           GVHD, IBD, and FGID.

           Specific Aim #2: Characterize the immunologic dysregulation responsible for acute GVHD,
           chronic GVHD and defects in protective immunity in patients undergoing HCT.

           Objective 1: Perform longitudinal immune analysis on T cells and B cells purified from
           patients undergoing allogeneic HCT who develop acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, and
           infectious complications post-transplant and compare to patients without these
           complications.

           Objective 2: Perform microbiome analysis longitudinally in patients undergoing HCT to
           determine the impact of microbiome alterations in the development of post-transplant
           complications.

        2. Background and Significance

      Allogeneic HCT is an effective treatment for patients with malignant and non-malignant
      hematologic diseases. However, this treatment is complicated with high rates of morbidity and
      mortality limiting its broader application. The leading causes of post-transplant morbidity
      and mortality include acute and chronic GVHD, relapse and infectious disease. The goal of the
      PREDICT trial is to apply a systems approach to understanding the mechanisms driving these
      complications, such that evidence-based treatment strategies can be devised.

      Acute GVHD: Acute GVHD is mediated by donor-derived allo-reactive T cells becoming activated
      and resulting in cytotoxicity against host cells as well as cytokine-mediated tissue damage.
      Moderate to severe acute GVHD can occur in up to 60% of patients undergoing HCT and the more
      severe forms have been associated with mortality rates &gt;50%. The most common sites of the
      immune-mediated tissue damage are the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI GVHD
      occurs in 40-50% of HCT patients and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality from this
      disease.

      The diagnosis of GI GVHD is derived from clinical and histopathological findings. GVHD can
      occur in both the upper and lower GI tract leading to symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain,
      nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia. Histopathological diagnostic criteria for GI GVHD includes
      identification of crypt cell apoptosis, crypt destruction and/or mucosa denudation.
      Unfortunately, the severity of GVHD on histology is poorly correlated with the clinical
      course of the disease.

      While GI GVHD is a common complication following HCT there remain many barriers to its
      consistent and accurate diagnosis. First, diagnosis is dependent on appropriate tissue
      sampling. Visible lesions are frequently absent8 and endoscopic findings can be diffuse and
      nonspecific. There is also no consensus on the optimal location of the GI tract for biopsies
      or number of biopsies needed to secure a diagnosis. There is also frequent discordance
      between biopsy specimens from the upper and lower GI tract. Second, patients presenting early
      in the course of GVHD may have subtle histopathological findings that may be missed or not
      yet present. At the onset of GVHD few apoptotic cells may be seen and crypt loss and mucosal
      damage may yet to have occured. Lastly, there are also confounding factors that can lead to
      the misdiagnosis of GVHD that include conditioning regimen related toxicity, concomitant
      infections, and medications which can all cause focal inflammation of the GI tract. In the
      first 20 days following a myeloablative conditioning regimen diffuse apoptosis can be seen
      mimicking acute GVHD10. Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus infections can also have
      similar clinical and histopathological presentations. Use of mycophenolate mofetil and proton
      pump inhibitors have also been found associated with GI tract apoptosis that can be
      misdiagnosed as GVHD. All of these factors lead to the high degree of inter-observer
      variability in the histological diagnosis of GVHD and poor correlation with the clinical
      observations, illustrating the need for more sensitive and specific methods of diagnosis.

      There have been recent advances in the identification of biomarkers in GVHD that have
      diagnostic and prognostic significance. IL-8, IL-2 receptor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor
      receptor-1 (TNF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), elafin, regenerating islet-derived
      3-alpha (reg-3alpha), TIM3, IL-6, ST2, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), IL-33, CXCL10, and
      CXCL11 have all been found to have utility in predicting the development of GVHD. While these
      biomarkers have been identified they have not been extensively validated and are yet to be
      clinically adopted as a guide to alter treatment. Moreover, the biomarkers discovered thus
      far are often the result of downstream pathway perturbations and discovering the upstream
      dysregulation that occurs earlier in the course of the disease may be valuable in developing
      diagnostic or prognostic models that could lead to trials aimed at altering the natural
      course of the disease.

      The Investigators have previously shown that by using advanced immunologic analysis including
      flow cytometry, and whole transcriptome analysis, we can identify previously unrecognized
      molecular pathways active in GVHD. The Investigators anticipate that by utilizing a systems
      immunology approach in patients with acute GVHD they will be able to identify pathways that
      have diagnostic and prognostic value. This may enhance our diagnostic capacity and most
      importantly, allow us to individualize management of patients based on their specific
      immunologic profiles.

      Chronic GVHD: CGVHD occurs in 40-60% of transplant patients with the incidence of this
      disease rising in the past 2 decades. 25 chronic GVHD causes significant mortality, and in
      those patients that survive, it can result in profound effects on quality of life. Despite
      the increased frequency of chronic GVHD, accurate diagnosis and evidence-based therapy is
      still lacking. Thus, while chronic GVHD biomarkers have been identified there have yet to be
      any that qualify for clinical application. Moreover, these biomarkers often represent
      end-stage pathway perturbations and may result from nonspecific inflammation and tissue
      damage as well as counter-regulatory mechanisms. In addition to the challenges in diagnosis,
      there are significant treatment challenges as well: Thus, treatment of chronic GVHD has not
      changed significantly over the past few decades. First line therapy remains corticosteroids
      with or without calcineurin inhibitiors (CNIs) and unfortunately, approximately 50% of
      patients will fail and require second line treatment with failure-free survival at 2 years
      following second-line therapy being only 25%. These data underscore the significant unmet
      needs in this field, both for molecular diagnostics and evidence-based treatment paradigms.

      Protective Immunity: In addition to the challenges of acute and chronic GVHD, patients
      undergoing HCT face other toxicities as well, many of which are related to dysfunctional
      immune reconstitution after transplant. However, although the phenomenology of the many
      defects in protective immunity (both against infectious pathogens and against leukemia
      relapse) is well-documented, the causative molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To address
      these questions, the investigators and others have begun to perform detailed assessments of
      immunologic reconstitution after HCT including the application of new T Cell Receptor (TCR)
      and B cell Receptor (BCR) deep-sequencing technologies. These technologies allow the
      investigation of the breadth and depth of post-transplant immune reconstitution at a level of
      molecular detail not previously possible and hold the promise of deepening our understanding
      of the impact of infectious pathogens on global immune health and immune reconstitution. The
      widespread application of these technologies, and their intersection with detailed assessment
      of immune phenotype and function can provide novel insights about the state of immune health
      in transplant patients, and holds the promise of identifying patients in need of novel
      interventions to improve their post-transplant immune reconstitution.

      The goal of the PREDICT trial is to apply a systems-biology approach to enable precision
      diagnostics for the key immunologic outcomes post-transplant. This approach will deepen our
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the most deadly post-transplant
      complications, and serve as a critical platform upon which to design evidence-based treatment
      paradigms for transplant patients.
