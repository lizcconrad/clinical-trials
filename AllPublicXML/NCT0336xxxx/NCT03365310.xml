      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of turmeric and tulsi polyherbal
      formulation in the management of frailty in the elderly population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a wasting syndrome of old age that leaves a person vulnerable to falls, functional
      decline, morbidity and mortality. Reducing the severity of frailty will provide large
      benefits for individuals, their families and for the society. It is assumed that early
      intervention with frail people will improve quality of life and reduce the costs of care.
      This trial is testing the frailty intervention with herbal medicine. If this frailty
      intervention is shown to be effective, there are major potential benefits to the frail older
      population generally in terms of decreased disability. The interventions being examined are
      readily transferable to routine clinical practice and can potentially be applied routinely in
      aged care services.
