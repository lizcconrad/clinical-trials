  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FRDTM is easy to perform and does not require sophisticated laboratory technology and/or
      experienced pathologists for test result interpretation. Compared to the Pap smear and HPV
      test, the FRDTM enables clinicians to obtain test results immediately (within 60 seconds)
      after the screening. This empowers clinicians in making timely decisions on appropriate
      patient management, and facilitating patient compliance with follow-up procedures. In
      addition, the FRDTM requires minimal training and technical support. Due to its advantage of
      rapid visualization of abnormal cervical lesions (CIN2+) in a cost-effective way, health care
      professionals can make cervical cancer detection accessible to women worldwide, especially in
      regions with limited medical resources. This is a cross-sectional study to evaluate the
      clinical performance of Folate Receptor-Mediated Epithelium Staining (FRDTM) in detecting
      cervical neoplastic lesions (CIN2+).

    <textblock>
      The Folate Receptor-Mediated Staining Solution is a dye solution that stains for medical
      purposes used in staining cells and tissues for detecting neoplastic diseases. The main
      purpose of this product is to detect abnormal cervical lesions (CIN2+) during a gynecological
      speculum examination. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical
      performance of Folate Receptor-Mediated Epithelium Staining (FRDTM) in detecting cervical
      neoplastic lesions (CIN2+).

      The subjects who are enrolled in this study will first undergo the FRD test, then cytology
      and HPV test. Women with abnormal cytology (≥ ASCUS/AGC), positive FRD test in either the
      cervix or cervical canal, and/or positive HPV test will be referred to colposcopy. In
      addition, 10% of the subjects who tested negative for all three tests and are ≥ 25 years old
      will be randomly selected to complete a colposcopy as well.

      According to the colposcopy assessment, if the results show satisfied (type I) then a biopsy
      will be taken. Subjects with a positive FRD test for the cervical canal, unsatisfied
      colposcopy (type II-III), and/or detection of AGC during cytology will have to complete an
      ECC procedure as well. Finally, a histopathological examination will be done and used as the
      gold standard. Subjects with a histopathological examination result of &lt; CIN2 will be asked
      to come back for a follow up visit within 6 months or 1 year, according to the investigator's
      discretion. Subjects can exit the study at any time after colposcopy.

    <description>The Folate Receptor-Mediated Staining Solution is a dye solution that stains for medical purposes used in staining cells and tissues for detecting neoplastic diseases. After inserting a speculum into your vagina, the FRD™ staining solution will be applied to the cervix using an applicator. After removal of the applicator, the doctor will inspect the applicator for color changes and note any changes. The physician will then remove any excess stain from the cervix using distilled water.</description>

    <description>During the colposcopic examination, the physician will insert a speculum into the vagina and then apply a vinegar solution to the cervix. The vinegar solution causes any potential abnormal cells to turn white. These white regions are best seen using the colposcope, which magnifiesthe skin.</description>

    <description>If the examination is not satisfactory and the doctor is not able to see the entire cervix, he may perform an endocervical curettage, or ECC. This sample is collected by placing a long, thin instrument into the cervical canal and a sample is scraped from that area. The sample will be sent to the laboratory for a pathologist to review.</description>

    <description>According to the colposcopy assessment, if the doctor sees a white area, or an area of abnormal cells, a tiny sample of tissue, called a biopsy will be taken from the cervix. About half of women do not feel the biopsy being taken.
Others may feel a quick pinch. After the biopsy, the wound will be treated to stop bleeding.The biopsy will be sent to the laboratory for a pathologist to review.</description>
