  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are comparison of the incidence of intraoperative air
      embolism and the extent of blood loss in patients undergoing posterior cranial fossa (PCF)
      and pineal region (PR) surgeries in sitting and horizontal position. Additionally, the
      overall treatment outcome, neurological functional outcome, degree of tumor removal, clinical
      course in the postoperative period, and the patient satisfaction will be compared between the
      groups.

      This was a prospective observational study to assess the effects of patient positioning
      during craniotomies on surgical outcomes. Patients were distributed into 2 major groups based
      on the surgical position: sitting and horizontal. Each group was further divided into
      subgroups based on the type and location of the lesion. To achieve the study goals,
      comparison of the 2 approaches in equivalent patient groups was performed, including
      comparable demographics, diagnoses, topographic location of the lesions, anesthetic
      approaches, and surgical experience.

      The operating surgeons decided patient positioning based on clinical judgment. Type of
      anesthesia was defined by the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient however, it was
      maximally standardized for both sites. All the surgeries were performed by neurosurgeons with
      sufficient experience of sitting craniotomies.

        Patients undergoing elective craniotomies on posterior cranial fossa or pineal region were
        identified on each site before surgery. Patients were asked to be part of the study
        explaining that no intervention was necessary besides a phone call performed by the
        research team 3 months after their surgery.
