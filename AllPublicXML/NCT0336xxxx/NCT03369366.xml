    <textblock>
      Immediate reconstruction and dental rehabilitation of maxillofacial ablative defects with
      patient specific reconstruction plates, dental implants, and immediate load provisional
      screw-retained prosthesis will improve patient short and long term outcomes and improve
      patient quality of life. Utilizing current technologic advances, patients undergoing large
      ablative procedures for benign head and neck pathology can now not only have immediate bone
      and soft tissue reconstruction, but dental rehabilitation as well. Using virtual surgical
      planning, patient specific selective laser melded reconstruction plates, and dental implants,
      a screw-retained provisional dental restoration can be fabricated and placed during a
      one-stage procedure with minimal to no intra-operative prosthetic work required.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of any reconstructive procedure is to restore a patient's natural form and
      function. The new techniques implemented in this study will demonstrate an approach that
      allows immediate return of the patient's premorbid state in one procedure. The investigators
      have demonstrated success with a small cohort of patients, and published a recent case study
      regarding this new technique. This study is meant to build upon the investigators experiences
      and advance their process and treatment of these patients. With a larger patient population
      to study, greater data can be obtained, with the ultimate goal of establishing this treatment
      as a new standard of care for patients with large ablative defects requiring reconstruction.

      Patients with benign, large tumors requiring surgical resection with free tissue transfer
      reconstruction involving the maxilla and mandible will be included in the study. All of the
      patients will undergo the following pre-operative protocol:

        -  CT Maxillofacial Region

        -  CTA

        -  Dental impression (intra-oral scan and/or impressions)

        -  Virtual surgical planning

        -  Patient specific plate fabrication

        -  Resection and flap harvest osteotomy guides

        -  Fabrication of screw-retained provisional prosthesis

      Surgical treatment protocol involves:

        -  Resection of benign tumor using osteotomy guides

        -  Reconstruction with free tissue (osseous free flap) transfer using osteotomy guides

        -  Placement of dental implants (minimum of three) using integrated osteotomy and implant
           placement guide

        -  Placement of provisional screw-retained prosthesis (all while flap is still pedicled to
           vascular supply)

        -  Inset of flap/implant/prosthesis/custom plate construct

        -  Vascular anastomosis and closure

      Immediate post-operative management will include a 5-to-7 day post-operative hospital stay
      and a post-operative CT scan evaluation. Long-term evaluation of patients will include
      routine clinical exams and cone beam CT scans to evaluate flap and implant survival.
      Patients, for the purpose of this study, will be followed for one year following placement of
      final dental prosthesis (18-24 months post-operatively).

    <description>NobelActive's expanding tapered implant body condenses bone gradually while the apex with drilling blades enables a smaller osteotomy. These features help to achieve high primary stability in demanding situations, such as soft bone or extraction sockets. NobelActive enables immediate implant placement and Immediate Function where it might otherwise be challenging.</description>

    <description>The prefabricated prosthesis will be secured onto the implants using non-engaging multiunit abutments with screws, followed by fixation of the patient-specific plate to the fibula with monocortical screws. The previously used cutting guides are fixated with the screw locations corresponding to the screw locations of the custom plate. This allows for accurate positioning and fixation of the custom construct of the plate and fibula without the need for intermaxillary fixation (IMF).</description>
