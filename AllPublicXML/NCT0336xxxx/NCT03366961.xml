      This study aims to identify the safety and the survival benefit of the conversion surgery in
      stage IV or unresectable gastric cancer. The study designed single-arm phase II trial. All
      the patients would undergo curative-intent radical gastrectomy after palliative chemotherapy
      if the tumor responded to the chemotherapy. Primary endpoint was three-year overall survival.
      Secondary endpoints included short-term postoperative outcomes within 30 days, three-year
      relapse free survival, and success rate of conversion surgery (rate of R0 resection).

    <textblock>
      The survival rate of patients with stage IV gastric cancer (GC) is very low. Recently,
      several retrospective studies about conversion surgery have been introduced. The results of
      the studies showed around 30~40% of three-year survival rate in conversion surgery group.
      Eight institutions in Catholic University of Korea analyzed 419 stage IV GC patients, and
      they had divided into four groups: chemotherapy only, chemotherapy followed by gastrectomy,
      gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy, and best supportive care group. The group of
      gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy, which is similar with conversion surgery, showed 40% of
      three-year survival rate. However, the study included only small number of patients who were
      in conversion surgery group, and had several biases. Thus, we planned multi-national,
      multi-center phase II trial for conversion surgery in stage IV or unresectable GC.
