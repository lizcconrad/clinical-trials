      Scientific evidence regarding the effects of Brain Gym®, on people with cognitive impairment
      is scarce. This study aimed at comparing the effects of a program based on Brain Gym®
      exercises against a fitness exercise program on the cognitive function, functional
      independence, physical fitness and quality of life in institutionalized older adults with
      cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive training and physical exercise have been regarded as useful strategies in order to
      improve the cognitive function in older people with cognitive impairment. In this regard, it
      has been argued that while physical exercise improves the metabolic activity of the brain,
      the performance of cognitively demanding tasks increases the amount of dendritic branches and
      the level of synaptic plasticity, implying that the combination of both therapies may result
      in synergistic effects that positively influence various cognitive domains in different ways.
      One of the best known therapies which combines mental and physical training is Brain Gym®
      (BG), a movement-based program originally designed to improve learning capabilities through
      the performance of mind-body exercises. Brain Gym® can be considered as an interesting field
      of research due to the need of identifying novel therapies which might be more pleasant for
      older adults who tend not to be prone to participating in conventional exercise programs and
      might have a positive effect on their cognitive function. In spite of this, scientific
      evidence regarding the effects of BG on people with cognitive impairment is scarce and none
      of the studies compared the potential benefits of BG versus traditional exercise programs for
      this population. Moreover, to the authors' knowledge no study of this kind has been published
      so far. Under these circumstances, the present study aims at identifying the potential
      benefits of performing BG exercises on the cognitive function, functional independence,
      physical fitness, and quality of life of institutionalized older people with cognitive
      impairment, as well as at finding out whether the effects are more significant than those
      produced by a traditional exercise program.

    <description>By means of the Spanish version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. This is a 30-point questionnaire comprised by eight different categories and score range:
Orientation to time (0-5 points) Orientation to place (0-5 points) Registration (0-3 points) Attention and calculation (0-5 points) Recall (0-3 points) Language (0-2 points) Repetition (0-1 points) Complex commands (0-6 points)
The total score is the result of the summation of the categories. Interpretation:
Any score greater than or equal to 24 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition.
≤9 points: severe cognitive impairment 10-18 points: moderate cognitive impairment 19-23 points: mild cognitive impairment</description>

    <measure>Assessment of the changes in participants' functional independence.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>By means of the Barthel Index (BI) Spanish version. This scale evaluates the independence for the activities of daily living. It contains 10 different activities, with a possible score ranging from 0 to 10, with a maximum total score of the scale of 100 (summing the subscales results).
Interpretation:
&lt;20 Total dependence 21 - 60 Severe dependence 61 - 90 Moderate dependence 91 - 99 Mild dependence 100 Total Independence</description>

    <description>By means of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), spanish version. For each of the 8 subscales, the value can go from 0 to 100. For the interpretation of the results, the 50 (standard deviation 10) value on each dimension must be the mean valor for the sub scale reported for the general population, meaning that more or less than 50 must be considered better or worse, respectively.</description>
