  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe, with a patient reported score (BIOSECURE), the influence of an approved
      therapeutic education program (TEP) in patients with joint inflammation requiring a
      biological treatment initiation.

      The hypothesis is that patients attending the TEP will display better cognitive and
      adaptation competences than patients with no TEP.

      Patient's reported quality of life, disease related stress management, treatment adherence,
      socio-demographic factors, biological home administration modalities and if the biologic
      treatment is maintained at 12 months, will also be described.
