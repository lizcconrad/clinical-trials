  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) regulates cell growth and survival.
      Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are HER2-positive, which are an aggressive and
      fast-growing subtype of breast cancer. This study will evaluate a new treatment using a
      potent Poly polymerase (PARP) inhibitor known as Niraparib. Niraparib will be combined with
      trastuzumab, a HER2-targeted agent, to evaluate the safety and tolerability in patients with
      metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. It is anticipated that the combination of drugs will
      improve survival and have few side effects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. All patients in the phase 1 and 2
      portion of the study will receive Niraparib by mouth on days 1-21 of each 21 day cycle as
      well as trastuzumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each cycle. Blood and tissue will be
      collected at pre-specified times to enable pharmacokinetic, biomarker, and toxicity studies.
      The drug dosage will then be determined for the phase 2 portion at a dose limiting level.
      Following treatment, patients will be followed every 6 weeks for 6 months until disease
      progression or an unacceptable adverse event.

    <intervention_model_description>There are two phases to this study. Phase 1 will enroll 6-12 patients and Phase 2 will enroll up to 40. Trastuzumab will be given intravenously at 6 mg/kg on Day 1 for each 21 day cycle in both phases. Niraparib will be given by mouth every day at a dosage of 300 mg for phase 1 participants and 200 mg (or 300 mg/kg) for phase 2 participants. Tumor measurement and response will be monitored by MRI or CT scans after cycles 3 and 6 and then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years or until disease progression. Blood and tissue samples will be collected for pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, and laboratory evaluations.</intervention_model_description>

             similar chemical or biological composition to herceptin are ineligible for study
             enrollment.
