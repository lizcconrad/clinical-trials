  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study investigates the course of disease in patients with chronic inflammatory
      skin diseases (atopic eczema and psoriasis). For this purpose, patients are asked once a year
      to take part in a data collection, questionnaires on the severity and quality of life are
      filled in and patients are also asked to give blood samples and skin swabs. The skin smears
      are superficial smears of three areas of skin with cotton swabs, which are used to examine
      bacteria on the skin. The blood samples are used to analyze inflammation messengers during
      the course of the disease. Optionally, patients are asked to submit second skin biopsies once
      a year to analyze inflammatory cell-level changes in the skin. Overall, the study will help
      to monitor the pathogenesis of the participating patients for at least ten years and to
      collect information about the inflammatory mechanisms of the diseases. The study has no
      effect on the therapies of the disease, it serves only the accompanying data collection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases in
      dermatology. Due to genetic predispositions, inflammatory changes of the skin occur. The
      specific immunological inflammatory mechanisms are partly understood for both diseases and
      targeted therapies are established in psoriasis therapy and are currently available for the
      first time in the treatment of atopic eczema. In order to better understand the course of the
      disease and to characterize the changes in the inflammatory mechanisms during the course of
      the disease, longitudinal prospective studies are needed to evaluate biological samples. This
      study investigates long-term clinical epidemiological data from affected patients, as well as
      biological samples, including blood samples, non-invasive skin swabs for microbiome
      detection, and optional skin biopsies for histological, immunohistological and molecular
      characterization of the disease. Patients are screened once a year and followed up for at
      least ten years.
