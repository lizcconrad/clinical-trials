  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, was launched as a
      treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the U.S. in August 2014. In contrast with
      several previous cardiovascular outcomes trials, which failed to demonstrate an association
      with a higher or a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes associated with members of other
      recently marketed antidiabetic classes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial has shown that patients at
      high cardiovascular risk randomized to empagliflozin vs. placebo, were associated with a
      reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause
      mortality.However, these and other findings arising from an extensive clinical trial program
      aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety profile for empagliflozin have yet to be
      demonstrated in a non-trial environment. This study aims to investigate the transferability
      of the effects demonstrated in dedicated randomized clinical studies to a broader population
      under real world conditions.
