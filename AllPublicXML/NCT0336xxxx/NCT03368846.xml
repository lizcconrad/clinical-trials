  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, single oral dose study in healthy male
      subjects. It is planned to enrol a single cohort of 6 healthy male subjects to ensure data in
      4 evaluable subjects.

      Each subject will receive a single administration of 120 mg [14C] varlitinib oral suspension
      containing not more than (NMT) 2.9 MBq (79 µCi), in the fed state.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 28 days before
      dosing. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on the evening prior to IMP
      administration (Day 1) and will fast overnight for a minimum of 8 h. Subjects will be dosed
      on the morning of Day 1 following a light breakfast, and will remain resident in the clinic
      until up to 240 h after dosing (Day 11). It is planned that subjects will be released as a
      group when all subjects have achieved a mass balance cumulative recovery of &gt;90%, or if &lt;1%
      of the dose administered has been collected in urine and faeces within 2 separate,
      consecutive 24 h periods. In this case, collection of all samples (blood, urine and faeces)
      will cease and the subjects will undergo discharge assessments. If this criterion has not
      been met by all subjects on Day 11, the residency period may be extended by a further 48 h
      maximum (up to Day 13). If the criterion is still not met by Day 13, or if additional
      residency is not considered appropriate or necessary, then home collections of urine and/or
      faeces may be requested at the discretion of the investigator for individual subjects.
