  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, multi-center open-label pharmacokinetic trial studying the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of Minocin IV. Up to 67 subjects will
      be enrolled to obtain 50 evaluable, ICU patients who are already receiving antimicrobial
      therapy for a known or suspected Gram-negative infection. The entire study duration will be
      approximately 12 months and each subject participation duration will be approximately 2 days
      depending on whether any follow-up is needed. The study will be conducted at approximately 10
      clinical sites. Each subject will receive a single 200 mg dose of Minocin IV infused over
      approximately 60 minutes. Each subject will have 7 PK samples collected (1 pre-dose, 6
      post-dose) at designated time points over a ~48 hour period following the start of the
      Minocin IV infusion. The primary objectives are: 1) To characterize minocycline PK at the
      population level in critically-ill adults, with illness known or suspected to be caused by
      infection with Gram-negative bacteria and 2) To assess patient-level and clinical covariates
      associated with minocycline pharmacokinetic properties in critically-ill adults, with illness
      known or suspected to be caused by infection with Gram-negative bacteria.

      known or suspected to be caused by infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Up to 67 subjects
      will be enrolled in order to obtain 50 PK evaluable subjects in the study. To be considered
      PK evaluable, a subject must receive the full infusion of study drug, and is required to have
      at least 3 PK samples collected in the first 12 hours post dose and at least 1 PK sample
      collected 24-48 hours post dose. Subjects who are dosed with minocycline but do not meet this
      PK sampling requirement will still be included in the population PK analysis, but an
      additional subject will be enrolled as a replacement to meet the goal of having 50 PK
      evaluable subjects with intensive PK sampling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female &gt; / = 18 years of age.

          2. Subject is in the ICU, or is being admitted to the ICU.

          3. Known or suspected Gram-negative infection for which the subject is receiving systemic
             antibiotics, and which was the reason for admission to the ICU, or reason for
             persistent need for ICU care.

          4. Expectation, in the judgment of the investigator, that the subject will remain
             admitted in the hospital for at least 48 hours following enrollment and that all study
             procedures will be completed.

          5. Expectation that intravenous access will be sufficient to allow for study drug
             infusion, and for all protocol required blood sampling to occur.

          6. The subject, or legally authorized representative (LAR), is able and willing to
             provide signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of significant hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to tetracycline
             antibiotics.

          2. Receipt of oral or intravenous tetracycline class drugs within 7 days of enrollment
             (e.g., minocycline, tetracycline, tigecycline, doxycycline).

          3. Use of isotretinoin within 2 weeks of enrollment into the study.

          4. Major surgery* within 48 hours prior to enrollment.

             *Major surgery is defined as &quot;the opening of either a body cavity or the mesenchymal
             barrier, using general anesthesia&quot;.

          5. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          6. Patient is being treated for intracranial hypertension.

          7. Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, precludes participation
             because it could affect subject safety.

          8. Receipt of an investigational study product within 7 days prior to enrollment.
             Investigator discretion should be used when longer acting agents have been used in the
             previous 30 days.
