  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot early phase I trial studies how well diffusion tensor imaging works in predicting
      development of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with breast cancer.
      Diffusion tensor imaging may help to get better pictures of the nerves of feet and lower legs
      before and after chemotherapy treatment and may help to predict the risk of developing
      peripheral neuropathy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the changes in the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient
      (ADC) values of the lower extremity nerves by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) before
      initiation and after completion of taxane chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish normal and abnormal FA and ADC values of the lower extremity nerves.

      II. Evaluate relationship of DTI findings of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy
      (CIPN) with self-reported Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ) and Functional Assessment
      of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-neurotoxicity questionnaire (FACT-GOT-NTX)
      questionnaires.

      III. Assess inter-reader variability in measuring FA and ADC values.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both lower extremities
      using magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) and DTI prior to initiation and after completion
      of standard of care chemotherapy.
