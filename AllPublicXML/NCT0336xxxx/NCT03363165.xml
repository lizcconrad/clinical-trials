  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HI-PAD is a placebo controlled double-blind randomized pilot clinical trial to determine
      whether VM202 may improve walking ability in people with lower extremity peripheral artery
      disease (PAD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HI-PAD study will randomize 39 people age 55 and older with PAD who do not have critical
      limb ischemia. The primary outcome is change in the six-minute walk distance at 3-month
      follow-up after the first study drug injection. A secondary outcome in change in six-minute
      walk distance at 6-month follow-up. Additional secondary outcomes are pain-free and maximal
      treadmill walking distance, calf biopsy measures of skeletal muscle regeneration, capillary
      density, and autophagy, and MRI-measured calf muscle perfusion at three-month follow-up.
      Investigators will also measure change in six-minute walk distance at 12-month follow-up.

    <description>Participants randomized to VM202 will receive calf muscle injections of VM202 to each leg with an ankle brachial index &lt;= 0.90. Injections of VM202 are administered by a physician in a double-blinded fashion after randomization on Day 0, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 42, for a total of four treatment days. Therefore, participants randomized to VM202 will receive 4 mgs of VM202 in each calf muscle on each treatment day. Injections are placed beginning 2 cm below the popliteal crease, and are administered in a pre-designed sequence and pattern, at a measured distance 2 cm apart.
Note: Participants who have an ABI &lt; 0.90 in only one leg will only receive injections in the leg with ABI &lt; 0.90.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to placebo will receive bilateral calf muscle injections of placebo (the excipient buffer formulation minus the VM202). Injections of placebo are administered by a physician in a double-blinded fashion after randomization on Day 0, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 42, for a total of four treatment days. Placebo appears identical to the VM202 study drug and is administered in a pattern on the calf identical to that of the VM202 injections.
Note: Participants who have an ABI &lt; 0.90 in only one leg will only receive injections in the leg with ABI &lt; 0.90.</description>

             PAD will be defined as an ankle brachial index (ABI) &lt;0.90 at the baseline study visit
             .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Above- or below-knee amputation.

          -  Critical limb ischemia, including individuals with gangrene and lower extremity
             ulcers.

          -  Wheelchair-bound or requiring a cane or walker to ambulate.

          -  Planned lower extremity revascularization, major orthopedic surgery, or other major
             surgery during the next six months.

          -  Lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, cardiovascular event, coronary
             revascularization, or other major surgery in the previous three months and planned
             revascularization or major surgery during the next six months.

          -  Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease
             requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, or a life-threatening illness with life
             expectancy less than six months. [NOTE: Participants who only use oxygen at night may
             still qualify]

          -  History of cancer or incomplete cancer screening as recommended by the American Cancer
             Society. Participants will be asked to provide information on screening history for
             colon cancer, breast cancer (women), and prostate cancer (men). A chest computed
             tomography will be performed for participants with &gt;30 pack year history of smoking,
             unless they have not smoked within the past 15 years, to screen for lung cancer that
             may exclude them.

          -  Evidence of proliferative retinopathy.

          -  Positive test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus
             or Human T-lymphotropic virus.

          -  Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score &lt;23 or dementia.

          -  Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.
             [NOTE:

        after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will become
        eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy study so
        long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention administration. After
        completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or gene therapy),
        participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up visit as long as at least
        three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.]

          -  Increase in angina or angina at rest.

          -  Premenopausal women.

          -  Non-English speaking.

          -  Visual impairment that limits walking ability.

          -  In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.

          -  Potential participants who have had symptoms from peripheral artery disease for less
             than six months will be excluded.

          -  All potential participants will be advised by telephone before their first baseline
             visit that 12-weeks of supervised treadmill exercise may be covered by their
             insurance. Potential participants who prefer to take part in 12-weeks of supervised
             treadmill exercise will not be eligible. Potential participants who are not interested
             in exercise or who do not have access to it will be eligible if they meet all other
             inclusion criteria. Potential participants who complete 12 weeks of supervised
             treadmill exercise may participate in the study, so long as 12 weeks has passed since
             their last supervised exercise session.

          -  Potential participants with a baseline six-minute walk value of 1,423 feet or higher
             will be excluded.

          -  Potential participants with the following laboratory values will be excluded: a
             hemoglobin value &lt; 8.0 g/dL, a white blood cell count &lt; 3,000 cells per microliter,
             platelet count &lt; 75,000/mm3, GFR &lt; 20 mL/minute/1.73 M2, AST or ALT value &gt; 3 times
             the upper limit of normal, or any other clinically significant laboratory abnormality
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, should exclude the participant.

          -  Vulnerable populations (fetuses, pregnant women, children, prisoners, and
             institutionalized persons) and adults unable to consent will not be included in the
             study.

          -  Potential participants with treated with cilostazol for less than three months will be
             excluded.
