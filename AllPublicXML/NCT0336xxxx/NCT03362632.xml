    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication of end-stage liver disease
      due to various causes. The initial anti-infective medication is appropriate and the patient's
      survival rate is closely related. Ascitic fluid bacterial culture takes a long time, the
      positive rate is low, it is difficult to guide the timely use of antimicrobial drugs,
      empirical medicine based on evidence-based medicine for SBP in patients with end-stage liver
      disease is essential. The American College of Hepatology and the European Society of
      Hepatology recommend the use of third-generation cephalosporins as the first choice of
      empirical therapy in patients with end-stage liver disease associated with community-acquired
      SBP. Patients with merger of hospital-acquired SBP with piperacillin / tazobactam or
      carbapenem +/- glycopeptide antibiotics is the first choice for empirical medication. There
      is no clear recommendation in China. In recent years, the conclusions of international
      clinical research in this area have been in disagreement with the recommendations. As a key
      factor in the selection of empirical antibiotics is local bacterial resistance data, these
      findings are difficult to evidence-based medicine for Chinese doctors. This project intends
      to observe the efficacy of different initial anti-infective regimens in Chinese patients with
      end-stage liver disease with SBP and 30-day and 60-day non-liver transplant survival rates,
      providing evidence-based medical evidence for the empirical use of such patients.
