  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a monocentric, prospective, observational and controlled trial
      (historical cohort control group of healthy non-obese subjects who had Nasal functional
      exploration for Snoring) as part of current care.

      This study concerns the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OSAS is
      elevated in subjects with morbid obesity (BMI≥40) (on average 70%). International
      recommendations agree on the need to seek OSAS before bariatric surgery because of the high
      risk of complications.

      Increased nasal resistance could also be related to a limitation of inspiratory flow due to
      an abnormality of the elasticity of the nasal mucosa or &quot;nasal compliance&quot;. Adipose
      infiltration of the nasal mucosa may occur during obesity.

      These tissue changes (decreased vaso-erectile tissue and increased adipose tissue) could
      modify the nasal compliance, which the decrease would be a possible factor of severity of
      OSAS in obese patients. Screening for an abnormality of compliance could also anticipate a
      difficulty of equipment for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) in the case of
      associated OSAS.

      All patients who must have bariatric surgery and get in the criteria are included. They will
      have to do a medical checkup pre and post-operative (polygraphy + ear/nose/throat assessment
      (ENT) + Nasal functional exploration). They will be followed for 13 to 24 months.

      The main objective of this research is to demonstrate a reduction of at least 30% of nasal
      compliance in a group of obese subjects (BMI&gt; 35) compared to a control group of healthy
      subjects.

      The secondary objectives are to is to demonstrate an increase of 30% in resistance in
      patients with BMI&gt; 35 compared to control group and a normalization of nasal compliance 1
      year after surgery when their weight is normalized (BMI &lt;30).

      A study period of 4 years is planned.
