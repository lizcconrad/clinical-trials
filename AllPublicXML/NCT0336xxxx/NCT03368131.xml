    <description>Objective response referred to participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR: disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR: greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions taking as reference the screening sum LD. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements had to be confirmed by repeat assessments that should have been performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol were also appropriate. Cumulative data (up to primary analysis cut-off date of 30-June-2015) are provided for both phase 2 and phase 3 within the results of this measure.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 of each treatment cycle, at the study drug completion visit, and thereafter at follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated, cancer-specific 30-item patient-reported measure, and contains 14 domains to assess the impact of cancer treatment on 5 aspects of participants functioning (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 aspects of disease/treatment-related symptoms (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea) and a global QoL/overall health status scale. Questions used 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; with the exception of the QoL/health status scale which uses a 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Each scale is transformed on a scale of 0-100; a higher score equals (=) a better level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms. Change of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 10-points has been found to be clinically significant. Cumulative data (up to primary analysis cut-off date of 30-June-2015) are provided for both phase 2 and phase 3 within the results of this measure.</description>
