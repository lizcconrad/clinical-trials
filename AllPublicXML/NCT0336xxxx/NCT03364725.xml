      To demonstrate that colocation treatment of substance use disorder and Hepatitis C infection
      concurrently while proving addiction counselling will achieve increased duration of sobriety
      and elimination of Hepatitis C virus in study participants.

      Primary objective:

      1. Cure rates (SVR-12, HCV plasma RNA not quantifiable 12 weeks after last dose of treatment)
      of HCV in 30 recently identified PWIDS under 30 years old

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Rate of sobriety maintenance for 1 year after enrollment

        2. Re-infection rate with HCV over 1 year after enrollment

        3. Re-admission rates for detox

        4. Cravings

          -  Negative pregnancy test in women and females must agree to acceptable contraception
             during treatment of HCV. Oral contraceptives that do not contain ethinyl estradiol are
             allowed with Mavyret

          -  Treatment na√Øve for HCV

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Diabetes with HgA1c more than 8.0

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities, other than HCV infection, based upon the results
             of a medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory profile, and a
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that make the subject an unsuitable candidate for this
             study in the opinion of the investigator, including, but not limited to:

               -  ALT/AST &gt; 10x normal value,

               -  WBC with ANC &lt; 1500 cell/ul,

             and participation in the trial.

          -  Hypersensitivity to naltrexone or polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) microspheres
