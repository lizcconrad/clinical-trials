  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been launched to collect spectral raman data paired with validated
      glucose reference values in private homes of subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will collect 2-4 daily optical raman readings paired with capillary Blood Glucose
      comparator in own home with maintaining usual routines. Subjects will either collect data for
      30 days during a 60 days period or collect data for 90 days during 6 months.
