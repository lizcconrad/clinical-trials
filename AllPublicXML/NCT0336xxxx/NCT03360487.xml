  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease, for which the forms of
      treatment are medication and rehabilitation. However, in vitro and in vivo studies have
      demonstrated that photobiomodulation can be an effective treatment modality for inflammatory
      diseases, including MS. Photobiomodulation has a broad range of benefits, such as the
      avoidance of cell and tissue death, the stimulation of healing and injury repair, reductions
      in pain, edema and inflammation, cell proliferation and even apoptosis. The outcomes of
      photobiomodulation include the regeneration of cells, the stimulation of the growth of
      Schwann cells, a reduction in spasticity, functional improvements, a reduction in nitric
      oxide levels and the upregulation of the cytokine IL10, demonstrating that this therapeutic
      modality can offer neuro-protection.

      Methods: A randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial is proposed. The patients
      will be divided into six groups. Groups 1 and 2 will receive sham and active
      photobiomodulation in the sublingual region, respectively. Groups 3 and 4 will receive sham
      and active photobiomodulation along the spinal cord, respectively. Group 5 will receive
      placebo treatment with photobiomodulation on the skin in the region of the radial artery with
      a specific bracelet. Group 6 will be treated with photobiomodulation on the skin in the
      region of the radial artery with a specific bracelet.

      Discussion: Treatment for MS is directed at the immune response and slowing the progression
      of the disease. This is one of the first clinical trials with sublingual and along the spinal
      cord photobiomodulation, which could help establish a new, promising treatment of the disease
      associated with pharmacological treatment.

    <description>The concentration of endogenous nitrite will be evaluated in serum samples using the Total Nitric Oxide and Nitrate/Nitrite Parameter Assay Kit (R&amp;D) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. Briefly, 50 µL sample will be incubated in 96 well plates with the reaction diluent provided by the kit, Griess Reagent I and II for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions will be read at 540 nm.</description>

    <description>The quantification of the serum levels of IL-10 and TNFα will be performed using the Human IL-10 and THF-alpha ELISA MAX (Biolegend), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plates will be coated with the capture anti-IL-10 or anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody for 18h at 8°C, washed and then incubated with the reagent provided by the kit to block non-specific binding and to reduce background. Samples will be added to each well at room temperature for 2h and after wash, detection antibody solution will be added. Reactions will be revealed with the Avidin-HRP solution and the absorbance will be read at 450nm.</description>
