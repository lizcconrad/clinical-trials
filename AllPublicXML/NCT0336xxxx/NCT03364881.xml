  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Right colon has complicated anatomy which is surrounded by important organs. The variations
      of vessels are more frequent than in left colon, which contribute to the difficulty of
      surgery. Among the variations, Henle's trunk is more obvious that makes it the commonest
      cause of bleeding during operation. Several veins can be found to conjoin the Henle's trunk,
      among which ASPDV and REGV are the two common tributaries while RCV,MCV,SRCV may vary from
      people to people. As a result, a better understanding of the anatomical classification of
      Henle's trunk is a must during operation. However, existing studies of Henle's trunk are very
      rare and often single-centered with minimal samples.In order to achieve better surgical
      outcome and reduce operative complications, the investigators design this study to
      investigate the anatomical classification of Henle's trunk and the surgical outcome of each
      type.
