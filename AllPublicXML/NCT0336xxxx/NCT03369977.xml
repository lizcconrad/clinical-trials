      A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial is designed to investigate the safety
      and efficacy of BioGlue as an adjunct for structural repair and hemostasis in Chinese
      subjects with acute type A aortic dissection. The trial consists of two phases:

      Phase One - A non-randomized, lead-in phase. During the lead-in phase, the first 2-3 eligible
      subjects at each center will receive BioGlue in open surgery. These subjects will be
      evaluated for safety separately from the randomized phase of the trial.

      Phase Two - A randomized, controlled phase. Type A aortic dissection subjects will be
      randomized into TSR group (control group) and surgical repair with BioGlue group (test group)
      with a ratio of 1:1, so that equal number of subjects in test and control groups can be
      ensured.

    <description>BioGlue (produced by CryoLife in Kennesaw, GA) is a surgical adhesive with two components respectively purified bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Glutaraldehyde (their proportions are 4:1). Crosslinked bonds (covalent bonds) of Glutaraldehyde cross-link the protein on the surface of the tissue and the amino residue of the bovine serum albumin. BioGlue also adheres to the synthetic matrix material by a mechanical interlocking mechanism in the space of graft matrix.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 18-70 years of age.

          -  Subject has a confirmed diagnosis of acute type A aortic dissection with subtype A2.

          -  Subject is willing and able to give written consent for the trial. If the subject is
             unconscious or under the influence of medications which render him or her unable to
             give fully informed consent, a guardian may provide informed consent for the subject
             regarding trial participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known allergy to albumin, bovine products, or glutaraldehyde.

          -  Subjects who have been treated with an investigational product who have not completed
             the entire follow-up period.

          -  Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria, including those who do not wish to
             participate or give informed consent for trial participation, will not be enrolled
             into the trial, and will be offered equivalent, non-trial surgical or other treatment,
             as judged appropriate by the investigator.

          -  Subjects with previous cardiac and aortic surgery.

          -  End stage malperfusion syndromes (i.e. end-organ failure such as coma, paraplegia,
             hemiplegia, intestinal necrosis, or hepatic failure).

          -  Subjects with Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders.

          -  Previous chronic dissections resulting from non-cardiac surgery and/or trauma.

          -  Concomitant surgery of valve replacement (both in screening and intraoperative).
