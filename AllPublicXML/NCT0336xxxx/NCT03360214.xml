  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled double-blind interventional study comparing the
      effect of pulsed-electromagnetic field device (PEMF), pectoral interfascial block (PIB), and
      placebo on postoperative pain control. This study has the interdisciplinary cooperation of
      the regional anesthesia group, and the breast and plastic surgery divisions. All female
      patients with breast cancer evaluated at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) who are
      undergoing unilateral or bilateral mastectomy with tissue expander reconstruction will be
      offered enrollment in this prospective study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain after mastectomy, or breast tissue removal, is very common with almost half of
      women experiencing some type of residual pain and even 13% characterizing it as severe. Poor
      acute postoperative pain control is not only associated with development of chronic pain, but
      has also been shown to be associated with delayed wound healing. Therefore, optimization of
      postoperative pain control is paramount not just for patient comfort, but to decrease
      immediate and long-term postoperative complications.

      There are two adjunctive modes of perioperative pain control currently in use at CUMC. The
      first mode uses pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) and consists of a noninvasive device
      placed over dressings around the surgical site. The second is a regional anesthetic blockâ€”the
      pectoral interfascial block (PIB) in which a long-lasting local anesthetic (bupivacaine) is
      injected into the surgical dissection area. Both of these techniques for postoperative
      analgesia have been shown to be effective in different types of breast surgery, but there is
      no current literature comparing the two modalities in their efficacy in reducing
      postoperative pain. There is also no current literature in their efficacy in the mastectomy
      and tissue expander patient population. Thus, the purpose of the proposed trial is a evaluate
      the efficacy of these two modalities of postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing
      mastectomy and tissue expander reconstruction.

    <description>Quality of recovery will be measured using QoR. QoR is a 15-item questionnaire which will score on a scale of 0-10 pertaining to patient's comfort, support system, pain, well being, and ability to carry out daily activities. Number &quot;0&quot; indicates none of the time and number &quot;10&quot; indicates all of the time.</description>
