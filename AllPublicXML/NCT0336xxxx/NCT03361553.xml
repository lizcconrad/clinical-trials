  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current practice guidelines recommend obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients to stay in the
      post anesthetic care unit (PACU) until the risk of respiratory depression has subsided.
      Inevitably, a greater demand on hospital resource utilization in these patients will increase
      health care cost. Polysomnography (PSG) and screening questionnaires can identify OSA but
      they are limited by accessibility and false positive results, respectively. Inaccurate OSA
      identification misguides postoperative surveillance plan. In contrast with MRI and CT scans,
      ultrasound is more accessible and more likely a practical tool for OSA screening. However,
      before clinical application, airway ultrasound (US) exam must undergo vigorous testing to
      check its utility, accuracy, inter-observer reliability and its ability to identify OSA and
      its severity.

    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to recruit surgical patients at risk of OSA, exposed to
      sedatives,and/or general anesthesia. Surface ultrasound measurements will be conducted in a
      separate setting, and be correlated with the sleep study results, and a set of ultrasound
      parameters will be validated in this setting. Relevant clinical outcomes will be captured as
      well.
