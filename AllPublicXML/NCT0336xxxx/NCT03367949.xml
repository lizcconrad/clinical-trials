  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental model cast accuracy can be affected by many variables as tray material, impression
      material and time elapsed before pouring the impression. All these factors would affect the
      accuracy of the surgical guide

      Impression inversion with markers technique avoids the dimension changes that may happen from
      pouring of the dental model cast. Also it saves time as no need for optical scan of the model
      cast and for scan appliance even in cases of multiple restoration. Adding markers to
      impression tray ensures an accurate merge even if the patient has restored dentition that may
      cause scatter during the CT/CBCT scan.

      This study will is for Assessment of the Accuracy of Surgical Guide designed from Dental
      Model Optical Scan versus Impression Inversion with Markers techniques in Computer Guided
      Implantology.
