    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are two pathological conditions that
      are highly prevalent worldwide and share multiple CVD risk factors. There is rare research
      performed among elderly adults. The investigators are conducting a cross-sectional analysis
      of elderly adults (≥65 years) to investigate the association between atrial fibrillation and
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in an elderly Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>

      Because of the aging population and improvements in cardiovascular treatments, its prevalence
      is expected to increase substantially over the next few decades. AF has been reported to be
      associated with high rates of hospitalization and death. Along with older age, there are many
      independent risk factors for AF like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease,
      heart failure and valvular heart disease.

      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most prevalent liver diseases in the world
      whose prevalence ranges from 6% to 35%, with a median of 20% in the general population. In
      recent years, an increasing body of evidence have indicated that NAFLD is linked to
      cardiovascular disease, myocardial abnormalities, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction,
      heart failure, aortic valve sclerosis and so on.

      NAFLD has also been observed to be significantly associated with AF in patients with type 2
      diabetes. Furthermore, a cohort study showed that NAFLD was associated with an increased risk
      of prevalent AF in a middle-aged population. However, whether the association between NAFLD
      and AF also holds true in the elderly population remains uncertain. Therefore, the
      investigators conducted this cross-sectional study to explore the association between NAFLD
      and AF in an elderly Chinese population.
