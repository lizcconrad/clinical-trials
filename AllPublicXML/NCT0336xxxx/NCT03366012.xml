    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the acceptability of a new non-invasive screening device to test
      for Barrett's esophagus. The investigators will prospectively enroll 100 patients to undergo
      Cytosponge testing. The time of involvement for an individual will range from 2 weeks to 2
      months, depending on the results of the Cytosponge test and time to follow up endoscopy, if
      indicated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen over the past half century and
      continues to have a dismal prognosis. Even though it has been established that Barrett's
      esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion to EAC, more than 90% of EAC patients are never
      diagnosed with BE beforehand. Thus, the opportunity is missed to identify most patients at
      high risk for EAC who could benefit from surveillance and early endoscopic therapy, which in
      turn may lower EAC mortality. Upper endoscopy is the only means to diagnose BE, yet
      widespread endoscopic screening is impractical and expensive. There is an urgent need to
      develop minimally-invasive methods of BE screening that can be easily performed in the
      primary care setting to allow for efficient and cost-effective interventions to decrease EAC
      mortality.

    <measure>Patient Tolerability determined by Score on Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>After undergoing the Cytosponge test, subjects will be asked to take a &quot;Cytosponge Post-Procedure Questionnaire&quot; to assess tolerability using a Likert scale from 1 (no discomfort) to 10 (severe discomfort) and whether they would be willing to undergo Cytosponge testing again (yes/no). The scale for each question is rated 1 to 10. Lower scores are &quot;better&quot; (greater tolerability for that particular measure), higher scores are &quot;worse&quot; (less tolerable for that particular measure). Each question on the questionnaire will be assessed independently (i.e. one score per question). No total scores are calculated.</description>

    <description>The Cytosponge consists of a 3cm diameter, polyester, medical grade spherical sponge on a string, compressed within a gelatin capsule. The capsule is swallowed while the patient or the research specialist holds onto the string. After 3-5 minutes the gelatin capsule dissolves allowing the spherical sponge to expand. The sponge is then retrieved by gently pulling on the string, thus collecting cells along the passageway through the entire length of the esophagus. The sample is then put into a preservative to be processed for immunohistochemical testing for trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) to determine diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus.</description>
