  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HaGuide version 1.0 (Neuro-Omega Ltd.) is a software module add-on to the FDA cleared
      Neuro-Omega System (K123796). It was designed to facilitate the use of Neuro-Omega's system
      by automatically mapping visually the depth of STN landmarks intra-operatively. HaGuide
      algorithm computes and displays the STN entry and exit, as well as introduces a detection of
      a distinct DLOR-VMNR boundary. HaGuide visual display is added to the UI and it is
      supplementing and not replacing the previously cleared standard display (visual and audio) of
      the system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease;

          2. Patient underwent implantation of DBS electrode in the STN for the treatment of
             Parkinson's disease, using the Neuro-Omega device for navigation;

          3. Procedure's MER digital recorded data is available;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. DBS performed for any other movement disorder other than Parkinson's Disease including
             Parkinsonism;

          2. The recording has a high intensity of noise that will not allow re-analysis using the
             HaGuide software, in such cases the HaGuide software indicates that the signal is not
             valid for analysis;

          3. Missing data for primary end-point on the respective patient medical chart;

          4. The collected data that is used for the validation is with high step size resolution;
