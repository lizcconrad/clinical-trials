      The investigators are interested in determining the best surgical technique to correct
      functional mitral regurgitation, as there is currently not one technique that is established
      to work better than the other.

      The technique used in current clinical practice is undersizing mitral annuloplasty (UMA), in
      which a prosthetic ring is implanted onto the mitral valve to correct the leakage. Though
      widely adopted, durability of the repair is less, as 58% of the patients present with
      recurrent FMR within 2 years. There are no specific algorithms to predict who might have UMA
      failure, but research indicates that some geometric indices might be strong predictors. The
      investigators are interested in testing the hypothesis that, elevated lateral inter-papillary
      muscle separation (IPMS) is a predictor of post-UMA recurrence of FMR at 12 months. In the
      first part of this study, the study team will measure lateral IPMS before surgery, and relate
      to post-surgery FMR severity at discharge/30 days, 6 months and 12 months.

      A relatively newer technique is papillary muscle approximation (PMA), in which a suture draws
      together the two muscles that connect the mitral valve to the heart muscle prior to
      performing UMA. This reduces the lateral inter-papillary muscle separation (IPMS) and is
      expected to improve the durability of UMA. In the second part of this study, the
      investigators will perform PMA and UMA together and determine if FMR severity is reduced at
      discharge/30 days, 6 months and 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is a common heart valve lesion that is observed in
      patients suffering for cardiomyopathies. Timely surgical repair of FMR can reduce volume
      overload and potentially improve cardiac function. Durable surgical techniques for FMR repair
      are lacking. Undersizing mitral annuloplasty (UMA) is the current technique of choice, but
      its durability is quite poor. Thirty five percent of the repairs fail within one year and 58%
      fail within 2 years.

      One of the probable mechanisms causing UMA failure is elevated lateral inter-papillary muscle
      separation (IPMS). The study investigators are interested in understanding if the extent of
      lateral IPMS has a direct impact on the failure rates of UMA at 1 year post surgery.
      Secondly, the investigators are interested in determining if patients with elevated lateral
      IPMS benefit from papillary muscle approximation (PMA) along with UMA.

      The investigators are interested in determining the best way to correct functional mitral
      regurgitation, as there is currently not one technique that is established to better than the
      other. The most common repair technique is called undersizing mitral annuloplasty (UMA), in
      which a prosthetic ring is implanted onto the mitral valve to correct the leakage. Another
      more recent technique is papillary muscle approximation (PMA), in which a suture draws
      together the two muscles that connect the mitral valve to the heart muscle prior to
      performing UMA. In this research study, the study team is investigating whether they can
      identify those patients who will benefit from one repair over another.

      The primary objective of this protocol is to investigate if pre-operative IPMS is predictive
      of FMR severity at 12 months after UMA to repair FMR. Furthermore, whether a cut-off value of
      pre-operative inter-papillary muscle separation can be established to predict patients who
      might have failure of UMA.

      The secondary objective of this protocol is to investigate if adding PMA to UMA is an
      effective technique in reducing recurrence of FMR at 12 months post-procedure.

    <description>The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire is a 21 item questionnaire that asks participants to describe how much their heart failure has affected life during the past month (4 weeks). Participants are asked if their heart failure prevented them from living as they want when completing daily tasks. Responses are rated on a scale from 0 to 5; 0 represents &quot;no&quot;, 1 represents &quot;very little&quot; and 5 represents &quot;very much&quot; on a continuum. The MLHF score is obtained by summing the subjects responses. A minimum score is 0 indicating no affect to life and a maximum score is 105 indicating the greatest affect to life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Status assessed by 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (Month 6), Post-Intervention (Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional status will be measured by a 6-minute walk test, which assesses the distance walked (in feet) on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). The test is used for preoperative and postoperative evaluation and for measuring the response to therapeutic interventions for pulmonary and cardiac disease. Optimal reference equations from healthy population-based samples using standardized 6MWT methods are not yet available. A low 6MWD is nonspecific and nondiagnostic. When the 6MWD is reduced, a thorough search for the cause of the impairment is warranted.</description>
