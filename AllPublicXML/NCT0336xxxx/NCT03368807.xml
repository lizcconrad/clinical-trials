      The main purpose of this study is to estimate missed bolus insulin doses in diabetics. This
      is a 12-week, single-arm, outpatient, exploratory study with two study periods in Type 1 or
      Type 2 diabetics, with an investigational reusable injection pen, insulin, and a Continuous
      Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device.

          -  Must be taking a bolus insulin analog (for example insulin lispro [U-100]/[U-200],
             insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine). In addition, must be able to switch to insulin
             lispro U-100 for the duration of the trial
