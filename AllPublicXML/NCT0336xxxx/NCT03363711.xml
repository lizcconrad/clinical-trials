  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will leverage two programs of research at UPenn and CHOP that are
      delivering technology-based interventions to adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer
      survivors.

      In the proposed study, all AYA survivors will receive a care plan via a tool (Smart-ALACC).
      They will then be randomized to receive (or not) a mobile health application (AYA STEPS) that
      will provide tailored messages to enhance uptake of their care plan.
