      non-legalized and legalized states have towards the legalization of medical marijuana.

      Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 100 will take part at MD
      Anderson.

      If participant chooses to take part in this study, participant will complete 5 questionnaires
      which will ask for participant's demographic information (age, race, sex, and so on) and
      about participant's feelings towards doctors, the use of marijuana (including participant's
      own personal use), any religious or spiritual feelings that participant may have, and about
      any anxiety and depression participant may have experienced. These should take about 20-25
      minutes to complete. Participant may complete the questionnaires on a hard copy survey or
      electronically on a tablet provided by the research staff. Surveys will not be e-mailed to
      participant.

      If participant is unable to complete the study questionnaires during this clinic visit,
      participant will be called by the research coordinator to complete them within 1 week.
      Participant's phone number will be collected to contact participant and will be deleted after
      participant completes the questionnaires.

      All questionnaire responses will be anonymous. No personally identifying information will be
      linked to participant's responses.

      Participation on this study will be over after participant completes the questionnaires.
