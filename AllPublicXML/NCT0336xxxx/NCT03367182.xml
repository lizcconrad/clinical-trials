  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety profile, response rate, progression free
      survival, overall survival of bevacizumab (Avastin) added to chemotherapy in patients with
      epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma with
      disease progression within 6 months of platinum treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Progression was based on tumor assessment made by the investigators according to the RECIST criteria</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be assessed in deaths, laboratory data, and vital signs. Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE version 4.0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Best Overall Confirmed Objective Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) by Modified RECIST until progression reported. Objective Response was determined by the investigator using modified RECIST criteria, Version 1.0. An objective response was a complete or partial overall confirmed response as determined by investigators. CR defined as complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR defined as greater than or equal to (â‰¥) 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of appropriate diameters of all target measurable lesions, no progress in the non-measurable disease, and no new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause. The OS data for participants for whom no death was captured in the clinical database were censored at the last time they were known to be alive.</description>
