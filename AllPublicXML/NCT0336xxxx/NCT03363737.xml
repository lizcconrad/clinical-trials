  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examine the utility of the Transtheoretical Model in influencing anxiety among college
      students. Employ a randomized controlled intervention including a static and dynamic Facebook
      intervention. The static group accessed a Facebook page featuring 96 statuses. Statuses were
      intended to engage cognitive processes, followed by behavioral processes of change per the
      Transtheoretical Model of behavior change. Content posted on the static Facebook page was
      identical to the dynamic page. However, the static group viewed all 96 statuses on the first
      day of the study, while the dynamic group received only 1-2 of these status updates per day
      throughout the intervention. Anxiety was measured using the Overall Anxiety Severity and
      Impairment Scale (OASIS). Time spent engaging in physical activity was assessed using the
      International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).
