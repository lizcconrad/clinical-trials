      To evaluate the effect of teriflunomide treatment on microglial activation in late stage
      multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), plaques in the white and grey matter of the brain represent the
      best known pathological changes of the disease, but a significant inflammation process has
      also been detected outside these plaques in connection with the disease. This extensive,
      diffuse inflammatory process correlates with the progression of the disease, measured by EDSS
      score (Expanded Disability Status Scale status) and reduction in patients' cognitive level.
      According to neuropathological research, the diffuse inflammatory process outside the plaques
      is connected with powerful activation of microglia, oxidative stress, and deficiencies in
      mitochondrial activity. The activation of microglial cells can be measured in vivo in
      patients using positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning and so-called TSPO radioligands,
      such as the 11C-PK11195 radioligand. 11C-PK11195 radioligand binds to TSPO molecules, which
      manifest on the surface of activated, but not un-activated, microglia.

      Teriflunomide treatment is expected to slow down the process of increasing microglial
      activation. TSPO-PET imaging allows in vivo follow-up of the pathogenic process associated
      with the gradual MS disease evolution, and allows to evaluate whether teriflunomide treatment
      has an effect on disease progression-related pathology.

        The research will recruit MS patients who are using teriflunomide treatment and are
        followed-up at the Neurology Outpatient Clinic at the Turku University Hospital. The study
        will not interfere with the initiation or dosage of the medication in any manner. The
        patient's treating neurologist will select the most suitable medication on the basis of the
        patient's clinical status, and patients using teriflunomide medication will be offered the
        option to participate in this imaging research.
