  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Center for Mind -Body Medicine has developed a mind-body skills group program that
      incorporates meditation, guided imagery, breathing techniques, autogenic training,
      biofeedback, genograms, and self-expression through words, drawings, and movement. These
      mind-body skills are designed to increase self-awareness and self-regulation. This program
      has been shown to significantly improve depression symptoms in children and adolescents with
      posttraumatic stress disorder in Gaza, but it has not yet been tested in a US adolescent
      population. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using mind-body
      skills groups to reduce depression in adolescents and to investigate the effects of the
      program on factors such as self-efficacy, mindfulness and rumination which are likely to
      mediate improvement.
