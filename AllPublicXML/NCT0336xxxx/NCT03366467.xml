  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to determine the effect of sensory adapted dental
      environment (SADE) in healthy children during a routine dental restorative treatment. The
      hypothesis is that the SADE would have a favorable effect in calming the subjects during
      dental treatment.

      the study is a random cross-over design. The participants will be randomly assigned into two
      groups. Group 1 will initially be treated under SADE (Time 1) and receive regular dental
      environment (RDE) on the second encounter (Time 2). For the second group, the procedure is
      reversed (RDE at Time 1 and SADE at Time 2).

      -  Dental treatment- will include restorations, crowns, pulp treatment, with local
           anesthesia. The use of oral/inhaled sedation will be decided according to the patient's
           behavior and cooperation assessment.

        -  Dental settings- The SADE: the sensory stimuli addressed are visual and auditory, as
           follows: (i) Visual sensation. All ceiling fluorescent lighting are removed. The adapted
           lighting consisted of slow-moving, repetitive visual color effects created by a
           projector, in the child's visual field. (ii) Auditory stimuli include rhythmic music,
           which was heard via loudspeakers. The RDE utilized fluorescent lighting on the ceiling,
           without special visual effects and without music stimulation.

        -  Instruments- 1) the children will be observed during the treatments. The observer will
           code all behaviors according to the Houpt Scale used for rating patient behavior during
           treatment. In addition, the examiner will count the number and duration (in minutes) of
           the anxious behavior (crying and movements). Because of the nature of the study (one
           environment with sensory adaptation and the other without), the observer cannot be blind
           to the treatment environment. 2) Physiologic arousal states, evaluated by the assessment
           of EDA (Mindlife Co, Jerusalem, Israel). Changes in the electrical conductance of the
           skin are a sensitive way of monitoring autonomic responses to external stimuli.

    <description>Rating patient behavior during treatment according to Houpt scale. The Houpt scale is a tool used to assess a child's behavior during dental sedation according to specific categories and scores including: sleep (1-awake, 2-drowsy, disoriented), movement (1-violent, 2-continuous, 3-controllable, 4-no movement), cry (1-hysterical, 2-continuous, 3-intermittent, 4-no cry), and overall behavior (1-treatment aborted, 2-poor, 3-regular, 4-good, 5-very good, 6-excellent).</description>
