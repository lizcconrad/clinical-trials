  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite important advances in the current understanding of sickle cell vaso-occlusion, the
      basis of its control and prevention remain partially unknown. The primary purpose is to test
      the hypothesis of a control of the sickle cell vaso-cocclusive (VOC) process by the anti band
      3 antibodies by assessing the level of these antibodies in the steady state and during the
      crises in SCA patients. To assess the relationship between the level of band 3 antibodies,
      the oxidation status, the expression of microparticles and the hemorheological alterations of
      the sickle red cells (SS RBs), the severity of VOC.

    <textblock>
      Although oxidative stress is not the primary aetiology of SCA, oxidative damage could in part
      account for pathophysiological mechanisms leading to sickle vaso-occlusion, in which anti
      bande 3 antibodies might play a role. Bande 3 is a protein belonging to red blood cells.
      These anti bande 3 antibodies are producted when after oxidative damage, a hidden site of
      bande 3 is revealed. In preliminary data, the Cuban partner of this study showed a
      significative difference between their level in patients, during steady state and
      vaso-occlusive crises. Our clinical question is to determine if a decrease of these
      antibodies, could participate in the occurrence of the crises. Therapeutic strategies aimed
      to counteract oxidative abnormalities might alleviate this still nowadays unknown mechanisms
      disease progression.

      Band 3 protein which belongs to the anionic interchanger is the main erythrocyte membrane
      protein, present in about 1.2 x 106 copies per cell. Under certain conditions, band 3 protein
      modifications in the human erythrocyte membrane surface lead to band 3 aggregates. These
      modifications are mostly due to oxidative insults that gradually accumulate during red blood
      cell lifespan. Band 3 clusters on the SS RBCs produce two significant changes: first, these
      cells acquire an adhesive nature; second, band 3 aggregates are recognized by natural band 3
      antibodies. Several studies have shown that band 3 peptides are able to inhibit the adherence
      of SS RBCs to endothelial cells. This suggests possible participation of band 3 antibodies in
      the aethiology as well as in the prevention of VOC in SCA. Oxidant damage in RBCs may
      contribute to the circulatory disorders by affecting their flow properties i.e. their
      deformability, aggregability and adherence to endothelial cells. Therefore, in parallel of
      the study of the evaluation of the role of anti bande 3 antibodies in VOC occurrence and
      severity, the investigators will explore the involvement of oxidative stress on the
      rheological properties of SSRBCs (deformability and aggregability),

    <description>The clinical data relative to the patients will be collected in each of these stages (CVO, basic state).
Besides, to estimate the severity of the CVO, we shall use an index of severity of the episode ( IS2) adapted from the one who was validated by our group to stratify the severity of vasoocclusifs episodes at the drepanocytic child SS.
Main clinical parameters: taken of analgesic at home (level), temperature in the admission, SaO2 in the admission, number of painful sites, thoracic pain with or without associated cough, score EVA in the entrance, feeling of the patient of bigger gravity of the CVO with regard to its crises previous, heart rate to the admission, … Main biological parameters: rate of leukocytes, of polynucléaires neutrophiles, of réticulocytes, Lactate déshydrogénase, of haemoglobin, C-reactive Protein … The biological data can be studied according to their raw rate or according to their difference with their basic value (in the stable state).</description>
