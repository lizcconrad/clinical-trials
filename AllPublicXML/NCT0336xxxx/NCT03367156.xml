  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if dexamethasone can help to control
      dyspnea (shortness of breath) in cancer patients. Researchers also want to learn if it can
      help to improve lung function and quality of life. In this study, dexamethasone will be
      compared to a placebo.

      A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any
      disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study
      drug has any real effect.

      This is an investigational study. Dexamethasone is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of pain, nausea and tiredness. Its use to manage shortness of breath is
      investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 201 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson and
      The Harris Health System (LBJ).

      Study assessments will be conducted in person or by phone during the course of this study.

      The study medication may be mailed to you.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have baseline tests
      after completing the screening questionnaires. The following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  Your breathing rate will be measured.

        -  The amount of oxygen in your body will be measured using a machine that clips on your
           finger.

        -  You will blow into a device called a spirometer a few times to measure your lung
           function.

        -  You will be asked to complete 4 questionnaires about shortness of breath, symptoms, and
           quality of life. These questionnaires should take a total of about 30 minutes to
           complete.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for cytokine testing. Cytokines are proteins
           that may affect the immune system.

      Study Groups:

      You will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice) to 1 of 2 study groups:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive dexamethasone on Days 1-14 of the study.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive a placebo on Days 1-14 of the study.

      This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the same, or worse than the
      other group. You will have a 2 in 3 chance of being assigned to Group 1. You will have a 1 in
      3 chance of being assigned to Group 2.

      Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo.
      However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are
      receiving.

      After 14 days, no matter which group you are assigned to, you will take dexamethasone for 14
      days.

      Study Drug/Placebo Administration:

      On Days 1-7, you will take 2 dexamethasone or placebo capsules twice each day.

      On Days 8-14, you will take 1 dexamethasone or placebo capsule twice each day.

      On Days 15-28, you will take 1 dexamethasone capsule twice each day.

      You should take the capsules around 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM. You should take the capsules with
      food and about a cup (8 ounces) of water.

      Study Visits/Calls:

      Beginning the day before you start taking dexamethasone (Day 0) through Day 14, you will be
      called 1 time each day to ask you about your level of shortness of breath and to remind you
      to take the capsules. These calls should last about 5 minutes each time.

      On or about Days 7 and 14, you will return to the clinic. You should bring your capsule boxes
      with you when you come to the clinic so the study staff can count the number of capsules. The
      following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will be asked to complete the same 4 questionnaires you completed during your
           baseline tests. These questionnaires should take a total of about 30 minutes to
           complete.

        -  You will blow into a spirometer to measure your lung function.

        -  You will be asked if you know if you have been receiving dexamethasone or placebo.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for cytokine testing. Cytokines are proteins
           that may affect the immune system.

      On Day 14, you will be asked at what level of shortness of breath you would feel comfortable.

      You will be called on or about Days 28 and 42 to ask you about your level of shortness of
      breath and any side effects you may be having. This call should last about 5 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for 42 days. You will no longer be able to take the study drug/placebo
      if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after your last visit/call.
