  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of isatuximab in combination with REGN2810
           in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are naïve
           to anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PDL-1)-containing
           therapy, or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed on
           anti-PD-1/PDL-1-containing therapy, and to confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

        -  To assess the response rate of isatuximab in combination with REGN2810 in patients with
           either mCRPC who are anti-PD-1/PDL-1 therapy naive, or NSCLC who progressed on
           anti-PD-1/PDL-1 therapy, or of isatuximab as single agent in patients with mCRPC.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety of the combination of isatuximab with REGN2810 or isatuximab
           monotherapy.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab and REGN2810.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab single agent or in
           combination with REGN2810, and to characterize the PK of REGN2810 in combination with
           isatuximab.

        -  To assess overall efficacy of isatuximab in combination with REGN2810 or as a single
           agent.
