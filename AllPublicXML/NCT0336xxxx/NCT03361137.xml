  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IV, multicenter study will evaluate whether participants with Hemophilia A and
      inhibitors receiving emicizumab prophylaxis can safely undergo minor surgical procedures
      without prophylactic bypassing agents (BPA).

    <description>All eligible participants will receive emicizumab via subcutaneous (SC) injection at a loading dose of 3 milligrams of medication per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, as long as they continue to derive sufficient benefit. Participants must have received all loading doses prior to surgery and plan to continue emicizumab for a minimum of 1 month after surgery. Dosing should be adjusted if the participant has a significant change in body weight.</description>

             the exception of previous catheter-associated thrombosis for which anti-thrombotic
             treatment is not currently ongoing) or current signs of thromboembolic disease

          -  Other conditions (e.g., certain autoimmune diseases) that may increase the risk of
             bleeding or thrombosis

          -  Participants who are at high risk for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), e.g., have a
             previous medical or family history of TMA, in the investigator's judgment

          -  Would refuse treatment with blood or blood products, if necessary.

          -  Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the

             risk of hemophilic bleeds within 5 half-lives of last drug administration before Study
             Day 1, a non-hemophilia-related investigational drug within the last 30 days or 5
             half-lives before Study Day 1 (whichever is longer), an investigational drug
             concurrently

          -  History of clinically significant hypersensitivity associated with monoclonal antibody
             therapies or components of the emicizumab injection

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 count &lt; 200
