  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an an open-label Phase I trial of VT1021 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors. Patients must have recurrent or advanced cancer (i.e., solid tumors) for which
      standard therapy offers no curative potential.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I study of VT1021 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The
      study will include a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. Upon determination of
      the recommended dose in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will be opened.
      The Dose Expansion Phase will include cohorts in selected indications in order to confirm the
      tolerability of VT1021 against specific tumor types.

    <measure>Identified recommended phase 2 dose by measuring incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) (Grade 2 or higher Adverse Events as measured by CTCAE v4.03) at increasing dose levels. Dose escalation only.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 doses weekly for 4 week cycle (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Only toxicities occurring during Cycle 1 of study therapy will be considered as DLTs and utilized to inform dose escalation decisions. As safety data become available for patients remaining on-study after Cycle 1, these data will be taken into consideration by the Sponsor when making decisions about continued dose-escalation and defining a RP2D.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be refractory to, or intolerant of, existing therapies known to provide
             clinical benefit for their condition (i.e., cancer diagnosis).

          2. Patient has evaluable disease by RECIST v1.1 (Appendix 3).

          3. Patient has a performance status (PS) of 0-2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) scale

          4. Patient is at least 21 days removed from therapeutic radiation or chemotherapy prior
             to the first scheduled day of dosing with VT1021.

          5. Patient has adequate organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of another malignancy within the past 2 years (excluding a history of
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, superficial non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial
             bladder cancer, or endometrial cancer that has been adequately treated, or stage 1
             prostate cancer that does not require treatment).

          2. History of a major surgical procedure or a significant traumatic injury within 14 days
             prior to commencing treatment, or the anticipation of the need for a major surgical
             procedure during the course of the study.

          3. Treatment with investigational therapy(ies) within 5 half-lives of the investigational
             therapy prior to the first scheduled day of dosing with VT1021, or 4 weeks if the
             half-life of the investigational agent is not known.

          4. Concurrent serious (as determined by the Principal Investigator) medical conditions,
             including, but not limited to, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV
             congestive heart failure, history of congenital prolonged QT syndrome, uncontrolled
             infection, active hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV, or other significant co-morbid
             conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would impair study participation
             or cooperation.

          5. Pregnancy or lactation.

          6. Evidence of symptomatic brain metastases. Patients with treated (surgically excised or
             irradiated) and stable brain metastases are eligible, assuming the patient has
             adequately recovered from treatment

          7. Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or investigational therapy.
