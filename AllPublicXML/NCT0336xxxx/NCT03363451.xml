  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term of End Stage of Liver Disease (ESLD) was raised in 80's of 20 Century, but without a
      restrict definition. Infections are the cause and effect in occurrence and development of
      ESLD, which not only induce or exacerbate ESLD, but also are the most combined complication.
      Multi-resistant bacteria, multi-organ injury, selection of anti-microbes, supporting
      treatment, disorder of intestine microbiota, et al are dilemma in clinical practice.
      Appropriate and formal diagnosis and treatment of ESLD combined infection are imperious
      nowadays.
