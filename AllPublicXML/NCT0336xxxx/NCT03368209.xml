  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study collected spectral raman data from diabetic patients. Data was paired with
      validated capillary references as well as CGM/FGM readings. Data was used to develop models
      for glucose prediction.

      This trial constitutes three subprotocols: &quot;The OUH protocol&quot;, &quot;The Home 1 protocol&quot; and &quot;The
      Home 2 protocol&quot; The investigation was initiated to collect spectral raman data paired with
      validated blood references. In the OUH protocol, capillary blood was analysed by ABL 800 Flex
      blood gas analyzer by Radiometer. In the Home 1 protocol, references were obtained by the
      finger pricking procedure from HemoCue (Radiometer). In the Home 2 protocol, HemoCue
      measurements were conducted along with continuous monitoring using Dexcom G4/G5 device
      (Dexcom) or FreeStyle Libre (Abbott) The data was collected from diabetic patients and
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) readings were obtained from all subjects.

    <description>The protocol constituted two outpatient visits in the clinic within one week. Each visit had a duration of approximately 2,5 hours. Prior to study, optical screenings were conducted:
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
Optical screening on measuring site with WM3.4.
Subjects were measured by the following scheme: ABL measurement, two optical measurements on WM3.4 #1 followed by two optical measurements on WM3.4 #2.</description>

WM3.4 was subsequently delivered to subject's home and the subject measured 30 days in a 60 days period of time. HemoCue was used for reference.</description>
