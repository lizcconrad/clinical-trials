      The purpose of this post-market registry is to collect real-world data associated with the
      use of Medtronic market-released neurothrombectomy devices in acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
      patients from countries in South East Asia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi‐center, non‐randomized, observational registry designed to
      collect real world data associated with the use of Medtronic market-released
      neurothrombectomy devices in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients from countries in South
      East Asia, including Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The primary objective of this registry
      is to assess clinical outcomes associated with the use of these devices in patients
      experiencing AIS due to large intracranial vessel occlusion within 8 hours of symptom onset.
      This registry may enroll up to 500 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject/subject's legally authorized representative has given Informed Consent
             according to country regulations, and/or EC requirements.

          2. Subject has experienced an Acute Ischemic Stroke due to large intracranial vessel
             occlusion in at least one of the following intracranial vessels: internal carotid
             artery (ICA), M1 and M2 segments of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), basilar, and
             vertebral arteries.

          3. Subject has been or will be treated with a Medtronic market‐released neurothrombectomy
             device as the initial device used to remove the thrombus.

          4. Subject is willing to participate in a 90‐day follow‐up visit.

          5. Treatment within 8 hours of stroke symptom onset (defined as stroke onset to access
             puncture).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Concurrent participation in another mechanical neurothrombectomy device trial or any
        other clinical trial with an active treatment arm or where the study procedure or treatment
        might confound the study analysis.
