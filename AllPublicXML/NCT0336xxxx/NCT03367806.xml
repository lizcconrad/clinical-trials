      Previous studies suggested an inverse relationship between coffee consumption and mortality
      in the general population. Furthermore, an inverse association between coffee consumption and
      serum biomarkers of inflammation and insulin resistance has been described. Prospective
      studies showed that coffee consumption might be associated with reduction in the incidence of
      type 2 diabetes. Although caffeine consumption appears to be associated with a decreased risk
      of developing type 2 diabetes, the relationship between caffeine consumption and mortality in
      patients with diabetes remains uncertain. The current analysis aimed to assess the effects of
      caffeine consumption and caffeine source on all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality
      among patients with diabetes.
