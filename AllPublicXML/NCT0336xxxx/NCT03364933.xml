  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial of PICU patients admitted for 7 days and expected to
      remain for at least another 3 days and who have a complex chronic condition. Patients will be
      randomized to usual care or usual care plus a primary intensivist and group of primary nurses
      (to facilitate passing of important patient information and informed, expedited
      decision-making). The primary research question is whether having a primary intensivist and
      nurses decreases PICU length of stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-stay intensive care unit (ICU) patients, or children who require prolonged
      hospitalization in the pediatric ICU (PICU), represent a minority of PICU patients but have a
      disproportionate impact on hospital resources and unfavorable outcomes, including morbidity,
      mortality, and repeated critical illness. These patients and their families have multifaceted
      needs (eg, tailored communication) that pose unique challenges to PICU providers and the
      parent-provider relationship. These experiences and needs are compounded and complicated by
      the transitory care that is typically provided by PICU. This transitory care may contribute
      to 1) patient/family dissatisfaction; 2) ineffective passing of important information day to
      day and week to week; and 3) delayed decision-making. These latter two potential consequences
      may, in turn, contribute to prolonged length of stay (LOS).

      For these reasons, the investigators propose a randomized control trial to test whether
      primary intensivists and primary nurses can decrease PICU LOS for long-stay patients. A
      primary intensivist is one that remains a consistent physician-presence for the
      patient/family and PICU team throughout the child's PICU stay, despite changes in the
      intensivist(s) who orchestrates day-to-day management. Primary nurses are a team of PICU
      nurses who provide the all/most of the bedside care to the child. The investigators
      hypothesize that the long-stay PICU patients who are randomized to receive primary
      intensivists and nurses will have a statistically lower LOS than those patients who do not.

    <description>Primary intensivist will have no active role in the daily management of patients. The primary intensivist should facilitate decision-making, be a liaison between the patient/family and PICU team, and be a resource of information for all. Responsibilities of primary intensivist:
Weekly check-in with and availability to patient/family
Attendance at family meetings
Availability to PICU team
Primary nurses will be a team of up to 7 ICU nurses who will provide as much of the bedside care as possible. Responsibilities of primary nurses:
Maintain a primary nurse binder (paper format) for on-going communication about the patient among the team members; it will be their discretion what is information is communicated.
The Primary Nurse or delegate will be involved in all team/family meetings and will be expected/given an opportunity to speak during these meetings.</description>
