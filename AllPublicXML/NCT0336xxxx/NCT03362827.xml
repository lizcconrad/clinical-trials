  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is aimed to assess the LTP-like pain amplification in chronic low back pain
      patients to explore the central and peripheral effect for pain LTP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cross-sectional study. Two groups, including low back pain group and healthy
      subjects group will be arranged in this study. 50 subjects will be recruited in each group,
      The healthy subjects were matched for sex and age in relation to the low back pain group.
      Conditioning electrical stimulation (100 Hz, repeated 5 times with 10 s intervals, 500
      impulses) using circular pin electrodes will be used in both groups to induce LTP-like pain
      amplification. The pain intensity changes to pinprick and light touch stimuli will be
      compared between two groups.

    <measure>Change of pain intensity to pinprick stimuli</measure>
    <time_frame>The pinprick sensation will be measured three times before and six times after the conditioning electrical stimulation with 10 minutes interval throughout the experiment (90 minutes).</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanical pinprick-evoked perception was assessed by three weighted pinprick stimulators which were randomly applied in the area adjacent to the conditioned site. The subjects indicated the perceived intensity on the same visual analogue scale(VAS).</description>

    <measure>Perception Features of conditioning electrical stimulation (CES)</measure>
    <time_frame>All subjects will rate the pain ratings during the 50 seconds stimulation.</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects were asked to rate continuously the magnitude of pain induced by the 100 Hz CES using a hand-held visual analogue scale (VAS) device. These VAS ratings were sampled by a computer. The VAS ranges from &quot;0&quot;(no sensation&quot;) to &quot;100&quot; (most imaginable pain) where &quot;30&quot; means pain threshold.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of pain intensity to light-stroking stimuli</measure>
    <time_frame>The light-touch sensation will be measured three times before and six times after the conditioning electrical stimulation with 10 minutes interval throughout the experiment (90 minutes).</time_frame>
    <description>A cotton swab was used for light stroking stimuli (~100mN) for assessing the tactile perception around the conditioned site.</description>

    <measure>Change of pain intensity to single electrical stimulation (SES)</measure>
    <time_frame>The pain ratings to SES will be measured three times before and six times after the conditioning electrical stimulation with 10 minutes interval throughout the experiment (90 minutes).</time_frame>
    <description>A single rectangular 1 ms constant-current electrical stimulation was applied as a homotopic electrical test stimulus using the same conditioning electrode placed at the conditioned site.</description>
