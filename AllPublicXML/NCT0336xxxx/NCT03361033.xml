  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with brain tumors are at risk for a number of psychological late effects, including
      neurocognitive and social deficits. This observational study focuses on assessment of social
      functioning, including social-cognitive and neurocognitive abilities, in survivors of
      pediatric brain tumors. This study will also assess the influence of medical factors,
      including diagnosis and age at diagnosis, on social functioning.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Examine the impact of social-cognitive and neurocognitive abilities on
      social functioning in survivors of pediatric brain tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: Assess the influence of medical factors such as diagnosis and age at
      diagnosis on the social functioning of survivors of pediatric brain tumors.

    <textblock>
      Assessment of social and neurocognitive functioning in survivors of pediatric brain tumors
      who are least two years post-therapy and between 8 and 12 years of age will be included.
      Participants will be recruited from two tumor types: 1) medulloblastoma, and 2) other brain
      tumors that were not treated with craniospinal irradiation. Upon enrollment, participants
      will complete standard psychological questionnaires used to evaluate both performance-based
      and self-report measures of social and neurocognitive functioning. Parents will complete
      questionnaires. Families will be asked for permission to contact teachers to complete
      additional questionnaires. Children will identify their best friend as part of their
      questionnaires and will be asked permission to contact this friend to complete two
      questionnaires. Finally, children will be asked to complete an online daily diary of social
      interactions for seven days.
