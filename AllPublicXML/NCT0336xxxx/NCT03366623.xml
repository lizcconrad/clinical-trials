      This study evaluates the effect of an intervention with a hospital clown compared to standard
      care on pain experience for acute hospitalized children receiving venipuncture. Half of the
      children will receive an intervention with the hospital clown while the other half will
      receive standard care.

      Background: Hospitalized children describe the pain associated with painful procedures as one
      of the worst experiences during hospitalization. These experiences can be traumatic for
      children and their families. Most children are acutely hospitalized with no chance to prepare
      the child for painful procedures, while others experience repeated hospitalizations. Previous
      negative pain experiences are known to have major consequences for future admissions and
      procedures. Therefore, there is a need for different interventions for pain relief. In 2004,
      hospital clowns became a part of the team on pediatric wards in Denmark. International
      studies have shown positive effects of hospital clowns on preoperative anxiety in children,
      but there is limited knowledge of the impact on the child's experience related to painful
      procedures.

      The overall purpose of this study is to investigate the effect and impact of the hospital
      clown as a non-pharmacological intervention on hospitalized children's pain experience and
      ability to cope during painful procedures in both short and long-term treatment and care.

      Methods: A two-faced mixed methods study design with merging and connecting results and
      findings.

        1. A prospective, randomized open-label trial to identify whether exposure to the hospital
           clown has an effect on pain experience in acute hospitalized children receiving
           venipuncture.

        2. An ethnographic study to uncover the pain experience and ability to cope during painful
           procedures in short-term hospitalization.

        3. An ethnographic study to uncover the influence related to repeated painful procedures,
           as well as uncover if a relationship may have a potential long-term impact.

    <description>The performance of the hospital clown included creating a relation with the child by using different techniques in the venipuncture procedure.
The hospital clown used distraction techniques with music, songs, toys, fake tattoos (a small sticker/label with a picture applied to the skin with water), dream journeys, storytelling and making agreements in collaboration with the child, parents and healthcare personnel.</description>
