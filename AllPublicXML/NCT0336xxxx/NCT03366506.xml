    <textblock>
      Investigation of the epidemiological factors associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS) in Israel with a view to future international collaboration. Particularly addressing:-

        1. Differences between ethnic subgroups

        2. Differences between immigrant and native-born populations

        3. Differences according to military service profile Clinical features gathered at each
           routine visit ,throughout the entire course of the disease, will be recorded in database
           format, in order to correlate with potential epidemiological factors.

           format, in order to correlate with potential epidemiological factors.

      The clinical features will include pattern of onset, details of full clinical exam (
      including ALSFRS-R score, power, reflexes, and other signs of upper or lower-motor neuron
      dysfunction.

      Correlations between different clinical parameters themselves will be made, as well as
      correlation between clinical parameters and other epidemiological factors.
