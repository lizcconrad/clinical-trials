  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the absorption of BMS-986205 into the bloodstream of
      healthy volunteers, when administered as an intact tablet taken orally, or as a crushed
      tablet taken orally with soft food, or as a crushed tablet suspension taken via a nasogastric
      (NG) tube. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequences and
      will receive a single dose of BMS-986205 twice during the course of the study.

          -  Signed written consent form.

          -  Healthy male and female participants (not of childbearing potential), determined by no
             clinically significant deviation from normal in medical history, physical examination,

          -  Any significant acute or chronic illness.

          -  Active tuberculosis (TB) requiring treatment, documented latent TB within the previous
             3 years, or evidence of a past TB infection without documented adequate therapy. All
             participants will be required to have a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test performed at
             screening.

          -  History of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) or any other congenital
             hemolytic anemias.

          -  History of cardiac arrhythmias and/or autonomic instability.

          -  History of pulmonary, renal or liver disease.

          -  History of Gilbert's Syndrome.

          -  Recent (within 6 months of study drug administration) history of smoking or current
             smokers, including use of electronic cigarettes or nicotine-containing products such
             as tobacco for chewing, nicotine patches, nicotine lozenges or nicotine gum.

          -  Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with
             vitiligo or psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger may enroll.
