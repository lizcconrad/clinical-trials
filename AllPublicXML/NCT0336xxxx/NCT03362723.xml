  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, pharmacokinetic study will evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) or
      relative bioavailability (rBA) of three new idasanutlin-tablet variants compared to the
      reference tablet formulation following oral administration of a 300 milligrams (mg) dose in
      participants with solid tumors for whom no further treatment options are available. Following
      the four administrations of idasanutlin in the BE/rBA cycle of the study (Cycle 1),
      participants who have no clinically defined progressive disease and who recover from any
      prior treatment toxicity to Grade less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 1 may enter the optional
      treatment extension phase. This extension phase will continue for additional 28-day cycles or
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed.
