  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of genetic and biologic factors in
      blood donors on red blood cell storage stability after autologous transfusion over the
      different range of storage period of 5-7 days and 35-42 days in healthy volunteers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of time biotin-labeled RBCs can be detected following infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 165 days</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined using enumeration of biotinylated RBCs obtained by flow cytometry from blood samples obtained at various time points from subjects with specified genetic mutations, compared with control subjects without the specified mutation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of storage hemolysis</measure>
    <time_frame>5-7 days and 35-42 days following blood donation</time_frame>
    <description>This will be quantified as percent hemolysis, which accounts for the levels of RBC-derived free hemoglobin in response to cold storage. We will define the associations between the primary endpoints and the quantification of storage hemolysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of red blood cell osmotic hemolysis</measure>
    <time_frame>5-7 days and 35-42 days following blood donation</time_frame>
    <description>This will be quantified by the evaluation of osmotic stress assays. We will define the associations between the primary endpoints and the quantification of osmotic hemolysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percentage of red blood cell oxidative hemolysis</measure>
    <time_frame>5-7 days and 35-42 days following blood donation</time_frame>
    <description>This will be quantified by the evaluation of oxidative stress assays. We will define the associations between the primary endpoints and the quantification of oxidative hemolysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Membrane microvesicle formation</measure>
    <time_frame>5-7 days and 35-42 days following blood donation</time_frame>
    <description>This will be quantified by centrifugation and collection of supernatants from stored red blood cell units.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of biotin labeled red blood cells</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours following blood transfusion</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined as the percentage of biotin-labeled cells remaining in the circulation 24 hours after transfusion relative to the 20-minute post-infusion blood sample.</description>

    <description>We will collect 500 mL of blood. The blood will be processed and split into two bags and labeled with a naturally occurring vitamin, biotin. The blood will then be re-infused back into the same participant at 2 time points (5-7 days and 35-42 days after storage).</description>
