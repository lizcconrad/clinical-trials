      To compare the effect of Operative Plate Fixation Versus Replacement for Mason Type III
      Fracture of Radial Head

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From April 2015 to October 2016, patients with comminuted radial head fractures diagnosed as
      Mason type III are retrospectively included in this study, they were treated with either
      operative plate or radial head replacement. All the patients are regularly followed up in
      clinic. Then we will compare the union rate and clinical functional outcome(Mayo score)
      between the 2 groups at 1 year after surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Men or women aged 18 to 65 years of age with Mason Type III radial head fracture are
        confirmed by radiograph within 1 month post injury Provision of informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pathological fractures Non-displaced (cortical contact) fractures Open fractures Presence
        of vascular or nerve injury Fractures more than 1 month post-injury Limited life expectancy
        due to significant medical co-morbidity Medical contraindication to surgery Inability to
        comply with rehabilitation or form completion Likely problems, in the judgement of the
        investigators, with maintaining follow-up (i.e. patients with no fixed address, patients
        not mentally competent to give consent, etc.)
