  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative recovery after cardiac surgery is influenced by early sternal bone stability.
      Traditional sternal closure of median sternotomy usually entails the use of 6-10 stainless
      steel wires. Augmenting sternal closure with techniques to enhance early bone stability
      should accelerate functional recovery from cardiac surgery thereby reducing post-operative
      pain, decreasing the need for narcotics, improving breathing and chest wall mechanics,
      stimulating early mobility and expediting hospital discharge.

      This study is a randomized, single-centre, double-blind clinical study comparing the effects
      of Montage bone putty plus conventional wire closure vs conventional wire closure only on the
      post-operative recovery of cardiac surgery patients with full medial sternotomy.

      Patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are participating in the study will be randomized to
      either conventional wire cerclage or conventional wire closure plus the use of Montage bone
      putty. Patients will be followed post-operatively Day 3, 5 and at discharge as well as weeks
      2, 4, 6 and months 3, 6 and 12.

      Each visit will include: Pain assessment, wound assessment, sternal assessment,
      analgesic/antibiotic use, spirometry testing, quality of life questionaries (EQ-5D/HAQ) and
      determination of any adverse events. Chest x-rays will done at discharge and 3, 6, and 12
      months to look at sternal healing.

      This pilot study will include a total of 65 patient (40 conventional + putty / 20
      conventional/ 5 initial open label with putty).
