    <masking_description>Stage I: the administration sequences of the 4 groups were CABD, ADCB, BCDA and DBAC respectively. D represents moxifloxacin, the positive control drug, for which an open design was adopted. For the other 3 groups, i.e. 500 mg nemonoxacin, 750 mg nemonoxacin, and placebo, a double-blind design was employed.
Stage II: An open design for 12 subjects who had completed Stage I to receive a single oral dose of 500 mg nemonoxacin after taking a high-fat test meal</masking_description>
