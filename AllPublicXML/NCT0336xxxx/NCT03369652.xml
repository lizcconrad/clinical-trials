  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the feasibility of cooperation between clinical pharmacists and physicians by
      conducting a telephone follow-up conversation between the hospital geriatrician, the general
      practitioner and the clinical pharmacist is evaluated. During hospital stay the clinical
      pharmacist and the geriatrician will review older patients' medication and discuss the future
      treatment with the general practitioner after discharge by telephone or medico-technology.

      The first part of the feasibility study will be a qualitative baseline measure of
      characteristics of the participants and work flow. The second part will be a pilot randomized
      controlled study where participants will be allocated to either usual care or medication
      review and follow up contact
