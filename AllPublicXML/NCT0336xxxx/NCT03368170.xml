  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IRL790 is an experimental small molecule compound with psychomotor stabilizing properties.
      The primary target is the dopamine D3 receptor, a target implicated in the generation of
      levodopa-induced dyskinesia, a side-effect frequently occurring with long-term levodopa
      treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. In experimental animals IRL790 potently
      reduced levodopa-induced involuntary movement without impairing the antiparkinsonian effect
      of levodopa.

      The primary purpose of the trial is to investigate whether IRL790 given as adjunctive
      treatment can reduce levodopa induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's disease. The
      trial will also help to establish the most optimal dosing of the compound.
