  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if apalutamide in combination with
      abiraterone acetate and prednisone can help to control metastatic (has spread)
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that has a certain type of biomarker in the
      tumor. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the
      study drug(s).

      This is an investigational study. Apalutamide is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes. The combination of abiraterone acetate and
      prednisone is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of mCRPC.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 4 apalutamide
      tablets by mouth 1 time at about the same time each day with or without food.

      You will take 4 abiraterone acetate tablets by mouth 1 time at about the same time every day.
      Do not eat for at least 2 hours before your dose and for at least 1 hour after the dose of
      abiraterone acetate.

      You will take prednisone by mouth 1 time every day. You can take the dose with or without
      food, but it is recommended that you take prednisone with a meal.

      You may take these tablets together, when possible. All tablets should be swallowed whole and
      not crushed or chewed.

      If you overdose (take 2 days of study drugs or more in 24 hours), contact the study doctor
      right away.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long for as long as the doctor thinks it is in
      your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Week 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to check for genetic
           mutations (changes).

      On Day 1 of Week 4 and then every 4 weeks starting at Week 9 (Weeks 13, 17, 21, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam

        -  You will have an EKG (Weeks 5 and 9).

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to check your PSA
           levels. During Week 9, this sample will also be used to check your testosterone levels.

      On Day 1 of Week 13 and every 12 weeks after that (Weeks 25, 37, 49, and so):

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

        -  At Week 13 only, you will have a chest x-ray, MRI, and a bone scan to check the status
           of the disease. If the chest x-ray shows signs of disease, you will also have a chest CT
           scan.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      As soon as possible after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to check your PSA and
           testosterone levels.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
