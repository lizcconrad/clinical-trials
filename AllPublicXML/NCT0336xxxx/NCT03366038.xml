  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is one of the most complicated surgical procedure and one of the
      standard treatments for benign and malignant disease of pancreatic head and periampullary
      region. Improvements in surgical techniques and the perioperative management of patients
      undergoing PD have reduced the surgical mortality rates to less than 3% in high-volume
      medical centers. However, the incidence of postoperative complication remains high, which
      ranges from 30% to 50% and the pancreatic fistula rate ranges from 5% to 40%. The key point
      of PD is still the enteric reconstruction of pancreatic stump. There were different
      techniques of enteric reconstruction, including: invagination pancreaticojejunostomy, binding
      pancreaticojejunostomy, duct-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy, Roux-en-Y
      pancreaticojejunostomy, and pancreaticogastrostomy and each technique had its advantages and
      disadvantages. We established a new digestive reconstruction technique named shark mouth
      modified pancreaticojejunostomy, which had theoretical advantages including easier performed;
      lower tension and less complication. The shark mouth modified pancreaticojejunostomy is an
      end-to-end pancreaticojejunostomy procedure which is between invagination
      pancreaticojejunostomy and binding pancreaticojejunostomy.The remnant of jejunum is shaped as
      shark mouth and then sutured with the pancreas remnant. After the surgery, the patients will
      be well followed up. The pancreaticojejunostomy time, post-operation complication, mortality
      and hospital stay will be documented to study the safety, efficiency and advantage of this
      new procedure.

    <textblock>
      A pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) still remains the curable treatment choice for most of
      malignant and benign neoplasms of the head of the pancreas and periampullary region. Though
      the safety of PD has been significantly improved, the post-operative pancreatic fistula
      (POPF) always is a formidable complication. More and more attention was focused on the
      different procedure of enteric reconstruction of pancreatic stump, which might be the key
      point to reduce the POPF.

      This is a prospective clinical trial performed in the general surgery department of Peking
      University Third Hospital. All pancreatic remnants are reconstructed with the method of Shark
      Mouth Modified Pancreaticojejunostomy. Shark Mouth Modified Pancreaticojejunostomy is
      performed as standardized procedure and all the detailed data of this procedure is
      documented, including gland texture, pancreas duct diameter, size of the stent, width of the
      pancreatic stump and diameter of the jejunum transverse incision. Silicone tube is inserted
      as internal stents and fixed on the pancreas remnant with non-absorbable sutures. The distal
      end of the tube should exceed the anastomosis of the common bile duct and jejunum. The same
      perioperative management strategies are conducted in all patients. Drainages are placed in
      all patients during the surgeries. Prophylactic somatostatin analogue are used in all cases
      for 3 days post operations.

      Theoretically, the incision of &quot;Shark Mouth&quot; might facilitate the pancreaticojejunostomy
      especially for the large pancreatic remnant; the feature of anastomosis might reduce the
      tension of pancreaticojejunostomy, which is important for the healing of anastomosis and
      might reduce the risk of POPF in the soft pancreas; the characters of anastomosis permits
      total drainage of pancreatic remnant, which is crucial in the situation of thinner pancreatic
      ducts.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the new anastomosis called &quot;Shark Mouth
      Modified Pancreaticojejunostomy&quot;, especially the morbidity of POPF.

    <description>The remnant of jejunum is closed by continuous suture. The transverse incision is made on the posterior wall of the jejunum (5 centimeters distal to remnantï¼‰, which starts at 0.2 centimeter to the mesenteric border and should never exceed the anti-mesenteric border . In case of large pancreas remnant, a longitudinal jejunum incision will be done at anterior part of anastomosis.
The posterior part of anastomosis is two layers of intermittent suture, including seromuscular suture layer and full thickness suture layer. The anterior part of anastomosis is a single layer full thickness suture. At last, the seromuscular layer of the proximal jejunum is sutured with the anterior pancreatic capsule to cover the anterior part of anastomosis.</description>
