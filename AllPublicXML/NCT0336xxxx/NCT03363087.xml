      There is increasing evidence that having AF is associated with some scarring of the upper
      chamber of the heart, the left atrium. There is also evidence that the amount of scarring can
      predict ablation success rates. Recently, rapid ultra high density mapping equipment has
      become available and this has the capability of defining the electrical scar in the atrium in
      detail. The equipment used to do this is standard approved equipment for the procedure but
      its use for making scar maps has not been fully assessed.

      In the mapping phase of the study therefore, the aim will be to collect high density scar
      maps in AF and normal rhythm to see how they compare. Maps will be collected in different
      ways to see if that changes their accuracy. The study will also assess if the values
      previously suggested as representing scar with lower density mapping systems are still
      appropriate where high density mapping equipment is used. The results from this study will
      help to improve the understanding of scar in the atrium and help demonstrate the most
      efficient way to collect scar information using this high density mapping equipment. In the
      future, clinicians may be able to use these very detailed scar maps to tailor and refine the
      way they ablate patients with AF, though the focus of the current study is just on collecting
      the scar information.

      While identifying areas requiring ablation is important to an ablation procedure, the other
      important aspect is the efficacy of ablation. Until now, we have been reliant on assessing
      our inputs into an ablation (such as the level of contact and the power delivered) but have
      been limited in the assessment of the output of an ablation in terms of lesion
      characteristics. New ablation catheter technology is now available which can assess the
      localised impedance drop with ablation. This is likely a better surrogate for lesion
      parameters than what we have previously had available and merits further study. Based on such
      study, we may be able to define targets for ablation which would help to guide future
      ablations.

      The study would propose to use the Rhythmia Ultra High Density (UHD) mapping system (Boston
      Scientific) firstly to generate scar maps to determine if the results are comparable with
      previous work using lower density systems. Scar maps would be acquired in 3 groups of
      patients. The first group would be Redo-persistent AF ablation cases as these patients would
      have expected LA scar (iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic) from their previous ablation procedure.
      De novo persistent AF patients who would be expected to have non-iatrogenic scar. De novo
      paroxysmal AF patients who would be expected to have no or minimal scar. In redo AF patients,
      the validity of the scar maps would be further explored by undertaking re-isolation of veins
      based on discontinuities in the pulmonary vein isolation lines. If this is proven to be
      effective, it would demonstrate that the scar picked up by the system is genuine and may also
      suggest a more effective use of UHD systems for redo-pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).

      In the ablation phase, we would be assessing the effect of ablation on the localised ablation
      characteristics of the tissue to assess how this is affected by ablation. From previous work,
      using conventional, wide area impedance measurements, there is a notable plateau in the
      impedance drop with ablation suggesting a point beyond which there is minimal efficacy gain
      from further ablation. One would expect this would be even more apparent with localised
      impedance.

      Original Hypothesis - mapping phase An UHD mapping system can be utilised to generate
      automated, rapid, high density atrial scar maps in AF to guide a scar-based ablation
      strategy.

      Original Hypothesis - ablation phase Localised Impedance will fall during ablation and this
      fall will plateau, suggesting a biophysical target for ablation

      There is a small body of literature addressing contact mapping of atrial scar but this has
      mainly relied on lower density mapping approaches. UHD mapping systems offer the advantage of
      true high-density mapping with improved signal to noise ratios that one would predict will
      lead to the generation of more accurate maps. These advantages are also such that one would
      predict scar maps in AF would be more accurate. Extending the scar maps to incorporate the RA
      is also novel in this context and would give an insight into the degree to which AF is a
      bi-atrial fibrotic cardiomyopathy. As the use of UHD mapping is novel, it is important to
      establish how relevant criteria used in lower density, lower fidelity mapping systems are
      when the newer system is used, especially in defining scar.

      No clinical studies have been published assessing localised impedance.

      Protocol Fifteen patients listed for persistent AF ablation would be recruited including
      redo-ablation patients (aiming for 5 de novo and 10 redo patients). All these patients would
      be in AF at the time of the procedure. A further 5 patients with paroxysmal AF would also be
      recruited. Procedures would be performed on uninterrupted anticoagulation with a
      pre-procedural TOE as dictated by local guidelines. Moderate sedation or general anaesthetic
      procedures would be included. Intravenous heparin would be used to maintain the ACT at a
      therapeutic level throughout the study. All mapping would be undertaken using the Orion high
      density multipolar mapping catheter with the Rhythmia system. The ablation catheter used
      would be the IntellaNav MiFi Open Irrigated Temperature Ablation Catheter.

      An RA scar map would be obtained using WCT as a reference. Double transseptal access would be
      obtained and the mapping and ablation catheters passed into the LA.

      An LA scar map would be taken with the mapping catheter. For paroxysmal AF cases in sinus
      rhythm, this would be the only LA map taken. For patients in AF, maps would be taken in AF
      and then in sinus rhythm. In redo cases, the veins which the scar map suggests are likely to
      be reconnected would be noted (based on discontinuities in the wide area circumferential
      ablation (WACA) lines). The mapping catheter would then be used to confirm the presence of
      electrical reconnection of each vein. The patient would then be cardioverted if in AF and the
      mapping process repeated using a WCT reference. With all maps, the aim would be complete LA
      coverage. For the sinus rhythm maps, the LA will be divided into 5 sites: roof, posterior
      wall, inferior wall, septum, anterior wall bordering left atrial appendage. Within each of
      these sites, the pacing threshold will be assessed at 3 locations incorporating a spread of
      bipolar voltages.

      Following the mapping phase, the case would then proceed as per the operator's standard
      methodology. The aim would be to collect at least 30 static study ablation points as
      discussed above. Vein re-isolation would be performed without any catheter measuring
      electrical activity in the vein, purely based on the scar map, targeting discontinuities in
      the WACA lines. Ablations would be static rather than drag ablations and at each point, the
      electrogram from the MiFi electrodes would be recorded at the start and end of ablation.
      Pacing would be performed during ablation and the impedance value at which pacing capture was
      lost would be noted. Following this ablation, the mapping catheter would be utilised to
      establish if the vein has been electrically disconnected based on the scar map.

      At the end of the case, in sinus rhythm, scar maps of the RA would be taken. In sinus rhythm,
      pacing would be undertaken as for the LA at the following sites: anterior wall, posterior
      wall, septum and lateral wall.

      The scar maps would be exported offline to allow quantitative analysis, as would the
      electrogram and impedance data. The analysis would be performed using the Matlab programming
      environment.

      The scar analysis will exclude any portions of the LA distal to the WACA lines. The initial
      step will be to give a low voltage zone percentage. The next step will be to identify
      congruent low voltage zones and give advice regarding the ablation strategy for these -
      whether this involved delivering lines, for instance for a large posterior wall scar, and if
      the ablation needs to be extended to other inexcitable structures to prevent leaving a narrow
      conducting isthmus.

      Study Follow up There would be no additional follow up for this study - the participants'
      follow up will follow the normal clinical practice at University Hospital Southampton.
