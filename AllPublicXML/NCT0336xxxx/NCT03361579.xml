  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open Label Placebo application has been shown to be effective in treatment of chronic pain
      (low back pain) and disease like the irritable bowel Syndrome. Data about effects on acute
      pain are spare.

      The study investigates the effect of an open-label Placebo (substance without a medical
      active component) application on acute pain, evoked via a artificial pain model in healthy
      male volunteers. 32 healthy male volunteers are recruited.

    <time_frame>30 minutes after baseline until 100 minutes after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain response measured by creating the Area under the Pain Curve (AUPC), using the numeric rating scale (NRS) from minute 30 to 100 during constant induced pain with electrical current at the forearm of the participant. Measuring of pain every 10 minutes from minute 30 to 100 (Minute 30,40,50,60,70,80,90, 100) in an experimental setting. Main comparison: The effect of open label placebo v.s. no treatment intervention</description>

    <description>Prior to the intervention during the Placebo is given, the volunteer receives a detailed information about the effect and the strength of an open-label placebo. This education is performed via a slide show and a news report video. The important terms for Placebo analgesia: positive expectations, conditioning, communication are discussed</description>
