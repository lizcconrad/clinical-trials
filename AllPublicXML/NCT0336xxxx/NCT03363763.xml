    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sirolimus (0.2% and
      0.4% formulations) and its vehicle when applied topically once daily for 12 weeks for the
      treatment of cutaneous angiofibromas in pediatric subjects with tuberous sclerosis complex
      (TSC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed
      to assess the safety and efficacy of topically-applied sirolimus for the treatment of
      cutaneous angiofibromas in pediatric subjects with TSC. The investigational product is
      sirolimus (0.2% and 0.4%), administered as an ointment formulation for topical administration
      during the double-blind treatment period. Subjects entering the open-label treatment period
      will receive sirolimus 0.2% administered as an ointment formulation for topical
      administration.

      Study subjects will be enrolled at 3-5 investigational sites in the United States (US).
      Approximately 45 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will randomly assigned in a 1:1:1
      ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatments. Subjects, or a parent/guardian, will apply the study
      medication topically to the cutaneous angiofibromas on the face once daily at night before
      going to bed for 12 weeks. Subjects who complete the doubleblind phase of the study, with an
      overall compliance rate &gt;80%, as determined by the number of dose days divided by the total
      of days between visits, will be offered entry into an open-label period for an additional 12
      weeks.The maximum study duration for each subject will be approximately 32 weeks and includes
      a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a blinded treatment period of 12 weeks, optional open
      label period of 12 weeks, and a follow-up period of 4 weeks.

      An interim analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed the double-blind phase
      (Visit 5 - Week 12). The data will be unblinded to assess for efficacy and results reported.
