  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome and ocular surface disease are very important ophthalmologic diseases. It is
      known that various inducers are involved. However, it is still necessary to study how
      influencing factors are related to dry eye syndrome and ocular surface disease and how
      treatment for dry eye syndrome and ocular surface disease is helpful.
