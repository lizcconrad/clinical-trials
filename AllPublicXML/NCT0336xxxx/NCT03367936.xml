      The overall purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to examine the effect and efficacy
      of the individualized, real-time, smartphone-based feedback of diet and physical activity
      self-monitoring on subsequent weight-control behaviors, weight loss outcomes and
      sustainability of patient engagement. Participants will be randomized into one of 2 groups:
      (1) Self-Monitoring -similar to what many people do on the participant's own, subjects will
      self-monitor diet, physical activity using Fitbit and weight using a Bluetooth-enabled scale,
      and (2) Self-Monitoring +Feedback-participants will self-monitor as described for the
      Self-Monitoring group but also will receive tailored Feedback messages. The Self-Monitoring
      +Feedback participants will receive up to 4 daily discrete pop-up Feedback messages on the
      participant's smartphone delivered at random times during waking hours and tailored to
      content of recorded entries in the subjects' smartphone-based diaries and a weekly summary
      Feedback message about the participant's weight.

      This study includes the following activities:

        1. Screening:

           Phase I: it will be conducted online. Respondents to recruitment solicitations will be
           provided an online Uniform Resource Locator (URL) with a hyperlink to a study flier that
           describes the essential elements of the study. It will also include a choice of URL or
           Quick Response (QR) code to access a Qualtrics online survey that will provide more
           details about the study. The investigator will also ask preliminary questions about
           eligibility (age, height and weight to calculate BMI), and consent to have the research
           team review the participant's answers.

           Phase II: it will be conducted online. Those who meet these criteria in Phase I will be
           notified via a second email with a link to another survey online and consent for
           providing more in-depth health history, including diagnosis of major medical conditions.
           After completing an online consent, the participants will provide personal information
           in the Sociodemographic and Lifestyle Questionnaire and health and medical conditions in
           the General Health History questionnaire.

           Individuals who remain eligible will be invited to a screening appointment where the
           investigators measure the participant's height/weight for BMI, and explain the aims of
           the study and the 2 group conditions. If interested in participating, attendees will be
           asked to sign a consent form for the baseline data collection. At this visit, the
           participants will be asked to complete the Eating Habits Checklist (EHC) to screen for
           eating disorders; a one-page questionnaire (Quick WAVE140) that assesses current diet
           and PA habits, and the CES-D.

           Run-in period: to minimize attrition and ensure that potential subjects are appropriate
           for the intervention, investigators will teach all eligible individuals how to download
           and complete a 5-day Self-Monitoring diary using the My Food Diary (Fitbit)
           Self-Monitoring program on the participant's phone or other computer. After review of
           the diary, investigators will contact the potential participant to schedule the baseline
           assessment. Individuals need to record at least 700 kcal/day of food intake to be
           eligible for the study. Each user will have a username and password and also have the
           ability to manage the participant'sown privacy settings.

        2. Randomization:

           At the end of the baseline assessment when eligibility is confirmed, the research staff
           will use a computer software program on a laptop to determine to which group the
           individual will be randomized. (Prior to this time, the randomization scheme will be
           implemented via a computerized program (Visual Basic 6.0) using minimization method,
           which will be overseen by a statistician (Co-PI: S Sereika). Each of the 2
           conditions(Self-Monitoring alone or Self-Monitoring plus Feedback) will be assigned a
           total of 265 subjects with randomization stratified by gender and race. After
           randomization, all participants will receive instructions on using the Fitbit Charge 2™
           for physical activity and the Withings scale for self-weighing.

        3. Intervention:

      The intervention will consist of the Self-Monitoring and Feedback program and remote guidance
      to a lifestyle program for weight loss. All participants will be subscribed to My Food Diary
      an online Self-Monitoring program that can be accessed via the participant's smartphone or
      any computer. The interventionists will have access to the diaries so the participants can
      contact a participant if there is any safety concern about the reported eating behaviors. The
      study will provide all participants a wrist-worn FitBit Charge 2™ to self-monitor the
      participant's physical activity which synchs with the participant's phone or computer. The
      study will also provide all participants a Bluetooth-enabled scale (Withings) for
      self-monitoring the participant's weight. The scale will transmit the weight values to the
      smartphone, LoseIt! and server, so the research team will know the weight status of
      participants. The subject registers as the primary scale user and is subsequently recognized
      and distinguished from other household users. The scale displays the weight accurately to the
      10th decimal. The data are converted to graphs for easy review. Batteries have a 6-12 month
      life. The scale measures weights between 5 and 180 kg. participants will weigh themselves
      with device daily; participants will be able to view the participant's weight data on the
      participant's smartphone. The Fitbit will provide data on daily steps and distance walked,
      which will be used to inform the selection of message that the investigators will provide
      participants in the Self-Monitoring plus Feedback group feedback messages related to physical
      activity. The data that will be transmitted between the Fitbit and Pitt servers will not
      contain any identifying personal information nor will Fitbit store any identifying
      information for the participants except the participant's usernames and email addresses,
      which are necessary to create a user account.

        1. Self-Monitoring group: Individuals in this condition will not receive Feedback messages.
           All subjects will use a smartphone to self-monitor diet (LoseIt!), Fitbit Charge HR to
           monitor PA, and a Withings digital scale for weight. Both LoseIt! and Fitbit app are
           publically available. At the baseline visit following randomization, participants will
           be oriented to Self-Monitoring and the various Self-Monitoring devices and apps, and
           provided a tutorial with images shown on the laptop and devices as well as printed
           materials showing the screen shots. At this baseline session, each participant will have
           a one-on-one session with the project interventionist which covers the core principles
           of behavioral weight loss to ensure all understand basic recommendations for safe and
           effective weight loss. The participants also will be given personalized fat, calorie,
           and physical activity goals for weight loss and information about how to access the
           intervention materials from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) online which is
           publically available(https://www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu/).

        2. Self-Monitoring+Feedback -This group will receive up to 4 Feedback messages per day
           (messages will be delivered between the hours set by the participants on the
           participant's phone, e.g., 8 AM and 9:30 PM). Messages will be delivered automatically,
           remotely and in real-time. it will be tailored to each participant's progress based on
           standardized algorithms. At the baseline visit following randomization, participants
           will be oriented to Self-Monitoring and the various Self-Monitoring devices and apps,
           and provided a tutorial with images shown on the laptop and devices as well as printed
           materials showing the screen shots. In addition, the Feedback program will be explained
           to them and how this is responsive to information entered on the Self-Monitoring
           diaries. Also, the participants will be given a brief handout on fat, calorie, physical
           activity and weight goals for weight loss and information about how to access the
           intervention materials from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) online.

      Research team are able to review the Self-Monitoring data, and will check the data weekly. As
      long as any indication of rapid weight loss or periods of inactivity occurs, research staff
      will contact the subject.
