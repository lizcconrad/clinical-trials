  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, randomized, 15-day clinical trial is being conducted to assess the
      changes to the skin microbiome of induced wounds on the back in approximately 35 healthy
      adult subjects aged 18-55 years, with Fitzpatrick Skin Types I - III. Microbiome and skin
      physiology assessments will be completed.
