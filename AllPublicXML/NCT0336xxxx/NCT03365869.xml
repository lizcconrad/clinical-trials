      The purpose of the study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of sirolimus treatment
      for people with systemic sclerosis.

      The investigators perform a multi-centre, double-blind pilot trial with sirolimus in SSc.The
      investigators evaluate the effectiveness and safeness of sirolimus for Systemic Sclerosis by
      randomized controlled study (sirolimus 2mg/d (N = 36) versus placebo group (N = 36)).

      Each SSc patients (n=72) received sirolimus or placebo (active group: placebo group =1:1,
      2mg/day， oral administration, (SIR 2mg, po., Qd) .

      The end points were the changement of modified RSS and the adverse events or severe adverse
      events onset.
