  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a knowledge gap regarding the optimal initial fluid to achieve effective
      resuscitation and improved outcomes in septic shock. The purpose of this study is to compare
      initial resuscitation with plasma to initial resuscitation with balanced crystalloids.

    <description>Initial resuscitation with plasma will be 10 mL/kg (700 mL in a typical 70 kg adult). Traditional doses of plasma, when used to correct coagulopathy range from 10-15 mL/kg.23 The plasma will be administered at a rate of 2-3 mL/kg/hr (140-210 mL/hr in a typical 70 kg adult). A research physician will be at bedside to follow patient resuscitation. Plasma administration may be terminated before the entire dose is administered if patients show clinical improvement. After the initial dose of plasma has been given, subsequent resuscitation will follow usual care using balanced crystalloids.</description>
