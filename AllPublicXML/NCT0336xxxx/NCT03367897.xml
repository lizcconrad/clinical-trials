  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study of bleeding peptic ulcers and/or erosions in the upper gastrointestinal
      tract - risk-medication, presence of Helicobacter pylori, treatment and outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to hospital due to hematemesis and/or melena with endoscopic finding of
      ulcer and/or erosion in the ventricle and/or duodenum are eligible for inclusion in the BLUE
      study after an informed consent has been obtained. The gastroscopy must be performed within
      72 hours after admission. Epidemiological data, comorbidity and past clinical history are
      recorded in addition to the consumption of defined risk medication and proton-pump inhibitors
      (PPI) during the last 4 weeks.

      The Forrest classification is used to describe an ulcer if present at endoscopy and
      endoscopic modalities for treatment are used according to established recommendations.
      Surgery or radiological intervention will be applied if needed.

      An infection with H. Pylori is diagnosed by different methods including a rapid urease test,
      culture and serology. If one of these tests is positive, the patient will receive triple
      therapy. To secure successful eradication patients are tested with 13C UBT (breath test) or
      HP antigen stool test after 3 months and HP IgG serology after 6 months.

      Registration of lowest haemoglobin (Hb) level during hospitalization and an algorithm to
      treatment with blood transfusion and/or high dose IV iron will be performed to evaluate
      alternative treatments to blood transfusions alone. Effect of treatment is evaluated at 8
      weeks and 6 months. A follow-up gastroscopy and blood test is performed after 2-3 months.
