    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Salmeterol/Fluticasone
      50/500 mcg Inhalation Powder treatment administered via Capsair twice daily and original
      product Seretide Diskus 500 mcg Inhalation Powder treatment twice daily in patients with
      moderate-severe COPD.

      Spirometric measurements will be performed at 12 different time points at pre-treatment and
      post-treatment (5. min, 15. min, 30. min, 1. hr, 2. hr, 3.hr, 4.hr, 6.hr, 8.hr, 10.hr and
      12.hr) during the treatment visits of 11-weeks study period.

      The aim of the current study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Salmeterol/Fluticasone
      50/500 mcg Inhalation Powder treatment administered via Capsair twice daily and original
      product Seretide Diskus 500 mcg Inhalation Powder treatment twice daily in patients with
      moderate-severe COPD.

      Patients who met all the inclusion criteria will enter a 1-week run-in period with the length
      determine by the specific medication, during which their usual treatment will be stopped and
      they will receive salbutamol as required.

      Following run-in period, patients will be randomly assigned to receive Salmeterol/Fluticasone
      50/500 mcg as dry powder capsule for inhalation by Capsair or Salmeterol/Fluticasone 50/500
      mcg as dry powder for inhalation by Diskus twice daily for 8-weeks treatment period.

      Patients will be evaluated at 6 consecutive visits: baseline (enrollment), screening,
      treatment (treatment initiation, after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment) and after treatment (will
      carry out by telephone two weeks following the last dose of study medication).

      Spirometric measurements will be performed at 12 different time points at pre-treatment and
      post-treatment (5. min, 15. min, 30. min, 1. hr, 2. hr, 3.hr, 4.hr, 6.hr, 8.hr, 10.hr and
      12.hr) during the treatment visits of 11-weeks study period.

      Safety will be assessed through vital signs, adverse events, serious adverse events and all
      cause mortality.

    <description>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), a measure of the degree of breathlessness, captures changes from baseline. Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. BDI will be measured at day 1 prior to the first dose with domain scores ranging from 0=very severe to 4=no impairment and a total score ranging from 0 to 12(best).</description>

    <description>SGRQ is a 51-item health related quality of life questionnaire and it consists of three sections; Symptoms-measuring the frequency and severity of respiratory symptoms, Activity-measuring limitation of activities by breathlessness and activities that cause breathlessness and Impacts-measuring disturbances in social and psychological functioning due to airway disease. It will be performed to evaluate quality of life of the patients by comparing pre-treatment and post-treatment values. The lowest possible value is zero and the highest 100. Higher values correspond to greater impairment in quality of life.</description>
