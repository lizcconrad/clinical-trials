      1. Background and Rationale:

           Little is currently known about intrinsic risk factors for sport-related concussion in
           youth ice hockey players. Emerging research suggests that alterations in cervical and
           balance function increase the risk of concussion in youth ice hockey players. Thus,
           evaluation of a primary prevention program aimed at addressing alterations in cervical
           and vestibular function may result in a protective effect in reducing the risk of
           concussion. Such a program targeting intrinsic risk factors for concussion has not
           previously been evaluated and thus a pilot Randomized control trial (RCT) to inform the
           feasibility and efficacy of such a program is needed prior to proceeding to evaluation
           of such a program on a larger scale.

        2. Research Question and Objectives

           The primary objectives of this pilot RCT study are: 1) To evaluate the feasibility of a
           concussion prevention program in youth ice hockey players; and 2) To evaluate the
           efficacy of a concussion prevention program in decreasing the risk of concussion.
           Exploratory objectives include evaluating the changes in quality of life, clinical
           measures of cervical and vestibular function measures and Hockey Canada on-ice skills
           testing in youth ice hockey players following a concussion prevention program.

        3. Methods

      This study will be a pilot RCT. Prior to the 2017 hockey season, 120 players from 8 youth ice
      hockey teams ages 13-17 will be recruited to participate. Once parental consent and/or player
      assent has been obtained, players will complete a series of initial intake forms. Baseline
      tests and measures, including a standardized preseason baseline questionnaire (regarding
      playing history, past medical history, participation in sport) and a battery of
      questionnaires and clinical measures. Individuals will be randomly allocated into either a
      control protocol (general cardiovascular warm-up, general stretching and strengthening,
      education on concussion identification) or a specific protocol (balance, neuromotor control,
      strength, vestibulo-ocular and oculomotor training + concussion education). Both groups will
      meet with the study physiotherapist once weekly for 4 weeks and exercises will be progressed.
      A previously validated prospective injury surveillance system will be implemented. As part of
      this process, a team designate will collect data throughout the season regarding individual
      player participation in games, practices and dry land training sessions. Individuals with a
      suspected concussion will be referred to the study sport medicine physician for evaluation,
      diagnosis and standard of care management. At this time all baseline tests and measures will
      be repeated.
