      The primary objectives of the study are outlined below:

        1. To investigate the relative bioavailability and absorption/kinetic profile of
           polyphenols after consumption of watermelon rind, flesh and seeds, respectively in an
           acute pilot study.

        2. To study the effects of watermelon intake on endothelial function using the FMD
           technique and to understand the relationship between plasma metabolites, including
           L-citrulline and arginine, and FMD responses.

      The proposed trial will be a randomized, 4 arm, placebo controlled, within-subject crossover,
      study design. It is a pilot trial to establish methods and collect the preliminary data
      (N=6). Subjects meeting eligibility criteria (see eligibility criteria) will participate in 4
      study visits where they will receive one serving (equivalent to 100 kcal) of 1 of 4
      treatments: watermelon rind, watermelon flesh, watermelon seeds or placebo.

      Qualified subjects from the screening visit will be randomized into the study and provided
      with a standard breakfast consisting of a high carbohydrate and moderate fat western-type
      meal 3 hours after the treatment. Each subject will be asked to come for one screening visit,
      a pre-study visit, and four dinner pick-ups on the day before each of the four test visits.
      The study day visit will last for approximately 9 h with a follow up visit the next day (24
      h) for blood collection to allow for the characterization of target watermelon polyphenols
      and metabolites in plasma. Subjects will be instructed not to alter their usual diet or fluid
      intake during the study periods. Seven days prior to each study day visit, subjects will be
      advised not to consume fruits and vegetables rich in polyphenols and carotenoids or other
      high phytochemical foods (watermelon and products, arugula, spinach, tea, berries, grapes,
      carrots, tomatoes, sweet potatoes etc.).

      Each study visit will involve with blood samples collection at time points 0 (fasting), 0.5,
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 h and 24 hour (h). An assigned test treatment will be provided
      immediately after the 0 h blood collection, a breakfast meal will be provided immediately
      after the 2 h blood collection, and lunch after 6 h blood collection. FMD will be measured at
      0 (fasting), 1, 3, 5, and 7h.
