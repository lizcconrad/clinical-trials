  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of remote ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning to
      standard myocardial protection protocol in patients submitted to off - pump coronary artery
      bypass grafting in a prospective, 1:1 randomized, double blind fashion. An interventional
      group will receive remote ischemic preconditioning 24-hours before OP-CABG, immediately
      before surgery and within 60 minutes following surgery by means of lower limb ischemia
      achieved by pressure cuff inflation, whereas control group will receive sham procedure
      perioperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective, 1:1 randomized and double blind fashion, the study will evaluate the impact
      of remote ischemic preconditioning, both immediate and second window of protection (24 hours
      and immediately before surgery) with remote ischemic postconditiong on operative outcomes in
      patients submitted to coronary artery bypass grafting without use of extracorporeal
      circulation.

      Remote ischemic conditioning was found to provide protection against necrosis and apoptosis
      due to ischemia and reperfusion injury, a phenomenon observed during coronary artery bypass
      grafting. That in turn was associated with poor postoperative outcomes, predominantly poor
      survival.

      Remote ischemic preconditioning will be provided by repeated lower leg ischemia and
      reperfusion with pressure cuff inflation for five minutes and deflation for five minutes in
      three consecutive cycles. Remote ischemic preconditioning will be performed 24 hours before
      CABG and immediately before surgery. Remote ischemic postconditioning will be performed
      within 60 minutes following the last coronary artery bypass graft completion and the
      restoration of coronary blood flow.

      The study will assess clinical endpoints such as postoperative acute myocardial infarction
      (type 5 MI), postoperative mortality, postoperative renal failure and laboratory outcomes
      such as postoperative serial measurements of troponin T release or glomerular filtration rate
      as secondary outcomes.

Remote ischemic postconditioning (5minutes ischemia and 5minutes reperfusion; lower leg ischemia achieved by pressure cuff inflation and deflation) will be administered to the patient within 60 minutes after the completion of all coronary artery bypass grafts and the restoration of coronary blood flow.</description>
