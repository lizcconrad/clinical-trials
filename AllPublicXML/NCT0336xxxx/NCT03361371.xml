      The sample size calculation is based on the assessment of the between-group difference in
      probability of treatment failure. The estimated total re-visit probability in bronchiolitis
      based on a recently published study was approximately 35% within 72 hours of ED discharge.50
      The investigators can therefore reasonably assume this proportion may approach 50% by day 7.
      Using the 50% estimate is conservative since it requires the largest sample size, providing
      at least 80% power regardless of the observed proportions. This is a superiority study in
      which the adoption of nasal suctioning will be recommended for future practice if the
      observed proportion of the primary outcome in this group is significantly lower than in the
      controls. With 186 patients per arm (372 in total) a two-sided test with a type I error of
      0.05 will have 80% power to achieve statistical significance if suctioning reduces the
      probability of treatment failure from 50% to 35% (i.e. absolute reduction of 15%). This
      estimate is based on clinically relevant differences agreed upon by study investigators and
      it also represents an NNT of 7. In the Cochrane review of asthma therapies an NNT of a
      comparable magnitude led to a change in national practice recommendations.52 Since
      bronchiolitis and related medical visits are highly prevalent,20 this target difference would
      also have an important economic impact. Based on our previous bronchiolitis trials, the
      anticipated refusal rate may be 20%. Given the study design and our past experience, the
      study non-completion rate and loss to follow-up can safely be assumed to be no higher than 5%
      each. Therefore, to have complete data on 372 patients the investigators plan to randomize
      412 (i.e. 372/(1 - 0.05)*(1 - 0.05) and to approach 515 (i.e. 412/(1 - 0.20).

      This is a three-center, randomized, outcome assessor- blinded clinical trial of infants
      discharged home from the ED with acute bronchiolitis. Two groups will be compared: infants
      receiving usual bronchiolitis care (see below) during the 7 days post ED discharge versus
      those given usual care plus enhanced nasal suctioning via a standardized nasal aspiration
      ZoLi device just prior to each feeding for 7 days post index ED visit discharge. Evidence
      suggests that suctioning at frequent intervals is associated with movement of secretions from
      the lower airway with improved minute volume. The 7- day study period has been chosen since
      the vast majority of infants discharged from the ED with bronchiolitis experience the
      targeted outcomes within this time frame.

      Prior to the ED discharge, all study participants will receive usual bronchiolitis care
      ordered by the ED physician as per standard of care which consists of supplemental oxygen for
      saturations less than 90% and supplemental IV hydration in those with inadequate oral intake.
      Eligible consenting patients deemed suitable for discharge home (representing approximately
      60-70% of the bronchiolitis population presenting to the ED) will be randomly allocated to
      one of two study groups:

      Control Group: this group will receive standardized routine discharge instructions describing
      information about bronchiolitis, expected course of illness, recommended management
      strategies such as fever control, augmented air humidification, need for frequent feeding and
      warning signs prompting return for care. Some ED treating physicians also recommend removal
      of nasal secretions via dropper attached to a bulb (usual strategy which produces negligible
      negative pressures) or via other commercially available aspirators (used less commonly) -
      this decision will be left up to the treating ED physician and the use of such devices will
      be tracked. This study design is in keeping with the pragmatic nature of the study used to
      show the real-world differences of the intervention. The clinical experience of the
      investigators suggests that the ZoLi device is currently not commonly used. Furthermore, the
      investigators will not reveal the identity of the experimental device to the ED physicians in
      order to minimize contamination of the control group.

      Experimental Group: in addition to the aforementioned usual bronchiolitis care at home, this
      group will undergo nasal suctioning prior to each feeding as needed for 7 days post discharge
      home (unless symptoms completely abate earlier), using exclusively the ZoLi study device (see
      above under study device). Families in this group will be given the ZoLi device at no cost
      and instructed in the appropriate technique and importance of using this tool. This
      explanation may enhance parental motivation to use the device.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of bronchiolitis in the ED as per the AAP diagnosis definition.
             Bronchiolitis is defined as the first episode of viral upper respiratory infection
             with respiratory distress and/or tachypnea for age.

          2. Age 4 weeks up to and including 12 months of age. Participating infants will have to
             be at least 4 weeks post their expected due date of birth since infants with
             bronchiolitis below this age cut-off are at a much higher risk of apnea and
             dehydration than their older counterparts.

          3. Below usual feeding intake in the past 24 hours. This will be screened by the study
             nurse/research assistant who will ask the caregiver(s) the following questions:
             Compared to usual, how has your infant fed in the last 24 hours?

               1. Definitely less than normal but more than half usual intake or some difficulty
                  breastfeeding.

               2. Very much less than normal (less than half usual intake or major difficulty
                  breastfeeding.

          4. Informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous diagnosis of bronchiolitis made more than 3 weeks prior to this ED visit.

          2. Hospitalization at the index ED visit. Although we have considered starting the
             experimental intervention at presentation to the ED, this was deemed counterproductive
             since many patients with bronchiolitis are currently routinely suctioned in the ED
             which would likely contaminate the control arm and impact study results.

          3. Normal/near normal feeding in the past 24 hours. The feeding adequacy will be screened
             by the study nurse who will ask the caregiver(s) the following questions:

             Compared to usual, how has your infant fed in the last 24 hours? Normal/ almost normal
             [more than about 80% usual intake]

          4. Zo-Li battery operated nasal aspirator used at home.

          5. Co-morbidities which may impact outcomes such as known diagnosis of congenital heart
             disease, chronic respiratory disease including known lung disease due to prematurity,
             aspiration due to severe gastro-esophageal reflux, neuro-muscular/neurologic disease,
             immunodeficiency, coagulopathies, nasal/upper airway abnormalities, oral,
             gastrointestinal anomalies [except for corrected pyloric stenosis], tracheo-esophageal
             fistulas, gastric/gastro-jejunal tube feeding supplementation.

          6. Parental poor command of the English/French language.

          7. Must have at least one of the following: home/cellular telephone or e- mail
