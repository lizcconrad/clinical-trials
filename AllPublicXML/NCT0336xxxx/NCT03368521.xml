  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate if a low back pain screening tool is helpful for the
      caregivers to direct the rehabilitation in a more efficient way, at an earlier stage. Primary
      Health care centers in the municipality of Halmstad, Sweden will be enrolled to participate
      in the study as either &quot;Control&quot; or &quot;intervention&quot;. The primary Health care centers who are
      enrolled taking part in the intervention, will use the provided screening tool when taking
      care of patients seeking care for low back pain. Scorings from the screening tool will
      &quot;label&quot; the patients as one of Three pre-defined risk levels. The caregiver will then use the
      provided risk level when deciding how to proceed the rehabilitation. Based on the risk level
      identified, the patient is directed to one of three levels of treatments - including simple
      advice; physiotherapy; or multimodal rehabilitation. The screening tool is used as a
      complement to the examination, allowing the physiotherapist /GP to decide how to proceed with
      rehabilitation using the back screening tool, together with Clinical examinations. The
      Control Group consists of patients recruited when seeking care for back pain at a Primary
      Health Care service who has been randomly selected as &quot;Control&quot;. The care givers at the
      Control primary Health care will conduct as usual, not using the back pain screening tool in
      their Clinical examinations.
