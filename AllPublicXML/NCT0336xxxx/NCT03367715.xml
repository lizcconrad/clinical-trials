        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years.

          -  Histopathological evidence of glioblastoma or gliosarcoma, WHO grade IV.

          -  Tumor MGMT promoter DNA not methylated (i.e., unmethylated) by central testing.

          -  Maximal tumor diameter (including residual tumor and resection cavity if subjects had
             tumor resection rather than only stereotactic biopsy) of 6.6 cm or less. Maximal tumor
             size allowed is derived from an estimated maximal radiotherapy planning target volume
             (PTV) of 150 cm3.

          -  Subjects must not have received any prior standard or investigational anti-tumor
             therapy other than surgery and must not intend to receive any standard or
             investigational anti-tumor therapy other than the study regimen.

          -  Karnofsky performance status (Appendix 2) of ≥60.

          -  Availability of a paraffin-embedded or frozen tumor-tissue block with a minimum of 1
             cm2 of tumor surface area, or 20 unstained slides from the glioblastoma tissue
             specimen if a tumor block cannot be submitted.

          -  Subjects must start study agent within 6 weeks from the first diagnostic surgery for
             glioblastoma.

          -  An interval of at least 2 weeks for surgical resection and 1 week for stereotactic
             biopsy from the start of study treatment.

          -  A contrast-enhanced MRI must be obtained within 7 days of the first dose of study
             treatment.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function defined by

               -  White blood cell count ≥ 2.0 x 109/L

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance
                  (CrCl) ≥ 40 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula or local
                  institutional standard method

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have
                  total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to father a child must agree to
             use highly effective contraception (any contraceptive method with a failure rate of
             less than 1% per year) while on study drug and for 23 weeks (for women) or 31 weeks
             (for men) after the last dose of study drug.

               1. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of
                  initiation of study drug.

               2. WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not
                  undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who
                  is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea
                  in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In
                  addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL to be defined as
                  post-menopausal.

               3. WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a
                  period of 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Men receiving
                  nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to
                  contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational
                  product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the
                  half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that
                  WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually
                  active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days.

               4. Highly effective contraceptive measures include: stable use of oral
                  contraceptives such as combined estrogen and progestogen and progestogen only
                  hormonal contraception or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives for 2
                  or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device [IUD];
                  intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy
                  and sexual abstinence.

               5. Contraception is not required for men with documented vasectomy.

               6. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented
                  hysterectomy or tubal ligation.

               7. Women must not be breastfeeding.

          -  Willing to and capable of providing written informed consent prior to any study
             related procedures.

          -  Ability and willingness to comply with all study requirements, including scheduled
             visits, treatment plans, laboratory tests, and other study-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior use of any standard or investigational anti-tumor therapy other than surgery

          -  Planned participation in another study of an investigational agent or investigational
             device or planned use of any other agent or therapeutic device intended for therapy of

                  of active autoimmune disease.

               4. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan
                  premedication) are allowed.

             prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines. Note: Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are
             not allowed.

             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months

             carcinoma in situ or melanoma in situ]. Prior history of other cancer is allowed, as
             long as there was no active disease within the prior 2 years.

          -  All other unstable, severe, or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions including
             colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, recent (within
             the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior, known alcohol or drug abuse,
             or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
