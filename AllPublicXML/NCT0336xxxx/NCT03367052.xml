      The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical and radiological results of
      two-level cervical ProDisc-C vivo versus hybrid construct.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial at 7 years of follow-up comparing two
      level ProDisc-C vivo artificial cervical disc replacement and hybrid construct, i.e.,
      combining ACDF (Anterior cervical discectomy fusion) and ProDisc-C vivo to treat degenerative
      disc disease (DDD). 542 DDD patients (age from 20 to 70) from several hospitals matching the
      inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to two groups (271 patients in each group). One
      group will be treated with two level ProDisc-C vivo disc replacement. The other group will be
      treated with hybrid construct. Clinical outcomes and radiological analysis will be done at
      1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 84 months after the surgical treatments.

    <intervention_model_description>542 DDD patients (age from 20 to 70) from several hospitals matching the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to two groups (271 patients in each group).

Clinical outcomes and radiological analysis will be compared between the two groups at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 84 months after the surgical treatments.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A patient's outcome was considered an overall success if all of the following conditions were met:1) postoperative (Neck Disability Index) NDI score improvement of at least a 15-point increase from preoperative score; 2) maintenance or improvement in neurological status; 3) disc height success; 4) no serious adverse event classified as implant associated or implant/surgical procedure associated; and 5) no additional surgical procedure classified as a &quot;failure&quot;.</description>

    <description>The neck disability index(NDI) questionnaire measures the level of pain and disability associated with various activities. The NDI is a 10-item, 50-point index that assesses different aspects of daily functioning in patients with neck pain. Each item is scored 0 to 5. The NDI score is a sum of the scores of the10-item. Clinical effects will be evaluated based on scores of the NDI. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Neck and arm pain scores will be measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from &quot;0' (no sensation) to '100&quot;(the most intense pain imaginable) where 30 means &quot;pain threshold&quot;.</description>
