    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this proof of concept clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the study drug, ACH-0144471, in participants who have been diagnosed with either
      C3GN or dense deposit disease (DDD) based on renal biopsy. Participants will be randomized
      1:1 to receive either study drug ACH-0144471 or placebo for a period of 6 months.

             biopsy obtained no more than 30 days (and preferably within 2 weeks) of first dose of
             study drug by the study's central pathology laboratory

          -  Evidence of alternative pathway (AP) hyperactivity based on at least one of the

          -  Have evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (positive serology for HIV
             antibody [HIV Ab]), hepatitis B infection (positive hepatitis B surface antigen
