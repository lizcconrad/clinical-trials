  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBI306 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds proprotein convertase
      substilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), preventing its interaction with the low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol receptor (LDL-R) and thereby restoring LDL-R recycling and low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol（LDL-C）uptake. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled,single ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of IBI306 in healthy adults.

      Ascending dose design includes 6 dose levels （25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg and 600
      mg). Tolerance and safety data up to 14 days after dosing from all subjects of the previous
      cohort will be reviewed before proceeding to the next dose. Total duration of the study per
      subject is 12 weeks.
