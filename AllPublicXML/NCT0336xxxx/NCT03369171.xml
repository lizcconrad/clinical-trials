  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of neurological injury in young adults. Capturing
      the extent of multiple domains of MS-related disability is critical for effective clinical
      care and the development of new paradigms for patient-focused therapeutic approaches. To date
      outcomes research in MS has centered on clinical exams, which may be insensitive over the
      short term (the 1-2 years of early stage clinical trials) and only capture a single snapshot
      of the patient's performance.

      With the mass production of sensors in the gaming and computer control industry, there is an
      opportunity to transform the traditional neurological exam with biosensors already in use
      outside the realm of health applications. The investigators herein propose to use a
      commercialized wearable electroMYOgraphy sensor (MYO,Thalamic Labs Inc, Kitchener, ON,
      Canada) for detection of upper and lower limb dysfunction in MS patients. The investigators
      will determine if the device can differentiate the diseased states, refine signal processing
      algorithms to create reliable outcomes using this device in MS patients, and determine if
      these outcomes are strongly associated with patients and physicians reported ambulatory and
      dexterity metrics. The investigators hypothesize that this digital technology may be
      introduced in the standard neurological exam technique in a non-disruptive manner and more
      accurately and potentially remotely detect both physician-reported and patient-reported
      disability.

      In the scope of this study, the investigators will also develop signal processing methodology
      to comprehensively track ambulation features.
