    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of cisplatin and
      paclitaxel with pembrolizumab in women with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical
      cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the effects of standard
      chemotherapy paclitaxel and cisplatin, administered in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody
      pembrolizumab, for recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer. Progression free
      survival will be assessed in patients treated with this combination.

      Patients should undergo tissue biopsy for diagnostic confirmation of metastatic disease,
      disease recurrence or persistence. Patients will be treated with 3 cycles of combination
      therapy. A cycle will consist of pembrolizumab at 200mg (IV), paclitaxel 175mg/m2 or 135mg/m2
      (IV) and cisplatin 50mg/m2, on day 1 every 21 days. The length of a cycle is 21 days. This
      regimen will be followed by imaging to determine response to treatment, at which time repeat
      biopsies will be obtained if measurable disease remains and is accessible (paired tissue
      samples).

      If patients demonstrate at least stable disease, they will then receive additional cycles of
      chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin plus pembrolizumab, given every 3 weeks with
      imaging obtained every 3 cycles until disease progression or complete resolution of disease.
      Blood collection will be performed before, during treatment and at end of study.

      Thirty-nine subjects will be accrued and treated at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center
      (SCCC)/University of Miami Hospital (UMH) inclusive of its satellite sites, and Jackson
      Memorial Hospital for approximately 24 months. Therapy will be administered until study
      completion, withdrawal of consent, disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity,
      whichever occurs first.

      All subjects will be followed for a Safety Evaluation at approximately 30-days (+7 days)
      after the last dose of study treatment or before the initiation of a new anti-cancer
      treatment, whichever occurs first. Thereafter subjects will be followed every 3-months for up
      to 24 months from the treatment discontinuation.
