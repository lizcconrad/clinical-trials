  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigator initiated prospective study to determine whether the use of a negative pressure
      suction in the hypopharynx will reduce the amount of aspiration during Video Fluoroscopic
      Swallowing Exam (VFSE) among patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a properly coordinated swallow, the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx undergo a
      series of movements that serve to prepare and expand the pharyngoesophageal segment (PES),
      which is the inlet into the esophagus. Under normal circumstances, a food bolus is safely
      propelled from the oropharynx, through the PES, and into the esophagus. Surgical and
      radiation therapy in the head and neck, as well as deficiencies such as poor coordination,
      mistiming, or obstructing lesions may prevent the food bolus from safely entering the
      esophagus and instead diverting toward the trachea.

      A number of patients with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia are not able to tolerate any diet
      without risking aspiration and subsequent pneumonia, often to a degree severe enough that
      they cannot manage to safely swallow their secreted saliva. These patients depend on a
      gastrostomy feeding tube in order to obtain adequate daily nutritional requirements and must
      suction or spit out their saliva to prevent aspiration and a sensation of asphyxiation.
      Despite these precautions, many of these patients ultimately suffer life-threatening
      pneumonia. Investigators will be testing if the use of use of a negative pressure suction in
      the hypopharynx will reduce the amount of aspiration during Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing
      Exam (VFSE) among patients with severe oropharyngeal dysphagia

Material enters the airway, contacts the vocal folds, and is not ejected from the airway.
Material enters the ariway, passes below the vocal folds, and is ejected into the larynx or out of the airway.
Material enters the airway, passes below the vocal folds, and is not ejected from the trachea despite effort.

    <measure>Pharyngo-esophageal Segment (PES) opening size</measure>
    <time_frame>During VFSE, PES is measured when the patient administers 20 cc of liquid barium and the PES is maximally distended.</time_frame>
    <description>Pharyngo-esophageal Segment (PES) is a 2.5 to 4.5 cm manometric high-pressure zone located between the pharynx and esophagus. Normal Pharyngoesophageal segment opening size on lateral view: 0.80 cm +/- 0.40 cm</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharyngeal Constriction Ratio (PCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement of the pharyngeal area during maximum contraction are taken after administration of 20 cc liquid barium. The pharyngeal area at rest is measured when 1 cc bolus is held in the oral cavity.</time_frame>
    <description>Pharyngeal Constriction Ratio: is a measure of pharyngeal clearance pressure. It is calculated by dividing the lateral pharyngeal area during maximal contraction by the area with a 1 cc bolus held in the oral cavity. The area is determined by onscreen tool provided. Normal PCR: 0.14 +/- 0.28</description>

    <time_frame>Time from when bolus head first passes posterior nasal spine to time bolus head enters base of vallecula</time_frame>
    <description>Oropharyngeal transit time is measured when the patient administers 20 cc of liquid barium. Normal oropharyngeal transit time: 0.42 sec +/- 0.36 sec</description>
