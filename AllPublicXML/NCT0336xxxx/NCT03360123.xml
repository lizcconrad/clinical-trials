      This study will evaluate the perceptions of the effects of two anxiolytic medications
      commonly used during dental treatment in patients weighing 40 kilograms or more.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Midazolam and nitrous oxide are commonly used in pediatric patients requiring anxiolysis
      during dental treatment. Triazolam and nitrous oxide are commonly used in adult patients
      requiring anxiolysis during dental treatment. The participants in this study are patients
      already scheduled for 2 sedation appointments to complete their dental treatment. The
      medications are both benzodiazepines that have similar risks, neither medication has greater
      adverse effects than the other. This study will evaluate the perceptions of the effects of
      the medications via a parent survey and chart review. The goal of the study is to determine
      which anxiolytic medication is perceived to provide a better sedation experience for older
      pediatric patients based on parent perception of the medication's effects and the patient's
      behavior during dental treatment.

    <time_frame>60-90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A chart review to assess patient behavior during treatment &amp; successful completion of treatment will be completed on secure Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC computers and will identify the patient through a coding system that will provide no link to patient identifiers. Patient behavior will be assessed using the Frankl Behavioral Rating scale. The behavior assessment will occur during the pre-sedation period, dental treatment and recovery period, which in total will take approximately 60-90 minutes. Your child's level of cooperation, willingness to accept treatment and emotions will be documented. Successful completion of treatment is determined by whether or not the treatment plan for that appointment was completed.</description>
