      This trial is a First in Human early feasibility study of a novel atherectomy device to treat
      peripheral artery disease. The trial is a prospective, single arm design that will enroll 10
      patients at 1 - 2 sites. Patients will be followed at 30 days and 6 months to evaluate vessel
      patency following treatment. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events throughout
      the study. Safety and Efficacy will be evaluated by comparing study results to established
      performance criteria,

      Feasibility Clinical Trial of the Cardio Flow FreedomFlow™ Orbital Atherectomy System to
      Treat Peripheral Artery Disease (FAST Trial) is a prospective non-randomized single arm study
      that will enroll up to 10 patients at 1 - 2 sites. The study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Cardio Flow atherectomy device for plaque removal in de novo target
      lesions in the peripheral vasculature of the lower extremities. The primary safety endpoint
      is defined as freedom from a composite of new onset major adverse events through the 30-day
      follow-up as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events physician. The primary
      effectiveness endpoint is defined as the ability of the Cardio Flow Device to achieve a
      residual diameter stenosis ≤ 50% without adjunctive therapy, determined by Angiographic core
      lab evaluation.
