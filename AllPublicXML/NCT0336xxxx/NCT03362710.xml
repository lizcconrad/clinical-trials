  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects mainly elderly patients. The ankle brachial index
      (ABI) and ultrasound imaging are the standard diagnostic tools in PAD diagnostic and severity
      estimation. Measurements are generally performed by a vascular physician. However, access to
      medical specialist is becoming increasingly difficult with long waiting times while the aging
      of the population increases, while most of these patients are seen by the general
      practitioner.

      To date, there is a lot of data in the literature on the value of using various ambulatory
      devices in the diagnosis and severity estimation of PAD but studied one by one.

      The investigators propose to compare the measurements made by a series of simple non-invasive
      ambulatory tools with the measurements performed by the vascular specialist. The
      investigators wish to demonstrate that a series of simple and economical tools, available to
      paramedical health professionals can diagnose PAD and evaluate ts severity the reducing the
      direct and indirect associated costs.

      Patients referred for an arterial vascular investigations of the lower limbs will be
      included.

      After signing the consent, all included patients will be assessed by the examination series,
      among which ABI measurement and an arterial Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs +/-
      transcutaneous oxygen pressure recording in case of suspected critical limb ischemia.
      Following the visit patients will be classified as have or not PAD and in case of PAD
      classified for the severity of PAD on the basis of the investigation results.

      Blinded to the results of the vascular laboratory test, a technician will:

      Measure ABI with an automatic sphygmomanometer.

      Examination series:

        1. Skin temperature on the back of the foot with infra-red thermometry

        2. Toe saturometry

        3. ABI with an automatic sphygmomanometry

        4. Skin Recoloration time at the foot
