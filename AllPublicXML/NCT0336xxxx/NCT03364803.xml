    <intervention_name>Cushing's QoL (Quality of Life Questionnaire)</intervention_name>
    <description>Cushing's QoL is a validated disease specific questionnaire consisting of 12 questions on a five-point Likert scale ranging from always to never. The total score ranges from 12 to 60, with a lower score indicating a greater negative impact on health related QoL. This is converted to a 0-100 scale, 0 indicating the worst and 100 indicating the best QoL</description>

    <intervention_name>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP)</intervention_name>
    <description>NHP is used in patients to assess general health and quality of life. This assessment consists of 38 yes/no questions that are subdivided into six scales assessing impairments: pain (eight items), energy level (three items), sleep (five items), emotional reactions (nine items), social isolation (five items) and physical mobility (eight items). A higher score indicates more impairment</description>

    <intervention_name>State Food Craving Questionnaire-State (FCQ-S)</intervention_name>
    <description>The FCQ-S consists of 15 items assessing: desire to eat, anticipation of positive reinforcement from eating, anticipation of negative reinforcement (reduction of negative affect) from eating, lack of control over eating, and (physiological) hunger; higher scores reflect stronger food craving. Participants respond, using a Likert-type scale, how much each item is true of them right now.</description>

    <intervention_name>Trait Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait (FCQ-T)</intervention_name>
    <description>Trait food craving will be assessed with the Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait (FCQ-T). The FCQ-T consists of 39 items assessing: intentions/plans to eat, anticipation of positive reinforcement from eating, anticipation of negative reinforcement from eating, lack of control over eating, preoccupation with food, (physiological) hunger, emotions preceding or following food cravings or eating, environmental cues that may elicit food cravings, negative emotions including guilt experienced as a consequence of food cravings, and/or indulging such cravings; higher scores again indicate higher trait craving. Individuals are asked to respond, using a Likert-type scale, how much each item is true of them in general.</description>

    <intervention_name>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</intervention_name>
    <description>A validated visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire will be completed in the fasting state. The VAS consists of 100-mm lines with words anchored at each end describing extreme sensations of hunger, prospective consumption (&quot;How much do you think you can eat?&quot;), fullness, and satisfaction, as well as craving (sweet, salty, fatty or savory). Patients will be asked to make a vertical mark across the line corresponding to their feelings. Quantification will performed by measuring the distance from the left end of the line to the mark.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sensitivity to Reinforcement of Addictive and other Primary Rewards (STRAP-R) food variant</intervention_name>
    <description>A validated questionnaire that assesses perceived subjective value attributed to expected/hypothetical foods and other primary reinforcers will be administered. This variant of this questionnaire was initially developed by Dr. Goldstein to assess 'liking' and 'wanting' of expected drug rewards for patients with cocaine addiction. The current assessment uses a modified version to assess 'liking' and 'wanting' for food.</description>

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,
        the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
        (MSKCC). If the investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their
        patient's medical records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study
        and their potential for enrolling in the research study. Potential subjects contacted by
        their treating physician will be referred to the investigator/research staff of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 14 or older

          -  Active or treated Cushing's (due to pituitary, ectopic, or adrenal tumor)

          -  The diagnosis of CS will be made by the PI, based on the below Endocrine Society
             guidelines, the patient's clinical presentation, and the PI's judgment.

             ° Diagnostic criteria for pituitary CD are according to the Endocrine Society
             guidelines and include: Elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC), normal or
             elevated plasma ACTH, elevated midnight salivary cortisol levels, or classic
             dexamethasone suppression testing for CD (morning cortisol &gt; 5 ug/dL after 1 mg
             overnight of classic 2-day low dose test) and a pituitary lesion on MRI. If patient
             does not have any of these results, pathology of ACTH tumor may confirm presence of
             disease.

          -  For pituitary patients, if the patient demonstrates non-classic testing or no
             pituitary lesion is seen on MRI then petrosal sinus sampling or positive surgical
             pathology will be used to confirm pituitary source of Cushing's. Clinical or
             biochemical remission after surgery will also confirm pituitary source.

          -  Ectopic Cushing's will be confirmed by petrosal sinus sampling and appropriate imaging
             tests, or positive surgical pathology.

          -  Adrenal Cushing's will be confirmed by a suppressed plasma ACTH value and
             identification of an adrenal lesion on CT or MRI, or positive surgical pathology.

          -  In lieu of MRI, surgical, or laboratory reports, physician's assessment note including
             mention of results will also be used as source for eligibility purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of iatrogenic Cushing's.
