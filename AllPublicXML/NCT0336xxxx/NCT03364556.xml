  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease leads to malnutrition and secondary conditions including osteoporosis. The
      dietary habits of adults with untreated, undiagnosed celiac disease has not yet been
      observed, but presents a critical piece in understanding the effects of the disease on bone
      health. Objective was to evaluate differences in nutritional intake of calcium, vitamin D,
      and phosphorus; serologic indices of these nutrients; and bone health among adults with and
      without celiac disease. Cross-sectional data from What We Eat in America (WWEIA) and the
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-14 was analyzed.

      Celiac disease leads to malnutrition and secondary conditions including osteoporosis. The
      dietary habits of adults with untreated, undiagnosed celiac disease has not yet been

      health. Objective was to evaluate differences in nutritional intake of calcium, vitamin D,

      without celiac disease.

      Cross-sectional data from What We Eat in America (WWEIA) and the National Health and
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-14 was analyzed, including self-reported dietary
      and supplement intake from one day of 24-hour recalls, serologic indicators, and dual x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) scans were analyzed in adults (n=49) testing positive for celiac disease
      to the tissue transglutaminase endomysial antibody assay (tTG-EMA). Statistical analysis
      included multiple linear regression modelling controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, energy
      intake, and poverty income ratio.

        Adults aged 18+ years with a complete 24-hour recall in WWEIA and a completed celiac
        disease serologic test. Two groups were used in the analysis. The control group consisted
        of a normal adult population without celiac disease, as indicated by a negative serologic
        test for celiac disease and no self-reported celiac disease. The serologically positive
        group were considered to have undiagnosed, untreated celiac disease based on a positive
        serologic test for celiac disease (EMA+), no self-reported celiac disease, and no adherence
        to a gluten-free diet. NHANES employs two steps of serologic tests for selected
        participants to screen for celiac disease antibodies that develop as a T-cell-mediated
        response to gluten.
