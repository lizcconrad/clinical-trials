  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the time of diagnosis, approximately 60%-80% of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer are
      found with cervical lymph node metastasis. Cervical nodal metastasis is an important
      prognostic factor in hypopharyngeal cancer. Induction chemotherapy is frequently used in
      advanced hypopharynx cancer. However, sometimes CR was obtained at the tumor's primary site
      but not in the palpable lymph nodes in the neck, the large cervical lymph node metastasis
      poorly responded to induction chemotherapy in a considerable percentage of patients. At
      present, patients with primary tumor achieved CR preferred to receive definitive radiotherapy
      no matter cervical lymph node metastasis SD or progression. But, radiotherapy was poor
      effective to the big cervical lymph node metastasis, because the inner of big cervical lymph
      node metastasis was hypoxic and necrosis. The investigators conducted a prospective,
      randomised trial to compare neck dissection with definitive radiotherapy for advanced
      hypopharyngeal cancer cervical lymph node metastasis with poor response to induction
      chemotherapy.
