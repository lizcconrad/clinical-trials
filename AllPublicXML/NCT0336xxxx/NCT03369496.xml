  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social networks, social capital, i.e., network-accessed resources, and neighbourhood
      environments have been shown associated with a range of health behaviours and conditions,
      including obesity, physical activity, nutrition, and mental health. Research on social
      capital and health in Montreal has shown the importance of network social capital for a
      person's subjective health status, sense of control, self-reported physical activity, and
      obesity. Research has also shown high social capital to reduce health service use, mental
      health service use, and improve the management of chronic illnesses. Despite advances in the
      understanding of social capital and its link to health and health service use, most research
      on social capital is cross sectional and is unable to identify the causal pathways linking
      social networks and capital to health and health care use. Longitudinal research would
      strengthen the evidence base for designing interventions to prevent or delay the use of
      health services, particularly in older adults.

      This research has three main objectives: (1) transform the original sample of Montreal
      Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Aging (MoNNET-HA) households (n=2707) into a panel study,
      (2) link the MoNNET-HA participant data to their Quebec Health Insurance Registry (RÃ©gie de
      l'assurance maladie (RAMQ)) information, and (3) assess the feasibility of extending the
      MoNNET-HA panel by one wave to include participant's core network members. Unique about the
      original MoNNET-HA sample is that it purposefully oversampled older adults (&gt; 64 years old)
      but remains representative of Montreal adults at various ages and income levels. In addition,
      MoNNET-HA data is integrated into a GIS database which allows researchers to examine the
      effects of neighbourhood environmental characteristics on health. By linking MoNNET-HA data
      to RAMQ, researchers will be able to examine patterns of diagnosed health conditions, (e.g.,
      fractures, depression), pharmaceutical use and adherence, and formal health care use over
      time. Transforming the cross-sectional study into a panel study would also allow researchers
      to examine longitudinally the dynamics of health and health care utilization among Panel
      participants over the life course, and the causal pathways linking neighbourhoods and
      networks to health and health care use.

        Population-based sample of adults randomly selected using a 2-stage stratified cluster
        sampling strategy.

          1. In the first stage, 862 Montreal Metropolitan Area census tracts were stratified using
             the census-tract median income into tertile of high, medium and low income census
             tract areas. From each tertile, 100 census tracts were selected at random from each
             census-tract group for a total of 300 tracts.

          2. Within each selected census tract, three respondents were selected at random using
             from the 25-44 years age category, three respondents from the 45-64 years age
             category, and three respondents from the age group 65 years and older. This resulted
             in a total of 9 respondents per census tract and a total of 2707 respondents the
             MoNNET Panel.
