  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), also called degenerative knee disease, is one of the most common
      bone and joint diseases in clinic. It was estimated to affect more than 9 million individuals
      in the United States in 2005 and is a leading cause of disability and medical costs. Most
      elderly people over the age of 65 have radiographic and/or clinical evidence of
      osteoarthritis. KOA is a lifelong disease which can lead to obvious pain, joint stiffness,
      limitation of activity and even joint failure or disability. Acupuncture is a popular
      treatment taken from ancient Chinese medicine, in which fine needles are placed into the body
      at specific points. Studies have shown that acupuncture can stimulate nerves under the skin,
      causing the body to produce natural pain-relieving substances (endorphins). However the
      evidences of acupuncture for KOA are contradictory. According to the review, intensive
      acupuncture with three sessions a week is more effective for KOA than sparse acupuncture with
      one session a week. Moreover, the papers published in the past years suggest that manual
      acupuncture and electro-acupuncture are most commonly used acupuncture therapy for the
      treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      intensive electro-acupuncture or manual acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in reducing pain
      and improving function in patients with KOA.

    <description>the percentage of patients with improvement in average pain (numerical rating scale, NRS) at least 2 units and in Western Ontario and Mcmaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function subscale score at least 6 units at 8 weeks. Pain NRS was a self-administered instrument, a number selected from 0-10 by participant. Intensity of pain range (over past week): 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain. Higher score indicating severe pain. The WOMAC function subscale referred to the participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC function subscale was comprised of 17 questions regarding the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in the study knee. The WOMAC function subscale score for each question ranged from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signified worse physical function. An overall score range of 0 (minimum) to 68 (maximum), with higher scores indicating worse physical function.</description>
