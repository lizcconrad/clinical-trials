  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the use of postoperative antibiotics
      following ESS decreases postoperative infection rates. This is a multi-institutional
      prospective study involving Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center,
      Columbia University Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, Mount Sinai Health System,
      and New York University Langone Medical Center. The study design will be a
      multi-institutional prospective randomized controlled trial with parallel random groups
      assigned to receive postoperative antibiotics or no postoperative antibiotics. The
      investigators hypothesize that patients who receive postoperative antibiotics will have lower
      postoperative infection rates and improved postoperative sinonasal symptoms and nasal
      endoscopy scores.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with CRS with or without nasal polyposis or allergic fungal rhinosinusitis
             who present to the otolaryngology clinic who have been deemed suitable for bilateral
             ESS, and are over the age of 18 will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with sinonasal tumors, allergies or adverse reactions to all of the
             antibiotics that will be used in this study (amoxicillin-clavulanate, doxycycline,
             clarithromycin), immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, pregnancy, or diabetes with nasal
             polyposis (inability to receive systemic steroids) will be excluded, as will patients
             who lack capacity to provide informed consent. Patients undergoing active treatment
             for malignancy will be excluded. Patients undergoing unilateral ESS or with
             nonabsorbable packing placed at the time of surgery will be excluded. Patients who
             have been on antibiotics within 2 weeks of the surgery date will be excluded. Patients
             with acute on chronic sinusitis or the presence of purulence at time of surgery will
             be excluded from the study.
