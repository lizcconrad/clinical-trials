  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and impact of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) on the fecal and urine microbiome, urine metabolome, risk of recurrent
      urinary tract infection (UTI), and persistent multidrug resistant organism (MDRO)
      colonization of patients with a history of recurrent MDRO UTIs. This is an open label phase
      1-2 study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) infections are increasingly common. The most common type
      of infection caused by MDROs is urinary tract infections (UTIs). Many MDROs are inhabitants
      of the colon, and MDROs can contaminate the periurethral area and migrate to the bladder.
      Patients with MDRO UTI frequently experience multiple relapses and hospitalizations, which
      both increase the individual's morbidity and mortality and leads to additional MDRO
      nosocomial spread. There are few options available to prevent MDRO UTIs, and there are
      limited strategies to identify patients at risk for recurrent MDRO UTI and prevent or reverse
      MDRO colonization. A potential novel method to reverse MDRO colonization and prevent
      recurrent UTI would be by repopulating the gut microbiome with &quot;healthy&quot; microbiota by fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT).

      In this study, participants with a history of severe, recurrent MDRO UTI will receive FMT.
      Participants will submit stool and urine specimens pre- and post-FMT, and the effect of FMT
      on the participants' fecal and urine microbiome, urine metabolome, persistent MDRO
      colonization, and risk of recurrent UTI will be evaluated.
