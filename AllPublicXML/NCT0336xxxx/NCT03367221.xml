  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) respresents the leading cause of mortality in early
      post-operative period of Lung Tranplantation (LTx). Protective ventilatory strategy could
      potentially reduce the risk of PGD in these patients. Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist
      (NAVA) is an assisted ventilation mode that could allow to adopt this strategy. Aim of the
      study is to assess the feasibility of NAVA in the early post-LTx phase and to describe the
      breathing pattern and the physiological relationship between neural respiratory drive and
      different levels of ventilatory assist, in the absence of pulmonary vagal afferent feedback.

    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation (LTx) is an important treatment option for select patients with
      end-stage pulmonary disease. Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) is the main cause of death; in
      the early period following LTx a protective ventilatory strategy (tidal volume - Vt of 6
      mL/Kg + Positive End Expiratory Pressure) could potentially reduce the risk of PGD in these
      patients. Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is an assisted ventilation mode in
      which neural inspiratory activity is monitored through the continuous recording of electrical
      activity of the diaphragm (EAdi). Actually, Guidelines about the adoption of a protective
      ventilatory strategy in the early post-opeartive period are lacking.

      NAVA, because of its intrinsic properties (proportionality between respiratory drive and
      level of assist, prevention of diaphragm atrophy), could allow to reach the afore mentioned
      ventilatory strategy. So, aim of the study, is the evaluation of patients' neural breathing
      pattern during NAVA, in early post-operative period of LTx
