  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the numerous benefits of peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) over general anesthesia (GA)
      in a variety of surgical procedures, PNBs can be associated with increased post-operative
      pain if pain medications are not taken correctly (titrated). Unfortunately, this is a common
      occurrence as patients often have difficulty titrating medications in the absence of direct
      medical care. PANDA, a smartphone-based postoperative pain management tool, is designed to
      address this issue by helping patients manage their pain medications. The purpose of this
      study is to demonstrate the feasibility of this application in patients who are discharged
      after receiving PNBs. The goal is to identify areas of improvement for the application
      itself. It is hypothesize that PANDA will be successful in supporting patients' postoperative
      pain management.
