  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aims of this project are to develop and pilot test a novel, patient-centered,
      family model for weight management [Acceptance-based Behavioral Treatment (ABBT)] in children
      aged 8-12 with obesity and their caregivers. Our aims are (1) to determine the treatment
      needs of children aged 8-12 with obesity and their families with a focus on executive
      functioning and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of family ABBT.

      Pilot Treatment Group. Children and caregivers who meet preliminary eligibility via phone
      screening will be scheduled for a baseline visit within one month of the first treatment
      session. During this visit, eligibility will be confirmed including height/weight
      measurements to determine BMI and informed consent/assent procedures will be conducted. Pairs
      providing informed consent/assent will complete questionnaires, measurements, and cognitive
      testing. Pre- and post-evaluations are estimated to take less than 70 minutes to complete.
      The assessments will be identical with the exception of online food/activity monitoring
      training at pre-treatment only and program evaluation surveys at post-evaluation only. Each
      treatment group will include a total of 8 child-caregiver pairs (total of 16 child-caregiver
      dyads with groups combined). A total of 24 weekly treatment sessions will be held over 6
      months for the ABBT protocol at a rate of 1 session per week. Semi-structured group
      interviews will be incorporated into an extended treatment session at month 3 and month 6 to
      assess caregiver and child experiences with the program.

The Total score is used which is a sum of all items which are rated on a 7-point Likert scale. Higher scores represent a greater degree of parental experiential avoidance.</description>

    <description>Family acceptance-based behavioral treatment (ABBT) will be piloted with 16 child-caregiver pairs.

    <intervention_name>Acceptance-based Behavioral Treatment (ABBT)</intervention_name>
    <description>ABBT is rooted in behavioral therapy but also cultivates self-regulation skills including experiential acceptance of potentially uncomfortable internal experiences (e.g., emotions, cravings), mindful awareness of decision making (e.g., mindful eating), and values clarification and behavioral commitment (e.g., practicing daily physical activity to be a contributing member on a sports team). ABBT has been used effectively to help youth and adults manage various medical and psychological problems. Moreover, components of ABBT have been shown to improve child and adult EF including inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. Recently, ABBT has been integrated with components of standard behavioral treatment of obesity and applied with robust efficacy to weight management in adults.</description>
