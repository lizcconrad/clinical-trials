  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During digestion of fatty foods, the liver produces a substance called bile which helps with
      the absorption of fat in the gut (small intestine). Some research studies have shown that
      friendly bacteria that live in our gut can change the makeup of bile (referred to as bile
      acids) leading to a lowering of blood cholesterol levels, an important risk factor for
      developing heart disease. This finding has been found in people who consume diets high in
      dietary fibers and probiotics that enhance the growth of friendly gut bacteria, and also
      plant rich foods high in polyphenols (such as apples). At present, very little is known about
      how the makeup of bile acids can regulate blood cholesterol levels and if their measurement
      in blood, urine or stool samples can be used as an indicator of human health.

      The aim of this study is to explore how consumption of foods which enhance the growth of
      friendly gut bacteria (such as probiotics, prebiotics, and plant rich foods high in
      polyphenols) can change the makeup of bile acids after 8 weeks. Changes in the bile acids
      measured in blood and stool samples will then be related to markers of health, such as blood
      cholesterol, glucose, insulin, vascular health and inflammatory markers.
