  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The public health relevance of this proposed project is substantial given the current opioid
      abuse epidemic as identified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This study finalizes
      and tests a new psychotherapy treatment that is designed to treat chronic pain and opioid
      addiction at the same time in a format that could be easily used in a community addiction
      treatment setting. Final products of the study will yield an integrated STOP
      (Self-regulation/Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) Therapy for Opioid addiction and Pain)
      manual guided protocol, patient workbook, and therapist training protocol.
