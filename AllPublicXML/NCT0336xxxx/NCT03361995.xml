        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is &gt;=18 years of age.

          2. The patient must have symptoms consistent with AMI (i.e. chest pain, arm pain, etc.)
             and unresponsive to nitroglycerin, with symptoms beginning greater than 30 minutes but
             less than 6 hours prior to presentation.

          3. Evidence of Acute Anterior MI with ST-segment elevation of 0.2 mV in two or more
             anterior contiguous precordial leads.

          4. The patient is eligible for PCI.

          5. The expected timing of the treatment pathway for the patient will allow for at least
             10 minutes of cooling with the IVTM System prior to PCI.

          6. The patient or patient's legal representative is willing to provide written, informed
             consent to participate in this clinical trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has had a previous myocardial infarction.

          2. The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;80 mmHg
             and non-responsive to fluids, or SBP &lt;100 mmHg with vasopressors, or requirement for
             an intra-aortic balloon pump [IABP]).

          3. The patient is presenting with resuscitated cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, or
             Killip risk stratification class II through IV.

          4. The patient has an aortic dissection or requires an immediate surgical or procedural
             intervention other than PCI.

          5. The patient has known history of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), hepatic failure, end
             stage kidney disease or severe renal failure (clearance &lt; 30ml/min/1.73m²).

          6. The patient is febrile (temperature &gt; 37.5 °C) or has experienced an infection with
             fever in the last 5 days.

          7. The patient has a known previous CABG.

          8. The patient has a known recent stroke within 90 days of admission.

          9. Cardio-pulmonary decompensation that has occurred en route to the hospital or, in the
             opinion of the physician, that is imminent or likely to occur following presentation
             to the clinical site.

         10. Contraindications to hypothermia, such as patients with known hematologic dyscrasias
             which affect thrombosis (e.g., cryoglobulinemia, sickle cell disease, serum cold
             agglutinins) or vasospastic disorders (such as Raynaud's or thromboangitis
             obliterans).

         11. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, or
             sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

         12. The patient has a known history of bleeding diathesis, coagulopathy, cryoglobulinemia
             or sickle cell anemia, or will refuse blood transfusions.

         13. The patient has a height of &lt;1.5 meters (4 feet 11 inches).

         14. The patient is known to be pregnant or is expected to become pregnant within one month
             of cooling treatment.

         15. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to buspirone
             hydrochloride or Meperidine (Demerol) and/or has been treated with a monoamine oxidase
             inhibitor in the past 14 days.

         16. Patient has a known history of severe hepatic or renal impairment, untreated
             hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, benign prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture
             that in the opinion of the physician would be incompatible with Meperidine
             administration.

         17. The patient has an Inferior Vena Cava filter in place (IVC).

         18. The patient has a pre-MI life expectancy of &lt;1 year due to underlying medical
             conditions or pre-existing co-morbidities.

         19. The patient has a known, unresolved history of drug use or alcohol dependency, or
             lacks the ability to comprehend or follow instructions.

         20. The patient is currently enrolled in another investigational drug or device trial.

         21. The patient is apprehensive about or unwilling to undergo the required MRI imaging at
             follow-up, has a documented or suspected diagnosis of claustrophobia, has Gadolinium
             allergy, or is in permanent Atrial Fibrillation.

         22. The patient has received thrombolytic therapy en route to the hospital.

         23. The patient shows clinical evidence of spontaneous reperfusion as observed
             symptomatically and/or from ECG findings (partial or complete ST resolution in ECG
             prior to informed consent and randomization).

         24. The patient is a vulnerable subject, for instance, a person in detention
             (i.e.,prisoner or ward of the state).
