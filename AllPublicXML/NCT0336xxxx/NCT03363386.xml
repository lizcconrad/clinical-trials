      The aim of the study is to investigate proprioceptive exercises training combined with
      aerobic exercises and resistive exercises training combined with aerobic exercises on dynamic
      balance and superficial sense. The patients were randomly divided into Proprioceptive
      Exercise Training Group (PG) (n=15) and Resistive Exercise Training Group (RG) (n=15). All
      subjects were included exercise education program and both groups had trained aerobic
      exercise program for walking on treadmill (2times/wk. 6 week duration).

      The aim of the study is to investigate proprioceptive exercises training combined with
      aerobic exercises and resistive exercises training combined with aerobic exercises on dynamic
      balance and superficial sense. The study included 30 volunteers with Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus(T2DM) who were referred to Fitness Center Arif Nihat Asya Kültür Merkezi Istanbul,
      Turkey by a medical doctor between December 2016- March 2017 and got diagnosed and followed
      up at least 6 month before. Glycemic control of all the participants were assessed according
      to fasting blood glucose and glycolated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Waist and hip circumference was
      recorded in centimeters. Six minute walking test (6MWT) was used to determine functional
      capacity of participants. We evaluated the dynamic balance of patients by Prokin PK200,
      Italy. Five parameters were obtained from Prokin as; Perimeter Length (PL), Area gap
      percentade (AGP) Medium Speed (MS), Anteroposterior equilibrium (AP) and Mediolateral
      equilibrium (ML). Proprioception assessment was done with angle reproduction test in
      direction of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion and deviations were recorded. Superficial sense
      was assessed with two point discrimination test and vibration threshold was evaluated by
      biothesiometer. Lower extremity muscles strength were assessed with handheld dynamometer
      (PowerTrack II commander, JTech Medical, Midvale, UT). The patients were randomly divided
      into Proprioceptive Exercise Training Group (PG) and Resistive Exercise Training Group (RG).
      All subjects were included exercise education program and both groups had trained aerobic
      exercise program for walking on treadmill (2times/wk. 6 week duration). The proprioceptive
      exercise program was applied in PG and the resistive exercise program was applied in RG twice
      a week and for duration 6 week.
