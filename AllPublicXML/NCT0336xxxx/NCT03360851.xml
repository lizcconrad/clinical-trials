    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Uncertainty in the clinical and etiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
      often leads to incorrect treatment and unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
      Establishing the clinical diagnosis of CAP is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity of chest
      radiograph to detect pulmonary infiltrates (~70%). Establishing the etiological diagnosis is
      also hampered, mainly because of the inevitable diagnostic delays and low sensitivity of
      routine microbiological tests. There are currently no recommendations for low-dose chest
      computed tomography (low-dose CT) or viral and bacterial point-of-care multiplex polymerase
      chain reaction (PoC-PCR) in the diagnostic work-up of CAP patients, because the data
      supporting such an approach are lacking.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the added value of low-dose CT and PoC-PCR
      in the diagnostic workup of patients with CAP hospitalised to non-intensive care unit (ICU)
      wards in minimizing selective antibiotic pressure while maintaining patient safety.

      Study design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial with historical control period.

      Study population: Adult patients (&gt;=18 years old) with a clinical diagnosis of CAP requiring
      hospitalisation to a non-ICU ward.

      Intervention: Intervention arm 1: availability of PoC-PCR during the ER visit; intervention
      arm 2: performing low-dose CT from the ER or at least within 24 hours; control arm: standard
      care.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary effectiveness outcome is days of therapy of
      broad-spectrum antibiotics. The primary safety outcome, on which the sample size is
      calculated, is 90-day all-cause mortality.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: There are no risks associated with performing the PoC-PCR and the radiation of
      the low-dose CT is of negligible risk. Nasopharyngeal swab collection causes a temporary
      unpleasant sensation. The low-dose CT can reveal unexpected findings which may require
      additional diagnostic procedures, for which the treating physician will use state-of-the-art
      guidelines. Treatment recommendations to de-escalate or stop antibiotic treatment may be
      beneficial for the individual patient by minimising exposure to antibiotics and improve
      targeted use of antibiotics. Final decisions are always made by the treating physician taking
      into account all clinical information.

    <description>A low-dose chest CT-scan will be performed either directly from the ER or from the medical ward as soon as possible but within 24 hours of admission. The CT will be performed with a radiation dose &lt;0.5 mSv for a 70kg patient, as a replacement or in addition to the chest radiograph. Pregnancy will be an exclusion criterion for CT because of unwanted radiation exposure. CT interpretation will be performed by a radiologist. Test results will be communicated to the treating physician. Recommendations based on the CT may be to discontinue antibiotics in case of a noninfectious diagnosis that explains the presented signs and symptoms and to start treatment for the alternative diagnosis if needed, or to re-evaluate the CAP diagnosis if no signs of lobar or bronchopneumonia are detected on the CT.</description>

    <description>The FilmArray real-time multiplex PCR (Biofire; bioMérieux) is a Point-of-Care PCR with a panel of respiratory viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus), and three atypical pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis), which will be performed on nasopharyngeal swab samples. Test results will be made available to the treating physician immediately. The treatment recommendation could be adaptation of antibiotic treatment for a documented atypical pathogen, a recommendation to not start or discontinue antibiotics when a virus is the only detected pathogen, or a recommendation to discontinue coverage of atypical pathogens.</description>
