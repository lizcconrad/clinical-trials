  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals are at an increased risk for mental health
      concerns, including anxiety, trauma-based distress, depression, self-harm, and suicidality.
      Quantitative and qualitative studies have shown that support appears to mediate mental health
      concerns, but to date, there have been zero psychotherapy studies focusing on transgender and
      gender diverse patients. The NIH has noted that TGD patients are considered to be a &quot;health
      disparities population,&quot; indicating that there is considerable research to support prevention
      and reduction in mental health disparities for this population.

      There are two aims to the current studyâ€”Aim 1: investigate the feasibility of conducting a
      psychotherapy randomized controlled trial for transgender and gender diverse populations, and
      Aim 2: longitudinally investigate the impact of minority stress interventions on well-being
      for transgender and gender diverse patients.

      First, it is hypothesized that this study will demonstrate feasibility regarding recruitment
      of transgender and gender diverse patients and that patients from both groups will report
      treatment acceptability. We also hypothesize that patients will report more acceptability for
      treatments that are focused on minority stress interventions. It is hypothesized that
      individuals in both the Minority Stress Treatment (MST) group and Treatment as Usual (TAU)
      group will both show improvements in well-being, but that the MST group will demonstrate
      larger effects in outcomes.

      No known published studies have focused on minority stress psychotherapy interventions for
      transgender and gender diverse populations. The findings from the proposed study will provide
      a multitude of information regarding longitudinal psychotherapy interventions focusing on
      minority stress that will inform future treatment manuals and larger, multi-site studies.

The total score ranges from 0 - 180 and includes a cutoff score of 63 or more (indicating symptoms of clinical distress). Higher scores suggest more symptoms of distress and difficulties in relationships. For symptom distress, scores range from 0-100 and the clinical cutoff score is 36 or more. For interpersonal relations, scores range from 0-44 and has a cutoff score of 15 or more. For social role, the range is 0-36 and includes a cutoff score of 12 or more. For all scales, higher scores indicate more distress. All scales are summed.</description>

Prior to attending each of the 12 psychotherapy sessions during their electronic assessment (filling out the OQ-45 on Qualtrics on a computer provided by the study team), patients will be prompted to report up to three minority stress experiences over the previous week in the survey tool (which the therapists will not see).
