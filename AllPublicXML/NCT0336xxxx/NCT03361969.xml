  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to
      evaluate the effects of estetrol on testosterone suppression and quality of life in prostate
      cancer patients treated with an LHRH agonist. Patients will be treated with estetrol or
      placebo for 6 months.

    <measure>Change from baseline in endocrine parameters, adrenal androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)</measure>
    <time_frame>168 days</time_frame>
    <description>Effects on endocrine parameters (Luteinising Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Estradiol (E2), adrenal androgens (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS)), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and SHBG will be evaluated. Actual values at baseline and at the scheduled visits, as well as change from baseline values at the post-baseline visits will be described using summary statistics and graphs. Difference between the treatment groups will be evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response</measure>
    <time_frame>168 days</time_frame>
    <description>Effects on PSA response will be evaluated. Actual values at baseline and at the scheduled visits, as well as change from baseline and percentage change from baseline values at the post-baseline visits will be described using summary statistics and graphs. Nadir and time to nadir will be described using summary statistics. Difference between the treatment groups will be evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire on Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>168 days</time_frame>
    <description>Effects on FACT-P questionnaire will be evaluated. FACT-P includes a 27-item &quot;core&quot; quality of life measure (FACT-G) grouped into 4 sub-scales: physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. The prostate cancer-specific subscale contains an additional 12 items; 10 of which are prostate cancer specific physical problems. Items are rated on a 5-item Likert scale, from 0, &quot;not at all&quot;, to 4, &quot;very much&quot;. Total range of scores is from 0 - 156. Higher scores indicate higher degree of functioning and better quality of life.
Total FACT-P scores, FACT-P general health subscale score (FACT-G) total score and all FACT-P subscale scores will be described at the scheduled visits using summary statistics and graphs. Differences between the treatment groups will be evaluated.</description>

Actual values at baseline and at the schedule visits as well as change from baseline values at the post-baseline visits will be described using summary statistics and graphs. Differences between the treatment groups will be evaluated.</description>
