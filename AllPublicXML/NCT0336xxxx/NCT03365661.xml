      This is a phase II multi-institutional therapeutic study of a non-myeloablative T cell
      receptor (TCR) alpha/beta depleted haploidentical transplantation with post-transplant immune
      reconstitution using ALT-803 for the treatment of high-risk myeloid leukemia (AML),
      treatment-related/secondary AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

    <description>A reduced intensity conditioning starts on Day -6, (CY/FLU/TBI/TLI) followed by infusion of a TCRα/β-deplete haploidentical graft on Day 0. Two doses of ALT-803 are given initially (early) 1 week apart to facilitate NK cell expansion. ALT-803 maintenance (late) for immune reconstitution begins at Day 42 and consists of 4 weekly doses, followed by 4 weeks off. Up to four 8 week treatment courses are permitted. No post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis is administered unless the final donor cell product contains &gt; 2 x 105 α/β T cells/kg recipient weight.</description>
