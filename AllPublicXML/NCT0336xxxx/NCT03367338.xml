      The aims of the study are to evaluate the effect of low-phosphate diet on FGF23 level and to
      determine the optimal amount of dietary phosphate restriction in hemodialysis patients. In
      particular, the investigators will assess the effect of pre-specified low-phosphate diets
      with two different phosphate amounts, 600 mg/day and 800 mg/day, on the changes of FGF23
      level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with hemodialysis, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high, and is
      the leading cause of death. Among several cardiovascular risk factors of hemodialysis
      patients, elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) level is common, and plays major role
      in the development of CVD with independent pathophysiologic mechanisms. Evidence from animal
      studies demonstrated that low-phosphate diet reduced FGF23 level. Clinical trials assessing
      the effect of dietary phosphate restriction on FGF23 focused on non-dialysis populution.
      However, little is known about the effect of low-phosphate diet on FGF23 in hemodialysis
      patients who have higher prevalence of hyperphosphatemia and severely elevated FGF23 level.
      In addition, current clinical guideline, based on evidence from observational studies of
      non-dialysis population, has recommended that dietary phosphate intake should be restricted
      to 800-1000 mg/day (adjusted for dietary protein needs) when serum phosphate levels are
      greater than 5.5 mg/dL in those with kidney failure. For hemodialysis population, the optimal
      amount of dietary phosphate restriction has not been determined. The aims of the study are to
      evaluate the effect of low-phosphate diet on FGF23 level and to determine the optimal amount
      of dietary phosphate restriction in hemodialysis patients. In particular, the investigators
      will assess the effect of pre-specified low-phosphate diets with two different phosphate
      amounts, 600 mg/day and 800 mg/day, on the changes of FGF23 level.

      It is to conduct a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial with cross-over design at a
      hemodialysis unit of tertiary teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. Subjects with aged older
      than 20 years, end-stage renal disease undergoing thrice-weekly hemodialysis for more than
      three months, having adequate dialysis (either single-pool Kt/V equal to or greater than 1.2
      or urea reduction ratio equal to or greater than 65%) and the most recent serum phosphate
      level greater than 5.5 mg/dL or between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dL with regular phosphate binder use
      will be randomly assigned into two groups: those in group A will receive 2-day diet with
      known phosphate content of 600 mg/day, followed by 5-day washout period and then receive
      another 2-day diet with 800 mg/day of phosphate. The opposite order of diets will be
      prescribed in group B. The study diets will be prepared and cooked at hospital cafeteria.
      Dietary compositions of the study diets were analyzed before the start of the study. Primary
      outcome measures are difference in change-from-baseline FGF-23 level between the two dietary
      interventions. Secondary outcomes include changes in serum phosphate, intact parathyroid
      hormone and 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3.

      Since food additives include readily absorbable inorganic phosphorus, only natural food
      sources were chosen for study diets. All raw food items were purchased at local market. Prior
      to enrollment of the eligible patients, the study diets were prepared and cooked by an
      experienced cook at hospital cafeteria and dietary composition of study diets were analyzed
      for chemical analysis. With reference to Association of Official Analytical Communities
      (AOAC) Official Method 984.27, phosphorus, calcium and sodium were determined by inductively
      coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) analysis with the detection limit of
      0.1 mg/L. In brief, the sample weight were obtained, the edible portions of samples were
      ashed at high temperature, digested in nitric acid, and used inductively coupled plasma to
      determine their actual contents of phosphorus and calcium. With reference to Taiwanese
      official methods, study diets were measured for analyses of protein, fat, saturated fat,
      sugar, moisture, and ash. Carbohydrates were calculated by the formula: 100 - (Protein + Fat
      + Moisture + Ash) (g/100 g). Calories were calculated by the formula: Protein (g) x 4 Kcal +
      Fat (g) x 9 Kcal + Carbohydrate (g) x 4 Kcal.

      Based on the measured values of food items, dietitian had crafted low-phosphate diets with
      phosphate content of 600 mg and 800 mg per day respectively. Less than 800 mg per day of
      phosphate amount is designed to fulfill the current clinical recommendation. Two different
      contents of phosphate diets were prepared to find out the optimal amount of dietary
      phosphate. Each of the diets was designed to have similar sodium, calcium, protein and total
      caloric contents but only differ in phosphate contents. To enhance nutrition, and to reduce
      phosphate amount and bioavailability, study diets were designed to fulfill the following
      criteria including high protein diet (≧1.2 g/kg/day), adequate calories (≧ 30 kcal/kg/day),
      low phosphate-to-protein ratio (&lt; 10 mg/g), and higher percentage of plant source of
      phosphate than that of animal source. In addition, meats were sliced and boiled for 30
      minutes before cooking to reduce the amount of phosphate while preserving protein content.
