  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Athletes have been exposed to an ever increasing training load and subsequent biomechanical
      overload due to a constant demand for performance enhancement. As a result, it is observed an
      increased rate of musculoskeletal problems, including spinal biomechanical dysfunctions that
      are often asymptomatic. These dysfunctions are believed to negatively influence a wide range
      of mechanical and physiological parameters such as muscle strength, range of motion, and
      symmetry, what could potentially influence sports performance.

      Spinal Manipulative Therapy (SMT) is a safe and effective therapy for musculoskeletal
      disorders that has been increasingly utilized in sports. SMT purpose is to correct spinal
      joints biomechanical dysfunctions using a high-velocity, low-amplitude movement, applied at
      the paraphysiological space, beyond the passive joint range of motion.

      Kinetic and kinematic symmetry can be measured in commonly utilized physical functional tests
      often used as indicators of athlete's performance. Symmetry Index calculation is used to
      verify bilateral asymmetries in static and dynamic tests.

      Therefore, the objective of this randomized controlled trial study is to measure the
      immediate effects of lumbar SMT on kinetic and kinematic symmetry of asymptomatic athletes,
      through of the use of three commonly used functional tests: Static posture, Free Squat, and
      Countermovement Jump (CMJ) are often used as indicators of athlete's performance. These
      quantitative data is important to assess training effectiveness and prevention/
      rehabilitation programs outcomes. To our knowledge this is the first study on literature that
      measured the immediate effects of SMT on kinetic and kinematic symmetry.

    <description>The participants assigned to the control group received the procedure &quot;Sham&quot; (pre-load positioning MVT). The Sham (SMT) was performed with participant body positioning in the lateral position, as the SMT intervention. The doctor followed the participant through the same position of (SMT) intervention, using the maintenance of set-up position, but no manipulative thrust was delivered. The therapist applied minimal pressure and slid their hands across the skin to mimic the manipulative trust. The position was maintained for approximately 1 minute in total, 30 seconds on each side, and none of force or researcher body weight were putted in this procedure, only minimal pressure common to stabilize the set up position of (SMT).</description>

        Inclusion criteria

        The inclusion criteria for sample followed the assumptions below:

          -  All young student participants had to be of both sexes, age between 18-35 years old.

          -  All participants had to be pain free or asymptomatic, with regards to low back pain,
             in order to create homogeneity within the study sample.

          -  All participants had to have at least a minimal score, (low level) of physical
             activity, evaluated by (IPAQ) questionnaire (International Physical Activity
             Questionnaire). This was done on the argument that the minimal score, already shows
             that the participants were minimally physically active. This also contributed in an
             indirect way to assure a certain degree of sample homogeneity, scoring the minimal
             level of physical activity to include in the study;

          -  All participants were required to show the subluxations or vertebral dysfunctions in
             their lumbar spine, detected by motion palpation. Through the purposive sampling, was
             allowed participants to officially take part in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria for sample followed the assumptions below:

          -  Participants who received medical, surgical or in addition manual interventions prior
             or during the study, were immediately excluded.

          -  Participants who presented with any contraindications to manipulation on spine, which
             included but was not limited to osteomyelitis, tuberculosis, infectious arthritis,
             disc extrusion, hemangioma, vertebral malignancy and advanced spondylolisthesis

          -  Participants who have participating of sports competitions or change in training
             routine during the collecting data, was immediately withdraw from the study.;

          -  Participants with no vertebral dysfunction in the palpated lumbar joints were excluded
             of the study;

          -  Participants who did not sign the informed consent form, or not agree of the
             conditions, or did not have conditions to compromise with the schedule, were
             immediately withdraw from the study.
