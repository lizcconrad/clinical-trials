  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis is a potentially lethal disease that has undergone major changes over
      the last decades. The Duke Criteria are recommended for evaluation of probability of presence
      of infective endocarditis by current ESC guidelines. However, since the introduction of Duke
      criteria in 1994, characteristics of patients presenting with potential infective
      endocarditis have substantially changed, especially in tertiary care facilities, towards a
      high proportion of patients with immune deficiency (caused by illness or medically induced),
      critically ill patients, patients with prosthetic valves and patients with long-lasting
      intensive care treatment. Likewise, with the increasing interventional therapy of structural
      heart disease and device implantation in older and multi-morbid patient cohorts, the
      frequency of endocarditis on prosthetic material and devices increased over the last decades.
      While Duke criteria overall misclassify a substantial proportion of patients with
      endocarditis, Duke criteria are difficult to apply in these patients because of lower
      sensitivity. Therefore, several modifications of the Duke criteria have been proposed. In
      addition, the uncertainty regarding potential infective endocarditis of treating physicians
      due to clinical characteristics of their patients leads to an increase in requests for
      transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, overcoming echocardiography laboratories.
      In the present study the investigators aim to identify (I) the precision of the Duke score in
      predicting presence of infective endocarditis in patients examined at the echocardiography
      laboratory of the West German Heart Center (II) determine characteristics, not including
      echocardiography that are associated with increased risk of infective endocarditis,
      justifying transesophageal echocardiography examination and (III) establish scoring
      algorithms to help treating physicians to assess the risk of endocarditis in severely
      diseased patient cohorts prior to echocardiography examinations and to avoid unnecessary echo
      exams.
