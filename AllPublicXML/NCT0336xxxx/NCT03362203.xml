      The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in local and segmental hypersensitivity and
      endogenous pain inhibition in people with chronic nonspecific neck pain.

      Quantitative sensory testing is widely used in human research to investigate the state of the
      peripheral and central nervous system contributions in pain processing. It is a valuable tool
      to help identify central sensitization and may be important in the treatment of chronic neck
      pain. This study is a cross-sectional study. Two groups including chronic neck pain group and
      healthy volunteers group will be arranged in this study. The healthy subjects will be matched
      for sex and age in relation to the neck pain group. The pressure pain threshold (PPT) will be
      measured at the neck muscle in both groups. The cold pressor test will be used in both groups
      to activate conditioned pain modulation.

    <measure>Change of pressure pain threshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>The PPT will be measured before CPT, 30 seconds after the CPT begin, and immediately after CPT.</time_frame>
    <description>A cold pressor test (CPT) was used to induce pain and trigger the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) response. The conditioned stimulus was immersion of the leg in a bucket of ice water on the side ipsilateral to the most painful neck region. The neck PPT was recorded beginning 30 s after immersion of the leg with two PPT measures for each point. The PPT will be also measured again immediately after CPT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical rating scale for pain (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients used this scale to rate the pain intensity of the neck pain before the experiment.</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS evaluates levels of pain intensity using an 100-point scale (range 0-100), with 0 being classified as &quot;no sensation&quot;, 30 &quot;pain threshold&quot;, 100 &quot;pain as bad as could be&quot;.</description>
