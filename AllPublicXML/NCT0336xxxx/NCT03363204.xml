  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no accurate diagnosis method for bruxism for now. Consequences of bruxism over
      teeth, muscles and articulation of the jaw are important.

      This study aims to develop a innovative tool in order to accurately rapidly diagnose bruxism
      in ambulatory evaluation.

    <description>Patients participating will put the BRUXENSE occlusal splint each night. During the night the device will collect data potentially related to bruxism. After each night the device will be cleaned with water and toothpaste and charged. This routine will be conducted over 10 consecutive nights.</description>
