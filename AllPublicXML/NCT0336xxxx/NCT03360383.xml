  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous vertebroplasty is now a common procedures of patients with acute osteoporotic
      vertebral compression fractures in medical units all over China, but the efficacy and
      essentiality of the surgery remain uncertain and is the subject of this study. This is a
      multiple center open-label randomised trial. Patients were randomly allocated to percutaneous
      vertebroplasty or conservative treatment. Because of the procedure , neither patients nor
      investigators were blinded. The primary outcome was pain relief at 1 month and 1 year.

      This study will use a randomised controlled trial to access the efficacy and essentiality of
      the surgery for vertebral compression fractures. Patients aged 50 years or older, had
      vertebral compression fractures on spine radiograph (minimum 15% height loss) will be invited
      to take part. Patients will be randomised into 2 arms with average amount. The participants
      in the intervention arm will have percutaneous vertebroplasty ; those randomised to the
      control arm will receive current standard conservative treatment methods.

      Patients were clinically assessed at baseline (the day of surgery or treatment), and at 1
      day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year afterwards. The primary outcome will be
      the pain release , categorised according to WHO classification.
