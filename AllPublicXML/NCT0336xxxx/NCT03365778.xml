    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an educational program that will help improve the
      patients' understanding of what laser treatment is, how it might be beneficial to them, and
      why it should be the first glaucoma treatment to consider before the use of glaucoma eye
      drops.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a disease characterized by optic nerve damage, visual field defects, elevated
      intraocular pressure (IOP) and progressive vision loss. More than 3 million Americans have
      glaucoma and more than 150,000 are blind as a result.

      Regular use of glaucoma medications can usually lower IOP, prevent disease progression,
      preserve vision and prevent blindness. However, many people with glaucoma do not always use
      their medication, with about one-third to one-half of patients with glaucoma not taking their
      drops as often as necessary, or have difficulty putting in the drops. There are also numerous
      local side effects from using glaucoma eye drops including red eyes, blurry vision and dry
      eye symptoms. Systemic side effects from eye drops range from triggering asthma, to lethargy
      and depression.

      Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) has been used safely and effectively for the treatment
      of elevated IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma for more than 20 years. SLT may result
      in mild and temporary IOP elevation, but this is a small risk and rarely significant. Other
      side effects include blurred vison and inflammation of the cornea (front, clear part of the
      eye), but they are extremely rare.

      The purpose of this study is to develop an educational program that will help improve the
      patients' understanding of what laser treatment is, how it might be beneficial to them, and
      why it should be considered as first glaucoma treatment before the use of glaucoma eye drops.
