      This study evaluates seroconversion against measles, mumps, rubella and yellow fever
      following vaccination. One-third of children will receive both yellow fever and measles,
      mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccines on the same day; one- third of children will receive MMR
      vaccine at enrollment followed by yellow fever vaccine 4 weeks later; one-third of children
      will receive yellow fever vaccine at enrollment followed by MMR vaccine 4 weeks later.

      The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization recommend that
      yellow fever and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines be administered on the same day or
      at least 4 weeks apart to prevent interference between live vaccines. In 2011 a Brazilian
      study demonstrated lower seroconversion against yellow fever, rubella, and mumps when the two
      vaccines were administered on the same day compared with administering them separately. WHO
      urged that additional studies be conducted to examine this issue.

      This Phase IV study aims to determine if seroconversion against measles, mumps, rubella, and
      yellow fever after administration of MMR and yellow fever vaccines on the same day is
      non-inferior to seroconversion after sequential administration 28 days apart in health
      12-month old children.

          -  Healthy child, determined by clinical history

          -  Availability to do study visits and blood sampling on days 28 + 7 and 56 + 14

          -  Informed consent signed by parents

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous vaccination against yellow fever, measles, mumps, or rubella

          -  History of yellow fever, measles, mumps or rubella

          -  Contraindication for any of the study vaccines: yellow fever vaccine or triple viral
             vaccine, including:

               1. Allergy to eggs, gelatin, or neomycin

               2. Weakened immunological function, including HIV infection, primary
                  immunodeficiencies, having received immunosuppressive doses of oral or injectable
                  corticosteroids (or equivalent), having received immunomodulators or
                  chemotherapeutic agents

               3. Thymus disease

          -  Not being available for the entire study period (up to 3 months), or not able to make
             the scheduled visits or complete the study procedures

          -  Participating in another clinical drug trial of a drug, vaccine, or medical device

             children in percentile â‰¤ 3 in the height/weight tables will be considered
