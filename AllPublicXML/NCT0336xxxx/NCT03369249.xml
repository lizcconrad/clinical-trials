  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study proposes to embed HIV testing outreach workers from a young adult focused
      medical and HIV treatment program into an alternative sentencing program to deliver a new
      service delivery model (Link2CARE) that integrates evidence-based protocols for
      justice-involved young adults to: a) promote HIV and STI testing, and HIV and SU risk
      screening, b) provide onsite intervention, and c) cross-system linkage to HIV, STI, and SU
      care. Phase 1 has already been completed. In phase 1, the intervention components were
      adapted for use among justice involved young adults and the resulting protocols were piloted
      with justice involved young adults, finalizing the resulting 4-session Link2CARE
      intervention. In phase 2, we will test Link2CARE among N=450 justice-involved young adults
      enrolled at the alternative sentencing program and conduct process evaluations with N=15
      alternative sentencing program staff.
