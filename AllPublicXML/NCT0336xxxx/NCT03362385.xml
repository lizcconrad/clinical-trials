  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an increasingly common chronic disorder in adults that has
      been strongly associated with various forms of cardiovascular disease. Compared to the
      general population, OSA occurs more often in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
      Although percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is nowadays part of standard therapy and
      optimal medical therapy has been used to manage traditional risk factors, the long-term
      cardiovascular outcomes after index ACS remain suboptimal.

      Some preliminary data suggest OSA is associated with higher risk of subsequent cardiovascular
      events in ACS patients. However, the study population was heterogeneous and these studies
      were not done in the context of new-generation drug-eluting stents and intensive antiplatelet
      therapy, thus precluding definite conclusions. Furthermore, a cardioprotective role of OSA in
      the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), via ischemic preconditioning, has also been
      postulated.

      Due to the inconsistent evidence, the investigators performed a large-scale, prospective
      cohort study to delineate the whole picture of the association of OSA with short- and
      long-term outcomes of patients with ACS. Whether treatment of OSA (eg. continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP)) would prevent these events will also be evaluated. Moreover, the
      investigators will assess the potential mechanisms of OSA-induced atherosclerosis and
      myocardial injury in ACS patients.
