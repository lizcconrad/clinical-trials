  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of balance training in a virtual environment
      with and without physiotherapeutic intervention on the motor function, balance and gait in
      chronic stroke patients.

      It is a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of
      Research of the Department of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of
      São Paulo University. Forty patients will be randomly assigned in control and experimental
      group.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of a balance training program in a virtual
      environment (using a gaming system with balance board device) with and without verbal/manual
      physiotherapeutic intervention, on the motor function, balance and gait in chronic stroke
      patients.

      It is a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial, performed at Center of
      Research of the Department of Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of
      São Paulo University.

      Forty chronic stroke patients will be randomly in control and experimental group, 20 each
      one. Both groups conduct 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session
      will consist a 30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and
      axial mobility exercises. After this, both groups will perform more 30 minutes of balance
      training using eight Wii Fit games which stimulate motor and cognitive functions.

      The main outcome measures will be: the lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment
      (FMA-LE); Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) and 6- minute walk test (6MWT).

    <measure>Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) measures balance. It includes 36 items that evaluate performance of 6 balance systems: biomechanical constraints, stability limits/verticality, anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, sensory orientation, and stability in gait.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-LE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>FMA-LE is a subscale measuring lower limb motor recovery. It examines movement and coordination of the hip, knee, and ankle in the supine, sitting, and standing positions. Each item is scored on a 3-point scale (0, cannot perform; 1, partially performs; 2, performs fully). The score range is 0 to 34, with higher scores indicating better lower limb motor performance</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT is a practical simple test. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). The 6MWT has been used as a measure of functional status of patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Limits of Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Limits of Stability subtest quantifies the maximum distance a person can intentionally displace their center of pressure (COP) from start position of midline COP centered over the base of support to eight targets. Location and movement of the COP was indicated by a cursor display projected on a screen in front of the subject. As targets were highlighted, the subject was to move the COP cursor quickly and accurately as possible towards a target located on the Limits of Stability perimeter and hold position as close to the target as possible. The parameters include COP movement velocity and directional control (% to target).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rhythmic Weight Shift</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Rhythmic Weight Shift quantifies the subject's active weight shift ability by moving the COP cursor to match velocity and direction of a moving visual target in the medial- lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions at three different velocities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Speciﬁc quality of life scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>Stroke Quality of Life Scale is a self-report assessment that includes 12 stroke subscales with 49 items. The Stroke Speciﬁc Quality of Life Scale attempts to capture the domains of stroke QOL that are insufficiently assessed with generic QOL measures. The 12 subscales, which are unidimensional, are Energy, Family Role, Language, Mobility, Mood, Personality, Self-Care, Social Roles, Thinking, Upper Extremity Function, Vision, and Work-Productivity. Participants responded to each item on a 5-point scale. Domain scores are the averages of the item scores, and the total score is the average of the domain scores. All summary scores therefore range from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate better function.</description>

    <description>Experimental group will perform a balance training program in a virtual environment (using a gaming system with balance board device - eight games of Nintendo Wii Fit®, for 14 sessions) without verbal/manual physiotherapeutic intervention.
Initially, instructions about the rules and strategies of how to play the game and control the avatar will be provided.
Then the patient will be invited to start the game, and in the two attempts of the training no manual or verbal assistance will be provided. Physiotherapist participation during training will be restricted to ensuring patient safety, providing motivational verbal stimuli, and replicating the feedback provided by the game at the end of each attempt.</description>

    <description>Control group will perform a balance training program in a virtual environment (gaming system with balance board device - eight games of Nintendo Wii Fit®, for 14 sessions) with verbal and manual physiotherapeutic intervention. Initially, instructions about the rules and strategies of how to play the game and control the avatar will be provided. Then the patient will be invited to start the game, and in the first attempt of the training physiotherapist will provide manual and verbal assistance, providing corrections on movement (avoiding compensatory movements). In the second attempt, no manual or verbal assistance will be provided (only ensuring patient safety, providing motivational verbal stimuli), allowing the patient to organize his or her performance.</description>
