  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac complications occur in 78% of patients with Fabry disease and are mainly
      characterized by a high frequency of left ventricular hypertrophy resulting from an
      accumulation of GL3 in cardiomyocytes. Apart from family screening, left ventricular
      hypertrophy is an important factor in the diagnosis of Fabry disease. This left ventricular
      hypertrophy is more often concentric and homogeneous, but it can also be asymmetric and mimic
      the patterns seen in so-called familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathies caused by mutations in
      the sarcomere protein genes. Electrocardiogram has been suggested as a screening tool for
      Fabry disease. Analysis of the PQ interval would be of interest. An algorithm has even been
      proposed to differentiate Fabry disease from amyloidosis with excellent sensitivity and
      specificity. The only criterion of left ventricular hypertrophy used in all studies is the
      Sokolov-Lyon index, but this index has many limitations and does not appear to be
      discriminatory for Fabry disease. Other validated criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy,
      such as the Cornell, Lewis, Gubner index or the Romhilt-Estes point score, have never been
      tested in Fabry disease. The primary objective of our study is to evaluate the diagnostic
      value of different electrocardiographic scores of left ventricular hypertrophy in Fabry
      disease.
