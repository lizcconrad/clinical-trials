  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary bacterial influenza pneumonia caused by Panton-Valentine Leukocidin Positive
      Staphylococcus aureus is a rare complication but with poor prognosis. This pathology seems to
      affect young patients (20-40 years) without any medical history. Since the influenza pandemic
      of 2009, this complication is more and more mentioned, sought and diagnosed. However, the
      literature is poor, consisting of case reports, experimental studies on murine models, and
      low-power studies.

      The main objective is to evaluate the mortality in intensive care units of patients
      post-influenza bacterial pneumonia due to a Panton-Valentine Leukocidin positive
      Staphylococcus aureus
