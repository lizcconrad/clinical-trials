      This randomized controlled trial graduate student research study will explore the effect of
      non-surgical intervention of the dorsal application of Kinesio Tape for carpal tunnel
      syndrome, and forearm wrist hand pain. Little evidence exists for an effective non-surgical
      intervention. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to explore changes in occupational
      performance and compliance in order to understand if Kinesio Tape contributed to results and
      if so, how the participants perceived the interventions.

    <measure>Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NRS Pain) and Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>NRS Pain involves patient circling a number from 0-10 with &quot;0&quot; meaning no pain and &quot;5&quot; moderate pain, and &quot;10&quot; is worst possible pain. The VAS Pain involves patients marking a line to indicate their current level of pain between &quot;No Pain&quot; and &quot;Pain as bad as it could possibly be.&quot; These are measured every 3 days for 3 weeks from baseline in the forearm, wrist and fingers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength and Pinch Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>change between baseline and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength is measured by Jamar Dynamometer hydraulic gauge following standard protocol. A Jamar hydraulic pinch meter gauge is used to measure finger strength in the following positions: Lateral pinch, pad to pad, and 3 Jaw-chuck pinch positions are used. Grip and pinch strength will be measured every 3 days for 3 weeks from baseline.</description>

    <description>Dorsal application of Kinesio Tape to the affected extremity: Approximately 12 inches of Kinesio tape will be applied from the musculotendinous junction of the participant's forearm over digits 1 and 5. Two - 2 inch strips of Kinesio Tape will be applied to the participant's wrists over the volar and dorsal aspects. The Kinesio Tape will remain in place for three days, with the participants returning for skin check by the researchers and re-application by the researchers four times during the course of the study.
A tape removal form will be provided should the participants want to remove it prior to the next visit.</description>

    <description>Approximately 4 inch strip of Kinesio Tape will be applied to the scapular spine of the same side as the affected extremity. The Kinesio Tape will remain in place for three days, with the participants returning for skin check by the researchers and re-application four times during the course of the study by the researcher. A tape removal form will be provided should the participants want to remove it prior to the next visit.</description>

    <description>Currently, the standard of care is a general cock-up splint and lumbrical exercises. A general cock-up splint will be supplied, fitted, and checked on each of the four return visits by the researchers. Lumbrical exercises are also used and consist of active joint ranges for the wrist and hand. The exercises will be demonstrated by the researchers for 3-sets of 10 times each, daily, to be recorded in a log by the participants.</description>
