  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a family counseling intervention, entitled &quot;Tuko
      Pamoja&quot; (Translation &quot;We are Together&quot; in Kiswahili). The intervention, delivered by lay
      counselors and through existing community social structures, is expected to improve family
      functioning and individual mental health among members. The sample includes highly distressed
      families with a child or adolescent (ages 8-17) exhibiting emotional or behavioral concerns;
      as such, particular emphasis is placed on adolescent-focused outcomes, including mental
      health and well-being.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a family counseling intervention, entitled &quot;Tuko
      Pamoja&quot; (Translation &quot;We are Together&quot; in Kiswahili), using a single case series design.

      The intervention, delivered by lay counselors and through existing community social
      structures, focuses on improving family relationships and mental health with content derived
      from evidence-based practices; these include solution-focused family therapy and cognitive
      behavioral strategies. It is components based, with modules delivered based on need. The
      content and structure has been adapted in both content and implementation model based on
      formative research in this context. Primary hypotheses include achieving improvements in
      outcomes related to:

        1. Family functioning, including elements such as communication, emotional closeness,
           structure and organization, and satisfaction for the overall family; this also includes
           indicators of functioning at dyadic levels (i.e., parent-child and couples functioning)

        2. Mental health of both children and caregivers, including positive well-being, with a
           particular emphasis on outcomes for children and adolescents.

      The investigators also hypothesize feasibility and acceptability based on a previous
      evaluation of the program and are analyzing community-sourced practices used by lay
      counselors. Investigators hypothesize that they are integrating locally-grounded strategies
      that may influence the delivery or outcomes of the intervention.

      The study will follow a single case series design with a sample size of 8 families, including
      up to 3 caregivers per family (who hold primary responsibility for the child whether
      biological or non-biological) and a target child identified through caregiver-report of the
      child about whom they are most concerned. This design will allow for tracking changes in
      outcome variables over time and for linking clinical changes to session content and delivery
      strategies.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will follow a single case (N of 1) series design. Pre-post changes will be measured, and repeated measures will be administered before, during, and following the intervention to track change over time. The timing of entry into the study and the numbers of repeated measures data points are randomized across families. Data analysis will aim to (a) identify patterns of change over the course of the intervention and (b) relate change trajectories to theorized mechanisms of action.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Family Functioning: Survey Measure (Change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month post-intervention; repeated measures pre, during, and post intervention up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>30 self-report items developed for the local context based on formative research. Responses are endorsed on a 10-point scale and refer to the past month. One composite score is calculated; higher scores reflect better family functioning. A subset of these are administered repeatedly pre- and post-intervention as part of the single case series design multiple assessments.</description>

    <measure>Family Functioning: Direct Observation (Change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A direct observational measure in which families complete standardized video-recorded activities. Behaviors are then coded on multiple domains, including ones related to positive/negative interactions, quality of communication, and problem-solving ability. Primary analyses will be conducted with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent-Child Relationship (Change over time)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month post-intervention; repeated measures pre, during, and post intervention up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Parent-Child Relationship: from standardized scales and locally developed items. Items selected and adapted from: (1) Parental Acceptance and Rejection Questionnaire, (2) Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey: Discipline Module, (3) Discipline Interview, (4) Parent-Adolescent Communication Scale. Each include caregiver and child/adolescent report versions. Caregiver report includes 66 items; Child report includes 60 items. Participants are asked to respond based on the past month. Children report on each caregiver separately.
For primary analyses, one composite score will be calculated. For follow-up analyses, subsets of items may be analyzed, including those related specifically to harsh treatment/abuse.
A subset of these are administered repeatedly pre- and post-intervention as part of the single case series design multiple assessments.</description>

    <description>Locally-derived items and selected items adapted from standardized scales: Conflict Tactics Scale; Dyadic Adjustment Scale; additional locally-derived items. A total of 52 items are included, referring to both self and spouse behaviors. The majority of items are based on a frequency scale, referring to the past month; some items related to spousal maltreatment assess whether behaviors have ever occurred.
As a primary outcome, responses across these items will be combined into one score. Follow-up analyses may be conducted using subsets of items to assess relationship quality and harsh treatment separately.
