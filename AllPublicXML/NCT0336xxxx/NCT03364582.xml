  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men and women
      with ≥130,000 new cases each year. Several dietary patterns have been associated with CRC
      risk but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Researchers thus propose to
      integrate dietary patterns and metabolomics data to comprehensively investigate biological
      pathways linking dietary patterns and CRC risk.

    <textblock>
      Several dietary patterns have been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk but
      underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Also, evidence is lacking on the consistency
      of dietary guidelines for overall health and CRC prevention given that it is not feasible to
      have an optimal diet for every disease. Furthermore, metabolomic profiling has not been
      widely assessed with respect to CRC risk. Metabolomics is uniquely suited to assess metabolic
      responses to dietary stimuli, given that it is situated downstream to all the other &quot;omics&quot;.
      Building on prior work in hypothesis-driven dietary patterns and CRC prevention, the
      researchers seek to fill these knowledge gaps by proposing to: 1) use a standardized
      methodology to compare the best diet for overall health with the best diet for CRC
      prevention, and further determine if any associations of dietary patterns with CRC prevention
      are mediated by mechanisms involving inflammation and insulin; 2) determine metabolites that
      may mediate the association of dietary intake with CRC risk. The researchers will utilize two
      large prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals
      Follow-up Study (HPFS), in which dietary and nondietary data have been collected every 2 to 4
      years among 173,230 women and men over the last ≥30 years, with ≥3,400 CRC cases and ≥43,800
      all-cause deaths. This integrated interrogation of dietary patterns and metabolomics data
      will inform the design of guidelines for healthful lifestyles that are optimized for CRC
      prevention.

        The Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). The NHS
        recruited 121,701 registered female nurses aged 30 to 55 years at baseline in 1976, and the
        HPFS enrolled 51,529 male health professionals aged 40 to 75 years at baseline in 1986 in
        the United States. In both cohorts, questionnaires were sent at baseline and every two
        years thereafter to collect and update demographic, lifestyle, medical, and other
        health-related information. Since the inception of both cohorts, participants have
        completed self-administered questionnaires every 2 years, providing updated information on
        medical and lifestyle factors. Every 2 to 4 years, participants receive validated
        semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) for dietary assessments.
