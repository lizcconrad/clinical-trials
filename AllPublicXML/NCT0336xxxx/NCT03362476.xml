  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will harness the multidisciplinary expertise to adapt an effective alcohol
      reduction computer-based intervention, called CBT4CBT, to enhance its appropriateness for
      HIV/HCV co-infected women and evaluate its efficacy. The intervention, if effective, may be
      an efficient and cost-effective alcohol reduction strategy, that is scalable and can be
      readily disseminated and integrated in clinical care at other AIDS Centres in Russia to
      enhance women's health and reduce HIV/HCV transmission risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women co-infected with HIV and HCV are at elevated risk for adverse health outcomes
      associated with alcohol use. Evidence-based alcohol reduction interventions for this
      vulnerable population are limited. To address this gap, the proposed study will harness the
      multidisciplinary expertise and experience of collaborative Russian-U.S. research team to
      adapt an effective computer-based intervention, called CBT4CBT, to enhance its
      appropriateness for HIV/HCV co-infected women and evaluate its efficacy. The proposed study
      will be conducted in three sequential stages: (1) Adaptation, (2) Implementation, and (3)
      Evaluation. Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) adapted
      computer-based alcohol reduction intervention, or (2) standard-of-care control condition. The
      proposed trial design and analysis provide an appropriate conceptual and methodological
      framework to assess the efficacy of the adapted computer-based intervention. The
      intervention, if effective, may be an efficient and cost-effective alcohol reduction strategy
      that is scalable and can be readily disseminated and integrated in clinical care at other
      AIDS Centres in Russia to enhance women's health and reduce HIV/HCV transmission risk.

    <description>CBT4CBT is a computer-based version of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) used in conjunction with standard clinical care for current substance users. Modules and follow up assignments focus on key concepts in substance use, including cravings, problem solving and decision making skills. The multimedia presentation, based on elementary level computer learning games, requires no previous experience with computers.The CBT4CBT intervention will be adapted to be linguistically, gender- and HIV/HCV-appropriate for Russian women living with HIV/HCV.</description>
