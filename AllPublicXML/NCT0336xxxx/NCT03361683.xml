  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients intubated due to acute respiratory failure have a high risk of infectious
      complications, airway injuries and multiple organic failure, so performing a successful
      extubation from mechanical ventilation is key. Between 10 and 20% of patients develop
      extubation failure, which is related to an increased in-hospital death rate, infections,
      higher costs and longer hospital stays. High-flow nasal oxygen therapy delivers heated,
      humidified air at flows up to 60L/min, and an oxygen concentration close to 100%, providing a
      fresh air reservoir at the naseo-pharyngeal level, evening out the peak inspiratory flow rate
      of the patient, improving air conductance, promoting secretion management, increasing
      end-expiratory lung volume, and applying a positive end-expiratory pressure. Such effects
      result in decreased breathing work, dyspnea relief, improved use tolerance, increased
      oxygenation, and lower fraction of inspired oxygen in patients with hypoxemic respiratory
      failure. High-flow oxygen therapy has recently been described to decrease extubation failure
      in a group of patients classified with low failure risk, in comparison to Venturi mask, and
      it was not inferior to non-invasive mechanical ventilation in high risk patients. However, it
      is worth pointing out that a large percentage of the patients included in such studies did
      not develop acute respiratory failure primarily.

      Given the beneficial effects described above, the investigators hypothesize that high-flow
      nasal oxygen therapy decreases the risk of extubation failure in a group of patients that
      required invasive mechanical ventilation due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intubated patients recovering from acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who have passed a
      spontaneous breathing trial will be included in the study. Following extubation, patients
      will be randomized assigned to one of two study groups. Heart rate, breathing rate, median
      arterial pressure, FiO2, SpO2, and dyspnea and comfort levels will be measured at defined
      intervals after extubation (basal, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and
      48 hours). An arterial blood gas test will be performed 60 minutes and 24 hours after
      extubation. The number of patients fulfilling certain preset criteria regarding extubation
      failure will be determined.

      Extubation failure shall be defined as the need for using invasive mechanical ventilation
      again within two days following extubation based on the criteria below:

        -  Breathing rate over 25 breaths per minute for more than two hours.

        -  Heart rate above 140 beats per minute or with a sustained increase or decrease greater
           than 20%.

        -  Clinical data showing fatigue of the respiratory muscles or an increase in breathing
           work.

        -  SaO2 &lt;90%; PaO2 &lt;80 mmHg with a FiO2 &gt; 50%.

        -  Hypercapnia (PaCO2 &gt;45 mmHg or &gt;20% compared to the value before extubation) with a pH
           below 7.33.

      Patients who do not fulfill the extubation failure criteria after the first 48 hours of
      admission may receive extra supplementary oxygen through any device (e.g., nasal cannula,
      face mask, reservoir mask, etc.). Every day, SpO2 will be measured and the moment when the
      patient reaches SpO2 &gt;94% with no need for oxygen will be determined.
