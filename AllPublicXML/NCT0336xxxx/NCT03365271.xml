  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter clinical trial aims to investigate the exact effect of drainage use for
      osteoarthritis patients in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) on post-operative performance.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter,open-label randomized controlled trail. A total of 100 participants
      will receive same perioperative treatment schedule, and all surgeries will be carried out by
      the same surgeon. Among all the participants, 50 patients will be randomly assigned to the
      experiment group in which a drainage will be applied during the surgery, while another 50
      patients will be randomly assigned to the control group without a drainage application in the
      surgery.Data on perioperative bleeding volume, swelling of lower extremities, pain score will
      be collected and analysed.
