  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a new intervention, BOLSTER, which was designed to provide
      more support for patients with ovarian cancer and their caregivers after a hospitalization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalizations can be difficult for patients with cancer, especially when they are
      transitioning home. Patients and caregivers are often expected to perform complex medical and
      nursing tasks with little or no preparation. Patients and caregivers report high levels of
      unmet needs for information about how best to manage symptoms and new medical procedures
      (such as managing new tubes, lines or drains).

      The study team has developed a research project which aims to address these needs. If a
      patient agrees to participate in the study, she will take part in a program called BOLSTER
      (Building Out Lifelines for Safety, Trust, Empowerment and Renewal). BOLSTER will provide
      patients and caregivers with education and skills training, symptom management, and support
      across care settings.
