  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is the realization of tests at home and in Hospitals or
      Functional Rehabilitation for the improvement of the communication with the family and
      medical entourage, the facility of the emotional expression, the evaluation of the pain, the
      control of home automation to increase their autonomy, facilitated their reintegration at
      home. The work is the last step of the research program started in 2009, with the
      optimization of the installation of the system, the improvement of physical and computer
      ergonomic aspects and the development of dedicated interfaces according to the type of
      disability and needs. of each one.

      A work upstream of the definition of specifications taking into account the medical
      constraints was realized and the actions of improvement of the models, the algorithms, the
      robustness and the effectiveness of the treatment are in progress . The specific adaptation
      to concrete cases should lead to a system that allows 90% of the population of people with
      disabilities to exploit the system and significantly improve their level of communication,
      autonomy and in fact their daily lives.
