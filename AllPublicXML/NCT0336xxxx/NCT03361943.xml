  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses data from the NHANES surveys to evaluate trends in SSB intakes among US
      children. The goal was to determine whether recent declines in intake may have been less
      marked in the more vulnerable groups with a persistently high burden of obesity, including
      race/ethnic minorities and low-income groups.

      Recent studies suggest sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has been declining among US
      children 2-18y. However, most studies focus on changes in mean intake and little is known
      about trends in the high SSB consumers who are most at risk of excess weight gain. There is
      also limited understanding of whether and how these changes over time may have influenced
      disparities in intake among vulnerable groups of children with persistently high levels of
      obesity, including children from low-income households, and several race-/ethnic minorities.

      This analysis of six cycles of US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
      dietary surveillance data from 2003-2014 examined shifts over time in SSB intake at both the
      median and 90th percentile among US children. The study evaluated the extent to which
      disparities in intake of total SSBs, as well as major SSB subtypes (regular sodas, fruit
      drinks and other), may have persisted in vulnerable groups, for both median and &quot;heavy&quot;
      intake. The analysis presents data for three age groups: 2-5y, 6-11y and 12-18y by gender,
      and focus on three race-ethnic groups: Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and
      Mexican-American. Household income is used as the primary socioeconomic status variable.
