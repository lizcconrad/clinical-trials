    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of cervical disc
      replacement with the ProDisc-C vivo Cervical Disc in a prospective, randomized, multi-center
      trial with 7 years of follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial at 7 years of follow-up comparing
      ProDisc-C vivo artificial cervical disc replacement and ACDF (Anterior cervical discectomy
      fusion) to treat degenerative disc disease (DDD). 648 DDD patients (age from 20 to 70) from
      several hospitals matching the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to two groups
      (324 patients in each group). One group will be treated with ProDisc-C vivo disc replacement.
      The other group will be treated with ACDF. The clinical outcomes and radiographic
      measurements will be compared between two groups at 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 84 months
      after the surgical treatments.

    <description>A patient's outcome was considered an overall success if all of the following conditions were met: 1) postoperative (Neck Disability Index) NDI score improvement of at least a 15-point increase from preoperative score; 2) maintenance or improvement in neurological status; 3) disc height success; 4) no serious adverse event classified as implant associated or implant/surgical procedure associated; and 5) no additional surgical procedure classified as a &quot;failure&quot;.</description>

    <description>The neck disability index(NDI) questionnaire measures the level of pain and disability associated with various activities. The NDI is a 10-item, 50-point index that assesses different aspects of daily functioning in patients with neck pain. Each item is scored 0 to 5. The NDI score is a sum of the scores of the10-item. Clinical effects will be evaluated based on scores of the NDI. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Neck and arm pain scores will be measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from &quot;0' (no sensation) to '100&quot;(the most intense pain imaginable) where 30 means &quot;pain threshold&quot;.</description>
