  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the preliminary efficacy of an innovative mobile-health (mHealth)
      intervention (hereon referred to as S4E) to improve human immunodeficiency virus and sexually
      transmitted infection testing and reduce HIV/STI risk behaviors in a clinic sample (n=100) of
      at-risk youth ages 14-21 living in Southeast Michigan. A Stage I randomized control trial
      will be conducted to examine the preliminary efficacy of S4E, relative to Usual Care (UC),
      over a period of six months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV/STI and drug abuse remain significant public health priorities in the US and youth are
      disproportionately affected. Youth between the ages of 15 - 24 constitute 25% of the sexually
      experienced population, yet account for 46% and 50% of HIV infections and new STIs,
      respectively. National surveillance data indicate that youth disproportionately engage in
      HIV/STI risk behaviors, including condomless sex and licit and illicit drug use, which
      increase their risk for HIV/STI infection. Despite the disproportionately high rates of
      HIV/STI infection and risk behaviors in youth, fewer than 14% report having ever been tested
      for HIV and many are not routinely screened for asymptomatic STIs as recommended by the
      Center for Disease Control. In Southeast Michigan, HIV/STI are disproportionately high. To
      address these significant public health concerns, a mobile-health (mHealth) intervention was
      developed for health clinic settings. The proposed research aims to develop a cross-platform
      and universal version of S4E. The cross-platform and universal version of S4E will be
      compatible with both IOS and Android operating systems, and multiple mobile devices, aimed at
      providing adolescents with ongoing access to the intervention once they leave the clinic. The
      proposed research will also evaluate the preliminary efficacy of S4E to improve HIV/STI
      testing and reduce HIV/STI risk behaviors in a clinic sample (n=100) of at-risk youth ages
      14-21 living in Southeast Michigan by conducting a Stage I RCT to examine the preliminary
      efficacy of S4E, relative to Usual Care, among a sample of 100 at-risk youth over six months.

    <intervention_model_description>To test the preliminary efficacy of S4E, we will conduct a Stage I RCT and use a mixed between/within-subjects design with two levels of intervention (S4E and Usual Care) as the between-subjects factor and three repeated measures assessments (Baseline, 3-, and 6-months post-Baseline) as the within-subjects factor.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Adolescent HIV Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 and 6 month post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Post-intervention, we will assess whether youths requested to receive HIV testing at the clinic, and at 3 and 6 months post-baseline (yes/no).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in condomless sex behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 month post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent unsafe sexual behavior will be measured (time points 1-3) using items extracted from Jemmott, Jemmott, and Fong's Sexual Behavior instrument. This gated instrument will assess the adolescent's past 90-day condom use, number of sexual partners, and contraceptive use (non-condom).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in drug use behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 and 6 month post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Licit and illicit drug use behaviors will be assessed (time points 1-3) using items from the Monitoring the Future Study. Youth will be asked whether or not they have used licit or illicit drugs in their lifetime and the past 90 days. Youth who report &quot;Yes&quot; to past 90-day sex will be asked to report the frequency of drug use before sex. These measures have been used in our formative research.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinician-Youth Communication</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 and 6 month post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Completed by both the clinician (α =.70) and youth (α =.69), clinician-youth communication will be assessed (time points 1-3) using items adapted from the Matched Pair Instrument (19 items; MPI). MPI assesses process and content of communication, including verbal and action-related behaviors performed by clinicians. Responses range from &quot;1=strongly disagree,&quot; to &quot;5=strongly agree,&quot; on a five-point Likert scale. A sample statement for clinicians and youths is, &quot;Encouraged the patient/me to express his or her/my thoughts concerning drug use behaviors.&quot;</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Youth Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 and 6 month post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Youth's self-efficacy will be assessed (time points 1-3) using two scales, including the Condom Self-Efficacy Scale (19 items, α =.85), and Drug Use Resistance Self-Efficacy (24 items, α =.98). Responses range from &quot;1=not sure at all,&quot; to &quot;4=definitely sure,&quot; on a four-point Likert scale. A sample question for the youth is, &quot;How sure are you that you can refuse if a friend offers you marijuana at a party and you do not want it?&quot;</description>

    <description>S4E application was developed in collaboration with youth in Southeast Michigan. S4E aims to prevent and reduce HIV/STI risk behaviors, including drug use and sexual risk behaviors, and increase HIV/STI testing among youth. Content produced for the application is based on scientific prevention principles in conjunction with youth input. To date, we have developed modules focused on youth alcohol &amp; drug use, HIV &amp; STIs and a forthcoming module on tobacco prevention and cessation.</description>
