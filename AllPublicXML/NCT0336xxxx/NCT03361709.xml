  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is rapidly growing worldwide. One major concern with
      diabetes mellitus is how it may affect vision in different ways; including the increased risk
      of developing cataract. Several studies have found an association between diabetes mellitus
      and the development of cataract. In patients with DM, cataract progression is also faster and
      occurs at a younger age.5 While results for modern cataract surgery are satisfactory,
      cataract surgery in diabetic patients carries a higher risk of peri and post-operative
      complications than in non-diabetic patients. Several studies have shown that the corneal
      endothelial count of diabetic patients is decreased, with more damage occurring to corneal
      endothelial cells following phacoemulsification in diabetics than in non-diabetics. This is
      presumed to be due to increased vulnerability of corneal endothelial cells in diabetics and a
      delay in the repair process.

      Administration of topical corticosteroids is the main method to control post-operative
      inflammation after phacoemulsification, however many studies have also proved the safety and
      efficacy of intracameral corticosteroids to control inflammation post-operatively. While
      intracameral triamcinolone is effective in controlling post-operative inflammation, elevation
      of intraocular pressure is a main concern.

      Dexamethasone has been found to be effective in controlling post-operative inflammation with
      no effect on intraocular pressure. This may be due to its rapid turnover and short half-life.
      No studies however have been performed to evaluate the safety and benefit of intracameral
      injection of dexamethasone following phacoemulsification in diabetic patients. In the present
      study, investigators aim to evaluate this and determine its effect on the post-operative
      corneal endothelial cell density and corneal thickness.

      This is a prospective interventional randomized controlled cohort study to determine the
      safety and benefit of intracameral dexamethasone injection at the conclusion of
      phacoemulsification in diabetic patients with cataract.

      All patients will undergo full ophthalmological examination including best corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior segment examination and fundus
      examination. History and control of diabetes mellitus will be recorded. Patients ≥ 40 years
      old with a visually significant cataract, who are known to be diabetic for more than 10 years
      and are free of exclusion criteria will be included in our study.

      In addition to routine pre-operative cataract evaluation and investigations, patients will
      also undergo non-contact Specular Microscopy (Konan Medical, Inc., Hyogo, Japan) to record
      the pre-operative corneal endothelial cell density in the central cornea, as well as
      anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT, Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) to
      record pre-operative central corneal thickness (CCT).

      Standard phacoemulsification will be performed using the Infiniti machine (Alcon, Fort Worth,
      Texas, USA) with the stop and chop technique, and 0.2 mg of dexamethasone in 0.05 ml will be
      injected intracamerally at the conclusion of surgery in half of the study eyes, assigned
      using a randomization method.

      Post-operative examination will include BCVA, IOP measurement and level of anterior segment
      inflammation on days 1,7 and 30 of follow up. Specular microscopy and AS-OCT will be
      performed at day 30 of follow up. Ophthalmologist performing examinations and investigations
      will be masked to whether dexamethasone was injected or not to avoid bias.

      The difference in mean corneal endothelial cell density before and after phacoemulsification
      will be compared between both groups. The difference in CCT, post-operative inflammation and
      IOP will also be compared between both groups.

      All statistical analyses will be done using IBM SPSS v20.0 statistical software (IBM
      Corporation, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics will be calculated, and the data will be
      summarized as mean ± SD for numerical data, and as frequencies and percentages for
      categorical data. When the p-value is &lt; 0.05 this will be considered as statistically
      significant.
