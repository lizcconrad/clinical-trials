  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a major problem among veteran populations. Insomnia impacts physical and mental
      health functioning and is associated with reduced quality of life. Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is one of the most promising treatments for insomnia; however,
      access to CBT-I is severely limited by a lack of trained clinicians within the Veterans
      Health Administration (VHA). There is a critical need to offer innovative approaches to meet
      the demand and need for insomnia treatment. Leveraging technology to meet treatment demands
      is consistent with service delivery models based upon stepped care principles. This
      randomized controlled trial will determine whether a computerized, self-guided, web-based
      version of CBT-I is efficacious in reducing insomnia symptoms and improving functioning
      compared to a computerized program control.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Symptom Severity; Time 1 to Time 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis will be the intent-to-treat comparison between groups of the change in insomnia symptom severity as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) from Time 1 to Time 2. Statistical inference regarding the difference between intervention groups will be based on the estimated coefficient for a group indicator variable in each of three analysis of covariance models with the change from Time 1 to Time 2 for each outcome serving as the dependent variable. Additional covariates will include the baseline value of the outcome to improve the precision of the estimate, and any potential confounders discovered in the randomization check.</description>
