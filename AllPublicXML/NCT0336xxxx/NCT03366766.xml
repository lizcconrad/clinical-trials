    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well Nivolumab, Cisplatin, and Pemetrexed Disodium or
      Gemcitabine Hydrochloride in treating patients with stage I-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer
      that can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as Nivolumab, may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as Cisplatin
      and Pemetrexed Disodium or Gemcitabine Hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving Nivolumab, Cisplatin, and Pemetrexed Disodium or
      Gemcitabine Hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate major pathologic response (mpCR) in patients with newly diagnosed and
      untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage I-IIIA treated with three courses of
      induction nivolumab added to either cisplatin/pemetrexed or cisplatin/gemcitabine prior to
      surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety. II. Complete pathologic response at all sites of disease. III. Major pathologic
      response rate at primary site. IV. Clinical complete response rate. V. 1 year progression
      free survival (PFS). VI. Overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether PDL1 expression is associated with treatment response. II. To explore
      whether there is a net change in the Th1/Th2 ratio (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL10, etc.) or cell
      subset frequencies (M2 monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc.) within a patient's
      peripheral blood either at baseline or in response to treatment is associated with treatment
      response.

      III. To explore whether exosomes or other immune related serum biomarkers change after
      combination therapy.

      IV. To explore the predictive value of serial cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels
      and response.

      V. PD-L1 assessment in tumor.
