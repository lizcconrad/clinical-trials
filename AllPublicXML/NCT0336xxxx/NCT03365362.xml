      This 2 x 2 factorial, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will test two
      interventions: directly observed medication therapy, and long-term therapy with varenicline
      among 450 smokers with opioid use disorder recruited from community-based, outpatient opioid
      treatment programs. The analytic strategy will evaluate the milestones in smoking
      cessation—achieving initial abstinence, preventing lapse and preventing relapse--necessary
      for long-term cessation, and evaluate theoretically-guided psychological and social factors
      and pharmacogenetic factors that influence these cessation processes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use and tobacco-related disease are highly prevalent among persons with opioid use
      disorders (OUD). Unfortunately, traditional evidence-based smoking cessation interventions
      have yielded low rates of tobacco abstinence in this group. The majority of trials evaluating
      smoking cessation treatment interventions among persons with OUD have relied on short-term
      interventions that do not account for the unique challenges faced by these smokers,
      specifically, establishing initial abstinence, adhering to evidence-based cessation
      treatments, and maintaining abstinence once active treatments cease. Long-term smoking
      cessation medication treatment approaches have shown promise in promoting cessation and
      decreasing relapse among individuals without OUD, however the applicability of extended
      medication approaches to smokers with OUD may be limited by poor adherence to smoking
      cessation medications. Though adherence to cessation medication is strongly associated with
      cessation success, adherence is especially challenging for persons with OUD. Opioid treatment
      program-based directly observed therapy (DOT) interventions improve clinical outcomes in HIV
      and TB, and pilot data suggest that DOT varenicline is associated with increased smoking
      cessation medication adherence and may increase smoking cessation rates. In this 2 x 2
      factorial, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the investigators will test
      two interventions: directly observed medication therapy, and long-term therapy with
      varenicline. The analytic strategy will evaluate the milestones in smoking
      cessation—achieving initial abstinence, preventing lapse and preventing relapse--necessary
      for long-term cessation, and evaluate theoretically-guided psychological and social factors
      and pharmacogenetic factors that influence these cessation processes. The investigators will
      recruit 450 smokers with OUD from community-based, outpatient opioid treatment programs and
      test the following specific aims: (1) to test the efficacy of directly observed varenicline
      therapy compared to self-administered varenicline therapy on smoking cessation milestones,
      (2) to test the efficacy of long-term varenicline compared to short-term varenicline on
      smoking cessation milestones, and (3) to understand the mechanism of smoking cessation by
      examining the impact of theory-guided psychological and social factors and of pharmacogenetic
      factors on cessation milestones.
