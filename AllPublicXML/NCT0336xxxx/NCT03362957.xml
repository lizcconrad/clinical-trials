  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To evaluate embolization as a treatment for OA related knee pain versus placebo to
      demonstrate the actual effect of embolization on pain and disability.

      Participants: There will be 21 subjects enrolled over the age 40 with knee pain secondary to
      arthritis.

      Procedures (methods): This will be a single-blinded randomized-controlled study of GAE versus
      placebo in a small population with knee pain secondary to arthritis to determine safety and
      efficacy. Clinical procedures and evaluations will consist of a preoperative screening
      assessment to determine if the potential study subject meets the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate artery embolization, and follow-up
      visits at 24 hours, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months. An MRI will be performed after the 1-month visit in
      those patients who underwent embolization to detect a change in synovial vascularity and to
      exclude complication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-blinded randomized-controlled study of GAE versus placebo in a small
      population with knee pain secondary to arthritis to determine safety and efficacy. After
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of a written informed consent and over,
      approximately a 24 month duration, N=21 subjects will be recruited. Only subjects â‰¥ 40 years
      will be screened for study recruitment. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio of
      GAE:Placebo and will be blinded from study treatment (see flow chart below). The placebo
      procedure will be a diagnostic angiogram of the knee, without embolization. Appropriate
      measures will be taken to ensure patients and nursing staff caring for the patient are
      blinded to assignment. Each patient will be told at the time of recruitment that they may be
      randomly assigned to sham, but if after 1 month they have not had symptom improvement, their
      assigned procedure would be revealed and, if they had undergone a sham procedure, they will
      be allowed to proceed with embolization. This second procedure should be shorter than a
      complete angiogram and embolization, as the detailed angiogram will not need to be repeated,
      and therefore both arms will have similar total radiation dose.

      Clinical procedures and evaluations will consist of a preoperative screening assessment to
      determine if the potential study subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate artery embolization, and follow-up visits at 24
      hours, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months. An MRI will be performed after the 1-month visit in those
      patients who underwent embolization to detect a change in synovial vascularity and to exclude
      complication.

    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) will be used to measure function. This is a score derived from a questionnaire in which the patient answers questions regarding rheumatic symptoms in the subcategories of pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Individuals select the level of difficulty they have performing various tasks using a 5 point Likert scale (0=None, 1=Slightly, 3=Very, 4=Extremely). Then, results are scored with a total maximum score of 96. A higher score indicates more difficulty in each of the categories.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient pain (mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain will be assessed at each of the patient's follow-up visits and used to measure the change from baseline (prior to the GAE procedure). The investigators will use this to measure if the patient's pain level decreases.</description>
