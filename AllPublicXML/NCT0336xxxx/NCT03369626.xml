  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study evaluating a three month digitally delivered lifestyle change program in
      adults with Type 2 Diabetes. The FareWell Program (the &quot;Program&quot;) aims to reduce
      well-established biomarkers of cardiometabolic diseases, weight, and medications. The current
      study is designed to evaluate to what degree adults with Type 2 Diabetes engaged with the
      Program can improve glycemic control and/or decrease medication needs.

      The Program aims to reduce well-established biomarkers of cardiometabolic diseases, weight,
      and medications. It includes meal planning tools, smart shopping lists, recipes curated by a
      physician, dietitian and chef educator, daily self-monitoring features with personalized
      weekly goals, bi-weekly live one-on-one health coaching and support from an online member
      community, and an educational curriculum. Subjects in the Program may receive support from
      other members of a Care Team (lifestyle medicine physician, chef educator, registered
      dietitian and/or psychologist/psychiatrist) as needed. The Care Team does not provide medical
      advice, nor replace traditional medical care. Instead, the Care Team encourages behavior
      change by providing support and sharing its expertise.

      Study participants will have access to the Program for a twelve week period and will be asked
      to complete short health surveys at baseline and at the end of the study.
