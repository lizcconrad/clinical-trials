      As a first step toward investigating whether modulation of impulsivity and associated neural
      pathways may yield clinically meaningful changes in risk for adolescent suicidal behavior,
      the R21 is a proof-of concept study evaluating the potential for tDCS targeting brain regions
      associated with behavioral impulsivity (right inferior frontal gyrus [rIFG]) and cognitive
      impulsivity (left orbitofrontal cortex [lOFC]) to modulate these facets of impulsivity in a
      sample of adolescent suicide attempters. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      anodal tDCS over the rIFG, anodal tDCS over the lOFC, or a sham stimulation condition, in a
      three-group design. Task-based measures of behavioral and cognitive impulsivity will be
      administered before and after tDCS or sham stimulation. Additionally, EEG and ERP data will
      be collected during the impulsivity tasks, and resting-state EEG data will be collected pre-
      and post-tDCS administration to confirm engagement of the targeted brain regions and to
      delineating the neural pathways underlying the effects of tDCS on impulsivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in adolescence. To improve the ability to
      predict and prevent suicidal behavior, there is a pressing need for research in this area to
      advance beyond identifying risk factors toward a greater focus on the mechanisms of risk for
      this behavior. In particular, elucidating the neural pathways underlying risk for suicidal
      behavior is important insofar as such work may yield specific and modifiable targets for
      clinical intervention. The adoption of new experimental paradigms providing experimental
      control over potentially modifiable risk factors has been recommended as a means of
      meaningfully advancing the field in this regard. Although yet to be applied to the study of
      suicidality, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in conjunction with measures of
      electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs), may hold promise as an
      experimental paradigm in the study of potentially modifiable risk factors, and underlying
      neural mechanisms, for suicidality. One such risk factor of particular relevance to suicide
      in adolescence is state-sensitive aspects of impulsivity. Impulsivity has been consistently
      linked with suicidality, with this association appearing to be stronger in adolescence than
      adulthood. As a first step toward investigating whether modulation of impulsivity and
      associated neural pathways may yield clinically meaningful changes in risk for adolescent
      suicidal behavior, the R21 is a proof-of concept study evaluating the potential for tDCS
      targeting brain regions associated with behavioral impulsivity (right inferior frontal gyrus
      [rIFG]) and cognitive impulsivity (left orbitofrontal cortex [lOFC]) to modulate these facets
      of impulsivity in a sample of adolescent suicide attempters. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive anodal tDCS over the rIFG, anodal tDCS over the lOFC, or a sham
      stimulation condition, in a three-group design. Task-based measures of behavioral and
      cognitive impulsivity will be administered before and after tDCS or sham stimulation.
      Additionally, EEG and ERP data will be collected during the impulsivity tasks, and
      resting-state EEG data will be collected pre- and post-tDCS administration to confirm
      engagement of the targeted brain regions and to delineating the neural pathways underlying
      the effects of tDCS on impulsivity.

    <description>The Stop-Signal Task (SST) is a task requiring inhibition of a prepotent motor response. The SST requires participants to respond to a target stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing a button, but also to withhold their response when they hear an auditory signal. Thus, this task involves a competition between activating and inhibiting processes. The primary outcome variable is change in the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) for the task administered seconds to minutes before and seconds to minutes after stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Delay Discounting Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from within an hour pre-stimulation to within an hour post-stimulation condition</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized Delay Discounting Task (DDT) will be used to assess impulsive choice. In this task, participants are asked to choose between an immediate but small monetary reward and a delayed but larger monetary reward. Delay discounting is the tendency to undervalue an anticipated future reward as the time delay to obtaining the reward increases. Participants will be presented with nine ascending and descending choices until their responses reach a convergence point where their preferences for the immediate and delayed reward are equal (the indifference point). A lower indifference point or a higher discounting rate (preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards) indexes greater impulsivity. The primary outcome variable is change in performance on this task administered seconds to minutes before and seconds to minutes after stimulation.</description>

    <description>tDCS at a constant current of 1.5 mA will be applied for one 20-minute session over the right inferior frontal gyrus . Resting-state EEG for 10 minutes will be recorded immediately prior to and after tDCS. After post-tDCS resting state EEG is acquired, participants will complete the Stop Signal and Delayed Discounting Task, while EEG is recorded to extract Evoked Response Potentials in a single-blind procedure. The participants and assessors will be blind to experimental condition. Ordering of tasks will be counterbalanced.</description>

    <description>In the sham condition, the current will be ramped up to 1.5mA for 30 seconds and then ramped back down to 0. As this commonly used sham procedure produces a brief tingling sensation, participants are kept unaware of their experimental condition. Resting-state EEG for 10 minutes will be recorded immediately prior to and after the sham tDCS. After post-sham stimulation resting state EEG is acquired, participants will complete the Stop Signal and Delayed Discounting Task, while EEG is recorded to extract Evoked Response Potentials in a single-blind procedure.

    <ipd_description>Analysis files will be constructed from the stored electronic data and will be stripped of identifying information with the Safe Harbor method. Specifically, youth and their parents will be identified with a family identifier and person identifier number that is randomly generated and not related to any element of their personal identifying information. No names, addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, medical records, etc. will be retained. Dates will contain only year and a randomly generated day-of-the-year. The investigators will only share it with external investigators when a data use agreement (DUA) is executed between Lifespan and the requester's institution. The DUA will specify the requested data elements (each of which must be justified), the specific research question, the timeline for the project, and schedule for data destruction. The data will be made available on April 1, 2021 by the PI</ipd_description>
