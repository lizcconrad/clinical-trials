  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study´s objective was to identify the effectiveness of nursing orientation for the
      reduction of anxiety and stress of patients that was waiting cardiac catheterization. Method.
      This is a randomized clinical trial. The sample consisted of patients that was waiting
      cardiac catheterization who were divided into two groups: intervention group (patients who
      received nursing orientation with a validated guidance manual about this procedure) and
      control group (patients who received the routine nursing orientation). The primary end points
      were the anxiety and stress, which was evaluated in two moments (before and after the nursing
      orientation). The State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-state) was used to assess anxiety and the
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was used to assess stress. Prior to the collection, the
      research project was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee and the data was collected
      after its approval.

      This study´s objective was to identify the effectiveness of nursing orientation for the
      reduction of anxiety and stress of patients that was waiting cardiac catheterization. Method.
      This is a randomized clinical trial. The sample consisted of patients that was waiting
      cardiac catheterization who were divided into two groups: intervention group (patients who
      received nursing orientation with a validated guidance manual about this procedure) and
      control group (patients who received the routine nursing orientation). The subjects were
      consulted about the desire to participate, and those who agreed, signed the consent form. The
      patients were randomized to one of two groups (control or intervention), according to the
      sequence determined by the Random System. Randomization was carried out by a teacher who did
      not participate of any phase of this study. After randomization, the patients were instructed
      how to fill out the instruments. The primary end points were the anxiety and stress, which
      was evaluated in two moments (before and after the nursing orientation). The State Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI-state) was used to assess anxiety and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was
      used to assess stress. Subsequent to this first evaluation, the patients, both in the control
      group and in the intervention group, received the intervention by another profissional. After
      the patients were evaluated about anxiety and stress. Prior to the collection, the research
      project was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee and the data was collected after its
      approval.

    <measure>Change from score of anxiety and stress</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients were followed for one day</time_frame>
    <description>The anxiety and stress were evaluated using the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-state) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), immediately before and after interventions. The STAI -state consists of 20 items, with Likert responses ranging from 1 (Absolutely not) to 4 (Very High), obtaining values from 20 to 80 points, that the higher the score, the greater the patient's anxiety. Anxiety was categorized as follows: low anxiety (20-34 points), moderate anxiety (35-49 points), high anxiety (50-64 points) and very high anxiety (65-80 points). The PSS-10 has 10 items, whose score varies from 0 to 40 points, and the higher the scores, the greater the perceived stress of the patient.</description>
