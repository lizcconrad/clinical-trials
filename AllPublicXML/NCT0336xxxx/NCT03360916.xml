      The purpose of this study is to determine how different doses of a statin affect muscle
      health and exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High cholesterol and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently prevented and treated with
      statin therapy. Statin use can cause muscle weakness, fatigue and/or pain, and these symptoms
      can increase with dose and duration of statin use. Statins may also change the ability to
      exercise.

      This study is testing how different doses of a statin, Lipitor, affect muscle health and
      exercise. The doses that will be used in this study (20 mg/day or 80 mg/day) are typical for
      treating high cholesterol.

      This study is expected to last about 14 weeks.
