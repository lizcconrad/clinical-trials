  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab (study drug)
      combined with standard radiation to the tumor (tumor boost) before patients undergo standard
      treatment that can consist of one or more of the following: breast-conserving surgery,
      radiation to the entire breast/chest wall after surgery, and chemotherapy.

      Study participants will receive two doses of the study drug intravenously (through the vein)
      before their planned breast surgery or chemotherapy. The study drug will be administered
      three weeks apart. At the time of the second dose, radiation to the tumor in the affected
      breast will be given. This type of radiation treatment is called a &quot;tumor boost&quot;, which is a
      standard part of radiation therapy for breast cancer that may occur either before or after
      planned breast-conserving surgery. Patients will receive breast surgery or begin chemotherapy
      approximately six weeks after your first dose of the study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With more than 1 million new cases diagnosed yearly worldwide, breast cancer is a global
      public health burden. Over the past decade, molecular subtyping of breast cancer has
      identified intrinsic subtypes that may be at enhanced risk for both local and distant
      recurrence. This study focuses on the immunogenicity of high-risk breast cancer subtypes that
      are likely to display a dense lymphocytic infiltration including including TNBC and HR+/HER2-
      tumors.

      Immune build up via immune co-stimulatory molecules permits the ensuing immune response to
      strengthen and destroy cancer systemically. Thus, the effect of the anti-tumor immune
      response initiated by the radiation to an intact tumor by combination with checkpoint
      blockade is increased.

      Pembrolizumab is an optimal immunotherapy agent to study, as this agent has recently been FDA
      approved for use in multiple tumor types. It is therefore ready to be tested for efficacy in
      other disease sites and in combination with other treatments.
