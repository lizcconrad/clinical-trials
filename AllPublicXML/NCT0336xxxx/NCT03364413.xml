  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how the brain responds when individuals eat enjoyable
      foods such as chocolate. Eating certain foods can make one want to keep eating even when
      feeling full, caused by dopamine in the brain. The researchers believe this dopamine response
      can be measured by looking at the individual's eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With obesity at an all-time high, understanding eating behavior beyond physical need is a
      priority. Food reinforcement is driven by central dopamine activity. However, objective
      measurement of brain dopamine-related behavioral events is hindered by the lack of
      non-invasive, accessible techniques that are amenable to testing in a &quot;naturalistic&quot;
      environment. The goal of this project is to develop a non-invasive, accessible methodology to
      measure dopaminergic responses to food in a natural setting. This research will use a novel,
      hand-held electroretinograph (ERG) that does not require eye dilation and uses a skin
      electrode to measure retinal dopamine activity. Previous work establishes that retinal
      dopamine activity can be used as a proxy for central dopamine function. The ability to assess
      both subjective behavioral variables and central dopaminergic responses simultaneously will
      provide an ideal approach for innovative studies of the control of eating behavior.
