      Radial Head Fractures are common injury in children. In this study, healthy children with
      Mason type I or II radial head fractures are planned to be included.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure will be an assessment of functional daily
      activities as measured by the MAYO score at four weeks post injury. Secondary outcomes will
      include an assessment of pain scores using VAS.

      Sample Size and Analysis: Assuming a standard deviation of 10%, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2 and
      10% dropout rate yields a sample size of 150 patients. Secondary analyses will include
      Fisher's Exact test to compare proportions of children with full range of motion of the
      injured ankle at four weeks and with full baseline activity level at four months, and the
      area under the curve of a pain-time profile curve will be compared using a Student's t-test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        5 to 18 years of age with one of the following fracture Undisplaced Maoson types I and II
        fractures of the radial head

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The diagnosis of elbow sprain or contusion; they occur primarily in adolescents with closed
        epiphyseal plates.

        All open fractures which require surgical debridement. All children at risk for
        pathological fractures such as those with congenital or acquired generalized bony disease.

        Congenital anomalies of the elbow. Patients with coagulopathies. Multisystem trauma and
        multiple fractures of the same or opposite limb. Patients cognitively and developmentally
        delayed with inability to express pain and/or difficult assessment of baseline activity
        level.

        Injuries greater than 72 hours old. Past history of surgery or closed reduction of the same
        elbow within the last 6 months or ankle trauma of the same ankle within 3 months.
