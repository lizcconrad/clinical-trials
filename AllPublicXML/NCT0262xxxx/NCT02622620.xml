      Contrast-enhanced MRI is the most common way for evaluating neuroepithelial tumor grading and
      monitoring for tumor recurrence,but the ability to predict tumor behavior remains very
      limited.In this study, the investigators will use multi-b-value diffusion-weighted
      imaging(DWI),three-dimensional arterial spin labeling(3D-ASL) and dynamic contrast-enhanced
      MRI imaging(DCE) to evaluate neuroepithelial tumor grading and monitor for tumor recurrence.

      Glioma is classified into 4 grades, with worse prognosis for more advanced grades.Previous
      studies have suggested that different therapeutic strategies should be applied for gliomas at
      different grades,so glioma grading before the operation is therefore of important clinical
      significance for guiding the grade-dependent therapeutic strategy.

      Combination temozolomide and radiation significantly prolongs survival compared with
      radiation alone and has become standard treatment for Patients with high-grade glioma.
      Response assessment in these patients is difficult as a result of the frequent occurrence of
      early imaging changes indistinguishable from tumor progression, termed pseudoprogression. The
      majority of patients remain clinically stable. It is often unclear whether current therapy
      should be maintained or second-line therapy initiated.

      The ADC value can potentially reveal the differences in cellularity and nuclear atypia of
      gliomas1. Theoretically, high cellularity in advanced gliomas may impede free water diffusion
      and thus lead to a decreased ADC value.In several previous studies,recurrent tumors have
      shows significantly higher cellularity than those shown by pseudoprogression.Such high
      cellularity is associated with relative reductions in extracellular space when compared with
      low cellularity, resulting in decreased diffusivity of water molecules in the former
      circumstance when compared with the latter. DWI measures the degree of water diffusion within
      tissue Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values quantify the mobility of water molecules
      at the cellular level, holding the potential to differentiate between necrosis, edema and
      recurrent tumor.

      A potential mechanism of pseudoprogression is that radiation-induced vascular changes may
      lead to focal transient increase in gadolinium enhancement.Three-dimensional arterial spin
      labeling(3D-ASL) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI imaging provides a noninvasive means
      for quantifying tumor vascular properties.
