  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer can be painful following surgery or can develop later and remain persistent.
      Pain occurrence is frequent with 50% of women developing sequelae pain of varying intensity
      with an impact on the quality of life. One of the priorities of the 3rd French Cancer Plan is
      to preserve quality of life.

      Osteopathy, complementary therapy, may help to reduce inconvenience caused by the disease,
      treatments and their side effects (asthenia, anxiety and pain).

      The main objective is to assess the impact of osteopathic treatment on pain in patients
      following breast cancer surgery. The impact will be considered beneficial if the pain score
      (digital scale) in the intervention group is lower, by at least two points, than the pain
      score in the control group at the end of the study.

      This is a monocentric, randomized, parallel group, single-blind and prospective clinical
      trial.
