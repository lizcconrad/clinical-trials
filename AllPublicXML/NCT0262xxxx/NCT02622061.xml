    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, single visit clinical investigation involving patients with known PCD
      vs. age matched healthy volunteers. This study involves 1 visit which will last one (1) to
      two (2) hours. Participants (and parent as applicable) will be asked for their consent to
      participate in the study. A brief medical history will be recorded, including information
      such as age, gender, height, weight, race, current medications and living environment. If the
      participant is a PCD patient, they will also be asked about their disease history. Prior to
      performing the nasal measurements, participants will receive instructions from study
      personnel and have the opportunity to practice. All participants will have a brief nasal exam
      and will also have to blow their nose before starting the measurements. Participants will be
      asked to perform nasal nitric oxide measurements using the tidal breathing method followed by
      the velum closed with expiration against resistance method.

      The primary objective is to determine the feasibility and capability of the NIOX VERO to
      discriminate participants with PCD from those that are healthy. Information collected in this
      study will help researchers understand more about the diagnosis of and identification of
      patients with PCD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 5 years and older.

          2. Anatomically, is able to complete the nasal NO measurements in both nostrils.

          3. Cohort 1 - PCD Patients: Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of PCD from one of
             the PCD diagnostic centres based on clinical phenotype PLUS diagnosis made by at least
             1 of the following (the specifics about how diagnosis was made must be documented in
             their medical file):

               -  A nasal biopsy or scraping showing a hallmark PCD defect such as, an outer (+/-
                  inner) dynein arm defect, microtubule defect, or

               -  A genetic test positive for bi-alleilic mutations in a known PCD-causing gene
                  associated with the diagnosis of PCD (e.g., ARMC4, C21orf59, CCDC39, CCDC40,
                  CCDC65, CCDC164, CCDC103, CCDC114, CCDC151, CCNO, DNAAF1 (LRRC50), DNAAF2 (KTU),
                  DNAAF3, DNAH5, DNAH11, DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAL1, DYX1C1, HEATR2, HYDIN, LRRC6, MCIDAS,
                  NME8 (TXNDC3), ODA/IDA, OFD1, RPGR, RSPH3, RSPH4A, RSPH9, SPAG1, ZMYND10), or

               -  EU Centres Only: A low nasal NO (determined by a chemiluminescent analyser) plus
                  either:

                    -  at least 2 separate occasions with 'hallmark' changes on high-speed video
                       microscopy, or

                    -  demonstration of mislocalisation of ciliary proteins by immunofluorescence
                       microscopy.

          4. Cohort 2 - Healthy Patients: Healthy, non-atopic, non-smoking patients (defined as
             patient with no airway or immune problems, no recent significant injury, no systemic
             infection, no systemic inflammation, no allergies or asthma).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             guardian).

         11. PCD Patients Only: Has mutations with RSPH1 since nasal NO may not be low in these
