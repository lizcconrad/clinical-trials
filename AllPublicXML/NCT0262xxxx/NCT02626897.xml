  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cross-over study of 12 patients with sarcoidosis will look at two different widely-used
      accelerometer devices. These devices are wrist worn and similar in size to a wrist-watch.
      They measure daily activity levels. The investigators hope to use one of these devices in the
      future within a randomised-controlled trial looking at using methylphenidate for the
      treatment of sarcoidosis-associated fatigue. In order to ensure that the investigators choose
      the ideal device the investigators wish to compare the GENEActiv and ActiGraph GT3X devices.
      Participants will be required to wear the devices for 7 days each, with 6 patients beginning
      with the GENEActiv device and changing to the ActiGraph device after 7 days, the remaining 6
      participants starting with the Actigraph before changing to the GENEActiv. Patients will
      complete a short exit questionnaire about their experience with the devices and their
      preference. The best device will be determined by both patient preference and reliability of
      collecting data.

    <textblock>
      This will be a small comparator study comparing two devices (GENEActiv original and ActiGraph
      GT3X) in 12 patients with sarcoidosis. Participants wear one device for 7 days before
      returning the device, and wear the second device to wear for a further 7 day period. Each
      participant will wear the devices for 24 hours throughout the measurement period. The devices
      will be worn in a random order, randomised using sealed envelopes. They will be advised not
      to remove the devices during the 7 day monitoring period, with the exception of the GT3X
      which should be removed if the participant is bathing or swimming (they are able to shower).
      When each device is returned the participants will be asked to complete an exit questionnaire
      on their experience with the device. Before the participants wear the devices they will be
      asked to complete a short question regarding how tired/fatigued they feel.

      The devices will be worn on the participant's non-dominant wrist. They will wear both devices
      in a random order (determined by randomisation at the start of the trial with regards to
      which device will be worn first). Six participants will start with the GENEActiv device and
      six will begin with the Actigraph GT3X device. The device order will be chosen randomly based
      upon a random number sequence generated in Microsoft Excel and placed in envelopes numbered 1
      to 12.
