  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is the first step in the development of an new assay that may be further
      tested as a screening method for ovarian and endometrial cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most high grade ovarian cancers originate in the fallopian tubes. Since the lining of the
      fallopian tube opens into the uterine cavity cancer cells from ovarian/fallopian tube cancers
      can travel through the uterus to the cervix and vagina. Likewise, endometrial cancer cells
      shed through the cervix into the vagina. It may be possible to develop a screening test for
      ovarian and endometrial cancers by collecting vaginal cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Ovarian Cancer and Endometrial Cancer cases:

          1. Women age 19 or older.

          2. Histologically confirmed high grade serous cancer (had a pre-operative core biopsy) of
             ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal origin or histo-cytologically confirmed endometrial
             cancer, not yet treated by surgery or chemotherapy.

          3. Give consent to access primary tumour tissue following surgery or biopsy.

        Healthy participants:

        1) Healthy women between the ages of 19 and 60.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ovarian Cancer and Endometrial Cancer cases:

          1. Women with self-reported, known pregnancy.

             Healthy participants:

          2. Women with a prior diagnosis of gynecologic malignancy (ovarian, endometrial,
             cervical, or vulvar cancer) will be excluded.

          3. Women who report irregular bleeding (spotting between menstrual cycles, or
             post-menopausal bleeding), or who have self-reported gynecologic concerns (e.g. pelvic
             pain, pelvic masses, dyspareunia) or have had a recent evaluation for gynecologic
             concerns (consultation with a gynecologist, pelvic ultrasound, endometrial biopsy) are
             ineligible.

          4. Women with known Lynch Syndrome and/or BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations will not be
             eligible to participate as healthy volunteers for this study.

          5. Women with self-reported, known pregnancy.
