      BACKGROUND: In 2011 a Maternity Services Development Programme was implemented in a South of
      England city, to promote effective collaborative working between maternity services
      (midwives) and other service providers (health visitors, social workers, specialist services
      etc.) by co-locating services in local childrens centres. The progamme ultimately aimed to
      improve care for local service users (women and their families), especially those considered
      vulnerable. Implemented changes were based on evidence that suggests poor collaborative
      working contributes to poorer outcomes. RATIONALE: To explore the impact of the programme on
      local service providers, and by association service user care. AIM: To explore a localised
      Maternity Services Development Programme, identifying how inter- agency collaborative working
      occurs, and the service providers perceived benefits and challenges on collaboration, and by
      association service user care. METHODOLOGY: The proposed research uses a case study approach
      to collect and analyse predominantly qualitative data, and some quantitative data. Data will
      be collected using observation episodes (e.g. participant meetings) to observe collaboration,
      and interviews to explore these experiences. Additionally documents will be analysed to
      observe documented evidence of collaborative practice. Pre-existing statistical data will
      also be used to highlight changes in indicators of service user well being since the
      implementation of the Maternity Services Development Programme. PARTICIPANTS: A cross-section
      of service providers (no service users) working in or with maternity services from 4 of 9
      city Children Centre's. FINDINGS: No current findings, data collection expected to start
      September 2015.

      In 2011 a Maternity Services Development Programme (MSDP) was implemented in one South of
      England city. The programme aimed to promote effective collaborative working between
      maternity services (midwives) and other service providers (health visitors, social workers,
      Children Centre staff, specialist and volunteer services) to improve outcomes for service
      users (women and families). The MSDP utilised local Children's Centres, which provide
      community focused family support, to co-locate maternity services and other service
      providers. The rationale to improve collaborative working is supported by evidence suggesting
      poor collaborative working contributes to poorer outcomes (Laming Report 2003; Marmot Review
      2010). Therefore programmes such as the MSDP could potentially improve short and long-term
      outcomes for those accessing maternity services.

      The proposed research uses a case study approach to collect and analyse predominantly
      qualitative data, and some quantitative data. This method will allow for analysis of the MSDP
      and understanding of its influence on maternity services and collaboration, and will aim to
      illuminate perceived strengths and challenges of the MSDP evident to services providers. Data
      will be collected using observation episodes (e.g. participant meetings) to observe
      collaboration, and interviews to explore experiences. Additionally documents will be analysed
      to observe documented evidence of collaborative practice. Pre-existing statistical data will
      also be used to highlight changes in indicators of service user well-being since the
      implementation of the MSDP.

      The research will recruit a cross-section of service providers (no service users) that work
      in or with maternity services from four of the nine city Children Centres. Invitation letters
      will be circulated to potential participants through participating Children Centre
      management, where they will be invited to participate in the observation and interview data
      collection activities. They will then be able to select the extent of their participation.

    <description>The Maternity Services Development Programme was implemented to improve care for local families (service users) involved with maternity services. The aim was to improve care during the early stages of a family's development and to establish foundations for long-term well-being. One aspect of the programme worked to improve the delivery of care by facilitating collaboration and joint-planning between service providers. The programme uses local city Children's Centres to co-locate services (different agencies or professionals who are working within the same locality). The aim of co-location was to promote stronger collaboration between maternity services and other service provider agencies to develop stronger partnerships, and to help identify those who are (or who may become) vulnerable.</description>
