  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a social media-based (Facebook) intervention
      that provides support and skills to parents with adolescent children in treatment for
      substance abuse. The Facebook intervention, PURPOSE, will be 8 weeks long and led by other
      parents (peer leaders). Peer leaders will go through 2 2-3-hour training sessions and be
      assessed at the end to confirm their understanding of study protocol and procedures. The
      study PI will lead 2 short (2-weeks) trial tests of various segments of the intervention to
      test out content and procedures. Then, a pilot trial with 80 parents, 40 randomized to
      PURPOSE and 40 randomized to treatment as usual (TAU), will be done to test how useful
      PURPOSE can be in promoting parents' engagement in their child's treatment and recovery while
      reducing their own distress and feelings of shame/stigma. Parents will do a phone interview
      at the start of PURPOSE and again at the end of the 8 weeks.

      This study will take advantage of established peer training techniques to train parents of
      adolescents who are more experienced to help other parents better engage in services for
      their adolescent child. This pilot study marks the beginning of our long-term program of
      research focused on adapting intervention tools for delivery via e-technology platforms as a
      means for optimizing treatment effectiveness for youth. Thus, the proposed study will
      contribute to the scientific literature on the role of parental support in adolescent
      recovery as well as respond to NIDA's call for increased understanding of the feasibility and
      utility of social media as an option expanding the traditional treatment and face-to-face
      self-help groups. The proposed study has the following aims:

      Aim 1: To develop PURPOSE, a social-media based intervention that provides information and
      coping tools for parents/guardians of adolescent children with a SUD. The theoretically
      grounded intervention will be peer-led, and will be developed and refined with feedback from
      experts, providers, parents, and adolescents.

      Aim 2: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of PURPOSE that uses online peer-led
      intervention delivery. Trial testing will be conducted to iteratively refine content and
      procedures in order to optimize the engagement and usefulness of the intervention for
      parents.

      Aim 3: To conduct a pilot control trial to provide preliminary data on this intervention so
      as to determine if social media-based parent support group involvement positively impacts
      parent outcomes (reduced stigma and distress, improved parent monitoring, and increased
      engagement in adolescent treatment) and adolescent outcomes (treatment retention and
      abstinence).
