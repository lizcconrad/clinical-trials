  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two purpose of this study, first is to find whether arthroscopic rotator cuff
      repair is changing the appearance of supraspinatus muscle atrophy in each and every patient.
      Second, is to find how much approximate change one can expect depending on age and tendon
      retraction

      Retrospective review of 209 patients having both preoperative and immediate postoperative MRI
      done. Both preoperative and immediate postoperative occupancy ratio calculated and from that
      change in occupancy ratio calculated for each and every patient. Patient were divided in two
      major group according to age that is &lt;60 years and &gt;60 years and 3 subgroups of mild,
      moderate and severe depending on preoperative supraspinatus tendon retraction on coronal view
      of MRI. Postoperative occupation ratio was compared with preoperative occupation ratio within
      the subgroups and change in occupation ratio was used for comparison between the subgroup.
      Change in occupation ratio was also used for comparison between 2 major groups

    <description>Supraspinatus muscle atrophy was measured and evaluated according to the Thomazeau classification. Stage 1: slight atrophy occupation ratio (1.00-0.60), Stage 2: moderate atrophy occupation ratio (0.60-0.40), Stage 3: Severe atrophy occupation ratio(&lt;0.40). Both preoperative and immediate postoperative occupancy ratio calculated and from that change in occupancy ratio calculated for each and every patient.Postoperative occupation ratio was compared with preoperative occupation ratio within the groups and change in occupation ratio was used for comparison between the groups.</description>
