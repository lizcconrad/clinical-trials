      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a functional yogurt
      powder on menopausal, middle-aged women at high risk of osteoporosis. The functional yogurt
      powder containing Calcium, D, K, C vitamins, Zn, Mg, L-leucin and the Lactobacillus plantarum
      3547 probiotic, was developed to benefit bone health and in the long term may contribute to
      the prevention of osteoporosis.

      Randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect
      of a functional yogurt powder on bone health biomarkers in menopause, middle-aged women at
      high risk of osteoporosis.

      78 volunteers will be recruited at the La Paz University Hospital of Madrid. Participants
      should meet the next inclusion criteria: being menopausal, aged between 50 and 65 years,
      IMC≥18.5 &lt;35 Kg/m2 and having a diagnosis of osteopenia without pharmacological treatment
      (Volunteers without osteopenia diagnosis should meet two of the next: dairy intake under 2
      servings a day, sedentary lifestyle and/or smokers of more than 5 cigarettes a day).

      Participants will be randomized in two arms:

        1. Functional yogurt powder arm: they will receive over 24 weeks a daily serving of the
           functional yogurt powder containing Calcium, D, K, C vitamins, Zn, Mg, L-leucin and the
           Lactobacillus plantarum 3547 probiotic.

        2. Control yogurt powder arm: they will receive over 24 weeks a daily serving of the
           control yogurt powder (not enriched).

      All participants will be advised to follow a healthy diet and practice physical activity.

      Follow up will include 3 individualized visits and 4 group visits to check the product intake
      compliance and the tolerance to the product. The primary outcome, vitamin D level, will be
      measured at the beginning (basal condition) and at the end of the intervention (24 weeks).
      Other bone health biomarkers (Parathyroid hormone (PTH) calcium, phosphorus, calcitonin,
      osteocalcin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH),osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, sclerostin,the
      N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) and C-terminal telopeptide CTx) and safety issues (transaminases
      and creatinine) will be measured at the same time points (0 and 24 weeks).
