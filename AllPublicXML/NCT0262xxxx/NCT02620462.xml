    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the leading causes of lower limb disability among the
      elderly and can cause loss of knee joint proprioception that contributes towards
      deterioration of postural balance. Maintaining a good postural stability is essential while
      performing everyday functional activities and to avoid falls. Exercise training has been
      reported to reduce pain as well as improve performance of functional tasks in patients with
      KOA however compliance to exercise can be challenging due to pain, lack of motivation and
      traditional nature of exercise that can easily overtax patients. Furthermore, there are not
      exercise programs that are specifically designed for patients with KOA in order to address
      lost knee joint proprioception. Recent studies have also demonstrated that visual feedback
      during exercise can enhance the benefits of exercise training. Therefore, the aim of the
      proposed study is to implement an interactive sensor-based exercise training to improve
      postural balance, gait and activities of daily living in patients with KOA.

      The exercise intervention procedure is based on wearable sensor game-based balance-training
      program (Exergame). Subjects will perform progressive balance exercises such as ankle
      reaching or weight shifting, obstacle crossing, and ankle trail making task (i.e.
      motor-cognitive task). Real-time visual/audio lower-extremity joint motion feedback will be
      provided using wearable sensors (LEGSys, Biosensics LLC, Cambridge, MA, USA) to assist and
      encourage subjects to accurately execute each exercise task. The same wearable sensor
      technology is also used to quantify changes in balance and gait.

      Changes in balance, gait, fear of falling, physical activity, pain, and quality of life
      parameters will be assessed at the beginning and conclusion of the training program.

      Subjects will perform sensor-based interactive balance training (on computer screen), 2 x
      week, for a period of 6 weeks. The training consists of three balance tasks shown on a
      computer screen (1. ankle reaching task or weight shifting , 2. obstacle negotiation task,
      and 3. ankle trail making task (i.e. motor-cognitive task) intended to improve postural
      stability.
