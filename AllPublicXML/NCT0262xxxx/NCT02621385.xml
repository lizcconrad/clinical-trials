  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the potential effect of administration of tradipitant on
      CYP3A4 using midazolam pharmacokinetics as markers.

      The study will also further characterize the pharmacokinetics of tradipitant.

             intrauterine device [IUD], diaphragm or condom with spermicidal jelly or foam or
             cervical cap) for a period of 35 days before the first dosing, for the duration of the
             study, and recommended to use it for one month after the last dose. Women are

             another acceptable method of birth control during the study and recommended to use it
             for one month after the last dose. Women currently taking oral contraceptives will be
             required to discontinue their regimen at least two weeks prior to first dosing.
