      This study will consist of two parts: Part A will evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GS-4059 in healthy participants. Part B
      will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and the effect of GS-4059 on disease-specific
      clinical markers and outcomes in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
