      The main aim of the WESTCOR study is to

        -  investigate the ability of two high sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays to
           diagnose acute coronary syndrome and predict prognosis in different patient populations
           (e.g. gender, age and co-morbidity)

        -  to validate the suggested 1 hour protocol for rule in and rule out of acute coronary
           syndrome for two hs-cTn assays in an unselected chest pain population

        -  to investigate different biomarkers ability to predict long term prognosis after
           hospitalization for chest pain

      The WESTCOR-study will include patients presenting to the Emergency Department of Haukeland
      University Hospital and Stavanger University Hospital with symptoms indicative of acute
      coronary syndrome. 1500 patients will be included at Haukeland University Hospital and 1500
      at Stavanger University Hospital. The two locations use different high sensitive troponin
      assays (i.e. hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI (Abbott Diagnostics) for routine diagnostic of coronary
      syndrome.

      3000 patients will be sampled and hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI will be measured at admission, after
      three hours and after 8-12 hours. Clinicians will be blinded to the results of the hs-cTn
      assay that is not used as routine assay locally. Final diagnosis will be made by two
      independent cardiologists based on all available clinical information and results of the
      routine tests. The ability to diagnose or exclude MI at different sampling points in
      different patient populations will be compared for the two hs troponin assays. Differences in
      the clinical follow-up of will be compared for the two locations and related to eventual
      differences i hs-cTn results. Analytical interferences will be measured for the different
      assays.

      1500 patients will have an additional sample 1 hour after admission. The clinicians will be
      blinded to the results of this sample (both hs-cTn assays). The ability of the one-hour
      sample to diagnose or exclude myocardial infraction (MI) will be compared between the two
      assays.

      All patients will have a follow-up sample 3 months after discharge. The patients will further
      be followed for 20 years through national registers and the prognostic value of hs-cTn
      concentrations and dynamics as well as other biomarkers, will be measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:
