  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycemic index concept is widely used to determine impact of a food to blood glucose. Several
      studies showed that water content and intake after meal may influence glycemic response of
      the meal and thus have an effect on the result of GI measurement. Currently these studies
      found conflicting results. Therefore, this study aims to determine whether water intake,
      specifically after meal, may influence the glycemic response and glycemic index value of the
      meal.

    <description>The glycemic index is a calculated from measurements of area under the glucose curve after the food is eaten, divided by the corresponding area after the control food is eaten. The value is multiplied by 100 to represent a percentage of the reference food.</description>
