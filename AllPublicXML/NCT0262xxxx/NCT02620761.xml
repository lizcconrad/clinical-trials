  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      with a sample size of 20 patients in each of the two arms (fenoldopam vs placebo) based upon
      a difference in serum creatinine by one standard deviation. Fluid and salt intake will be
      held constant within clinical parameters and carefully measured. Fenoldopam will be started
      at 0.1 ug/kg/min. If, after 6 hrs there is no decrease in blood pressure, the dose will be
      increased to 0.2 ug/kg/min. This dose will be continued throughout the remainder of the
      study. A study of pediatric patients previously provided to the FDA showed no hypotension at
      a dose of 0.2 ug/kg/min. Fenoldopam will be started 12 hrs before the first dose of
      indomethacin and discontinued 12 hrs after the 3rd dose of indomethacin. Study samples will
      include both blood and urine. The primary outcome will be a reduction in renal dysfunction,
      as determined by creatinine and urine output over the course of treatment. Additional
      outcomes will include determination of known and novel metabolomic urine markers of renal
      dysfunction.

      Hypotheses

        -  The investigators primary hypothesis is that fenoldopam reduces renal dysfunction
           associated with indomethacin administration for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in
           preterm infants. A secondary endpoint or measured outcome will be the determination of
           fenoldopam pharmacokinetics in the premature population. Lastly, the investigators
           hypothesize that urine and serum acute kidney injury (AKI) biomarkers will be superior
           to contemporary neonatal AKI definitions in their ability to identify renal injury.

      Specific Aims

        -  Evaluate the effect of fenoldopam on renal function in preterm infants administered
           indomethacin

        -  Determination of fenoldopam pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in preterm
           infants

        -  Define whether newly identified biomarkers of renal dysfunction are more sensitive
           markers of renal dysfunction following indomethacin than traditional markers including
           urine output and serum creatinine.

      Study design

        -  The study will be a prospective, blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial.
           Fenoldopam will be started at 0.1 ug/kg/min. If, after 6 hrs there is no decrease in
           blood pressure, the dose will be increased to 0.2 ug/kg/min and continued throughout the
           remainder of the study. The previous study in pediatric patients showed no hypotension
           at a dose of 0.2 ug/kg/min. Fenoldopam will be started 12 hrs before the first dose of
           indomethacin and discontinued 12 hrs after the 3rd dose of indomethacin.

      Describe study population or sample material

        -  5-14 day old preterm infants born at less than or equal to 28 weeks gestation with
           patent ductus arteriosus in whom attempted medical closure with indomethacin is
           indicated as decided upon by the attending physician Sample size/power of primary
           endpoint

        -  Sample size is 20 patients in each of the two arms (fenoldopam vs placebo) based upon an
           improvement in serum creatinine by one standard deviation.

    <time_frame>66 hrs - from 6 hrs before beginning of fenoldopam or placebo infusion up to 24 hours after the last dose of indomethacin</time_frame>
    <description>Urine will be collected and measured in 6 hour increments beginning 6 hours prior to starting fenoldopam or placebo infusion. The first dose of indomethacin will be given 12 hours after starting fenoldopam or placebo. Two additional doses of indomethacin will be given 12 hours apart. Urine will continue to be collected and volume measured in 6 hour increments up to 24 hrs after the last dose of indomethacin. To summarize, urine will be collected and measured from time -6 hours to 0 hours. Fenoldapam or placebo will be initiated at time 0 hrs, indomethacin given at time 12, 24 and 36 hours, and urine collected and measured to time 60 hours.</description>
