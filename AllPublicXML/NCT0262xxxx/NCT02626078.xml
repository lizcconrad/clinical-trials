  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutrition is an essential component of health and a key determinant of aging and quality of
      life of individuals. Malnutrition in the elderly is now recognized as a public health problem
      affecting nearly half of residents in nursing homes. The fight against malnutrition requires
      to rethink the meal in all its dimensions, beyond the nutritional needs. In order to improve
      practices of care at the elderly, the impact of environmental and social aspects of food in
      nursing homes has been assessed. The social environment and interactions during the meals are
      now identified as effective ways to stimulate food intake and increase feelings of well-being
      in the elderly.

      The objectives of the study are to characterize the appreciation of food and social
      interactions during the meals and to study the relationships between the quality of food
      practices and nutritional status of the residents in nursing homes to improve their quality
      of life.

    <description>Residents will be observed during lunch to evaluate their behavior, verbal interactions between residents. The food intake during 24 hours will be evaluated also. In an interview after lunch, the appreciation of the meal by residents will be assessed by a questionnaire and the score of the nutritional state will be defined.</description>
