  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mast Cell Connect Registry is a voluntary, observational database that will capture
      demographic, socioeconomic, and disease information directly from patients with mastocytosis
      via a secure web-based tool. No experimental intervention is involved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mastocytosis is an extremely rare and heterogeneous spectrum of diseases characterized by the
      buildup of genetically altered mast cells. Patients experience a wide range of symptoms and
      in some cases, mast cell buildup can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Current
      treatments address disease symptoms and not the underlying cause. To facilitate the
      development of new therapies for mastocytosis, it is important for the community to support
      clinical trials and to document the impact of the disease, including disease natural history
      and the impact on patients, in a systematic way. Mast Cell Connect is a web-based registry
      that allows mastocytosis patients and caregivers to enter information about the experience of
      the patient living with mastocytosis directly into an online data collection tool.

      The Mast Cell Connect Registry allows mastocytosis patients and caregivers to enter
      information about the experience of the patient living with mastocytosis directly into a
      web-based data collection tool. Two forms of data will be collected: responses to surveys
      administered on the web-based portal, and de-identified data curated from medical reports
      uploaded by patients or their caregivers.
