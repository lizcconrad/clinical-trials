    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-titration trial to study the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacokinetics of oral cochleate amphotericin B (CAMB) in the treatment of mucocutaneous
      candidiasis infections in patients who are refractory or intolerant to standard non
      intravenous therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients aged 18 to 75 years with mucocutaneous candidiasis (esophageal, oropharyngeal, or
      vulvovaginal) who are refractory or intolerant to standard non-intravenous therapies will be
      enrolled. Patients will initially be treated in a short-term dose titration period, where the
      dose may be increased in patients that do not respond clinically. Patients who do not respond
      clinically to the highest dose of drug will discontinue the protocol. Patients that respond
      to treatment and tolerate the study medication will be eligible to enter a long-term
      extension (up to 6-months).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a clinical diagnosis of at least one of the following:

          -  Persistent OPC for greater than 2 weeks documented on at least one occasion by KOH or
             fungal stain and confirmed by mycological culture to be azole resistant within the
             previous 6 months and/or intolerance to standard non intravenous therapies.

          -  EC associated with clinical symptoms of retrosternal pain, odynophagia, and/or pain
             with swallowing and documented by esophageal biopsy or visualization with culture
             documenting azole resistance within the previous 6 months and/or intolerance to
             standard non-intravenous therapies.

          -  Persistent VVC for greater than 2 weeks as documented by presence of vaginal symptoms
             and a positive wet mount showing Candida structures and confirmed by a vaginal culture
             positive for Candida with azole resistance within the previous 6 months and/or
             intolerance to standard non intravenous therapies.

          -  Patient is expected to survive for &gt; = 6 months.

          -  Willing to have samples stored for future research.

          -  Agree to use highly effective contraception.

               -  Contraception: Because the effects of CAMB on the developing human fetus are
                  unknown, sexually active patients of childbearing potential must agree to use
                  highly effective contraception as outlined below before study entry and for the
                  duration of study participation. Females of childbearing potential must have a
                  negative pregnancy test result before receiving CAMB. During the course of the
                  study, if a patient becomes pregnant or suspects they are pregnant, then they
                  should inform the study staff and their primary care physician immediately.
                  Acceptable forms of contraception are:

                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD) or equivalent.

                    -  Hormonal contraceptives (eg, consistent, timely and continuous use of
                       contraceptive pill, patch, ring, implant, or injection that has reached full
                       efficacy prior to dosing). If the patient uses contraceptive pill, patch, or
                       ring, then a barrier method (eg, male/female condom, cap, or diaphragm plus
                       spermicide) must also be used at the time of potentially reproductive sexual
                       activity.

                    -  Be in a stable, long-term monogamous relationship, per PI assessment, with a
                       partner that does not pose any potential pregnancy risk, eg, has undergone a
                       vasectomy at least 6 months prior to first dose of study agent or is of the
                       same sex as the patient.

                    -  Have had a hysterectomy and/or a bilateral tubal ligation or both ovaries
                       removed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to any AMB product or any component of CAMB (eg, phosphatidylserine)

          -  Have evidence of systemic fungal infections requiring intravenous antifungal therapy

          -  Pregnant or nursing women, and women intending to become pregnant during the study
             period

          -  Had a concomitant medical condition that could interfere with study drug evaluation or
             that is a contraindication to the proposed investigational treatment based upon known
             agent safety profile or toxicities.

          -  Had any of the following laboratory abnormalities at the screening visit:

               -  Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and Alkaline phosphatase
                  (ALP) &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Total bilirubin level &gt; 2.5 times the ULN

               -  Serum creatinine level &gt; 2 times the ULN

               -  Absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/microliter

               -  Potassium level less than or equal to 3.5 mmol/L

          -  Exposure to any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to Day 0 (Baseline).

          -  Current or recent history (past 12 months) of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Use of intravenous AMB products within 1-week of start of study drug administration

          -  Use of non-intravenous AMB products (such as oral AMB swishes) within 72 hours prior
             to start of study drug administration

          -  Subjects receiving potassium supplements.

          -  Any other condition the investigator believes would interfere with the patient s
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, or which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the subject at undue risk.
