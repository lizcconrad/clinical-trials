  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to define, for Autism Spectrum Disorder, the extent of
      genetic variation in synaptic pathways that may be targeted for therapeutic development. For
      this purpose the investigators will take advantage of large, well-characterized cohorts of
      patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder for genetic screenings. Targeted sequencing of
      selected synaptic genes, previously associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder, will be carried
      out in these cohorts with deep coverage of coding regions and a strong focus on previously
      untested regulatory regions. Genomic data from Copy Number Variant, whole genome sequencing
      and exome sequencing, available for some of these patients, will be integrated in the overall
      analysis. The investigators will strongly emphasize the establishment of comprehensive
      genotype/phenotype correlations and set up an induced Pluripotent Stem Cells collection from
      selected patients with synaptic mutations for functional and expression analysis.

      Specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To identify genetic variants in selected synaptic genes, by targeted sequencing with
      deep coverage of coding regions and a strong focus on previously untested regulatory regions
      in Autism Spectrum Disorder

      Aim 2: To define the range of clinical phenotypes caused by mutations in synaptic genes by
      establishing detailed genotype/phenotype correlations and analyzing segregation in families
      with multiple individuals affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder
      traits or other neuropsychiatric disorders

      Aim 3: To generate a repository of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Autism Spectrum
      Disorder subjects with synaptic mutations for translational studies, including expression and
      functional assays.

      Aim 4: To identify the neuronal phenotypes caused by deleterious synaptic mutations for
      further translational studies

    <description>For all patients included in the study, core assessment carried out by either collaborating partners consists of diagnosis using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) criteria for autism and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-G) criteria for autism or Autism Spectrum Disorders. Patients with profound intellectual disability or with a known medical cause of autism, such as neurocutaneous syndromes, Fragile X, metabolic disorders, extreme prematurity, congenital rubella and other prenatal or postnatal neurological infections or gross dysmorphology, will be excluded.</description>

      DNA from subjects will be stored in the biobank of our study. From some patients with
      deleterious mutations in synaptic genes, cells (PBMC, Keratinocytes ou Fibroblasts) will be
      sampled from derivation in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.
