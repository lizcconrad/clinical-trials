    <textblock>
      Low-volume high-intensity interval exercise training may improve aspects of health and
      fitness in young people, but interventions must be practical and engaging. The investigators
      examined the effect of a novel school-based low-volume high-intensity interval training
      programme on health, fitness and physical activity outcomes in adolescent school pupils. 101
      English adolescents aged 13-14 years took part in the study. Participants were healthy male
      and female volunteers, recruited from four schools in Northeast England. Using a
      non-randomised design, two schools took part in the intervention, and two were assigned to
      the control. Those in the intervention group completed a 10-week school-based high-intensity
      interval exercise training programme. The intervention took place three times per week, and
      comprised of 4-7 repetitions of 45 s maximal effort exercise (boxing, dance, soccer and
      basketball drills), each interspersed with 90-s rest. Participants were encouraged to work
      maximally during the 45-s repetitions. Control participants were instructed not to change
      their lifestyle, dietary or physical activity habits during the intervention period, and
      maintain their normal school physical education routine. Study outcomes were blood lipid and
      glucose levels, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, carotid intima-media thickness,
      physical activity levels, serum C-reactive protein levels and blood pressure.

    <description>Participants were required to complete a high-intensity interval exercise training intervention, which took place three time per week for 10 weeks. The exercise sessions comprised of 4 to 7 repetitions of 45 s maximal effort exercise, based on boxing, dance, soccer and basketball drills), interspersed with 90-s rest. During each repetitions participants were encouraged to reach &gt;90% of their individual maximal heart rate. Participants were asked to maintain their dietary habits throughout the intervention period.</description>
