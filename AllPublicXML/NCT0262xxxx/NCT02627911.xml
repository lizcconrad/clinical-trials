    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in crossover trial, with two 72-hour hospitalization separated by
      a period Wash-out of at least one week. Each hospitalization is a period of treatment.
      According to randomization, patients will be provided with either Diabeloop system or the
      usual system.

      In both treatment periods:

        -  patients in a situation of sedentarity or physical activity, will be equipped with
           ActiGraph (measuring motricity) and a ActiHeart ( measuring heart rate)

        -  meals and physical activities will be similar in both periods

        -  the same blood glucose meter will be used throughout the duration of the study.

        -  the capillary blood glucose will be performed : before bolus and 2 hours after a meal,
           before exercise, in case of hypo or hyper-glycemic episodes and when the patient and /
           or investigator deem it necessary.
