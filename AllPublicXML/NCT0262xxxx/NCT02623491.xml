  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind
      (neither the investigator nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive comparator treatment that has no study drug in
      it), single center study in healthy male participants and female participants of
      non-childbearing potential (surgically sterile or post menopausal), aged 18 to 58 years
      inclusive. This study will consist of two parts; a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) part and a
      Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) part. The SAD will consist of 6 escalating dose cohorts.
      Participants in each cohort will be randomized to receive a single oral administration of
      JNJ-55375515 or placebo after an overnight fast. The planned doses of JNJ-55375515 range from
      0.75 to 100 milligrams (mg). Participants in an additional cohort will be dosed in the fed
      state to determine the effects of food on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      JNJ-55375515. An additional optional cohort may be evaluated to further explore the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of JNJ-55375515, with the maximal dose
      not exceeding 200 mg. The study duration for participants in the SAD part of the study will
      be approximately 2 to 5.5 weeks, including eligibility Screening. The MAD will consist of 3
      cohorts of 9 participants. Participants will receive once daily oral doses of JNJ-55375515 or
      placebo for 10 consecutive days. The study duration for participants in the MAD part of this
      study will be approximately 3 to 7 weeks including the eligibility Screening. The Safety of
      Participants will be monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Up to Day 5 in part 1; up to Day 15 in part 2</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose below the dose at which 2 or more subjects receiving the same dose of active study drug experience the same dose-limiting toxicity or have the same severe adverse event, or below the level at which the Investigator and Sponsor agree that an unacceptable dose-limiting toxicity has occurred in a single subject treated with active study drug.</description>
