  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, single-dose, open-label study conducted in male and
      surgically sterile or post-menopausal female participants with stable chronic hepatic
      impairment and in healthy participants matched by age, gender, and body weight to assess the
      effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of alectinib.
