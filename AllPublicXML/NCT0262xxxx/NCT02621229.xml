      The purpose of this multi-center randomized controlled trial is to compare lower calorie
      refeeding to higher calorie refeeding for hospitalized adolescents and young adults with AN.
      The investigators will compare efficacy (achievement and maintenance of clinical remission at
      12 months), safety during hospitalization, and cost effectiveness (including costs of initial
      and re hospitalization, 12 month follow up and safety/adverse events).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an illness commonly diagnosed in adolescence with low recovery rates
      and high healthcare costs. The major medical complication of AN is malnutrition. Caloric
      restriction, purging and other weight control behaviors can lead to medical instability
      (abnormal vital signs) requiring hospitalization. The primary goal of hospitalization is to
      restore medical stability by reintroducing nutrition, or &quot;refeeding&quot;. Within 12 mo of
      discharge, 43% of patients will require medical rehospitalization. This results in a costly
      course of recovery, given that eating disorders are the most expensive among primary mental
      health diagnoses requiring hospitalization. Several lines of inquiry seeking to identify
      characteristics or short-term outcomes that may predict better recovery in AN point to rapid
      short-term weight gain as a strong predictor of long-term outcomes. Greater weight gain in
      hospital predicts weight recovery at 12 moand, in psychotherapeutic trials, greater weight
      gain during the first 3-4 wk (1.7-1.9 lb/wk) predicts full remission at 12 mo. Unfortunately,
      the currently recommended approach, Lower Calorie Refeeding (LCR), is associated with slow
      weight gain and prolonged hospital stay. Treatment is now moving sporadically toward Higher
      Calorie Refeeding (HCR) in the hope of improved recovery. However, no study to date has
      directly compared these two approaches.] Since the refeeding syndrome, characterized by rapid
      electrolyte shifts, delirium and cardiac arrest in response to the influx of nutrients was
      first described around WWII, refeeding has been approached with caution. Following
      documentation of this syndrome in patients with AN, conservative, consensus-based
      recommendations for LCR were developed to ensure safety. LCR typically begins around 1200
      kilocalories (kcal) per day and advances by 200 kcal every other day. The investigators found
      that patients initially lose weight on this &quot;start low and go slow&quot; approach and require
      prolonged hospitalizations to achieve medical stability. This finding contributed to
      recognition of the &quot;underfeeding syndrome&quot;. In subsequent studies, the investigators
      demonstrated that HCR produced faster weight gain and shorter hospitalization. While no
      increased risk of refeeding syndrome has been reported using HCR, the variety of electrolyte
      supplementation protocols being used to manage risk have not been examined.

      Findings from these observational and retrospective studies have been rapidly accepted by
      many clinicians and insurers and HCR is now being integrated into practice in many hospitals.
      However, there are major gaps in the evidence necessary to adopt HCR as the new standard of
      care. These gaps are: 1.) It is not known if HCR impacts clinical remission, which is
      typically defined as the combination of weight and cognitive recovery at 12 mo. 2.) The
      safety of HCR has not been confirmed. The hallmark electrolyte imbalances of refeeding
      syndrome occur frequently and still have not been systematically examined on differing
      refeeding protocols. 3.) The relative cost-effectiveness of the two approaches has not been
      established.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) at two sites to
      directly compare HCR and LCR for refeeding in AN. To accomplish the following aims, 120
      adolescents will be enrolled upon admission to hospital for malnutrition secondary to AN and
      randomized 1:1 to HCR (beginning with 2000 kcal and advanced 200 kcal/d) or LCR (beginning at
      1400 kcal/d and advanced 200 kcal every other day) until medical stability is restored.
      Participants will be followed for 12 mo after randomization: Daily while in hospital and at
      follow-up [10 dy],1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, and 12 mo after randomization.
