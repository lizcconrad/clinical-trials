  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, the investigators are examining the use of a novel pathogen testing
      technology and method of identification of antibiotic susceptibility against the conventional
      C &amp; S testing for patients with both complicated and uncomplicated UTIs. The investigators
      will examine the two modes in terms of objective patient related outcomes, i.e. 1) diagnostic
      accuracy and degree of detail of final analysis; 2) time to resolution of symptoms; 3)
      quality of life as defined by particularly symptomology and &quot;bothersomeness&quot; of the symptoms;
      and 4) overall cost.
