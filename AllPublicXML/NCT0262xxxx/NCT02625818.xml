  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major proportion of patients admitted to psychiatric acute and emergency departments have
      symptoms, behaviors or function influenced by implicit or explicit suicidal intention
      (tendency towards self-harm, or suicide attempt). There is an increased risk of suicide in
      the acute phase during in-patient stay and after discharge. At present there is no
      satisfactory tool to predict post-discharge suicide risk.

      Multidimensional rating is expected to have better predictive properties than one-dimensional
      rating for suicidal behavior during in -patient stay and two years after discharge.
      Multidimensional rating assesses anxiety, panic, agitation, suicidal thoughts and ideations,
      as well as therapist's reactions during interviews. In the present study the predictive
      properties of two rating scales for suicidal behavior during in-patient stay and two years
      after will be compared. One of these is a multidimensional scale: &quot;Multidimensional
      Assessment of Suicide Risk&quot; (MARIS).
