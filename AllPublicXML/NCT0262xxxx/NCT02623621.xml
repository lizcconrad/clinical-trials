  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing amount of reports has consistently evidenced that a sustained inhibition of the
      angiogenesis is an effective therapeutic strategy, able to improve the outcome of metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.

      In the last decade different biologic agents targeting angiogenesis have been approved for
      the treatment of mCRC, such as bevacizumab, aflibercept and regorafenib, and, more recently,
      solid evidences have demonstrated the efficacy of a sustained antiangiogenic approach even
      beyond the first progression to a bevacizumab-containing regimen. In particular, two phase
      III randomized trials proved the effectiveness of prosecuting bevacizumab in second-line
      switching the chemotherapeutic regimen in patients already treated with bevacizumab in
      first-line. Preliminary experiences evidenced that circulating levels of angiogenesis-related
      markers are significantly modulated during first-line chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. In
      particular, a wide variability of plasma soluble Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
      Receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) levels is observed at the time of disease progression and retrospective
      data suggest that benefit from the continuation of bevacizumab may be restricted to patients
      with high levels of soluble VEGFR-2 at the first evidence of disease progression. This study
      aims at prospectively validating those retrospective data.
