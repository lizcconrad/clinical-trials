  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators performed a randomized controlled trial of 62 patients undergoing elective
      abdominal operations. The treatment group was provided a liquid protein supplement and
      instructed to take a dose three times daily for the first 20 postoperative days.
      Investigators followed patients for six months and compared wound healing and changes in
      weight and laboratory values.

    <measure>Change in weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, and then postoperative at 1-2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean preoperative weight compared to mean postoperative weight at each follow-up appointment. Weight recorded in pounds, subsequent measurements at each postoperative point were normalized to the preoperative weight and reported as a relative percentage of the preoperative weight.</description>

    <measure>Wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, and then postoperative at 1-2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall wound healing was documented on a scale of 0-2 (0 for unhealed, 1 for partially healed, 2 for completely healed). A wound was considered partially healed if there was any portion of the wound which had epidermal edges that were not in direct contact.</description>

    <measure>Change in white blood cell count (1x10 3/ uL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, and then postoperative at 1-2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in white blood cell count relative to preoperative white blood cell count, calculated as absolute change</description>

    <measure>Change in total protein (g/ dL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, and then postoperative at 1-2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in total protein at each follow-up point relative to preoperative total protein, calculated as absolute change</description>

    <time_frame>Preoperative, and then postoperative at 1-2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in albumin at each follow-up point relative to preoperative albumin, calculated as absolute change</description>
