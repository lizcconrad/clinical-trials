      This prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double blind, single-center study is to be
      conducted in the Medical University of Warsaw Public Paediatric Teaching Hospital in
      following departments: Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Department of
      Paediatrics and Nephrology, Department of Pediatric Pneumonology and Allergy, Department of
      Pediatrics with Medical Assessment Unit, Admissions Department. It is planned to include a
      total of 156 children aged between 12 months to 18 years old receiving antibiotic therapy
      because of acute respiratory tract infection/or urinary tract infection. The children will be
      randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of bovine lactoferrin or placebo twice a day orally for
      the whole period of antibiotic therapy. The primary efficacy parameter is occurrence of
      diarrhea during the antibiotic therapy and two weeks after, defined as &gt; 3 stools a day, a
      watery or loose stool with/or occurrence of blood in the stool.
