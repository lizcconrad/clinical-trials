  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This experimental study will look at the effects of INP therapy for two patient groups: 1)
      patients with reduced peripheral circulation and chronic wounds in patients with renal
      disease (dialysis patients); 2) and peripheral arterial disease and leg ulcers. The project
      is designed as a non-randomized clinical trial with single-subject multiple baseline design.
      Also the intervention will be subjected on the same leg for each individual throughout the
      study period. The other leg will act as a control. A baseline measure with patient history
      collection will be performed before a four-week intervention period. These measures include:
      Segmental pulse-volume-recording, Segmental skin perfusion pressure with a laser Doppler
      sensor and a pressure cuff to evaluate reactive hyperemia (Sensilase, Väsamed) and a health
      survey (SF-12/EQ-5D-5L) or similar. After four weeks and eight weeks of intervention, the
      same tests will be repeated. A final follow-up test will be two weeks after cessation of the
      intermittent negative pressure intervention. The study will look at the effect of INP on
      renal failure patients who are given dialysis at a dialysis center located at Oslo University
      Hospital, Ullevål. Otivio AS has supplied the FlowOx devices and provided the necessary
      training to perform this project. Outcome variables assessed before, during and after the
      10-week study period will be: wound healing, quality of life, skin perfusion pressure and
      segmental pulse-volume recording. The aim of this project is to prospectively examine and
      elucidate the effect of intermittent negative pressure therapy on clinically relevant
      measures related to the reduction of peripheral macro- and microcirculation in patients with
      renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment.

      The hypothesis of the study is:

        -  Application of INP in patients with renal failure, by the use of the FlowOx™ device,
           will improve wound healing and peripheral circulation in the foot compared to before
           treatment (baseline) in patients undergoing dialysis treatment.

        -  Application of INP in patients with PAD, by the use of the FlowOx™ device, will improve
           macro- and microcirculation and wound healing in the foot compared to before treatment
           (baseline) in patients with chronic wounds.

    <description>Fully automated and quantitative evaluation of microcirculatory perfusion in the skin of the foot and leg (Sensilase, Vasamed, USA).
Multiple levels can be assessed on limbs; bilateral measurement helps to manage test time Not susceptible to interference effects from medial calcification Requires use of pressure cuffs to occlude blood flow for specified time period in order to evaluate reactive hyperemic response to controlled release of pressure Graphical output of pressure and perfusion during cuff deflation indicates the pressure (mmHg) at which skin perfusion is found to return in addition to pressure contour</description>

    <description>The study design will be a non-randomized clinical trial with single-subject baseline design (also called single-case baseline design) where each patients act as their own controls:
Observations (A) will be taken before and after a 8-week intervention period. We plan to introduce a 4-week INP-treatment period ('FlowOx™) (B) using the same outcome variables that were used as baseline measures. If the patient demonstrates improvements in outcome variables after the first treatment period (B1), the patient will be asked to continue INP therapy for another 4-week period, before a final assessment after a total of 8-week intervention period (B2) (A-B-B design).</description>

    <intervention_name>FlowOx™</intervention_name>
    <description>FlowOx™ uses intermittent negative and atmospheric pressure, and is intended for use as an adjunct non-invasive therapy for the treatment of reduced peripheral circulation. Negative pressure cycles are created by alternating between removing air and venting the vacuum-chamber to atmospheric pressure. The vacuum cycle is controlled by the Control Unit (Pump). FlowOx™ is designed to assists wound healing indirectly by improving blood flow to the affected limb and augmenting the wound healing effect of the contact dressings and any associated medication. Treatment is planned to be applied while the participants are seated and it does not interfere with other activities normally enjoyed while seated. Treatment is recommended for one to two hours per session aiming to improve blood flow in the affected area and thus the clinical outcomes.</description>
