  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aims to further the understanding of glaucoma pathogenesis and progression
      by utilizing both enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography to visualize and
      measure the lamina cribrosa in vivo and segmentation technology to accurately delineate and
      measure the boundaries of the retinal layers. The investigators will elaborate further on the
      key concepts of lamina cribrosa thickness and transynaptic degeneration.

      There are two important areas of the eye that investigators need to better look at in order
      to further understanding of glaucoma. The first area is the retina (part of the eye that
      converts images from the eye's optical system into electrical impulses that are sent along
      the optic nerve to the brain). Newer technology (Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography) now
      allows us to look at the different layers of the retina and measure the thickness of each
      layer carefully. The second area is the lamina cribrosa (a portion of the white part of the
      eye which has the nerve fibers passing through it that connect the eye to the brain). If the
      lamina cribrosa is thin, it is possible that it may bend more easily and disrupt these nerve
      fibers. New technology (Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography) now allows us to measure the
      thickness of the lamina cribrosa.

      In this study, the investigators will look at and measure the thickness of the different
      retinal layers as well as the lamina cribrosa. These findings will help monitor and
      understand better the changes that occur in the eye as a result of glaucoma.

      The investigators have chosen individuals with primary open-angle glaucoma and unilateral
      visual field defects as the main patient population (in addition to normal controls). By
      approximating each participants baseline anatomy using the fellow, &quot;internal control&quot; eye,
      the investigators will be able to better determine if any changes occur in the macula or the
      lamina cribrosa as a result of glaucoma.
