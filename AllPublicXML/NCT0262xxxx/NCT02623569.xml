      Arms Assigned Interventions

      Experimental: Ivabradine Ivabradine 5 mg twice a day for first 4 weeks and 7.5mg twice a day
      when positive ETT and HR＞60times/min or negative ETT and HR＞80times/min of subjects.

      Active Comparator: Atenolol Atenolol 12.5 mg twice a day for first 4 weeks and 25mg twice a
      day when positive ETT and heard rate＞60times/min or negative ETT and HR ＞80times/min of
      subjects.

      1. Washout period：Chronic angina patients stop using medicine that affect heart rate. The
           patients undergoes ETT after 2-7 days and positive ETT into the treatment period(If not
           take similar medicine, patients can be carried out ETT directly)。

        2. Treatment period：Patients carried out ETT after therapy with Ivabradine(5mg,bid)/
           Atenolol(12.5mg,bid) for 4 weeks.The dose adjust base on test result and heart rate,
           Ivabradine(5mg,bid)/Atenolol(12.5mg,bid) or Ivabradine(7.5mg,bid)/ Atenolol(25mg,bid)
           for 8 weeks and carried out ETT.

        3. security period：After the treatment period, all patients to take Atenolol 12.5mg/ 25mg
           bid 1 week.

      If heart rate are low 50 times/min after taking Ivabradine 5mg/ Atenolol 12.5mg, subjects
      should withdrawal and dropped out study. If subjects heart rate are low 50 times/min after
      taking Ivabradine 7.5mg/ Atenolol 25mg, subjects should change the dose to Ivabradine 5mg/
      Atenolol 12.5mg.
