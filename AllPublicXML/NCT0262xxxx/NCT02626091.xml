  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of a ICG-fluorescence guidance complemented
      with enhanced reality to correctly document intestinal pre-anastomotic perfusion and to
      validate the accuracy of this technique with metabolic intestinal cells changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate intraoperative evaluation of peri-anastomotic gastrointestinal tract perfusion is
      essential to reduce the risk of anastomotic complications such as leakage or strictures.
      Anastomotic leakage is the most dreadful complication of colorectal resections.

      Intestinal microcirculation and viability is usually estimated from the color of the serosal
      surface, presence of peristalsis, pulsation and bleeding from the marginal arteries. This is
      subjective and based on the experience of the surgeon.

      Fluorescence videography integrates a near-infrared endoscope able to detect the signal
      emitted by a fluorescent dye, Indocyanine Green (ICG), which is administered by intravenous
      injection. Fluorescence intensity is proportional to the amount of fluorescent dye diffused
      in the tissue and it consequently is a surrogate marker of tissue perfusion.

      The hypothesis is that ICG-fluorescence guidance coupled with enhanced reality would allow a
      precise and rapid localization of the future anastomotic site in terms of optimal perfusion
      in laparoscopic colorectal resections.

      In patients undergoing elective left-sided colonic resection by laparoscopic approach,
      resection site and anastomosis perfusion will be evaluated by :

        -  the visual appreciation of the surgeon

        -  the fluorescence-based enhanced reality, after injection of ICG and digital process.

      A series of peri-operative samplings will also be carried out. In any case, the resection
      will be performed according to the surgeon's appreciation.
