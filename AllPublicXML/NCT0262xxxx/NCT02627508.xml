  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to examine the tolerability and effectiveness of pregnenolone in
      individuals with autism. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring steroid hormone in the brain
      that has been implicated in treating various psychiatric conditions. The investigators hope
      to learn the effects and safety of using pregnenolone in reducing irritability and
      sensitivity to sensory differences and improving social communication in individuals with
      autism. The investigators hope by studying the effects of pregnenolone in more detail, the
      investigators can design better ways to treat individuals with autism.
