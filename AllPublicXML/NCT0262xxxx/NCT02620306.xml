      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Fimasartan in patients
      with hypertensive diabetic chronic kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized subjects will take the investigational product (Fimasartan or Losartan)
      corresponding to each treatment group for 24 weeks. After that, all subjects will take
      Fimasartan for additional 120 weeks in an open-label, 2-parallel group study conducted with 2
      groups in accordance with the blood pressure control criteria.
