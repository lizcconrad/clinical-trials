    <textblock>
      The role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) in clozapine dose adjustment have been debated.
      Blood samples for s-clozapine monitoring should be drawn 12 hours post dose.

      The scope of this trial is to describe changes of s-clozapine and s-N-desmethyl-clozapine
      within the range of 10-14 hours after the last administration of clozapine .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several factors can influence s-clozapine and thereby the occurence of dose-related adverse
      reactions and level of treatment response. The role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) in
      clozapine dose adjustment have been debated. Blood samples for s-clozapine monitoring are
      recommended to be drawn 12 hours post dose. Uncertainty regarding the timing of blood
      sampling and the individual pharmakokinetics for clozapine +/- 2 hours from the 12-hour
      timepoint, leads to uncertainty regarding the comparability of serum concentrations and the
      information hold within them.

      The scope of this trial is to describe changes of s-clozapine and s-N-desmethyl-clozapine
      within the range of 10-14 hours after the last administration of clozapine .

      In addition we want to investigate if any of the following covariates might affect the change
      of s-clozapine and s-N-desmethyl-clozapine: Sex, age, BMI, co-medications, signs of
      infection, caffeine intake and smoking.
