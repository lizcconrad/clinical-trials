  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the anti-inflammatory effect of high-dose
      riboflavin supplementation on chronic plaque psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common chronic skin
      disorder that affects over 4 million people. There is no cure for psoriasis and treatment is
      directed at controlling patients' symptoms. Amongst patients with skin disease, there is
      significant interest in using complementary alternative medicine and vitamins to treat their
      disease. Previous human case reports suggest that riboflavin, commonly known as Vitamin B2,
      is clinically effective for the treatment of psoriasis; however, they were not conclusive.
      More recent human trials have shown that 400 mg of daily oral riboflavin is a safe and
      well-tolerated medication to administer to humans. For the purpose of this study, the
      riboflavin is used as an investigational drug.

      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the anti-inflammatory effect of high-dose
      riboflavin supplementation on chronic plaque psoriasis. Up to fifty volunteers with chronic
      plaque psoriasis will be recruited for a double-blind, placebo-controlled 28 week prospective
      study with cross-over of both the intervention and control groups at the 12 week time mark.
      There will be a 4 week washout period when subjects crossover. Riboflavin will be dosed 400
      mg by mouth daily versus placebo. Throughout the study the investigators will perform both
      clinical and laboratory assessments to measure response.
