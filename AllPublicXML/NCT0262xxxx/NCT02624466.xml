    <textblock>
      Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from one of the most devastating diseases
      in childhood resulting in a lifelong need for health care, and a 3 times decreased life
      expectancy. In addition, they have important comorbidities that negatively impact on their
      quality of life and integration in society, jeopardizing their future even after a potential
      transplantation. Retention of uraemic toxins is accepted to play a major role in the
      pathogenesis of the comorbid conditions, but studies in children are lacking. Furthermore,
      there are currently no good tools to evaluate severity and monitor adequacy of treatment,
      resulting in suboptimal management.

      The overall scientific objective of this four years UToPaed IWT-TBM project is to provide the
      clinician with new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the management of children with CKD,
      based on the improved understanding of uraemic toxicity.

      In this first part of UToPaed, the investigators will associate concentrations of a wide
      variety of uraemic toxins with different comorbidities in CKD children, i.e. growth,
      protein-energy wasting, quality of life, cardiovascular risk factors, circadian rhythm, sleep
      quality, and psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning (i.e. cross-sectional and
      longitudinal). The toxins of which concentrations are best correlated with comorbidities
      during the progress of CKD and eventually have representative kinetics (UToPaed - part 2:
      Kinetic analysis) will be selected as markers. These markers will be, together with the
      comorbidities, further tracked after interventions, i.e. starting on dialysis,
      transplantation, changes in dialysis strategy (UToPaed - part 3 - intervention study).

      From the validated kinetic models (UToPaed - part 2 and 3), an open access user-friendly
      prediction simulator (PAEDSIM) based on patient characteristics and marker concentrations
      will be developed to optimise and individualise the dialysis therapy.

      By providing clinicians with more advanced and appropriate tools to improve management of all
      children with CKD, i.e. better assessment of the degree of renal dysfunction, better
      determination of the ideal time to start renal replacement therapy, and more accurate
      monitoring of dialysis adequacy, the investigators aim to improve neurocognitive and
      psychosocial functioning (short term), growth, maturation into puberty, and social
      integration (median term) and survival (long term).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational multicenter study in children (≤ 18 years) with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) stage 2 to 5D with or without renal replacement therapy. In this study,
      60 children with CKD stage 2 - 5 (without renal replacement therapy)(GROUP 1), 30 children
      with CKD stage 5D treated with peritoneal dialysis (GROUP 2) and 30 children with CKD stage
      5D treated with haemodialysis (GROUP 3) will be followed for a total duration of 24 months.

      The study participants are evaluated on their standard visit at the outpatient clinic every 3
      months. At this visit, a blood sample for uraemic toxin concentration is withdrawn and
      several co-morbidities (growth, protein-energy wasting, cardiovascular disease, quality of
      life, psychosocial functioning, sleep, attention and executive functions) are assessed.
      Anthropometric parameters, dietary assessment, stool evaluation, nail evaluation, office and
      24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography and questionnaires are used
      to map out the several co-morbidities.

      Blood analyses are performed to get the concentrations of a wide variety of uraemic toxins:
      i.e. small water soluble solutes, middle molecules and protein-bound solutes. All blood
      analyses within this project are performed in the Ghent University Hospital: i.e. urea,
      creatinine, calcium, and phosphorus are determined in the routine laboratory of the Ghent
      University Hospital using standard methods, while all other uraemic toxins are determined in
      the laboratory of the Nephrology Section using ELISA and (in-house developed) HPLC/UPLC
      techniques. For the protein-bound solutes two runs are needed to distinguish between total
      and free fractions of the protein-bound solutes.
