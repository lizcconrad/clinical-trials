      This study aims to develop a method for the assessment of central NMDA receptor functioning
      in patients with depression and schizophrenia. For this purpose a transitional approach is
      used based on preclinical studies that show a dose-dependent relationship between the
      activity of hypothalamic NMDA receptor and plasma AVP response to increasing plasma
      osmolality. Patients with schizophrenia, depression and healthy controls participated in this
      study. The Investigators found that in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia the AVP
      response was low and that in a subgroup of subjects with depression the AVP response was high
      compared to healthy controls.

      Evidence suggests that altered N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity and glutamate
      signaling may underlie the pathogenesis of both schizophrenia and depression at least in
      subgroups of patients. In schizophrenia, pharmacologic modeling, postmortem and imaging data
      suggest reduced NMDA signaling. In contrast, recent clinical trials demonstrating the
      efficacy of the NMDA antagonist ketamine in severely depressed patients suggest increased
      NMDA receptor signaling. The Investigators have conducted a proof of concept study to assess
      whether there is any in vivo evidence for an inverse association in depression and
      schizophrenia with respect to the NMDA receptor function. For this purpose the investigators
      used a translational approach, based on findings from animal studies that NMDA receptor is a
      key mediator of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) release into the bloodstream. Using hypertonic
      saline to induce AVP release, as done in animal studies, it was found that in a subgroup of
      depressed patients, NMDA receptor mediated AVP release was significantly increased, whereas
      in a subgroup of schizophrenia patients, the same response was abnormally low. Previous
      research has demonstrated that this response is well conserved. These findings are consistent
      with implicated NMDA receptor related abnormalities in depression and schizophrenia in
      subgroups of patients, and provide the first in vivo evidence towards this dichotomy.
