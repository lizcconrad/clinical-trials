  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to determine how shared reading promotes child language
      development, and to use this knowledge to make it an effective language-boosting tool for
      children from all social and economic backgrounds.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two interventions will be created which are intended to boost children's vocabulary and
      grammar abilities, and will be assessed on how they are implemented by caregivers across
      different socio economic groups, and how they affect children's development of these language
      skills. Previous research has found dialogic reading interventions to be less effective for
      children from low socio-economic backgrounds. This project will investigate whether a shared
      reading intervention, designed to require less of a behaviour change from caregivers than
      dialogic reading, can be used to effectively boost vocabulary and grammar development in
      children across the whole socio-economic spectrum.

    <description>The Preschool Language Scale Fifth Edition (PLS-5) Will be administered. This is a published standardized measure of the language knowledge of individual children. The investigators will use both the Auditory Comprehension and Expressive Communication scales to measure vocabulary and grammar knowledge. The PLS-5 standard scores are based on a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Scores between 85 and 115 are considered to be within the normal range.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals - Preschool 2 UK (CELF Preschool-2) will be administered. This is a published standardized measure of the language knowledge of individual children. The investigators will use the 'Sentence Structure' subtest. This will allow measurement of the children's understanding of a range of simple and complex sentence structures. A sentence is read to the child and the child chooses, from a set of pictures, which picture ''goes with'' that sentence.</description>

    <description>Reading Together - Shared Reading Control. The intervention will run for six weeks and the caregivers will be provided with books to read with their children. Caregivers will not be trained to read with their child. The caregivers will be asked to read two books to their child five times a week. Caregivers will keep a reading diary and audio record all shared book reading sessions with their child.</description>

Caregivers will be trained to read with their child using a style which involves pausing, recasting and open questioning. The caregivers will be asked to read two books to their child five times a week. Caregivers will keep a reading diary and audio record all shared book reading sessions with their child.</description>
