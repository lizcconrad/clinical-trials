  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to compare the effects of tDCS and constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT)
      in the premotor cortex vs. primary motor cortex in severely subacute stroke survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors experience one or more movement-related impairments and activity
      limitations. In this sense, the premotor cortex (PMC) can be considered as an alternative
      locus for post-stroke rehabilitation. In relation to physical rehabilitation protocols,
      associate to neuromodulation, the investigators have chosen a standardized physical therapy
      protocol for this study, the Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT), which presents
      evidence of good therapeutic results. The investigators hypothesized that applying tDCS and
      CIMT over the PMC promotes motor restoration in stroke patients.
