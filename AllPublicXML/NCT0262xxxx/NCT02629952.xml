  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plant derived compounds, e.g. flavonoids from dark chocolate, green tea, or blueberries, show
      great potential as nutraceuticals for the treatment of various diseases such as type 2
      diabetes (T2D). Flavonoids have been suggested to improve glucose metabolism, reduce blood
      lipids, reduce oxidative stress and improve vascular function. For these reasons we recently
      investigated the effects of daily consumption of locally produced blueberry tea and
      demonstrated that this could partially restore insulin sensitivity in an animal model. We
      propose to translate these findings to assess the efficacy of this nutraceutical as a new
      treatment for improving glucose tolerance in people with T2D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for T2D are limited, have unwanted side effects, and lose effectiveness
      over time. There is a growing public interest in the use of complementary and alternative
      approaches for treating insulin resistance and T2D. Blueberries, blueberry leaves and
      cinnamon have each been reported to improve insulin sensitivity or insulin action. Blueberry
      Boost™ is a locally produced Blueberry Tea and is a proprietary blend of dried blueberries
      (37% wt/wt), blueberry leaves, raspberry leaves, spearmint leaves and cinnamon.

      It is well established that improving glycemic control is important for managing insulin
      resistance and T2D and the associated vascular pathologies that directly contribute to
      end-organ damage (microvascular disease), hypertension and cardiovascular disease (stroke,
      heart attack and heart failure). We have recently demonstrated that a unique blueberry tea
      blend fully restores the vascular insulin sensitivity in muscle of the high-fat fed
      insulin-resistant rat model and is associated with substantial improvements in muscle glucose
      uptake and whole body insulin sensitivity. We propose to translate these findings to assess
      the efficacy of this nutraceutical as a new treatment for improving glucose tolerance in
      people with T2D.

      Aim: Determine whether chronic consumption (4 weeks) of blueberry tea can improve metabolic
      and vascular health in people with and without T2D.
