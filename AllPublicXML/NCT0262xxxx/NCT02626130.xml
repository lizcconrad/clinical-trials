  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of
      tremelimumab alone and in combination with cryoablation in patients with metastatic kidney
      cancer (clear cell or non clear cell type) having surgery. Researchers also want to learn how
      the combination may affect the immune system.

      Cryoablation is a procedure that uses a hollow, thin tube called a cryoprobe to freeze and
      destroy cancer tissue.

      This is an investigational study. Tremelimumab is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      Tremelimumab is currently being used for research purposes only.

      If you are in Arm B, the cryoablation system used for your cryoablation procedure has been
      FDA-approved for use in cancer. The use of this system for metastatic kidney cancer combined
      with tremelimumab is investigational.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups (called &quot;arms&quot;). Both you and the study staff will
      know which group you are in. You have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

        -  If you are in Arm A, you will receive tremelimumab before and after surgery or biopsy.

        -  If you are in Arm B, you will have cryoablation and then receive tremelimumab before and
           after surgery or biopsy.

      All participants will receive tremelimumab by vein over about 60 minutes one time every 4
      weeks for your first 6 doses and then one time every 12 weeks after that.

      Cryoablation:

      If you are in Arm B, you will have cryoablation about 2-6 days before your first dose of
      study drug. To perform cryoablation, the affected area will first be numbed with anesthetic.
      Your study doctor will insert the cryoprobe needle and use an ultrasound device to help guide
      the cryoprobe until it reaches the cancerous area.

      When in place, the cryoprobe will be used to freeze the cancerous area. The doctor will be
      very careful to try to avoid damaging the surrounding normal tissue.

      The cryoablation procedure will last about 20 minutes. The cryoprobe will be removed when
      your doctor thinks the cancerous area has been treated as much as possible.

      There will be a small wound, like a puncture wound from a large needle. Most likely, you will
      not need any stitches to close this wound.

      Study Visits:

      Before each dose of tremelimumab, within 2 weeks before surgery or biopsy, within 4 weeks
      after surgery and every 4 weeks for 3 months after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to measure your protein
           levels, to test your liver, kidney, and hormone function, to test for biomarkers, and to
           test your immune system.

      Every 2 weeks for the first 2 months of taking tremelimumab, blood (about 2-3 tablespoons)
      will be drawn for routine tests, to measure your protein levels, and to test your liver and
      kidney functions.

      Within 2 weeks before surgery, and within 4 weeks after surgery or biopsy, if the study
      doctor thinks it is needed, you will have the same imaging scans that you had at screening to
      check the status of the disease.

      Before each dose of tremelimumab beginning three (3) months after surgery or biopsy and every
      12 weeks after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to measure your protein
           levels, to test your liver, kidney and hormone function, and to test your immune system.

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have the same imaging scans that you had at
      screening to check the status of the disease.

      Surgery or Biopsy:

      About 5 weeks after your second dose of tremelimumab, you will have surgery for kidney
      cancer. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form that describes the surgery and its
      risks. You may instead have a biopsy and you will be asked to sign a separate consent form
      that describes the biopsy and its risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your active participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      At about 30, 60, and 90 days after your last dose of study drug, you will return to the
      clinic for the following tests and procedures:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to measure your protein
           levels, to test your liver, kidney and hormone function, to test for biomarkers, and to
           test your immune system.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have the same imaging scans that you
           had at screening to check the status of the disease.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      A member of the study staff will contact you about every 6 months to ask about your health if
      the disease gets worse. This contact will be a phone call or by an e-mail. Your medical
      record may also be reviewed at that time. If you are contacted by phone, the call should last
      about 5 minutes.
