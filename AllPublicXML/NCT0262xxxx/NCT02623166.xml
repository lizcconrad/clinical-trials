  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the feasibility and acceptability of community health
      workers (ASHAs and ANMs) being able to treat sick children in the community. There is a
      national policy for treatment for children aged 2-59 months with illnesses such as pneumonia,
      diarrhea and fever by community health workers (CHWs), this policy has not been implemented
      as yet in Haryana. This research will identify barriers and opportunities for use of CHWs as
      treatment sources.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using indepth interviews, focus group discussions and other qualitative research methods
      barriers and opportunities for promoting use of ASHAs as a treatment source for diarrhea,
      pneumonia and fever will be identified. An intervention package which includes training of
      ASHAs and ANMs to treat uncomplicated cases of pneumonia, diarrhea and fever, ensuring they
      have required supplies, creating awareness in community and monitoring and supervising the
      treatment provided by them will be implemented in primary health centre areas in Haryana,
      India. ASHAs will treat cases of fast breathing pneumonia with amoxicillin and refer children
      with danger signs or chest indrawing pneumonia. Three rounds of cross sectional surveys will
      be conducted to ascertain prevalence of morbidity, careseeking and hospitalizations in
      children aged 2 to 59 months.
