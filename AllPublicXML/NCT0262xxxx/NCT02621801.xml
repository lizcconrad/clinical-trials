  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, waitlist-control study is evaluating the benefits of a stress management
      and resiliency training program for residents (SMART-R).

      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the SMART-R is effective at increasing
      coping skills and reducing stress among residents, reflected by changes in constructs such as
      emotional growth, perceived stress, optimism, and coping styles. Objective parameters (heart
      rate, galvanized skin response, sleep duration and quality, exercise and actigraphy) measured
      with the Basis health tracking device will help correlate objective signs to subjective
      report of stress.

      The investigators adapted the Benson-Henry Institute Stress Management and Resiliency
      Training Program -- Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP) to create the SMART-R
      resident wellness curriculum. The actual SMART-3RP is both a clinical program and research
      intervention. The three prongs of the SMART-R include 1) elicitation of the relaxation
      response through mind-body techniques 2) reducing overall stress reactivity and 3) increasing
      connectedness to self and others.

      In a waitlist-control design, the SMART-R was implemented into multiple residents programs at
      Mass General Hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medical College. The
      primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the SMART-R in increasing coping skills and
      reducing stress among residents in the participating programs. Participants enrolled will be
      invited to complete 1) a brief questionnaire before, during (q3months) and after
      participation in the program (5 questionnaires total). The investigators will also collect
      continuous physiologic data using the Basis Peak Health Tracking device to correlate the
      physiologic data with self-report measures of stress.

      Additionally, objective indicators of daily workload (page frequency, and quantity of notes
      authored by a resident during a given period) will help control for residents' schedules and
      busyness, in evaluating perceived stress, wellbeing and other outcomes.
