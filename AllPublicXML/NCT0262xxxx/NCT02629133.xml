      This study developed and assessed an innovative, high-reach, easily implementable, low-cost
      computer-delivered intervention (Safe and Healthy Experiences; The SHE Program) that
      addresses known barriers in early identification and intervention with sheltered battered
      women with IPV (intimate partner violence) and substance use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) and substance use are significant and interconnected public
      health problems facing women. For battered women, the presence of substance use increases the
      risk of revictimization and the risk of more severe abuse. Battered women's shelters provide
      emergency shelter to approximately 300,000 women and children each year. A prime time to
      intervene with battered women might be when they enter a shelter and have already initiated a
      change in their lives. A shelter-based intervention for battered women that addresses
      substance use problems might reduce the risk of substance use, reduce the risk of future IPV,
      and improve utilization of substance use treatment and community resources. The objective of
      this R34 Award was to develop and assess an innovative, easily implementable, low-cost,
      computer-delivered intervention, the SHE Program (Safe and Healthy Experiences) that
      addresses known barriers in early identification and intervention for battered sheltered
      women with substance use issues. SHE is based on motivational interviewing (MI) a
      well-defined intervention strategy that has yielded particularly promising results in a range
      of clinical issues and a range of patient populations, including substance using women. MI is
      consistent with an empowerment model, which is a highly recommended intervention model for
      victimized women. The R34 had two distinct phases to assess the SHE Program with battered
      sheltered women with substance use issues. During the Development Phase, the research team
      conducted focus groups and developed the intervention to meet the needs of our target group,
      developed the software for the computer-delivered intervention, and conducted an open trial
      with 10 participants. During the Pilot Study Phase, the investigators conducted a two-group,
      randomized controlled study with a sample of 50 battered sheltered women who reported
      substance use difficulties within the last three months, which provides the necessary
      groundwork to examine the efficacy of the SHE Program in a future, large clinical trial. The
      SHE Program was found to be feasible, acceptable and efficacious in improving outcomes for
      our vulnerable target population. The program has the potential to be widely disseminated
      while maintaining treatment fidelity across battered women shelters and may hold promise for
      IPV populations with substance use difficulties in other settings.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol and Substance Use: Timeline Follow-back (TLFB)-modified computer version</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months post shelter</time_frame>
    <description>The computer-based TLFB will assess drug use and heavy drinking (4+ standard drinks) days for the past week and the past 90 days. For primary analysis, days using drugs and heavy drinking days will be combined to create a single variable that reflects the total number of days that women used drugs or had 4+ drinks. The primary outcome is substance use (heavy drinking or drug using) days over a 6 month post shelter period. We are assessing the change of this number from baseline, 3 months post shelter, and 6 months post shelter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Treatment Services Review (TSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and again at 3 and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Services Review will be used to assess total days of substance use services (both treatment and self-help utilization) received (including outpatient, day patient, residential treatment, NA, AA) to capture the extent to which women are reaching out to access recovery-related resources. The TSR will assess total days of substance use services received for a 90 day window.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Composite Abuse Scale (CAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and again at 3 and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>The CAS is a widely used self-report of behaviors scale with 4 subscales that measure severe, combined abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, and harassment. The CAS has recently been published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compendium of intimate partner violence measures. It consists of 30 items presented in a six point format requiring respondents to answer &quot;never&quot;, &quot;only once&quot;, &quot;several times&quot;, &quot;monthly&quot;, &quot;weekly&quot; or &quot;daily&quot; in a twelve month period.</description>

    <description>The Cyber Stalking Scale measure is a 6 -item measure and assesses the use of technologies in stalking and harassment.</description>

    <measure>Safety Behavior Checklist (SBC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline, and again at 3 and 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Safety Behavior Checklist (SBC) has 15 items that assess the use of strategies suggested to keep victim safe (e.g., hiding money and extra clothing).</description>

    <description>Participants received a 50 minute intervention on the computer immediately after their baseline assessment and a 15 minute &quot;booster&quot; session on the computer within 2 weeks after the intervention. There was also a 3 and 6 month follow-up after completion of the SHE program.</description>

    <description>Control condition consisted of a series of questions regarding television show preferences and viewing a brief series of videos of popular entertainers/shows, with subsequent requests for rating of subjective preference. Participants in this condition completed a baseline assessment as well as a television show booster and a follow-up assessment 3 and 6 months later.</description>

    <description>The SHE program is specifically tailored, innovative and relevant to diverse, racial, and ethnic sheltered, battered women in a number of ways including the images and content used in the intervention. It is also tailored to participants' alcohol or substance use status, and designed to reach participants across levels of motivation for change. The content of SHE is theory-driven, consistent with the motivational interviewing model of behavior, and consistent with the literature on effective interventions that address IPV and substance use.</description>
