  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulant therapy is generally recommended for all patients presenting with acute
      symptomatic splanchnic vein thrombosis, starting with either low-molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin and continuing with the vitamin K antagonists in most
      patients. Rivaroxaban is approved for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary
      embolism, but no studies have assessed the safety of rivaroxaban in the setting of splanchnic
      vein thrombosis. The investigators aim to collect prospective information on the safety of
      rivaroxaban in a pilot cohort of 100 patients with acute splanchnic vein thrombosis without
      liver cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis are at increased risk of recurrent VTE and bleeding.
      Routine anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed
      by warfarin is recommended in this setting, but limited data is available to support this
      recommendation and more than 20% of these patients do not receive antithrombotic treatment
      due the fear for bleeding complications. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      characteristics of rivaroxaban make this drug an ideal alternative therapeutic strategy for
      the treatment of patients with SVT. Thanks to the oral route of administration, the short
      half-life, the high bioavailability, the predictable dose-response and the lack of effects on
      platelet activity, rivaroxaban could result as an important alternative to both LMWH and
      warfarin in the acute and long-term treatment of SVT patients. Furthermore, the analysis of
      phase III studies conducted in patients with DVT or PE have shown a better safety profile of
      rivaroxaban as compared to standard of treatment. This observed benefit in the safety profile
      of rivaroxaban would be extremely relevant in the treatment of patients with SVT. In this
      prospective cohort study, patients presenting with acute SVT will receive rivaroxaban 15 mg
      bid for 3 weeks followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg od for a total of 3 months. The primary safety
      and efficacy outcomes will be measured at 3 months.
