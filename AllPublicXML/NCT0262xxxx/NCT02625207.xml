    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, parallel group, multiple dose study in approximately 48 healthy
      male or female subjects of African American and Caucasian self-reported race, to assess the
      effect of CYP3A5 genotype on the PK of MVC and CYP3A5-derived metabolites. Maraviroc and
      CYP3A5-derived metabolite PK will also be compared between African-Americans and Caucasians
      in subjects carrying two copies of the dysfunctional CYP3A5 alleles (*3, *6, and/or *7).

      This will be an open-label, parallel group, multiple dose study in approximately 48 healthy
      male or female subjects of African American and Caucasian self-reported race, to assess the
      effect of CYP3A5 genotype on the PK of MVC and CYP3A5-derived metabolites. Maraviroc and
      CYP3A5-derived metabolite PK will also be compared between African-Americans and Caucasians
      in subjects carrying two copies of the dysfunctional CYP3A5 alleles (*3, *6, and/or *7).

      Dysfunctional genetic variants for CYP3A5, CYP3A4 and SLCO1B1 will be genotyped for subjects
      who participate in the pre-screening. Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for
      study participation will be placed into the study cohorts based on race and the number of
      functional (*1) and dysfunctional CYP3A5 alleles (*3, *6, and *7) CYP3A5 alleles.

      Cohort 1 (n=12; African-American): No CYP3A5*1 alleles (poor metabolizer). Cohort 2 (n=12;
      African-American): One CYP3A5*1 allele (intermediate metabolizer).

      Cohort 3 (n=12; African-American): Two CYP3A5*1 alleles (extensive metabolizer).

      Cohort 4 (n=12; Caucasian): No CYP3A5*1 alleles (poor metabolizer).

      Study Treatments:

      Part 1 Days 1-5: Maraviroc 300 mg BID in fasted state (AM dose only on Day 5). Part 2
      (Cohorts 1 and 3 only) Days 1-10: Maraviroc 150 mg QD plus darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg QD
      with food.

      Pharmacokinetics of MVC, PF-6857639, PF-6857640 and other hydroxylated metabolites with
      formation mediated by CYP3A5 (if present) will be assessed on Part 1, Day 5 and Part 2, Days
      10-11. Blood samples will be collected for a full PK profile.

      Subjects will be confined to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) the day prior to dosing on Day
      1 (Day 0) and discharged on Part 1, Day 6 and on Part 2, Day 11 (Cohorts 1 and 3 only).
      Subjects enrolled into Cohorts 1 and 3 may be confined to the CRU without the need to be
      discharged between Part 1 and Part 2.

        <description>Cavg is the average plasma concentration of maraviroc during the 0 to 24 hour time period. It was calculated as area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC [0-24]) divided by 24.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 6 days that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 11 days that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
