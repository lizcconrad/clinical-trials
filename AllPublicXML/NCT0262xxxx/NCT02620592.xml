      This First in Human (FIH) Phase I study intends to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ZYDPLA1 in normal healthy adult volunteers.

      Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and Glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) are
      incretin hormones, which stimulate glucose dependent insulin secretion, inhibit glucagon
      secretion, delay gastric emptying, suppress appetite and improve peripheral glucose uptake
      and disposal. Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a serine protease, which selectively
      cleaves the first two amino acids of GIP and GLP-1 thereby making it inactive. Inhibition of
      DPP-IV activity elevates endogenous GIP, GLP-1 and insulin levels thereby improving glucose
      excursion and exhibits antidiabetic activity. Since no orally active GLP-1 agonists are
      available, clinically orally bioavailable DPP-IV inhibitors hold great potential for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Cadila Healthcare Ltd. developed a novel and orally bioavailable DPP-IV inhibitor (ZYDPLA1).
      In-vitro studies confirm selective DPPIV inhibitory activity of the ZYDPLA1. Pre-clinical in
      vivo pharmacodynamic, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) &amp;
      toxicological studies showed the promising antidiabetic activity, good exposure and safety
      profile of ZYDPLA1(in various animal models).

      Hence a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled first in man trial proposed to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of ZYDPLA1 in healthy volunteers.

      This study included 4 plans:

      i) single dose escalation study ii) multiple dose escalation study, iii) gender effect study
      and iv) food effect study.
