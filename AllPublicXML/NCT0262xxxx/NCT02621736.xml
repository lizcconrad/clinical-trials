  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MEN) is a common problem in children, affecting 7-10% of
      all 7 year olds. MEN is often leading to psychosocial problems because of its burden and
      stigmatism.

      The only available medical treatment option is the vasopressin analogum Desmopressin®.
      However, according to the literature, only one third of patients shows a good treatment
      response, defined as more than 90% of reduced bed wetting. Furthermore, treatment with
      Desmopressin® may lead to psychosocial problems, high costs and potentially dangerous side
      effects like water intoxication and hypertension.

      Copeptin, mirroring arginine vasopressin (AVP), has been shown to be significantly lower in
      patients with MEN compared to controls and lower in patients with severe bed wetting compared
      to patients with only slight bed wetting.
