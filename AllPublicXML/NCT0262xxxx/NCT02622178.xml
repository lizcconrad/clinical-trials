  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the NOVA-DN VEP
      protocol and a new software and method (Corda) for the glaucoma detection using optical
      coherence tomography images. Another objective is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity
      of these tests to differentiate between normal subjects and glaucoma suspects.

      The hypothesis is that the NOVA-DN VEP protocol and Corda analysis results in a high
      sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
      (ROC area) for the glaucoma detection. Another hypothesis is that the NOVA-DN VEP protocol
      and some Corda parameters can differentiate between normal subjects and glaucoma suspects.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of the NOVA-DN VEP protocol and Corda
      parameters to discriminate between healthy eyes and eyes with early to moderate glaucomatous
      visual field loss. For this purpose the sensitivity (specificity cutoffs of 85%, 90%, and
      95%) and ROC of Corda parameters will be obtained.

      We will evaluate those measurements of the NOVA-DN VEP protocol, Corda software and the
      Cirrus SD-OCT software in order to compare and correlate those analyses.

    <description>Healthy subjects will require intraocular pressure less than 22 mmHg, normal appearing optic discs and retinal nerve fiber layer, normal optical coherence technology (RNFL thickness) and normal visual field results in both eyes. Participants will be tested on optical coherence tomography testing and Diopsys visual evoked potential testing (VEP).</description>

    <description>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a noninvasive imaging modality that provides micrometer-scale resolution.It has been revolutionized in recent years by exploitation of Fourier domain (FD) techniques, which have a significant sensitivity advantage over traditional time domain (TD) OCT. In spectral-domain (SD-OCT) the reference mirror is stationary, and OCT signal is acquired using a spectrometer as detector or by varying the wavelength of the light source.</description>

    <description>The viewing distance shall be set to 1 m, yielding a total display viewing angle of 15.5 degrees. The square black/white checkerboard pattern reversal stimulus has a height and width of 27 cm with a red circular ring used as a fixation target. The diameter of this target is approximately 1.5 cm with a ring thickness of 1.5 mm. The target ring shall be centered on the stimulus. Two pattern contrasts shall be used in the study, based on earlier studies that suggested that differential contrast stimulation could affect the NOVA-DN VEP protocol wave forms. The first pattern shall have a Michelson contrast of 15%. The second pattern shall have a Michelson contrast of 85%. These two patterns are referred to as Lc (Low contrast) and Hc (High contrast) respectively.</description>
