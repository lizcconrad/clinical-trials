      Single-center prospective study to assess the clinical course of group A streptococcal
      blistering distal dactylitis in children after antibiotic treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blistering distal dactylitis are very common in children. About 60% are caused by
      Staphylococcus aureus and some are caused by Group A Streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus
      pyogenes. While these forms have been known for fifty years, few publications are interested
      in it. Some studies have confirmed that a single antibiotic treatment against the SGA allows
      the healing of these dactylitis but few surgical teams have adopted this strategy. As all
      streptococcal infections, they face the risk of acute complications (septicemia,
      streptococcal toxic shock, etc.) or late (post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute
      rheumatic fever, etc.). The involvement of the SGA in these dactylitis is easy to demonstrate
      through the use of rapid GAS test already widely used in other GAS infections (tonsillitis,
      scarlet fever, streptococcal perianal infections).

      This study aims to assess the clinical course of positive GAS test blistering distal
      dactylitis in children after antibiotic treatment.
