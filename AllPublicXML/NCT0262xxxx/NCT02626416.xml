  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence rate of postoperative capsular opacification (PCO) in children after cataract
      surgery is reported to be as high as 100%, while timely Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy
      is effective to treat visual axis opacification (VAO) caused by PCO. Therefore, long-term
      follow-up, timely diagnosis and treatment is important to improve patient's outcome.

      The major and central part of lens is easy to be observed through a dilated pupil.
      Especially, opacification in the lens and/or lens capsule is distinctive showing as &quot;white&quot;
      on the &quot;black&quot; background. The characteristic features of the disease and advances in
      photographic technique with mobile phone make it possible for patients and/or their guardians
      to monitor the progress of cataract or PCO with mobile application in a &quot;self-help&quot; manner
      under non-clinical settings.

      The major and central part of lens is easy to be observed through a dilated pupil.
      Especially, opacification in the lens and/or lens capsule is distinctive showing as &quot;white&quot;
      on the &quot;black&quot; background. The characteristic features of the disease and advances in
      photographic technique with mobile phone make it possible for patients and/or their guardians
      to monitor the progress of cataract or PCO with mobile application in a &quot;self-help&quot; manner
      under non-clinical settings. In this way, patients and/or guardians could adjust the time of
      return to clinical follow-up visit accordingly. Furthermore, standardized and analyzed
      pictures could be sent to clinicians for remote diagnosis when necessary.

      The investigators developed a mobile phone application LenZOC. The investigators aimed to
      assess whether mobile phone application for parents of children with cataracts would improve
      their adherence with follow-up and increase rates of timely detection and management of
      treatable conditions such as posterior capsular opacification (PCO).

    <description>The transparency of the visual axial at the anterior segment is observed through a dilated pupil. Image of the eye of a patient taken with LenZOC is calibrated with a standardized white and black bar adhered to the patient's eyelid. Calibrated images are dimmed as graysalegrayscale. The intensity and progress of visual axial opacification (VAO) is quantified as absolute area and relative area (calculated as: absolute area of VAO/ absolute area of dilated pupil).</description>
