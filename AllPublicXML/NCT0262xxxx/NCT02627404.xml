  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a complex, multifactorial disorder with the intervention of genetic
      vulnerability factors. To help the identification of these genetic factors and to improve
      genotype-phenotype correlation, the identification of endophenotype through the exploration
      of vulnerability characteristics in unaffected first degree relatives have been recommended.
      For this purpose, the investigator include bipolar patients, unaffected first degree
      relatives and control subjects to perform genetic association studies and subphenotype
      analyses. In this study the investigator will focus on subgroups defined according to the
      existence of abnormal circadian rhythm (a major indicator of bipolar vulnerability).

      Lithium is the leading treatment of bipolar disorders but prophylactic lithium response is
      highly variable and difficult to predict due to lack of biomarkers of response. To explore
      lithium response variability and to identify biomarkers of response, the investigator
      characterise lithium response using &quot;ALDA&quot; scale to conduct pharmacogenetic studies and
      pharmacokinetic studies of lithium extended release, in the subpopulation of patients treated
      with lithium. As lithium is a circadian agent, the investigator will also explore the links
      between lithium response and circadian phenotypes. Finally, using Li7 magnetic spectroscopy,
      the investigator will compare lithium brain distribution in a small sample of good and
      partial responders to lithium.
