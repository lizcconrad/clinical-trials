  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers hope to learn if yoga complementary therapy would improve health-related
      quality of life, recovery of urinary continence and erectile function in patients who
      underwent prostate cancer surgery (i.e. radical prostatectomy). We hypothesized that in
      patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, preoperative and postoperative Yoga complementary
      therapy would improve health- related quality of life (HRQOL), recovery of urinary continence
      and erectile function.

      This two-arm, randomized controlled pilot study will compare Yoga intervention to usual care
      group. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of Yoga complementary therapy on HRQOL in patients
      who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Yoga therapy will be given to the intervention
      group three times in a week for 6 weeks prior to surgery and then initiated 3 weeks after the
      surgery for another 6 weeks. The yoga exercise will be tailored to the participant's comfort
      level. As an exploratory analysis, we will evaluate pro-inflammatory and immunological
      markers.
