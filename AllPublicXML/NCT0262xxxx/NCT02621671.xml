  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiology seeks to improve public health by identifying risk factors for cancer and other
      diseases and conveying that information to relevant audiences. The audience is presumed to
      understand and use that information to make appropriate decisions about lifestyle behaviors
      and medical treatments. Yet, even though a single risk factor can affect the risk of multiple
      health outcomes, this information is seldom communicated to people in a way that optimizes
      their understanding of the importance of engaging in a single healthy behavior. Providing
      individuals with the ability to understand how a single behavior (obtaining sufficient
      physical activity) could affect their risk of developing multiple diseases could foster a
      more coherent and meaningful picture of the behavior's importance in reducing health risks,
      increase motivation and intentions to engage in the behavior, and over time improve public
      health.

      The proposed study translates epidemiological data about five diseases that cause significant
      morbidity and mortality (i.e., colon cancer, breast cancer (women), heart disease, diabetes,
      and stroke) into a visual display that conveys individualized risk estimates in a
      comprehensible, meaningful, and useful way to diverse lay audiences.

    <time_frame>Completion of accrual for Arm 1 participants (estimated to be 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Survey questions will assess participants' cognitive and affective risk perceptions, response efficacy, perceived severity and reaction to the visual displays, health literacy and numeracy. The quantitative data will be examined using descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies, mean, median, mode, range, interquartile range, standard deviation) to evaluate whether a potential variability problem exists (e.g., restricted range) .</description>

    <measure>Most effective combination of strategies in communicating multiple disease risk estimates (Arm 2 only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of accrual for Arm 2 participants (estimated to be 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>-Participants will be randomly assigned by computer to 1 of the 12 experimental conditions. After completing questions about information seeking and physical activity they will read a short scenario that describes the purpose of a risk assessment tool and asks them to imagine that they had just entered their information into such a tool. Participants will see whichever risk ladder corresponds to the experimental condition to which they were assigned. The hypothetical display will be consistent with a display generated for an individual whose risk profile includes risk increasing and decreasing factors, but does not engage in the recommended amount of physical activity. To increase feasibility for the display will show the risk of the diseases in the same order regardless of experimental condition. Participants will be allowed to view the display as long as they wish.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete several survey items, view 1 of 8 disease risk pictures (selected at random), and then complete further survey questions.
Participants will then be recorded giving their opinions on the remaining 7 disease risk pictures which depict the hypothetical risk of disease.
The entire visit will take no more than 90 minutes with no follow-up.
The first 10-20 participants will be randomized to this arm.</description>
