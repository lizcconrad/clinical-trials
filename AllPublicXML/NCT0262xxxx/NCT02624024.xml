    <textblock>
      The AQT90 FLEX Troponin I (TnI) and Troponin T (TnT) Tests are in vitro diagnostic assays
      intended as an aid in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) in point-of-care and
      laboratory settings. The purpose of the study is to establish the clinical performance of the
      AQT90 FLEX TnI and TnT assays for both whole blood and plasma in the intended use population.
