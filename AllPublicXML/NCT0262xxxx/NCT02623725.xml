  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess and describe the booster effect of a CYD dengue vaccine
      dose administered 4 to 5 years after the completion of a 3-dose vaccination schedule.

      Primary Objective

      - To demonstrate the non-inferiority, in terms of geometric mean of titer ratios (GMTRs), of
      a CYD dengue vaccine booster compared to the third CYD dengue vaccine injection in subjects
      from previous CYD dengue vaccine trials.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  If the primary objective of non-inferiority is achieved: To demonstrate the superiority,
           in terms of GMTRs, of a CYD dengue vaccine booster compared to the third CYD dengue
           vaccine injection in subjects from previous CYD dengue vaccine trials.

        -  To describe the immune responses elicited by a CYD dengue vaccine booster and placebo
           injection in subjects who received 3 doses of the CYD dengue vaccine in previous CYD
           dengue vaccine trials.

        -  To describe the neutralizing Ab levels of each dengue serotype post-dose 3 (previous CYD
           dengue vaccine trials' subjects) and immediately prior to booster or placebo injection
           in all subjects.

        -  To describe the neutralizing Ab persistence 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years post booster
           or placebo injection in all subjects.

        -  To evaluate the safety of booster vaccination with the CYD dengue vaccine in all
           subjects.

      Healthy adolescents and adults who received 3 doses of the tetravalent dengue vaccine 4 to 5
      years earlier in previous CYD dengue vaccine trials (CYD13 - NCT00993447 and CYD30 -
      NCT01187433) will receive either a booster dose CYD dengue vaccine or a placebo vaccine. They
      will be evaluated for safety and antibody persistence of the booster injection up to 2 years
      post-vaccination.
