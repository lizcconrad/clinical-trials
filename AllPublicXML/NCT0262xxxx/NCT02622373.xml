  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain information that may be useful in helping to figure out
      better or newer ways to provide nutrition to babies born premature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Babies born premature weigh significantly less at the time of hospital discharge when
      compared to babies born at the corresponding age. The researchers in this study believe that
      the lower body weight at discharge may be due to lower muscle mass. However, there is no such
      information available for that at this time. It is important to have this information as
      babies who weigh less than normal at hospital discharge may develop higher blood pressure and
      higher sugar levels when they are 10-15 years old.

      By doing this study, researchers will be able to have information about the baby's muscle
      mass, which will help the researchers to provide better nutrition to babies who are born
      premature. Researchers will also be able to determine if there are any differences in the
      muscle/fat mass based on the type of feeding (breast milk alone, formula alone or a
      combination of breast milk and formula). This information may be beneficial in helping to
      promote the appropriate type of feeding for babies born premature.

    <description>Body composition as determined by the PEA POD air displacement plathesmography would determine the fat mass percentage and the serial measure of this parameter would determine the changes in the fat mass percentage indicating the quality of growth between 36 and 40 weeks post conceptional age. At 40 weeks corrected age, the fat mass percentage of the premature infants would be compared with ten healthy term infants born to healthy mothers with uncomplicated pregnancies.</description>
