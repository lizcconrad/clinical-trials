    <textblock>
      To determine if a therapy regimen including treatment with The MetaNeb® System has a positive
      impact on the rate of pulmonary complications that occur in high risk post-operative
      patients. This is a non-randomized facility (or hospital) level pre-post intervention study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pulmonary complications (PPC) are associated with significant excess
      morbidity, mortality and healthcare expenditure. Although PPCs are an incompletely understood
      multifactorial syndrome, atelectasis is recognized as a critical component. A variety of
      strategies have been shown to reduce the risk for development of post-operative atelectasis
      including lung expansion (LE) therapies. Well-designed studies are needed to distinguish
      which LE approach has the greatest potential to optimize patient care, clinical outcomes and
      cost savings.

      Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) devices have been in use for more than 25 years
      and are used widely in the acute care, post-surgical, and homecare setting. Such devices
      provide both LE and airway clearance therapy (ACT) for patients with obstructive and/or
      restrictive lung diseases and conditions. The MetaNeb® System is an LE expansion modality
      that incorporates all the physiological effects of IPV while providing additional therapeutic
      advantages intended primarily to more effectively treat or prevent pulmonary atelectasis.

      The study will be conducted in two stages. In Stage I of the study, a retrospective review of
      medical records for post-surgical patients, who received STANDARD THERAPY as defined by
      current hospital and respiratory care department policies and procedures will be performed.
      In Stage II, a CHANGE IN PRACTICE will be made and patients will receive standard care with
      the addition of therapy with The MetaNeb® System. Demographic, clinical &amp; outcome data will
      be collected for eligible patients during the two stages of the study. Study staff will
      collect data from the medical records, following a protocol determined schedule.

    <description>The treatment protocol used for Respiratory Care during the CHANGE IN PRACTICE period of the Study will be that prescribed by the patient's health care team in the routine standard care of each patient. With the exception of standard airway clearance and lung expansion procedures, other components of the patients respiratory care regimen will remain the same as during the standard therapy period, however the CHANGE IN PRACTICE will incorporate the use/treatment with The MetaNeb® System as an alternative to usual airway clearance and lung expansion procedures. Use of The MetaNeb® System will follow the labeling of the device.</description>
