  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop adequate and satisfactory tools using reliable
      clinical and physical factors in predicting pediatric obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea
      syndrome (OSAHS) and allow greater access to appropriate therapy in children.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of OSAHS is estimated to be about 1% to 4% in children, however, it is
      frequently underdiagnosed because of the difficulties for evaluation.Current diagnostic
      approaches are based on the patient's history, clinical presentation and physical
      examination, endoscopy, and radiological imaging examinations, and confirmation is made by
      the current gold standard of full-night polysomnography (PSG). Previous studies have reported
      the use of a clinical history, physical examination and questionnaires for predicting
      pediatric OSAHS but there were lacking of adequate and satisfactory results. Despite the
      potential diagnostic benefits, PSG for pediatric patients are not routinely used in clinical
      practice. Therefore, to obtain a reliable, valid, and easily-performed diagnostic or
      screening tool for the clinical assessment of pediatric OSAHS is essential for the
      cost-effective care of these patients.

    <description>When all variables were analyzed individually with the AHI, Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to explore the relationships between clinical predictor variables and AHI.Significant variables were entered into stepwise multiple linear regression analysis to identify independent predictors for pediatric OSAHS and to develop a predictive equation for AHI values.</description>

    <description>BMI z-score: a measure of relative weight adjusted for the child's age and gender, and calculated by dividing the difference between the measured value and the mean by the standard deviation.</description>

    <description>Tonsil size grading: 0, surgically removed tonsils; 1, tonsils hidden within the pillars; 2, tonsils extending to the pillars; 3, tonsils were beyond the pillars but not to the midline; and 4, tonsils extended to the midline.</description>
