  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting African American
      prostate cancer survivors to a 12 week physical activity intervention study of three arms
      (aerobics, resistance training, and usual care) through physician referral and community
      advertisement strategies. In addition, the investigators will investigate the acceptance rate
      of the intervention and gather preliminary results on the effect of exercise on African
      American men's urinary and sexual functions. These data can then be used to refine the
      intervention and its implementation model, and to inform the submission of a larger grant to
      the National Institutes of Health.
