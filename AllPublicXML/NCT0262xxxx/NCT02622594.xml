  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, two center, randomized, evaluator-blinded, bilateral
      (right vs. left) study of photodynamic therapy in subjects with facial actinic keratoses.

      Subject's face will be randomized to receive one of four treatments: Treatment 1, Treatment
      2, Treatment 3 or Treatment 4. Treatment 1 will include microneedling performed prior to ALA
      application to their right face and ALA application only to the left face 60 minutes prior to
      BLUE light treatment for 1000 seconds (16 minutes 40 seconds). Treatment 2 will include
      microneedling performed prior to ALA application to their left face and ALA application only
      to the right side of their face 60 minutes prior to BLUE light treatment for 1000 seconds (16
      minutes 40 seconds). Treatment 3 will include microneedling performed prior to ALA
      application to their right face and ALA application only to the left side of their face 30
      minutes prior to BLUE light treatment for 1000 seconds (16 minutes 40 seconds). Treatment 4
      will include microneedling performed prior to ALA application to their left face and ALA
      application only to the right side of their face 30 minutes prior to BLUE light treatment for
      1000 seconds (16 minutes 40 seconds). The face is defined as the surface of the skin
      encompassing the forehead to the hair line and tops of the eyebrows, the entire nasal dorsum,
      the cheeks (bounded by the orbital rim, the anterior border of the ear, the jawline, the nose
      and the chin), the upper lip (not including the vermilion border) and the chin (bounded by
      the lower edge of the vermilion border, the cheek junction and the jawline). The treatment
      areas will be not be occluded. A line will be drawn with a marker that intersects the nose,
      forehead, upper lip and chin in the midline. The left face is defined as the face to the left
      of this line and the right face is defined as the face to the right of this line.
      Posttreatment follow-up visits will be scheduled to occur 48 hours after the treatment and at
      1, 3 and 6 months after the treatment. A blinded evaluator who will remain blinded with
      respect to the randomization will conduct grading of the subject's actinic keratoses and
      photodamage. Tolerability of treatment will be assessed by evaluations of the local skin
      response (erythema, edema, etc.) and will be conducted by an unblinded evaluator.

      Safety will be evaluated by adverse events and local skin responses reported during the study
