  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for healthy participants. This study tests single dose of the research drug
      HSP-130 against two existing approved drugs United States - approved Neulasta and European
      Union-approved Neulasta.

    <textblock>
      There will be 25 healthy participants in each of the six sequence groups. A total of 150
      participants will be studied in one site in Australia. In addition to the 150 participants
      included, alternate subjects will be asked to come to the site on the day prior to when
      dosing is scheduled to begin. There will be 3 treatment options with 3 study dosing periods
      (1, 2 and 3) and at least 56 days between each treatment. The subject once asked to take part
      in the study will be assigned by chance (randomized) to one of the sequence groups as
      mentioned above (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).
