          -  Prospective participants upon examination are confirmed to have at least 3 live head
             lice (defined as lice adults or nymphs) and at least 5 viable appearance louse eggs
             (nits).

          -  Prospective participants who give written informed consent or, if the participant is
             under 17 years of age, whose parent/guardian gives written informed consent to
             participate in the study.

          -  Prospective participants who will be available for follow up visits over the 21 days
             following first treatment.

          -  Prospective female participants (including female caregivers) of childbearing
             potential who are willing to provide a urine pregnancy test.

          -  Prospective participants who agree not to shave their hair or use any other
             pediculicide, nit combing, or louse treatment method during the course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prospective participants with a known sensitivity to any of the ingredients in benzyl

          -  Prospective participants with a secondary bacterial infection of the scalp (eg.
             impetigo/pyoderma) or have a secondary or long term scalp condition that could make it
             difficult to evaluate the extent and severity of an infestation or that would present
             a problem in the evaluation of response to therapy (e.g., psoriatic lesions of the
             scalp, extensive seborrheic dermatitis).

          -  Prospective participants who have been treated with other head lice products within 4
             weeks prior to randomization.

             urine pregnancy test.

          -  Prospective participants who have participated in another clinical study or used an
             investigational new drug within 1 month before entry into this study.

          -  Participants who have already participated in this clinical study.
