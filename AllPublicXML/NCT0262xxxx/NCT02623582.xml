  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot open-label study to estimate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of intravenously
      administered, RNA electroporated autologous T cells expressing anti-CD123 chimeric antigen
      receptors expressing tandem TCR and 4-1BB (TCR /4-1BB) costimulatory domains (referred to as
      RNA CART123) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) subjects.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The remaining 12 subjects of the study will receive up to six IV doses of RNA CART123 cells.
Subjects in Cohort 2 may be given lymphodepleting chemotherapy 4 days (+/- 1 day) prior to the first CART123 cell infusion (if ALC&gt; 500/uL).
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy may be repeated before the fourth dose of RNA CART123 cells (if ALC&gt; 500/uL).
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy includes a single dose of cyclophosphamide (1g/m2) Weight used for dosing will be the weight obtained prior to the apheresis procedure Cell numbers are based on CAR+ cells with CAR expression determined by flow cytometry Based on the product release criteria, at least 20% of the total cells will be RNA CART123 cells.
Dosing will not be changed for changes in subject weight The indicated doses are +/- 20% to account for manufacturing variability.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 18 years of age or older with AML with no available curative
             treatment options using currently available therapies

          -  Subjects must have a suitable stem cell donor available who may donate cells if the
             subject needs to undergo allogeneic HCT. Donor may be matched or mismatched and must
             be found to be suitable according to the institution's standard criteria.

          -  Subjects with second or subsequent relapse, any relapse refractory to salvage, or with
             persistent disease after at least two lines of therapy.

             a. Subjects with relapsed disease after prior allogeneic HCT (myeloablative or
             non-myeloablative) will be eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria and i.
             Have experienced graft rejection (no evidence of donor cells by STR analysis on 2
             occasions separated by at least 1 month), OR: ii. Donor cells are present but there is
             no active GVHD, subject does not require immunosuppression and is more than 6 months
             from transplant

          -  Subjects must have evaluable disease defined as &gt;5% blasts on marrow aspirate or
             biopsy, extramedullary disease (CNS involvement is prohibited), or at least 20% blasts
             in the peripheral blood within 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Note: subjects with second
             or subsequent relapse are considered to have evaluable disease even without meeting
             the above morphologic criteria if they are found to have persistent recurrent
             disease-associated molecular or cytogenetic abnormalities.

          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.6 mg/dl

          -  ALT/AST must be &lt; 5 x upper limit of normal unless related to disease

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl, unless subject has Gilbert's syndrome (â‰¤3.0 mg/dL);

          -  ECOG Performance status 0-2.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40% as confirmed by ECHO/MUGA

          -  Written informed consent is given.

          -  Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable birth control methods.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. The safety of this therapy on unborn children is not
             known. Female study participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test at enrollment. A urine pregnancy test will be performed within 48 hours
             before infusion.

          -  HIV infection.

          -  Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.

          -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressant medications. Recent or
             current use of inhaled steroids or physiologic replacement with hydrocortisone is not
             exclusionary.

          -  Absolute lymphocyte count &lt;500/uL

          -  Any uncontrolled active medical disorder that would preclude participation as
             outlined.

          -  Subjects with signs or symptoms indicative of CNS involvement. A CNS evaluation should
             be performed as clinically appropriate to rule out CNS involvement.

          -  Known history of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum
             albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40).

          -  Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association
             Classification.

          -  Patients with a known history or prior diagnosis of optic neuritis or other
             immunologic or inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system

          -  Subjects with clinically apparent arrhythmia, or arrhythmias that are not stable on
             medical management, within 2 weeks of the Screening/Enrollment visit.
