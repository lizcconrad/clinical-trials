      This study will evaluate progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective
      response rate (ORR), duration of response, and safety of motesanib (AMG706) in combination
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared to placebo in combination with paclitaxel and
      carboplatin.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called motesanib. Motesanib is being tested in
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin to treat people who have Stage IV or recurrent
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study will look at progression free
      survival, overall survival, overall response and safety.

      The study enrolled 401 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groupsâ€”which remained undisclosed to the patient
      and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Motesanib 125 mg + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin

      All participants were asked to take 5 X 25 mg motesanib tablets or placebo at the same time
      each day throughout the study. All participants received treatment with paclitaxel 200 mg/m^2
      intravenous (IV) and carboplatin IV on Day 1 of each 3 week Cycle for up to 6 Cycles. After 6
      Cycles participants could continue to receive motesanib or placebo alone for up to 36 months.

      This multi-centre trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 36 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final
      visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12, 18 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from randomization to death (or, where applicable, the censoring date). Participants who had not died or were lost to follow-up by the analysis data cut-off date were censored at their last contact date. Participants who withdrew full consent to participate in the study were censored on the date consent was withdrawn.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants achieving either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST Version 1.1 criteria. CR= disappearance of all target lesions; disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum LD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR was defined as the time from the date of first response (CR or PR) to disease progression (per RECIST Version 1.1) or death. CR= Disappearance of all target lesions; disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR= At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD ) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum LD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
