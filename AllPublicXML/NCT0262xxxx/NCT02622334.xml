        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of ocular hypertension (OHT) or primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) in at
             least one eye (qualifying eye) as determined by the Investigator at screening or based
             on a reliable and documented assessment done within the last 6 months prior to
             screening provided that no progression of visual field damage is expected

          -  At baseline visit, intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt;= 24 mmHg in the morning and &gt;= 21 mmHg
             in the afternoon measurement in at least one eye (qualifying eye = study eye) and =&lt;
             34 mmHg at all time points in both eyes

          -  Best corrected logMAR visual acuity score of 0.7 (20/100 Snellen) or better in each
             eye as measured by ETDRS visual acuity test at screening

          -  Central corneal pachymetry measurement 420 to 620 micrometer in qualifying eye at
             screening

          -  Cup-to-disk ratio =&lt; 0.8 (both eyes) at screening

          -  Anterior chamber angle is open and non-occludable as confirmed by the Investigator by

             acceptable), metabolic disorder, cancer or cirrhosis

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (SBP &gt;= 160 mmHg and/or DBP &gt;= 100 mmHg) despite treatment
             at the time of screening confirmed by the average of &gt;= 3 blood pressure measurements,
             properly measured with well-maintained equipment

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory test results at screening

          -  Hypersensitivity to RO5093151 or any of the components of its formulation, or

             anterior chamber

          -  Evidence of clinically significant blepharitis, concurrent infectious/non-infectious
             conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis

          -  History or signs of penetrating ocular trauma. Uneventful (uncomplicated) cataract
             surgery performed 3 months prior to screening is allowed

          -  According to the Investigator's best judgment, risk of visual field or visual acuity
             worsening in either eye as a consequence of glaucoma progression or consequence of
             participation in the trial (i.e., during washout of ocular hypotensive medications or
             treatment with placebo) or any other ocular disease

          -  Unable to safely stop ocular hypotension medications prior to randomization according
             to the required minimum washout periods

          -  History of any ocular filtering surgical intervention, previous glaucoma intraocular
             surgery, or laser trabeculoplasty

          -  History of refractive surgery (laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis, laser epithelial
             keratomileusis, photorefractive keratectomy, phototherapeutic keratectomy)

          -  Any other intraocular surgery within 6 months of screening

          -  Advanced age-related macular degeneration (wet or dry), vitreous hemorrhage, diabetic
             retinopathy or any progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause other
             than glaucoma
