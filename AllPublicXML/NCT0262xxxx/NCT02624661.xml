  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia is one of the strongest pains known to humans. Some patients do not have
      enough effect with the available pharmaceutical treatments and are offered a type of surgery,
      which involves the injection of glycerol in a nerve structure called trigeminal ganglion. The
      researchers will do a pilot study on 10 patients with a new surgical technique using
      neuronavigation. The researchers believe that this new neuronavigation-based system can
      improve the precision of the technique and reduce the risk for complications.
