      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effect of 3 months use of enhanced Oral
      Nutritional Supplementation (ONS) on muscle accretion and functional performance in
      malnourished elderly patients. The objectives of this study are to determine feasibility of
      recruitment, adherence to intervention and retention of the sample, as well as the capacity
      of subjects to complete functional and muscle mass measures for a planned multi-centre
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure, centralized web-based randomization module to:
Ensure Enlive (enhanced ONS) + standard menu; or
Standard of care (including standard menu and possibly ONS) Patients randomized will receive standard menu or standard menu plus enhanced oral nutritional supplements (ONS). Patients randomized to enhanced ONS, will receive one bottle of ONS Abbott Ensure Enlive (235 mL, 350 calories), or similar product, two times daily for 90 days.</intervention_model_description>
