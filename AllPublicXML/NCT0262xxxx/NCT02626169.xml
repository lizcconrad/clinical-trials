    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor and clopidogrel are FDA-approved drugs for inhibition of platelet hyper-reactivity
      in certain clinical situations. The platelet inhibition and patient outcomes (PLATO) trial
      showed that in patients with acute coronary syndromes, ticagrelor significantly reduced the
      primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke), all-cause mortality
      and cardiovascular mortality compared to clopidogrel. It has been suggested that in addition
      to its anti-platelet effects, ticagrelor has additional unique effects, including
      anti-inflammatory effects that are not shared by clopidogrel. In the present study the
      investigators will assess whether ticagrelor, as compared to clopidogrel, increases serum
      levels of 15-epi-lipoxin A4, a potent endogenous anti-inflammatory mediator.

    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel are routinely used for platelet inhibition in addition
      to aspirin in patients after acute coronary syndromes. The platelet inhibition and patient
      outcomes (PLATO) trial showed that in patients with acute coronary syndromes, ticagrelor
      significantly reduced the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or
      stroke), all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality compared to clopidogrel. On the
      other hand, when compared with clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes with
      scheduled percutaneous coronary intervention, prasugrel therapy did not affect overall
      mortality despite the fact that it was associated with significantly reduced rates of
      ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, but with an increased risk of major bleeding,
      including fatal bleeding. This may suggest that ticagrelor possesses additional (pleiotropic)
      effects besides platelet inhibition.

      The investigators have recently shown that pioglitazone increases 15-epi-lipoxin A4 blood
      levels in patients. The investigators have recently found that in the rat, ticagrelor
      increases tissue levels of 15-epi-lipoxin A4 in the heart, aorta and kidney.

      It is plausible that some of the favorable effects of ticagrelor seen in the clinical studies
      are mediated via the anti-inflammatory effects of 15-epi-lipoxin A4.

      15-epi-lipoxin A4 is a potent anti-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving mediator derived
      from arachidonic acid. Several studies have suggested that ticagrelor has anti-inflammatory
      properties in various animal models. In the present study the investigators will assess if
      ticagrelor increases blood 15-epi-lipoxin A4 levels at doses used in patients.
