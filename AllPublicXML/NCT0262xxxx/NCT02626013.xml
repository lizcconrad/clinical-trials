  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study aims at assessing the impact of nab-paclitaxel on the clinical
      outcomes and the health-related QoL (HRQoL) of this heavily burdened and difficult-to-treat
      population. Notably, the data generated in the context of this study will serve as
      complementary evidence to that of the tightly and strictly controlled pre-registration
      clinical trial setting, which is of essential importance especially in patient populations
      with diseases of complex and heterogeneous biology, such as breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for inclusion in this study have to meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Adult patients (18 years and older);

          -  Patients with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of MBC who have
             failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard,
             anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated;

          -  Patients for whom the decision to prescribe therapy with nab-paclitaxel according to
             the locally approved product's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) has already
             been taken prior to their enrolment in the study; the assignment of the patient to
             this therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by the study protocol but falls
             within current practice and the prescription of nab-paclitaxel is clearly separated
             from the physician's decision to include the patient in the current study;

          -  Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply
             with the requirements of this study protocol;

          -  Patients must have signed an informed consent document;

          -  Patients must be able to read, understand and complete the study specific
             questionnaire

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in
        this study:

          -  Patients who have initiated treatment with nab-paclitaxel more than 7 days prior to
             their enrolment into the study;

          -  Patients that meet any of the contraindications to the administration of the study
             drug according to the approved SmPC;

          -  Receipt of any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the
             investigational agent (whichever is longer) before the commencement of therapy with
             nab-paclitaxel.
