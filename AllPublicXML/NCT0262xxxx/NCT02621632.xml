  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to investigate a novel compression system termed Socknleg composed of an
      understocking covering the foot with three added stockings extending from the ankle to the
      knee without covering the foot. The novel Socknleg system is compared to a standard class III
      compression stocking.

      The investigator tests a novel compression system termed Socknleg in 20 healthy individuals
      and 20 patients with chronic venous disease. Socknleg is composed of an understocking
      covering the foot with three added stockings extending from the ankle to the knee without
      covering the foot. The novel Socknleg system is compared to a standard class III compression
      stocking. Outcome measures are successful donning and the comparison of interface pressure
      measured on the level of the ankle.

    <description>Interface pressure of the compression systems is measured at level cB1 (transition of the Achilles tendon to the calf muscle) in mmHg by a pressure measuring device termed PicopressÂ® . Interface pressure is compared between the novel compression system and the comparator, a class III compression stocking.</description>
