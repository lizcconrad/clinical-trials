      The objective of the ELENA French Cohort is to study the developmental trajectories of
      children and adolescents with ASD and their risk or protective associated factors.

      This is an open, prospective and multicenter cohort study, including children and adolescents
      under 16 years of age with ASD recruited from services specialized in the assessment of
      developmental disorders.

      Multidisciplinary cohort studies of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) followed
      from childhood to adulthood exist abroad but not in France. The objective of the ELENA French
      Cohort is to study the developmental trajectories of children and adolescents with ASD and
      their risk or protective associated factors.

      This is an open, prospective and multicenter cohort study, including children and adolescents
      under 16 years of age with ASD recruited from services specialized in the assessment of
      developmental disorders. The patients will be monitored every 18 months for at least 36
      months and during a maximum of 10 years. Clinical, social, environmental, and genetic data,
      as well as data relating to the parental quality of life will be collected. The primary
      endpoint will be the adaptive level in three domains of the Vineland II (Communication,
      Socialization and Daily living skills). The secondary endpoints will be parental quality of
      life, comorbidities, interventions and severity of ASD.

      The inclusion of 900 patients over a 10-year period is expected. This cohort should
      contribute to a better knowledge of the child with ASD's development, taking into account his
      physical, social and familial environment, the type of interventions and some genetic
      components. It should also lay the foundations for a national network of professionals
      working in the field of autism research by offering them a common tool for promoting
      translational studies.
