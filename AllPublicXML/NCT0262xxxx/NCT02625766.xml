  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral compression type pelvic ring injuries remain the most common type of pelvic fractures
      encountered. There is a substantial amount of controversy surrounding the treatment of these
      injuries and there is evidence that both operative and non-operative treatment can be
      successful.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The crux of the problem is determining which of these patients would benefit from early
      surgical stabilization and which will heal uneventfully without surgery. Many authors site
      patient pain and inability to mobilize as indications for surgery, although there is
      conflicting evidence supporting this claim. The presence of chronic pain in the trauma
      population is a growing area of interest, and there is a push towards controlling pain more
      effectively in the acute setting. It remains to be proven that surgical intervention is more
      effective at decreasing acute and longer term pain.

      There is evidence in the literature to support both operative and non-operative treatment of
      patients with LC1 or LC2 pelvic fractures. There is conflicting evidence that surgical
      stabilization decreases acute pain and narcotic requirements, although patients are often
      counseled to that effect. The investigators propose to prospectively randomize patients with
      lateral compression type pelvic fractures to non-operative versus operative treatment and
      track which group has less pain, less need for narcotic pain medications, and who mobilizes
      with physical therapy faster.

    <description>Patients enrolled in the operative treatment group will undergo surgical intervention for their pelvic fracture. The surgeon will decide the best surgical technique as per standard of care for the patient's injury. The patient will mobilize as per the surgeon's instructions and x-rays will be taken at follow-up clinic appointments to determine if the injury is healing properly. If additional surgery is required or other complications arise, this will be recorded within the study follow-up forms.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolled in the non-operative treatment group will not undergo surgical intervention for their pelvic fracture. They will mobilize as per the surgeon's instructions according to standard of care of for this injury. X-rays will be taken at follow-up clinic appointments to determine if the injury is healing properly or if the pelvis has shifted and may warrant surgical intervention. If complications arise and/or surgery is required, crossover will be allowed and recorded within study follow-up forms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has one of the following pelvic fractures (includes bilateral sacral
             fractures): Lateral compression type 1, Lateral compression type 2, Lateral
             compression type 3
