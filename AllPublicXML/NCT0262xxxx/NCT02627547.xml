  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flavonoids are compounds that have been proven to have a beneficial effect on health, such as
      reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and, in some cases, cancer. Citrus
      juices have a high flavonoid content. However, the absorption of flavonoids into the body is
      limited. This study will investigate whether being physically active improves the absorption
      of flavonoids.

      Endurance trained athletes will be invited to participate. Following screening procedures (a.
      Health Screening Questionnaire; b. height and weight measurement for calculation of Body Mass
      Index; c. maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) uptake test, eligible participants will
      undertake two experimental tests; one during a period of normal training, the other
      immediately following 1 week of detraining.

      In the morning of the experimental trial participants will consume 500 mL of orange juice.
      Blood samples and urinary fractions will be collected prior (base line) to and for 24 hours
      after orange juice consumption. Participants will be asked to follow a special
      polyphenol-free diet and record weighed dietary intake for 2 days preceding each trial and
      during the day of the experimental trial.

      The study aims to:

        1. Determine the effects of training status of endurance athletes on bioavailability of
           flavanones in endurance trained individuals

        2. Determine whether changes in bioavailability of flavanones are related to changes in
           biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, plasma lipids and insulin sensitivity.
