  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an
      intervention designed to facilitate family engagement during bedside rounds at a children's
      hospital. The intervention consists of a &quot;checklist&quot; of key behaviors associated with the
      delivery of quality family-centered rounds, as well as training in the use of the checklist
      tool. In a pre-post controlled design, two hospital services will be randomized to use the
      checklist while two others will be randomized to usual care. The intervention is expected to
      increase to the performance of key checklist behaviors, family engagement, and family
      perceptions of patient safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family engagement in children's healthcare encounters has been suggested as a means to
      improve safety. To engage families in care, the recommended practice is to conduct rounds at
      the child's bedside with the family present (family-centered rounds). Family-centered rounds
      strive to engage families in (1) a relationship with care providers, (2) exchange of
      information for decision making, and (3) deliberation about decisions. Bedside rounds
      represent a consistent venue to engage families in the care of hospitalized children, yet no
      studies have systematically identified and examined the barriers and facilitators of family
      engagement during rounds as a means to improve safety.
