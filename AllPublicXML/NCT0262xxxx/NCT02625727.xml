  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using double blind, randomized controlled design to study the immediate, short-term and
      intermediate-term therapeutic effects of ultrasound guided hyaluronic acid injection and
      hyaluronic acid combined corticosteroid injection to patients with knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 76 patients will be collected. The participants will be randomized into two
      groups, including hyaluronic acid injection group and hyaluronic acid combined corticosteroid
      injection group.

      Physical activity will be evaluated. The hyaluronic acid group will receive three times of
      hyaluronic acid injection per week in three weeks; the hyaluronic acid combined
      corticosteroid group will receive hyaluronic acid combined corticosteroid injection in the
      first week, followed by hyaluronic acid injection at the second and third week.

      Re-evaluation will be arranged at after one week of injection, after two weeks of injection,
      one week after injection, one month after injection, three months after injection, and six
      month after injection.
