  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
      prophylactic emicizumab treatment in participants previously treated with episodic or
      prophylactic bypassing agents. Episodic bypassing agent participants will be randomized in a
      2:1 fashion to receive emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A) versus no prophylaxis (Arm B) and will
      be stratified across Arms A and B according to the number of bleeds they experienced over the
      last 24 weeks prior to study entry (less than [&lt;] 9 or greater than or equal to [&gt;/=] 9
      bleeds); Arm B participants will have the opportunity to switch to emicizumab prophylaxis
      after at least 24 weeks on-study. Prophylactic bypassing agent participants will switch to
      emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm C) from the start of the trial; enrollment will be extended for
      24 weeks after the last participant has enrolled in Arms A or B or until approximately 50
      participants have enrolled in Arm C, whichever occurs first. Episodic bypassing agent
      participants who previously participated in the non-interventional study BH29768
      (NCT02476942) who were unable to enroll in Arms A or B, or participants on prophylactic
      bypassing agents who were unable to enroll in Arm C, prior to their closure will have the
      opportunity to enroll in Arm D. Like participants in Arms A and C, Arm D participants will
      receive emicizumab prophylaxis from the start of the trial. All participants will continue to
      receive episodic bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, preferably with
      recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa).

          <title>Arm A (Episodic Treatment): Emicizumab</title>
          <description>Participants, who received episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry, received prophylactic emicizumab. Emicizumab was administered at a loading dose of 3 milligrams per kilogram per week (mg/kg/week) subcutaneously (SC) for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC up to the end of study. Participants continued to receive episodic bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, with recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) and/or activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC).</description>

          <title>Arm B (Episodic Treatment): No Emicizumab</title>
          <description>Participants, who received episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry, did not receive emicizumab prophylaxis. Participants in this arm could switch to emicizumab prophylaxis after completing at least 24 weeks on study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, with rFVIIa and/or aPCC.</description>

The EQ-5D-5L includes 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L health state profile (descriptive system) and the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale. The EQ-5D-5L health state profile is designed to record the participant's current health state in 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Responses from the five domains are used to calculate a single utility index value ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates better health state (no problems) and 5 indicates worst health state (confined to bed).</description>

          <title>Arm B (Episodic Treatment): No Emicizumab</title>
          <description>Participants, who received episodic treatment with bypassing agents prior to study entry, did not receive emicizumab prophylaxis. Participants in this arm could switch to emicizumab prophylaxis after completing at least 24 weeks on study. Participants continued to receive bypassing agent therapy to treat breakthrough bleeds, with rFVIIa and/or aPCC. Data reported for this arm represents data collected from all Arm B participants during 'no emicizumab' treatment; data from those participants who switched to emicizumab after at least 24 weeks is reported separately in Arm Bemi.</description>
