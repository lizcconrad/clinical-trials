  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATTRwt (also known as senile systemic, or senile cardiac amyloidosis) is a progressive heart
      disease, causing congestive heart failure. It is caused by amyloid protein deposits in the
      heart, that are derived from a normal protein, TTR, made in the liver. The aim of the study
      is to determine whether lowering the blood levels of TTR, by a weekly injection of a compound
      designed specifically to do this, will slow the progression of the disease when treated
      patients are compared to previously-followed patients who were not receiving this drug. The
      study also aims to determine how well this drug is tolerated and the existence and severity
      of any drug side-effects.

        All patients with documented SSA will be considered for inclusion. SSA is defined as an
        echocardiographic appearance of left ventricular wall thickness of 13 mm or more, in the
        absence of uncontrolled hypertension, and with a positive biopsy for amyloid, which also
        stains positive for TTR by immunochemistry or mass spectrometry. For the definition of SSA,
        genetic testing should be negative for a mutation. Identification of amyloid type is
        standard of care for all patients seen at the Cardiac Amyloidosis Program and the presence
        of a clinically -obtained positive biopsy will be a requirement for study inclusion. The
        positive biopsy can be from any organ, providing that the echocardiographic appearance is
        typical of amyloidosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients should, in the opinion of the Investigator, be in a stable state in terms of
             NYHA class. Class I-III patients will be recruited.

          2. Age 50-90 years

          3. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females. If a woman is premenopausal, or a male
             partners with a premenopausal woman, she/he must be willing to use the following
             methods of contraception: condoms, oral/hormonal contraception, Intrauterine Device,
             diaphragm, or abstinence

          4. Written informed consent to be obtained prior to study treatment

          5. Histochemical diagnosis of amyloidosis as based on detection by polarizing microscopy
             of green birefringent material in Congo red-stained tissue specimens

          6. Molecular definition of the absence of a TTR mutation or immunohistochemical staining
             of amyloid fibrils with anti TTR antibody and negative genetic testing for a TTR
             mutation.

          7. Willingness to return to the treating center for follow-up.

          8. Willingness and ability to self-administer, or to have spouse administer weekly
             subcutaneous injections of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, require further adjustment of
             diuretics at the time of screening to achieve optimal treatment of heart failure. Once
             stable for 2 weeks, patients in Class I-III will become eligible for inclusion.

          2. Patients with NYHA class 4 congestive heart failure.

          3. Concomitant non-amyloid heart disease that might, in the opinion of the investigator,
             cause changes in strain imaging on serial follow-up (e.g. aortic stenosis of greater
             than mild severity, unstable coronary artery disease).

          4. Prior liver transplantation or liver transplantation anticipated in less than 6
             months;

          5. ALT and/or AST ³ 2 x ULN and/or Alkaline phosphatase ³ 2 x UNL;

          6. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) &lt; 50 ml/min;

          7. Any other lab values that in the opinion of the investigator might place the subject
             at unacceptable risk for participation in the study;

          8. History of poor compliance with medications or medical treatment, based on a review of
             medical records.

          9. History of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of the study therapy;

         10. Use of any investigational drug for amyloidosis within 4 weeks prior to study entry or
             during the study.

         11. Current use of tafamidis, diflunisal, doxycycline or TUDCA for therapy of amyloidosis.
