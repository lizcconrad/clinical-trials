  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial investigates a new vaginal delivery system made of silicone rubber,
      containing Nestorone®, a 19—nor progesterone derivative and a low dose of serum estradiol
      (E2). The investigators plan to evaluate one-month data on the serum estradiol (E2) levels of
      three different contraceptive vaginal rings that contain a fixed dose of NES and escalating
      doses (75 µg/day, 100 µg/day, or 200 µg/day) of estradiol as the basis for selecting a CVR
      for a larger contraceptive efficacy trial.

      This dose-finding study aims to evaluate serum estradiol levels with use of contraceptive
      vaginal rings releasing Nestorone® and escalating doses of estradiol in normal cycling women.
      The primary objective is to evaluate one-month data on the serum estradiol (E2) levels of
      three different contraceptive vaginal rings containing a fixed dose of Nestorone® (NES) and
      escalating doses of estradiol as the basis for selecting a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR)
      dose for a contraceptive efficacy trial. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects
      of three different estradiol doses of a NES- E2 CVR on progesterone levels, bleeding and side
      effects during one month of use and to evaluate the effects of a hormone-free internal on
      bleeding patterns. Nestorone serum levels will further be measured as an indication of
      compliance with the continuous use of the ring.

                  evaluated by the investigator for inclusion based on risk factors that would
                  increase their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and thromboembolism, e.g.
                  lipid levels, glucose level, BP, BMI, family history of CVD at a young age.

             following treatment; partner treatment is also recommended. Subjects with vaginal
             infection (yeast, trichomonis, or bacterial vaginosis) may be enrolled after
             treatment. Investigators should make a determination if subjects are at high risk for
             reinfection, e.g. multiple sex partners, untreated partner, and whether such subjects
             can be included. In accordance with PI/medical designee assessment and local standards
             of practice, women with a history of genital herpes can be included if outbreaks are
             infrequent.

          8. A known clinically significant Pap test abnormality, as managed by current local or
             national guidelines that will require treatment during study participation.

          9. Known benign or malignant liver tumors; known active liver disease.

         10. Invasive cancer (past history of any carcinoma or sarcoma, except non-melanoma skin
             cancer).

         11. Current or past medically diagnosed severe depression, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could be exacerbated by use of a hormonal contraceptive.

         12. Known or suspected current alcoholism or drug abuse.

         13. Elevated serum fasting clinical chemistry values or complete blood count (CBC) values
             designated clinically significant by the investigator or medically qualified
             sub-investigator.

         14. Uncontrolled thyroid disease.

         15. Known impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal reserve.

         16. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;35.

         17. Use of injectable contraceptives (e.g. cyclofem or depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate)
             during the 9 months prior to enrollment or no spontaneous menses since last injection.

         18. Use of oral, transdermal, vaginal, implantable or intrauterine contraceptives within 7
             days prior to start of the treatment cycle. (Copper IUD is allowable. Levonorgestrel
             releasing IUD is not allowed.) NOTE: Discontinuation of any of these methods must have
             been for personal reasons unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this study.

         19. Known hypersensitivity to silicone rubber.

         20. History of toxic shock syndrome.

         21. Cystoceles or rectoceles or other anatomical abnormality that would preclude use of a
             vaginal ring.

         22. Planning to undergo major surgery during study participation.

         23. Severe constipation.

         24. Use of liver enzyme inducers or inhibitors on a regular basis.

         25. Known HIV infection.

         26. Bariatric surgery within the past year prior to enrollment. Have issues or concerns
             (in the judgment of the investigator) that may compromise the safety of the subject or
             confound the reliability of compliance and information acquired in this study.
