  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dermatological surgeons wear many hats to care for subjects with skin cancer. While their
      role in cancerous tissue removal results in superior cure rates, there is also a need for
      skilled excisional repair and effective wound healing regimens so the subject can heal with
      the least amount of scarring necessary. As such, numerous techniques have been developed for
      reducing the morbidity associated with excessive scarring. Various flaps and grafts allow the
      surgeon to approximate skin texture, thickness and adnexa with respect to the residual
      surrounding tissue. However, for optimal cosmetic and functional outcome, specific suture
      techniques are often necessary to ensure close wound approximation while simultaneously
      minimizing static tension along the wound edge. In addition, there are post-operative
      techniques for wound care that range from special dressings during the various stages of
      healing to cosmetic procedures for scar modification. Unfortunately, once the operation is
      complete, there is little the surgeon can do to minimize adverse scar formation without
      impairing the healing process. To date, most surgical wounds are allowed to heal at least
      partially before scar revision or modulation is attempted.

      Botulinum toxin presents a unique opportunity for surgeons to affect scar formation
      throughout the duration of the healing process. These effects are likely independent and
      adjunctive to any and all wound care techniques, and are primarily attributed to a reduction
      in dynamic tension on the wound edges. Most importantly, botulinum toxin's one time dosing
      requirements with respect to reduced scar formation precludes the variance inherent to
      standard wound care practices.

      Therefore, it has been proposed that for selected subjects, botulinum toxin may be a safe,
      effective and reliable means for improved post-excisional repair outcomes. Botulinum toxin
      has been investigated as an inhibitor of excessive, post-excisional scar formation in plastic
      surgery and Otorhinolaryngology literature. However, these promising studies have yet to
      combine objective assessment measures of human scar formation in a randomized controlled
      trial. In addition, there are currently no formal studies of botulinum toxin as a
      prophylactic against excess scarring in the dermatological literature. Fortunately, Botulinum
      toxin dosing in the forehead for the purposes of inhibiting excessive scar formation is
      comparable to the amount given for cosmetic purposes, which is commonplace in dermatology and
      well-studied.

      This study will attempt to assess the efficacy of Botulinum toxin as a prophylactic treatment
      in post-excisional repairs for the purpose of preventing excess scar formation. The end
      points will be the evaluation of each scar using the Manchester Scar Scale.

      All MSS and mMSS assessments will be performed in a standardized fashion. The mMSS
      assessments will be blinded and performed by board-certified dermatologists in the Department
      of Dermatology, Faculty Practice Associates, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New
      York City.
