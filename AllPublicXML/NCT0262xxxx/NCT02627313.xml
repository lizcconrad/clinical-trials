  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional breast radiotherapy is delivered to the entirety of the breast in fractionated
      treatments given over several weeks. While these techniques are effective, there is a risk of
      late adverse events from irradiation of surrounding normal tissues and the protracted nature
      of the treatments is inconvenient to patients and resource-intensive for health care systems.
      There is an unmet need for novel treatments that can be delivered more quickly, with reduced
      normal tissue exposure, and without compromising efficacy. The GammaPod is a breast-specific
      radiotherapy delivery device that holds the promise in addressing these needs. Employing the
      engineering and physics principles from stereotactic radiotherapy, it allows delivery of a
      highly-localized radiation dose to a very limited volume of breast. The Ottawa Hospital is
      the only Canadian member of a consortium of five academic institutions that have acquired the
      GammaPod in order to rigorously evaluate its use in clinical trials. The aim of the current
      project is to complete a mandatory clinical feasibility study of the GammaPod as part of the
      application for Investigational Testing of Medical Devices from Health Canada. The study will
      focus on the use of the GammaPod to deliver a radiotherapy boost, that is, a localized dose
      of radiation just around the surgical bed, in a single treatment.

    <description>Definition of treatment acceptability
No deviation (acceptable): 100% prescription isodose surface covers at least 95% of the PTV. The near-minimum PTV dose (D98%) must be greater than 7.2 Gy and near-maximum PTV dose (D2%) must be less than 9.6 Gy.
Minor deviation but acceptable: 95% prescription isodose surface covers between 95% and 100% of the PTV. No portion of the PTV receives &lt;93% of the prescription dose. Near-maximum dose (D2%) to PTV exceeds prescription dose by &gt;20% but &lt;30%. All specified critical normal tissue DVH limits fall within 5% of the guidelines.
Major deviations (unacceptable): 95% isodose surface covers &lt; 95% of the PTV. A portion of PTV receives &lt; 93% of the prescription dose. Near-maximum dose to PTV exceeds prescription dose by &gt;30%. Any critical normal tissue DVH limit exceeds 5% of the specified value.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must sign consent for study participation.

          -  The patient must be female and have a diagnosis of an invasive breast cancer that was
             treated surgically by a partial mastectomy.

          -  The surgical cavity is clearly visible on CT images and delineated by surgical clips

          -  We have at least one of the following clinico-pathological factors:

               -  Age ≥18 and ≤ 50 years

               -  Lymphovascular space invasion positive

               -  Grade III histology

               -  More than 2 close resection margins ( &gt; 0 mm to ≤ 2 mm)

               -  1 close resection margin and extensive in-situ component (EIC)

               -  Non-hormone sensitive breast cancer (ER and PR negative)

          -  Surgical margins are negative for invasive or non-invasive breast cancer.

          -  The volume of the TB PTV is less than 25% of the whole breast volume which is a
             criteria used for partial breast alone trials (NSABP B-39). The absolute value of the
             boost PTV is ≤ 100 cc

          -  Multifocal disease is allowed if it was removed by a single lumpectomy resection and
