  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled, Phase II
      clinical study to evaluate the effect of serelaxin versus placebo (both in addition to SoC)
      on the release of hs-cTnI, in patients with CHF after an exercise testing session.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age, with body weight ≤ 160 Kg

          -  Diagnosis of stable CHF:

        New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class II/III. Receiving guideline-recommended
        treatment for CHF.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45%, obtained within the last 3 months prior to
             screening.

          -  NT-proBNP &gt; 300 ng/L in sinus rhythm or &gt; 900 ng/L if not in sinus rhythm (determined
             locally).

          -  Ability to exercise for at least 10 to 12 minutes based on investigator's judgment.

          -  Systolic BP ≥ 125 mm Hg at randomization

          -  Renal function defined as an eGFR of ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2 at screening (sMDRD
             formula).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dyspnea primarily due to non-cardiac causes.

          -  Increased risk of developing hypotension during vasodilator therapy according to
             investigators judgement.

          -  Any contraindication for exercise testing and spirometry.

          -  Stopping of the spiroergometry at screening according to the stopping rules, unless
             the patient has reached maximum exercise capacity defined as carbon dioxide
             production/oxygen consumption (VCO2/VO2) &gt; 1.05.

          -  Change in guideline-recommended CHF treatment within 1 month prior to screening.
