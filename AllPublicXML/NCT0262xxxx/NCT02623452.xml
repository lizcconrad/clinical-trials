    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in participants with type1 diabetes on insulin injection therapy
      to investigate how the body processes a test formulation of insulin lispro and the effect of
      the test formulation on blood sugar levels. Side effects and tolerability will be documented.
      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part A and Part B) to achieve its objectives.
      Participants are expected to enroll in both parts.
