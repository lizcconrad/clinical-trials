  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of prostate cancer. In recent
      years it has become evident that higher doses of radiation are required to optimize disease
      control. The limiting factor of escalating dose to the prostate is the surrounding normal
      tissue. Despite advances in escalating radiation therapy, failures still occur in 20-30% of
      patients most often at the site of the original primary disease. As such there is growing
      interest in further dose escalating to the area of primary disease burden.The aim of this
      work is to look at the feasibility and toxicities of an integrated focal boost to whole gland
      prostate treatment using high dose rate brachytherapy.

      This study is a pilot study of 60 patients look at the toxicities, biochemical and patient
      reported quality of life outcomes of an MR-integrated focal boost using HDR prostate
      brachytherapy. Eligible patients for this study will be determined by pre-brachytherapy MRI
      (DCE, T2 weighted and diffusion weighted) imaging, to identify a dominant intraprostatic
      lesion. The HDR dose prescription is 19 Gy to the whole gland ad 22.5 Gy to MRI visible
      lesion delivered in one fraction, assuming that dose constraints to critical organs can be
      met.

    <description>Prior to brachytherapy treatment, a multiparametric MRI will be obtained for identification of the dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) and fused with the preplanning transrectal ultrasound. A total of 19 Gy will be prescribed to the prostate, organ at risk limits will be observed and up to 22.5 Gy can be delivered to the DIL</description>
