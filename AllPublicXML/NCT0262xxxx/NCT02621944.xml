  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in 20 per 1000 births. Only 47% of neonates
      treated with the state of the art therapy (induced systemic hypothermia) have normal
      outcomes. Therefore, other promising therapies that potentially work in synergy with
      hypothermia to improve neurologic outcomes need to be tested. One potential agent is
      melatonin. Melatonin is a naturally occurring substance produced mainly from the pineal
      gland. Melatonin is widely known for its role in regulating the circadian rhythm, but it has
      many other effects that may benefit infants with HI injury. Melatonin serves as a free
      radical scavenger, decreases inflammatory cytokines, and stimulates anti-oxidant enzymes.
      Therefore, melatonin may interrupt several key components in the pathophysiology of HIE, in
      turn minimizing cell death and improving outcomes. The research study will evaluate the
      neuroprotective properties and appropriate dose of Melatonin to give to infants undergoing
      therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty subjects will be enrolled in a dose escalation study. Subjects 1-10 will receive
      melatonin (0.5 mg/kg). If that dose proves to be safe, subjects 11-20 will receive an
      increased dose of melatonin (3 mg/kg). Subjects 21-30 will receive a dose increased to the
      targeted projected therapeutic dose (5 mg/kg).

      The serum concentration of melatonin and capture adverse event reports during this dose
      escalation study in neonates undergoing hypothermia and the long-term safety and potential
      efficacy via developmental follow-up performed at 18-22 months of age. In addition, this
      study will determine the effect of melatonin on the inflammatory cascade, oxidative stress,
      free radical production, and serum biomarkers of brain injury in neonates undergoing
      hypothermia.
