      Introduction: Population aging is associated with increased prevalence of chronic diseases.
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world
      population, affecting motor function and functional independence progressively. The
      physiological aging promotes the gradual reduction of body weight, lung function, peripheral
      muscle strength, cardiopulmonary endurance and physical capacity, which increase the
      debilitating effects. Aging, when associated with PD, can induce loss of functionality,
      postural changes, further affecting the nutritional status, worsening the quality of life and
      functional independence of the individual. Although physical therapy is commonly applied with
      a variety of methodologies to PD patients, evidence for the effectiveness of these
      interventions is lacking.

      Objective: The primary objective of the study is to compare the effects of Functional
      Training, Stationary Bike and Exergaming Exercises on proportion of fallers in elderly
      participants with PD. In addition, the secondary objectives are to compare the effects on
      cardiopulmonary endurance, posture, postural control, executive function, quality of life and
      functionality of individuals with PD.

      Methodology: This is an interventional, randomized, blinded, longitudinal and prospective
      study. This research will be conducted in the State Reference Center for Health Care of the
      Elderly (CREASI). The sample will consist of 63 individuals with PD per group. The
      Experimental Group 1 will be submitted to Functional Training, the Experimental Group 2 with
      undergo training with Stationary Bike and the Experimental Group 3 will be submitted to
      exergame training using Xbox360 with KinectTM sensor. All the interventions will be performed
      three times per week, with 50 minutes per session, during 8 weeks.
