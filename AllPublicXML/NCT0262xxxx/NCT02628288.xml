      Comparison of healing responses after treatment of complex bifurcation lesions with a
      dedicated bifurcation device (Axxessâ„¢ Biolimus Eluting Coronary Bifurcation Stent System +
      Absorb BVS in the distal branches) versus the Modified T stenting technique using Absorb BVS:
      an optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center randomized clinical trial with baseline OCT and clinical,
      angiographic and OCT follow-up at thirty months. Patients with true and complex coronary
      bifurcation lesions are randomly assigned to treatment with the dedicated Axxess
      biolimus-eluting bifurcation stent in the proximal main vessel (MV) and additional Absorb
      everolimus-eluting BVS in the branches versus a modified T technique using Absorb BVS only.
      The primary endpoint is changes in minimal luminal area assessed with OCT from baseline to 30
      months in pre-specified bifurcation segments. The main aims are to assess acute performance
      and to compare long-term vessel healing with optical coherence tomography, and clinical and
      angiographic outcome after treatment of complex bifurcation lesions with a dedicated stent
      with additional Absorb Bioabsorbable scaffolds (BVS) versus a modified T stenting technique
      with Absorb BVS.
