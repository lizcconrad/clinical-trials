  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      We are involved in testing new behavioral science methods and measures for future research
      projects. In the course of these evaluations, we will also test research questions related to
      parents psychological experiences and how these relate to the responses they have when they
      encounter different types of communication about child health. We are testing multiple
      research questions in the course of this research.

      Objective:

      - To learn about technologies and approaches to use in future research studies.

      Eligibility:

      - Parents (fathers and mothers) of children between the ages of 3-7.

      Design:

      As part of the main study, participants will do four tasks:

      Task 1: Before participants arrive for an in-person visit, they will answer questions online
      about themselves, their child, and their thoughts and opinions related to health.

      Task 2: At the in-person visit, participants will watch a short scene from a movie and answer
      some questions

      Task 3: At the in-person visit, participants will read information about a child health topic
      and answer questions

      Task 4: At the in-person visit, participants will use a virtual reality-based buffet
      restaurant simulation to make hypothetical food choices for their child...
