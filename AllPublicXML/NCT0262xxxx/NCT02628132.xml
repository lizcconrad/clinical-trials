  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The expression of PD-L1 in breast cancer has been previously demonstrated (Ghebeh et al
      2006). In addition, PD-L1 has been shown to work as a &quot;molecular shield&quot;, by protecting
      cancer cells from cytotoxic T-cells and chemotherapy induced apoptosis (Ghebeh et al 2008)
      suggesting to combine PD-L1 blockade with chemotherapy.

      This trial will test Durvalumab in combination with Paclitaxel on metastatic triple-negative
      breast cancer patients. The safety profile of Durvalumab as a monotherapy has been previously
      established (lu et al 2015). In this trial the safety profile and tolerability of Durvalumab
      given in combination of Paclitaxel will be tested. In addition, the efficacy of this
      combination on metastatic breast cancer will be monitored.

      This open label single arm trial will involve metastatic triple negative PD-L1 positive
      breast cancer patients. The trial will include a dose deescalation phase where three doses of
      paclitaxel will be tried on 3 patients each followed by a dose expansion phase on 25
      patients. Paclitaxel will be given weekly for 1 cycle followed by combination of Paclitaxel
      and Durvalumab. Once 6 cycles of Paclitaxel are completed, Durvalumab will be given alone
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The toxicity and tolerability of the
      combination will be the main end point while the efficacy will be a secondary end point.
