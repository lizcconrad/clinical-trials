      Pilot open-label study to estimate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of intravenously
      administered, RNA electroporated autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen
      receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ /4-1BB) costimulatory domains (referred to
      as &quot;RNA CART19&quot;) in Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) patients. Subjects will be treated with IV
      administration of RNA anti-CD19 CAR T cells for a total of six doses over 3 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects with HL with no available curative treatment options (such as
             autologous SCT) who have a limited prognosis (several months to &lt; 2 year survival)
             with currently available therapies will be enrolled.

               -  HL with biopsy-proven relapse or refractory disease who are unresponsive to or
                  intolerant of at least one line of standard salvage therapy;

               -  Patients must have evaluable disease by radiologic imaging (FDG PET-CT or FDG
                  PET-MRI) within 42 day of enrollment; evaluable includes both assessable and/or
                  measurable disease

          -  Age 18 to 24 years. Patients ages 22-24 will only be enrolled if they are currently
             being treated at CHOP or another pediatric facility/oncologist.

          -  Expected survival &gt; 12 weeks at time of screening

          -  Adequate organ function defined as:

          -  Renal function defined as:

               -  Creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 OR

               -  Serum creatinine: &lt; 1.7mg/dL (male subjects) or &lt; 1.4mg/dL (female subjects)

          -  ALT &lt; 5 times the ULN for age

          -  Total Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl

          -  Must have a minimum level of pulmonary reserve defined as ≤ Grade 1 dyspnea and pulse
             oxygenation &gt; 94% on room air

          -  Patients with relapsed disease after prior allogeneic SCT (myeloablative or
             non-myeloablative) will be eligible if they meet all other inclusion criteria and

          -  Have no active GVHD and require no immunosuppression

          -  Are more than 6 months from transplant 6) Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50 at
             screening

          -  Left Ventricular Shortening Fraction (LVSF) &gt; 28% confirmed by echocardiogram, or Left
             Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &gt; 45% confirmed by echocardiogram or MUGA

          -  Signed written informed consent must be obtained prior to any study procedures

          -  Successful T cell test expansion (to be performed as part of inclusion criteria until
             3 subjects meet all enrollment criteria)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. The safety of this therapy on unborn children is not
             known. Female study participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test at enrollment. A urine pregnancy test will be performed within 48 hours
             before the RNA CART19 infusion.

          -  HIV infection.

          -  Patients with known active CNS involvement by malignancy. Patients with prior CNS
             disease that has been effectively treated will be eligible providing treatment was &gt;4
             weeks before enrollment

          -  Patients in complete remission with no evidence by radiologic imaging of disease.

          -  History of allergy to murine proteins

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum
             albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40).

          -  Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy within the last 3 months, or absence of
             circulating B cells
