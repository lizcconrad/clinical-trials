      An assessment of the effectiveness of Pilates based physical therapy exercises for patients
      with low back pain (LBP) and its influence on spinal movement and patient reported functional
      disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is becoming a major public health problem associated with enormous
      economic burden on the modern society. Despite conservative interventions such as Pilates
      back exercises are routinely prescribed in clinical practice, most studies to date have only
      assessed its efficacy based on subjective patient reported outcomes with limited objective
      data available to clearly demonstrate the benefit of Pilates exercise on spinal alignment and
      mobility. Furthermore, patient adherence has been well identified to be an obstacle for
      effective home exercise program and the most cost-effective strategy to improve patient
      compliance remain unknown. Current study therefore aims to fulfil this gap in our knowledge
      by assessing the change of spinal alignment and kinematics utilizing dynamic radiographs
      performed pre- and post- a 6-week Pilates based physical therapy exercise program compare to
      a more generic hospital based back care exercise program. Furthermore, the effectiveness of
      conducing weekly phone reminders for 6 weeks on improving short (6-month) and long (12-month)
      term functional outcomes and patient compliance will also be assessed.
