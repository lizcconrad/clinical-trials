  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open, non-interventional, prospective, multi-center clinical research platform with the main
      objective to assess molecular biomarker testing, treatment and outcome of patients with
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC in Germany
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thorough knowledge of the treatment reality, e.g. characteristics, diagnostic, treatment and
      outcome of unselected patients in real-life practice, is crucial to evaluate and improve the
      quality of care for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The purpose
      of CRISP is to set up a national clinical research platform to document uniform data on the
      molecular testing, treatment, course of disease in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC
      not amenable to curative treatment. A particular focus is on molecular biomarker testing of
      patients before the start of first-line treatment. The data shall be used to assess the
      current state of care and to develop recommendations concerning topics that could be
      improved. PRO assessment will provide large-scale data on quality of life and
      anxiety/depression for real-life patients in routine practice. In addition, two
      questionnaires (concerning individual quality of life and patient-caregiver communication)
      will be validated in German patients with metastatic NSCLC. Furthermore CRISP will set up a
      decentralized clinically annotated tissue repository for future collaborative,
      investigational scientific biomarker testing.

      All patients will be asked to give consent for their tumor samples to be used for future
      investigational translational research. If the patient agrees, contact details of the local
      pathology where the tumor sample is stored as well as the sample's identification number will
      be documented in the eCRF, creating the CRISP &quot;decentralized clinically annotated tissue
      repository&quot;. Study sites will inform the local pathologists about the patient's consent and

        Patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC at the start of palliative first-line
        systemic therapy. Of all patients recruited, 3,250 patients with nonsquamous cell carcinoma
        will be tested for molecular alterations at the start of first-line treatment (CRISP
        patients). 1,750 patients with squamous can be tested for molecular alterations at the
        start of first-line treatment (CRISP patients). The remainder will be patients with
        untested non-squamous carcinoma (CRISP satellite patients). Patients will be recruited in
        up to 150 study sites (certified lung cancer centers, comprehensive cancer centers,
        hospitals and office-based oncology practices) in Germany.
