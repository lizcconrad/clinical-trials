  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the impact of text messaging on physical activity
      in persons with risk factors for peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-five million Latinos live in the U.S. and nearly 14% have peripheral arterial disease
      (PAD) defined as a build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to the legs.
      Approximately 40% have at least one risk for PAD (i.e., aged 70 years and older, diabetes,
      high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, or smoking). Persons with at least one risk
      factor and who are physically inactive are more likely to suffer from severe PAD. Physical
      inactivity is highly prevalent in Latinos and a major risk factor for PAD. Physical
      inactivity affects 50% of Latinos aged 60 years and older.

      Participation in this study will last for about 3 months. Participants will be randomized to
      one of two groups. One group will receive text messages, brief telephone calls, and a
      handout. The other group will only receive the handout. The study will be looking at how the
      different groups respond to the different interventions used in the study.

    <description>Change will be measured using the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form 36. The survey has 36 questions. Scores are coded based on response by participant. A score of 100 indicates the most favorable situation while a score of 0 would indicate the least favorable.</description>
