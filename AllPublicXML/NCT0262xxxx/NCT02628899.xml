      Trial Objectives: To assess the safety and feasibility of Transcatheter Aortic Valve
      Replacement (TAVR) with commercially available bioprostheses in elderly patients with severe,
      symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) who are low‐risk (STS score ≤3%) for surgical aortic valve
      replacement (SAVR).

      Methodology: This is a multicenter, prospective trial of TAVR in low-risk patients at up to
      twelve sites in the United States. The trial will have three arms. The first will comprise
      200 patients undergoing transfemoral TAVR. The second arm will comprise200 closely matched
      historical controls who underwent isolated bioprosthetic SAVR.

      Historical controls will be selected from among patients at the same site who have undergone
      isolated bioprosthetic SAVR within the previous 36 months. TAVR patients will then be matched
      to SAVR patients using STS database variables to perform propensity matching, including (but
      not limited to) age, gender, race, ethnicity, STS score, and valve prosthesis size. Once the
      historical matched controls are identified, detailed chart review will abstract in-hospital
      and 30-day outcomes for the SAVR cohort.

      The third arm of the trial will comprise a registry of TAVR in up to 100 low-risk patients
      with bicuspid aortic valve. The results from the registry arm will be analyzed independently.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint: All-cause mortality at 30 days following transfemoral TAVR vs.
      bioprosthetic SAVR.

      Primary Safety Endpoint: Defined as the composite of major adverse events at 30 days:

          4. The Heart Team agrees that the patient is low-risk, quantified by an estimated risk of
             ≤3% by the calculated STS score for operative mortality at 30 days; AND agrees that
             SAVR would be an appropriate therapy if offered.

             multislice CT measurements

          6. Procedure status is elective

          7. Expected survival is at least 24 months
