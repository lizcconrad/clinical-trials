    <textblock>
      This study will quantify the safety and efficacy of the CardioCel implant in tri-leaflet
      repair. 80 patients in up to 7 sites in Europe and the US will all be treated with the
      CardioCel implant.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the CardioCel for the
      repair of aortic valve stenosis and/or insufficiency. CardioCel is a cardiovascular patch
      manufactured with the so called ADAPT® technology. The ADAPT technology uses bovine
      spongiform encephalopathy-free pericardium which is processed in several ways to make it
      biocompatible with human tissue. CardioCel should provide an off the shelf material solution
      for tri-leaflet repair surgery due to its functional attributes, low propensity for post
      implant calcification, and overall biocompatibility. As a result adverse events and
      complications associated with the autologous pericardium repair surgery are mitigated.

      In this study patients suffering from moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis and/or aortic
      insufficiency will be included.

      In this study 80 patients will be enrolled in up to 7 centers in Europe and the US. The
      expected study duration is 36 months; 12 months of recruitment and 24 months follow-up.

      CardioCel is US FDA cleared for the repair of cardiac and vascular defects, including
      intra-cardiac defects; septal defects, valve and annulus repair, great vessel reconstruction,
      peripheral vascular reconstruction, suture line buttressing and pericardial closure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject's annular measurements are ≥ 19 mm to &lt; 27mm as confirmed on pre-op echo
             and inter commissure distance equal to or bigger than 19mm as confirmed
