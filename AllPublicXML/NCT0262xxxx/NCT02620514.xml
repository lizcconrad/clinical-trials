    <measure>Change in Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks, End of Study (Up to 24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The HBI is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses IBD severity. A score of less than 5 is generally considered to represent clinical remission. A score of 8 to 9 or higher are considered severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Change in Simple Colitis Activity Index (SCAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks, End of Study (Up to 24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SCAI is a way of scoring disease activity in Ulcerative Colitis based on six simple questions about symptoms that gives a number between 0-19 that corresponds to the severity of disease activity. This index gives more detailed information on how active disease is using a number.</description>

    <time_frame>12 Weeks, End of Study (Up to 24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a fourteen item scale that asks participants to describe how they feel. Scores range between 0 and 21. A score of 0 to 7 is normal. A score of 8 to 10 indicates borderline depression/anxiety. A score of 11-21 indicates a case of depression/anxiety.</description>
