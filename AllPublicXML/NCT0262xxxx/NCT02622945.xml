  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired
      with speech-language therapy is more beneficial than speech-language therapy alone in acute
      and chronic post-stroke aphasia.

      This study aims to determine whether behavioral word-retrieval therapy coupled with anodal
      tDCS will improve the fluency and name retrieval performance of participants with post-stroke
      aphasia more efficiently and for greater duration than language therapy alone (i.e. in the
      sham condition).

      tDCS neuronal targets will be selected in this order:

        1. left posterior superior-middle temporal gyrus (an area critical for word retrieval and
           word comprehension),

        2. left posterior frontal areas found to be responsible for lexical selection if the first
           area is infarcted, or

        3. right cerebellum (important for learning, and consistently activated in naming task) if
           both of the other areas are infarcted.

      The same areas will be stimulated during the first tDCS and sham periods. If the participant
      returns for a second period of tDCS and sham with language therapy, the right cerebellum will
      be stimulated (if it was the only uninfarcted target area investigators will stimulate this
      area again). For cerebellar stimulation, either anodal or cathodal will be used as studies
      show that anodal or cathodal stimulation has an effect on cognitive functions.

    <description>Stimulation will be delivered by a battery-driven constant current stimulator. The electrical current will be administered to a pre-specified region of the brain not affected by the lesion(perilesional areas, right hemisphere or cerebellum). The stimulation will be delivered at an intensity of 2mA (estimated current density 0.04 mA/cm2; estimated total charge 0.048C/cm2) in a ramp-like fashion for a maximum of 20 minutes. Speech-language therapy will be oral and written naming.</description>
