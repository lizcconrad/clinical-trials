      Objectives: To evaluate the effects of eight weeks of cognitive motor training (dual task) in
      the risk of falls, balance, independence in basic activities of daily living (BADL) and
      handgrip in institutionalized elderly.

      Methods: The sample was divided in two groups: double task group (DTG), consists of five
      elderly, undergoing a training consists of motor and cognitive activities and control group
      (CG) consists of four seniors who underwent conventional kinesiotherapeutic training, based
      on global stretching and strengthening exercises, both held in 16 sessions.

      Experimental, prospective and quantitative study, whose sample was selected for convenience
      in a long-term care institution for the elderly (LTCF) in the city of Uberaba - MG. The
      volunteers were divided into two groups, named dual task group (DTG) consists of five
      seniors, and control group (CG) consists of four elderly. All participants of both groups
      answered a questionnaire with sociodemographic and economic characteristics of the sample.
      Participants underwent a pre- and post evaluation containing vital signs parameters (blood
      pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate), anthropometric data (weight and height) and
      different tests to evaluate the balance, functional mobility, risk of falls, muscle strength
      and independence to carry out basic activities of daily living. The performed tests were
      Timed Up and Go (TUG) conventional, motor TUG and TUG cognitive, beyond Romberg test and
      Sensitized Romberg, Berg Balance Scale, and modified Katz scale (with maintenance of the six
      original activities of the scale, but with simulation to the performance of each task,
      measuring the spent time).
