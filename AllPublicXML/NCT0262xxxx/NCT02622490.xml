  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty participants without serious concomitant diseases consume either a high- or a low
      carb. meal either as one single meal or as 5 small portions in the morning and are tested for
      effects on major cardiovascular risk markers and on metabolic rate for three hours on each
      occasion.

      Thirty participants come to the metabolic ward at about 8 o´clock in the fasting state and
      stay until lunch on four occasions each. The participants are randomized to the order of the
      test meals. The meals have a total caloric content of 750 kcal and have either 50% of energy
      from carbohydrates (low fat) or 20% of energy from carbohydrates (low carb.). The meals are
      consumed on one occasion in the morning or divided in 5 portions (150 kcal each) for every 30
      minutes, i.e. total combinations of meal composition and of meal distribution is 4. Effects
      of the food on p-glucose, s-insulin, blood-lipids, hormones and on metabolic rate is measured
      by blood tests or by indirect calorimetry (for metabolic rate). Sense of satiety is measured
      by visual analogue scales.
