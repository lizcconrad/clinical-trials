      Uterine fibroids are a very common finding in women of reproductive age. But may fibroids
      grow in the first trimester pregnancy.

      Clinically has shown that:

      Uterine fibroids are associated with an Heavy or prolonged menstrual periods. Abnormal
      bleeding between menstrual periods.

      Uterine fibroids are associated with an increased rate of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm
      labor, placenta abruption, malpresentation, labor dystocia, cesarean delivery, and postpartum
      hemorrhage, pain is the most common complication of fibroids during pregnancy. Can usually be
      controlled by conservative treatment on Dydrogesterone Multivitamin nature.
