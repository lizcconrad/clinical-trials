      To assess the relationship between ovarian endometrioma and lower urinary tract symptoms,
      sexual function and gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, the investigators also assess the
      impact of surgeries for ovarian endometrioma on lower urinary tract symptoms, sexual function
      and gastrointestinal symptoms.

      All patients were found to have ovarian endometrioma were invited to participate in this
      study. The size and location of ovarian endometrioma should be assessed by ultrasonography.
      Besides, all enrolled female patients will be asked to complete overactive bladder symptom
      score, female bladder function, female sexual function, and bowel incontinence assessment
      questionnaires and CA125 level. In addition, patients who underwent surgeries for ovarian
      endometrioma will be requested to complete the above questionnaires and CA125 check-up at 3 &amp;
      6 months after surgery. At least 30 women with age and body mass index matched and without
      ovarian endometrioma will be invited to participate in this study as the control group.
