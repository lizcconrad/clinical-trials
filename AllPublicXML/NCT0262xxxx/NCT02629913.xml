  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Swiss company mementor has recently developed an interactive self-help intervention for
      the treatment of insomnia entitled mementor somnium. This programme is based on the
      guidelines for cognitive-behavioural therapy. mementor somnium consists of 6 online sessions.
      An animated personal sleep coach provides relevant audio-information and asks questions to
      which the patient is invited to respond. The components of the programme flexibly adapt to
      the patient's responses. Aside from psycho-education, exercises and an instruction for sleep
      restriction, mementor somnium includes a cognitive restructuring intervention in terms of a
      Socratic dialogue. This Socratic dialogue, implemented by the animated sleep coach, is based
      on a complex algorithm in the shape of an decision tree. University of Zurich's Department of
      Psychology in Switzerland will test the effectiveness of mementor somnium in a randomised
      controlled trial with three assessment times (pre, 6-weeks post and 3-months follow-up).
      Patients suffering from insomnia will be allocated randomly to either the active intervention
      group or the waitlist control group. Participants will have access to the programme mementor
      somnium for six weeks. Primary outcome measure is the Insomnia Severity Index, secondary
      outcome measures are Beck Depressions-Inventory revised (BDI-II), Brief Symptom Inventory 18,
      and the SF-12 Health Survey. Additionally, sleep diary data will be collected.
