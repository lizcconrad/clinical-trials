      BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess pulmonary deposition and distribution of
      radio-aerosol in obese and normal women, using 2-D planar scintigraphy. METHODS: after
      inhaling an aerosol of technetium labeled diethylenetriamine penteacetic acid (99mTc - DTPA)
      with an activity of 1 mCi in a total dose volume with normal saline of 2,5 ml using a
      vibrating mesh inhaler.

      BACKGROUND: Obese asthmatics are difficult to treat effectively, worse asthma control, and do
      not respond as well to standard therapy as lean asthmatic. Medical aerosols an important
      route of drug delivery in asthma, but narrowing in the airway cause by the obesity, can
      provoke turbulence and the effectiveness of the treatment could be compromise.

      AIM: To assess pulmonary deposition, distribution of radio-aerosol and analyze upper way
      dimension in obese and normal weight women, using 2-D planar scintigraphyand and computed
      tomography. METHODS: 20 obese women, 10 asthmatics and 10 non-asthmatics took part of the
      first part of the study. Anthropometric and clinical assessments were carried out, than lung
      function was performed. After randomization of the sequence of gas (sequence 1- oxygen and
      heliox; sequence 2-heliox and heliox) that would be used to inhale an aerosol with technetium
      labeled diethylenetriamine penteacetic acid (99mTc - DTPA) with an activity of 1 mCi in a
      total dose volume with normal saline of 2,5 ml using a vibrating mesh inhaler. All patients
      inhaled two times with one week of washout between then to eliminate risk of residual trace
      radiation and to avoid the possibility of bias.
