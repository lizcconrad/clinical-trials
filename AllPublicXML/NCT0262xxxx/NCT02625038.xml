      Target of the study is to evaluate the reduction accuracy of 3D computer-planned osteotomies
      that are performed with patient-specific instruments.

      Due to the higher accuracy achieved it is expected that complaints can be resolved or
      effectively revealed. The Research hypothesis to prove is &quot;The medical product permits the
      surgical reduction of deformed bones of the hand and forearm (radius, ulna, distal humerus,
      carpal, metacarpal, and finger bones) by corrective osteotomy within an accuracy of 2 mm and
      2ยบ. Secondary outcome is an assessment of the surgical outcome using the &quot;Disabilities of the
      Arm, Shoulder and Hand&quot; (DASH) and the &quot;Patient related wrist Evaluation&quot; (PRWE) scores.
