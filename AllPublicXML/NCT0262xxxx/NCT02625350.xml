  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycemic index is commonly used as a method to determine the effect of a food to blood
      glucose. Despite its carbohydrate and fat content, instant noodle is very popular in Asia,
      including Indonesia. Based on the serving method, there are instant noodle without and with
      soup. Studies have shown that water content of a meal may influence glycemic response of the
      meal and thus have an effect on the result of GI measurement. However none specifically
      studied instant noodles nor the additional water content as soup (not incorporated in the
      food matrix). Therefore, this study aims to determine whether the serving method of instant
      noodle (with and without soup) may influence the glycemic response and glycemic index value
      of the meal.
