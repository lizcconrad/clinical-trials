  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor is expressed in gastric cancer, and expression has been
      associated with more aggressive clinical disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor
      expression has been noted in 51% of gastric cancer specimens in one series (versus no
      expression in normal epithelium or superficial gastritis). Vascular endothelial growth factor
      expression in resected gastric cancer is associated with tumor recurrence and shorter
      survival. Maeda et al. studied 95 gastric cancer patients following resection with curative
      intent, and noted a significantly shorter survival in 34 patients whose tumor endothelium
      expressed VEGF (as detected via immunohistochemistry) versus 61 patients without endothelial
      VEGF expression (p&lt;0.05). Yoshikawa and colleagues observed similar survival differences in
      resected gastric cancer patients based on levels of circulating (plasma) VEGF at time of
      resection. Circulating VEGF is significantly higher in gastric cancer patients versus those
      without neoplasia. Elevated circulating VEGF was also associated with shorter survival in a
      European cohort undergoing gastric cancer resection; there was no survival beyond 30 months
      in 24 patients with serum VEGF &gt;533 pg/mL versus a 30-month survival rate &gt;35% for 34
      patients with VEGF levels below this threshold (p&lt;0.0001, log-rank test). Recently, Jüttner
      and colleagues noted reduced survival following R0 resection in gastric cancer patients whose
      tumors expressed VEGF-C or VEGF-D, with the most robust association between expression and
      reduced survival for patients whose tumors expressed both VEGF-C and VEGF-D.

      Investigational inhibition of VEGF Receptor 2 in gastric cancer xenografts (TMK-1 cell line)
      is associated with reduced tumor growth. DC101 therapy in this model is associated with
      significant reductions in tumor vascularity (as measured by CD-31 expression) and increases
      in endothelial and tumor apoptosis.

      The results of the REGARD and RAINBOW studies are consistent with the idea that tumor-
      related angiogenesis contributes to the pathophysiology of gastric cancer and demonstrate the
      ability of ramucirumab to represent an improvement in the care of patients with gastric
      cancer whose disease has progressed after prior chemotherapy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed gastric carcinoma, including
             gastric adenocarcinoma or GEJ adenocarcinoma. (Patients with adenocarcinoma of the
             distal esophagus are eligible if the primary tumor involves the GEJ.)

          2. The patient has metastatic disease or locally recurrent, unresectable disease.

          3. The patient has measureable or evaluable disease as determined by standard computed
             tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. Examples of evaluable,
             nonmeasurable disease include gastric, peritoneal, or mesenteric thickening in areas
             of known disease, or peritoneal nodules that are too small to be considered measurable
             by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) (48).

          4. The patient has experienced disease progression during treatment or within 4 months
             after the last dose of first-line therapy for metastatic disease.

               -  Acceptable prior chemotherapy regimens for this protocol are combination
                  chemotherapy regimens that include platinum and/or fluoropyrimidine components
                  (acceptable prior platinum agents are cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin;
                  acceptable prior fluoropyrimidine agents are 5-FU, capecitabine, or S-1).
                  Regimens including a third agent, such as an anthracycline or a taxane, are
                  acceptable provided a fluoropyrimidine and/or a platinum were used.

               -  Recurrence during or within 6 months of completion of adjuvant chemotherapy
                  (capecitabine, 5-FU, or TS-1) will be considered as first-line chemotherapy.

          5. The patient's disease is not amenable to potentially curative resection.

          6. The patient is ≥18 years of age.

          7. The patient has resolution to Grade ≤1 (or to Grade ≤2 in the case of neuropathy) by
             the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-
             CTCAE), Version 4.03, of all clinically significant toxic effects of prior
             chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy (with the exception of
             alopecia).

          8. The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)
             score of 0 or 1.

          9. The patient has adequate hepatic function as defined by a total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL
             (25.65 µmol/L), and aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN; or 5.0 times the ULN in the setting of liver
             metastases).

         10. The patient does not have:

               -  cirrhosis at a level of Child-Pugh B (or worse) or

               -  cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically
                  meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis. Clinically meaningful ascites is
                  defined as ascites from cirrhosis requiring diuretics or paracentesis.

         11. The patient has adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤1.5 times
             the ULN, or creatinine clearance (measured via 24-hour urine collection) ≥40 mL/minute
             (that is, if serum creatinine is &gt;1.5 times the ULN, a 24-hour urine collection to
             calculate creatinine clearance must be performed).

         12. The patient's urinary protein is ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA; if urine
             dipstick or routine analysis is ≥2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must
             demonstrate &lt;1000 mg of protein in 24 hours to allow participation in this protocol).

         13. The patient has adequate hematologic function, as evidenced by an absolute neutrophil
             count (ANC) ≥1000/µL, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (5.58 mmol/L), and platelets ≥100,000/µL.

         14. The patient must have adequate coagulation function as defined by international
             normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤5 seconds above
             the ULN (unless receiving anticoagulation therapy). Patients on full-dose
             anticoagulation must be on a stable dose (minimum duration 14 days) of oral
             anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin. If receiving warfarin, the patient must
             have an INR ≤3.0 and no active bleeding (that is, no bleeding within 14 days prior to
             first dose of protocol therapy) or pathological condition present that carries a high
             risk of bleeding (for example, tumor involving major vessels or known varices).
             Patients on anticoagulation therapy with unresected primary tumors or local tumor
             recurrence following resection are not eligible.

         15. If the patient has received prior anthracycline therapy as part of his or her
             first-line regimen, the patient is able to engage in ordinary physical activity
             without significant fatigue or dyspnea (equivalent to New York Heart Association Class
             I function) (49).

         16. Because the teratogenicity of ramucirumab is not known, the patient, if sexually
             active, must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using effective contraception
             (hormonal or barrier methods).

         17. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to enrollment.

         18. The patient is able to provide informed written consent.

          1. The patient has documented and/or symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

             limit compliance with treatment.

          6. The patient has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension (&gt;160 mmHg systolic or
             &gt;100 mmHg diastolic for &gt;4 weeks) despite standard medical management.

          7. The patient has a serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days
             prior to enrollment.
