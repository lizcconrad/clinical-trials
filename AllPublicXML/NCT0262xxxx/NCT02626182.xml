    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the ability of the drug sildenafil to improved exercise capacity,
      cardiac performance during exercise, and quality of life in patients with moderate to severe
      CF lung disease. 3/4 of the subjects will receive sildenafil and 1/4 will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over time, patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) develop disabling lung disease that progresses
      to chronic respiratory failure, exercise intolerance with marked limitation of physical
      activity, and premature death. Despite substantial improvements in care, patients with CF
      often develop pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) that leads to pulmonary hypertension. Previous
      studies have clearly linked severe pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure with high
      mortality in CF. Early clinical manifestations of PVD prior to the development of cor
      pulmonale include shortness of breath and dyspnea with exertion, but the extent to which PVD
      contributes to the decline in exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with CF is
      not known. Early evidence of PVD could be recognized in CF patients through standardized
      exercise testing and echocardiographic evaluation. Identifying those CF patients with PVD
      prior to the onset of right ventricular dysfunction may allow pharmacologic intervention to
      attenuate the progression of cardiovascular disease and improve quality of life. Clinical
      trials have demonstrated that treatment with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor,
      sildenafil, can decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and improve exercise tolerance in
      non-CF patients with pulmonary hypertension. Because experimental and clinical studies have
      implicated impaired NO-cGMP signaling in the pathophysiology of lung disease in CF,
      sildenafil may provide a novel pharmacological approach for treating PVD in patients with CF
      lung disease.
