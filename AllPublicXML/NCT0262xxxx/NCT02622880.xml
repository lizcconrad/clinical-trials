  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of an immune formula , consumed 10 days
      before surgery , on the number and characteristics of postoperative infections for a period
      of 30 days in a group of oropharynx, hypopharynx , larynx and oral cavity squamous cell
      cancer patients, candidates for surgery.

      68 subjects randomized into two study groups: 34 subjects consume the supplement of the study
      and 34 control consume the supplement IMPACT.

      Intervention period will be 10 days before surgery . The consume amount is 400 ml/ day. The
      Subjects were stratified according to tumor location ( larynx and oral cavity and oropharynx,
      hypopharynx) and disease stage (early and advanced).
