  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the potential protective effects of fatty acid supplementation
      through inhibition of platelet activation. fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) will be
      evaluated for protection from agonist-mediated platelet activation in platelets from type 2
      diabetics and healthy controls. Post-menopausal women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
      healthy post-menopausal women will be treated with omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid supplements
      to determine protection from platelet activation and thrombosis in this high risk population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential fatty acids such as omega-3 and omega-6 have been shown to play important roles in
      regulating platelet activation, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated
      as well as their true protection from thrombosis.

      12-lipoxygenase oxidized fatty acids are known to play both a pro- and anti-thrombotic effect
      on platelets depending on the fatty acid. oxidation of arachidonic acid by 12-lipoxygenase
      resuts in a pro-thrombotic bioactive lipid whereas oxidation of the omega-6 fatty acid DGLA
      found in plant oil results in formation of a potent anti-thrombotic bioactive lipid.
      Determining the extent of protection from this and other bioactive lipids produced through
      oxygenase activity will allow for a better understanding of which fatty acid supplementation
      may best protect from thrombosis.

      Essential fatty acids such as omega-3 (DHA/EPA) and omega-6 (DGLA) appear to be protective.
      However the underlying mechanism for this potential protection is not well understood.
      Identifying the mechanism by which these supplements protect from platelet activation may
      identify new approaches to preventing thrombotic events in this high risk population.
