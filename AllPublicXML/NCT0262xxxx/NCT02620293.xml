    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non-comparative investigation to determine the tolerance of Eczema
      Repair Emollient on healthy subjects with dry/atopic and very dry/atopic skin.

      The Eczema Repair Emollient will be applied for 47 hours under occlusion. Skin tolerance will
      be assessed immediately and 1 hour, 24, 48 and 72 hours after patch removal.

      will be recorded), each test site will be scored for erythema and oedema by the trained
      investigator using the ISO 10993 scoring system.

      Primary Endpoint The irritation of the test product according to the Cutaneous Irritancy
