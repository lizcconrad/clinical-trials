    <textblock>
      This is an open mono-centric prospective non-randomized study in patients with metastatic
      melanoma treated with Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibodies (Nivolumab). The aim of the study is to
      identify the immune cells modulations differences between patients who present a complete,
      partial or stable response and patients who have non-response to the therapy in order to
      establish an improving response rate strategy.
