    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm post-market study in patients requiring lumbar fusion using allograft
      interbody spacer in conjunction with map3® Cellular Allogeneic Bone Graft in patients with
      degenerative disc disease (DDD). This cohort study will enroll 80 patients total at up to 10
      sites. After subjects have signed an informed consent, the baseline visit and examinations
      will be completed. Patients will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and
      24 month visit after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Map3 is an allogeneic bone matrix which also contains demineralized cortical cancellous bone
      and multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC). MAPC-based cells are derived from allograft
      bone marrow, isolated from other cells and cryopreserved. Both the scaffold and cellular
      constituents are processed from the same donor but are provided in separate containers.
      Scaffold and cells combined constitute the implant and must be used together. The map3
      implant is available in Strips allograft and Chips allograft configurations.
