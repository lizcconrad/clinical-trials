      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low-intensity extracorporeal shock
      wave therapy utilizing the Dornier Aries in the treatment of erectile dysfunction of
      vasculogenic origin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of men are suffering from the effects of Erectile Dysfunction (ED) each
      year. The development of oral therapies (phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors) has been successful
      for many with the disease. However, these drugs may be contraindicated in patients with
      cardiovascular risk factors (which are often predecessors to developing ED) and are often
      ineffective in patients with other comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. The main
      objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of low-intensity
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy using the Dornier Aries in the treatment of erectile
      dysfunction of vasculogenic origin.

      This protocol allows for treatment of 23 men with 21-75 years of age with vasculogenic
      erectile dysfunction of at least 6 months' duration with low intensity extracorporeal shock
      wave therapy utilizing the Dornier Aries device.

      This protocol includes the application of 5000 shockwaves per session in 5 treatment areas
      with 1000 SW each at energy level 4-5 (energy flux density (0.051-0.062 mJ/mm²), while moving
      the applicator along the penile shaft within the treatment areas. The maximum energy applied
      during this treatment would be 23.35J.

      Conversely, the treatment protocol described within is designed to actually restore penile
      function as a disease-modifying therapy, and is not expected to require a maintenance regimen
      or continued treatments, as previous studies have demonstrated retained benefits at six
      months after the end of treatments.

      Dornier MedTech hired an independent party to monitor data and perform internal audits to
      ensure the precision, quality, and integrity of the data collected. The investigator(s)
      agrees to permit access to study records, source data, and source documents for this purpose.
