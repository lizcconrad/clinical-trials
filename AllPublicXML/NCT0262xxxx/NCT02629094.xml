      Background:

      People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at a high risk of getting visceral or deep
      belly fat. Visceral fat can cause health problems like heart or liver disease. Researchers
      want to see if a blood pressure drug can help by blocking a hormone in the body.

      Objective:

      To see if eplerenone reduces fat stored in the heart muscle and liver in people with HIV and
      increased visceral fat.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 75 with HIV and increased waist circumference. Increased waist circumference
      is defined as more than 40 inches in men and more than 35 inches in women.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Blood tests

      Measurements of hips, waist, legs, arms, shoulders, and neck

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. They will lie on a table that slides into a machine.

      Electrocardiogram (EKG) to measure heart electrical activity

      Transient elastography, a special ultrasound to measure liver tissue stiffness

      A small piece their liver collected (optional)

      Participants will have a baseline visit:

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Blood tests

      DEXA scan to measure body fat, muscle mass, and bone density. Participants will lie on a
      table while a very small dose of x-rays goes through the body.

      Resting energy expenditure (REE). This measures the amount of oxygen breathed in and carbon
      dioxide breathed out.

      Participants will get a 1-week supply of eplerenone. They will take one pill per day.

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 1 week later. They will have:

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Blood tests

      23-week supply of eplerenone

      Participants will have 5 more follow-up visits.

      Participants will have a final study visit, repeating many of the screening and baseline
      tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected individuals are at higher risk than uninfected people for developing
      cardiovascular disease. Visceral adipose tissue is also increased in HIV-infected people
      compared to uninfected individuals. Animal studies suggest that blockade of the
      mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular and metabolic
      parameters via inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride accumulation. We will
      examine the effects of the MR antagonist eplerenone (50 mg daily) on HIV-infected adults with
      abdominal fat accumulation in a 24-week, open-label, proof-of-concept study. Magnetic
      resonance imaging will be conducted at screening and the final study visit to evaluate
      cardiac and hepatic steatosis. We anticipate that blocking the effects of increased
      aldosterone secretion with eplerenone will significantly reduce intramyocardial lipid content
      and hepatic steatosis in this population. These effects may be accompanied by decreases in
      visceral adipose tissue, and improvements in dyslipidemia and inflammation, thereby improving
      cardiovascular health.
