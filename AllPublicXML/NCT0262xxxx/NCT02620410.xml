    <textblock>
      The RELAX-OAB (Treatment of REfractory Overactive BLadder with the AXonics Sacral
      Neuromodulation System) is a post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study designed to confirm
      the performance of the Axonics Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM) System as an aid in the treatment
      of the symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) as well as capturing patient satisfaction and
      quality of life data.

    <description>A disease-specific quality of life questionnaire. The ICIQ-OABqol is a psychometrically robust patient-completed questionnaire evaluating quality of life (QoL) in patients with overactive bladder for use in research and clinical practice across the world. The ICIQ-OABqol is the OAB-q adapted for use within the ICIQ structure and provides a detailed and robust measure to assess the impact of overactive bladder on quality of life. It is an ideal research tool as it explores in detail the impact on patients' lives of overactive bladder. The Third International Consultation on Incontinence recommended that all randomised trials evaluating treatments for incontinence use high quality questionnaires, in particular the ICIQ, to assess impact on patient outcome and facilitate comparisons. The ICIQ-OABqol provides a robust measure for this purpose.</description>
