    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find and evaluate the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      JNJ-64041809, a live attenuated double deleted (LADD) Listeria monocytogenes (bacteria in
      which two virulence genes, which encode molecules that help cause disease, have been removed)
      when administered intravenously to participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC).

    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicenter and 2-part study. The Part 1
      of study will be Dose Escalation phase to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based
      on safety and pharmacodynamic assessments and Part 2 will be Dose Expansion Phase to evaluate
      2 expansion cohorts (Cohort 2A and 2B) after the RP2D for JNJ-64041809 is determined in Part
      1. The study will consist of a Screening Period (from signing of informed consent until
      immediately before the first dose), an open-label Treatment Period (from the first dose of
      study drug until the End-of-Treatment Visit); and a Post treatment Follow-up Period (after
      the End-of Treatment Visit until study discontinuation). Participants will be primarily
      evaluated for RP2D. Participants safety will be evaluated throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with progressive metastatic
             disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, requires initiation of new
             treatment. The assessment of disease progression can be based on either PSA rise, new
             or progressive soft tissue disease (based on computed tomography [CT] or magnetic
             resonance imaging [MRI] scans), or new or progressive bony disease based on
             radionuclide bone scan or 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography/computed
             tomography [NaF PET/CT] scans). Participants being considered for Cohort 2B must, in
             addition, have primary or metastatic lesions amenable to tumor biopsies

          -  Must have received at least 2 prior approved therapies

          -  Ongoing androgen depletion therapy with a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone analog or
             inhibitor, or orchiectomy (surgical or medical castration)

          -  Serum testosterone levels less than (&lt;) 50 nanogram per deciliter (ng/dL) determined
             within 4 weeks prior to start of study drug

          -  For participants previously treated with first generation anti-androgens (ie,
             flutamide, nilutamide, or bicalutamide), discontinuation of flutamide or nilutamide
             therapy must occur greater than (&gt;) 4 weeks (&gt;6 weeks for bicalutamide) prior to start
             of study drug with no evidence of an anti-androgen withdrawal response (no decline in
             serum PSA)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Untreated brain metastases. Participants must have completed treatment for brain
             metastasis, and be neurologically stable off steroids, for at least 28 days prior to
             first dose of study drug

          -  Untreated spinal cord compression

          -  History of listeriosis or vaccination with a listeria-based vaccine or prophylactic
             vaccine (example influenza, pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis
             [dTP/dTAP]) within 28 days of study treatment

          -  Known allergy to both penicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Participants who
             are allergic to only one of these antibiotics are allowed to enroll

          -  Concurrent treatment with anti -Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha therapies, systemic
             corticosteroids (prednisone dose &gt;10 mg per day or equivalent) or other immune
