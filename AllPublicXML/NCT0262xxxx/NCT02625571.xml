  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant minority of children (ages 5-12) display problematic sexual behavior and the
      persistence of this behavior is oftentimes as stable as other child behavior problems, such
      as aggression and defiance. Unfortunately, the only tested intervention protocols for these
      concerns utilize a group treatment modality that is not feasible in most community treatment
      settings. This project will define and pilot test an intervention for child sexual behavior
      problems that is applicable in most settings and can be easily disseminated as a first step
      toward validation in larger clinical trials.
