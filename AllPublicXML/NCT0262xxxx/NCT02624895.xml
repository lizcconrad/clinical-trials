  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national, multicentric, prospective, observational trial. The decision to prescribe
      FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus panitumumab or FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus cetuximab must have been freely
      taken by the clinician prior to the study entry for each patient included. Each physician
      will see his/her patients within the context of routine visits, without any special visit
      being organised for the purposes of the study. Therefore, the doctor-patient relationship and
      patient follow-up are not modified. Physicians are totally free to decide on their patients'
      therapeutic management.

      EORTC QLQ-C30 and DLQI questionnaires will be completed by the patients at baseline (Day 1 of
      Cycle 1), at the first day of every other cycle (every 2 weeks) thereafter, and at &quot;end of
      treatment visit&quot; (28 days (+/- 3 days) from the last cycle). Questionnaires should be
      completed at the start of the visit, before any study related procedure is done.

      Before every cycle, adverse events will be recorded and graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.
      Treatment's modifications in terms of cycles' delay, dose reductions or drugs' interruptions
      will be recorded.

      Concomitant approaches to prevent or treat dermatological toxicities during the treatment
      will be registered.
