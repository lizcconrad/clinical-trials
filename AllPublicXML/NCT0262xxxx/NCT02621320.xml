  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Switzerland. In indoor-athletes as well
      as wheelchair users, vitamin D deficiency occurs even more often. It is well established that
      vitamin D deficiency has a negative effect on health. However, vitamin D supplementation in
      individuals with a vitamin D deficiency has a positive effect on muscle performance. In
      recently published studies with able-bodied subjects, it has been shown that a normal vitamin
      D level (&gt;75nmol/L) can only be achieved with a high-dose supplementation of vitamin D.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on exercise
      performance in wheelchair athletes with vitamin D deficiency . All participants with a
      vitamin D deficiency are assigned to the intervention group and treated with 6000 IU of
      vitamin D3 daily over a period of 12 weeks. All participants who have a normal vitamin D
      level will receive placebo treatment (control group). The physical performance is measured
      three times at baseline, after six weeks and 12 weeks. The measurements include a Wingate and
      a dynamometer test.
