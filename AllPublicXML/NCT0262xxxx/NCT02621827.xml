      This study measures the plasma half-life of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) in
      non-pregnant-non-lactating women, pregnant women at 30 wk gestational age and at 3 months
      post-partum in women who are exclusively breast-feeding.

    <description>NPNL women are age and parity matched to pregnant women. Each NPNL women is studied twice, approximately 3 months apart.
At each study period the participant receives (as the intervention) a single oral dose of stable isotope labeled 25(OH)D3.</description>

    <description>At each measurement, women are given an oral dose of stable isotope labelled 25(OH)D3. Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and on day 21 post-dose. Additional blood samples are collected post-dose on days 6,9,24,27 and 30.</description>
