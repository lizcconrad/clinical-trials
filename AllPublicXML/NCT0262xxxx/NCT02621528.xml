      The purpose of this multi-center, non-interventional, prospective, post-market clinical study
      is to collect real world data on patient outcomes and evaluate the procedural success and
      performance of the Lifetech CeraFlex™ occluders for patients with secundum type Atrial Septum
      Defect (ASD), Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) or Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA).

      This study is designed as a post-market, prospective, multi-center, non-interventional
      clinical study to collect data regarding procedural success, clinical performance and
      cost-effectiveness of the Lifetech CeraFlex™ occluders in patients with secundum ASD, PFO and
      PDA.

      Patients will be recruited in up to 12 investigational centers located in Europe and the
      Middle East.

      To avoid bias in the study population the following measures will be taken:

        -  All sponsor or designee and external study personnel will be trained on the latest
           version of the Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) and related study materials.

        -  Patients will be screened to confirm study eligibility with pre-defined
           inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to enrollment.

        -  This study will follow consecutive screening and enrollment.

      The study will enroll 120 patients. The patient population will consist of up to
      approximately 40 consecutive enrolled patients with a confirmed secundum type ASD, up to
      approximately 40 enrolled patients with PFO and up to approximately 40 enrolled patients with
      PDA resulting in a significant shunt and in need of an intervention. These estimated upper
      limits per therapy group can however be exceeded depending on the enrollment trend, to
      account for a minimum of 10 patients to be enrolled per therapy group and a total study
      population of 120 enrolled patients.
