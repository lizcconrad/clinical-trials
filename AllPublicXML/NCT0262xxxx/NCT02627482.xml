    <textblock>
      Most babies who measure small during pregnancy are born healthy. However, some are small
      because they are not growing as expected, usually because the placenta (the baby's 'life
      support' system) is not working properly. These babies are at greatly increased risk of dying
      before birth, and need to be delivered before they become poorly.

      Scans and electronic heartrate monitoring are currently used to monitor these babies. But
      they can only be used for short periods and don't always provide enough information to show
      when to deliver the baby.

      A small light monitor has been developed that safely records the baby's heart rate for up to
      16hrs by measuring electrical activity through sticky patches on the mum's skin (like a
      normal ECG). The woman carries on with her daily activities while wearing it. Monitoring the
      heart rate over a longer time may help with decisions about the timing of the delivery and
      could prevent stillbirth, the aim of our future study. This will include large numbers of
      women carrying small babies. Before the investigators can do this the investigators need to
      know whether:

        1. Wearing the monitor for 16hrs is practical and acceptable to pregnant women

        2. The monitor can provide useful information on the baby's heart rate at different stages
           of pregnancy.

      Thirty pregnant women whose babies are measuring small will be asked to wear the monitor on
      two occasions, for 16hrs each time. The women will describe what they think about wearing the
      monitor by completing questionnaires.

      The data from the monitor will be downloaded and compared with the woman's medical notes
      after the participant has delivered her baby. Results from this study will be publicised and
      will help with the design of the investigators future study into the usefulness of this
      monitor.

      Study design:

      The study has been designed as a prospective, non randomised, single centre feasibility study
      to determine the acceptability and reliability of the Monica AN24 device, as a method of
      long-term fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring on more than one occasion in the antenatal
      period.

      Objectives of the study:

      The proposed feasibility study aims to:

        1. Assess the recruitment rates and practicality of the study design and protocol.

        2. Evaluate the acceptability to participants of wearing the device for overnight FHR
           monitoring on two occasions in pregnancy.

        3. Measure the success rate of generating good quality overnight FHR data and identify any
           limitations of the technique.

        4. Determine response rates to questionnaires

      Recruitment The investigators will recruit women from 28 completed weeks of gestation. The
      investigators will study each participant on two occasions (2-4 weeks apart). Being a
      feasibility study FHR data obtained during these experiments will not be employed in the
      routine clinical care of study participants whose care will follow standard patterns of
      surveillance employed at the Jessop Wing Hospital (JW), Sheffield.

      Statistical analysis:

      As this is a feasibility study the investigators will employ mainly descriptive analysis. The
      investigators will report rates of consent, recruitment and acceptability of wearing the AN24
      device on two occasions. The investigators shall also report the rates and duration of
      obtaining valid FHR data when the device is worn. The feasibility and FHR outcome measures
      will be summarised and will inform design for future definitive studies.

      Future work and clinical impact of this research:

      The investigators believe that incorporating ambulatory FHR monitoring to the current methods
      employed to monitor SGA could predict and prevent stillbirth. This is the overarching aim of
      our future definitive multicentre study which will require collection of longterm FHR data at
      different stages of pregnancy from at least 500 women carrying small babies. Data captured
      from our feasibility study will inform the design of our main study and ensure that our
      design is robust and that all the potential issues identified in the feasibility study have
      been addressed.

    <description>The AN24 is a portable, battery powered device, developed in the UK and designed to monitor passively an unborn baby in the antenatal period. The device is CE marked and is attached via a cable assembly which in turn attaches to five standard disposable electrodes placed on the abdomen of a pregnant woman. It is intended for ambulatory use in either the home or hospital environment.
The AN24 has had rigorous checks in the UK and has been used in many European countries. No hazards have been identified that could compromise the safety of, or cause harm to the fetus or the mother. The only potential issue identified is a local reaction under the electrodes. Nonetheless, the electrodes used are the standard disposable ECG electrodes, used routinely for adult ECG measurements.</description>

        The Investigators will recruit 30 women with a singleton pregnancy (no congenital
        abnormality) and a customised birth weight ratio of less than 10th centile on ultrasound
        from the small baby clinic, which is provided at the Fetomaternal Unit (FMU) at the Jessop
        Wing (JW) Hospital, Sheffield. Each participant will be studied on 2 occasions, 2 to 4weeks
        apart at their routine hospital visit for serial ultrasound scans.
