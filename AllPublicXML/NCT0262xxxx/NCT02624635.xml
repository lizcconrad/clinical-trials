    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of manual therapy and of manual therapy
      associated with hip strengthening in the recovery of patients with heel pain.

      Heel pain decreases function, balance, walking and can cause change in the movement pattern.
      This alterations can induce a deficit in motor control of other structures as knee and hip.
      There is an importance to compare the effects of manual therapy and manual therapy associated
      with hip strengthening on the recover of patients with heel pain.

      After the initial assessment and data collection, participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of two intervention groups. Randomization will be held electronically in
      http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm site by simple random sampling. Patients will be
      treated for a maximum of 10 sessions, each session lasting about 40 minutes and each week two
      sessions. The maximum duration of treatment is 3 months. A physical therapist will be
      responsible for the screening of eligible patients and the random allocation of participants
      A second professional will be responsible for physical therapy initial and final evaluation
      and will be blind to the interventions. A third physical therapist will perform the
      interventions. The physiotherapist in charge of intervention will be blind to the initial and
      final evaluation.

    <description>The scheme established for that intervention is as follows: joint manipulation passive ankle and foot, myofascial release technique (gastrocnemius, soleus muscle and plantar fascia), neural mobilization (nerve tibial) and stretching the plantar region and sural triceps, following the recommendations described by Mcpoil et al. (2008).</description>

    <description>It will be done the same treatment performed in group 1 plus the strengthening of the muscles of the hip (iliac muscle, psoas, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus) and the treatment schedule established for this intervention is the use of exercises with progressive resistance. Will be performed 3 sets of 10 reps with 30 seconds rest between each set, according to the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM, 2014). The home exercises consist of repeating the same procedures performed for supervised strengthening. The calculation of the ideal individual load will be carried by Brzycki formula, i.e. one repetition maximum (1RM) = weight ÷ [1.0278 - (0.0278 x number of repetitions)] as was used by (Shirazi et al., 2007).</description>
