    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of ibrutinib,
      fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and obinutuzumab can help control chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL). The safety of this drug combination will be also studied.

      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and obinutuzumab
      are all FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with CLL. The
      use of these drugs in combination is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the
      drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 4 weeks (28 days).

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drug
      combination on the following schedule during Cycles 1-3:

      You will receive obinutuzumab by vein over 4-6 hours on the following days:

        -  on Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1

        -  on Day 1 of Cycles 2-3

      You will receive fludarabine by vein over 15 minutes on the following days:

        -  on Days 2-4 of Cycle 1

        -  on Days 1-3 of Cycles 2-3

      You will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over 30 minutes on the following days:

        -  on Days 2-4 of Cycle 1

        -  on Days 1-3 of Cycles 2-3

      You will also take ibrutinib by mouth with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water every day during Cycles
      1-3. You should swallow the capsules whole. Do not break, crush, chew, or dissolve the
      capsules. If you miss a dose, you can take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same
      day and return to your normal dosing time the next day. Do not take extra ibrutinib to make
      up for a missed dose.

      If you are unable to complete 3 cycles treatment with obinutuzumab, fludarabine,
      cyclophosphamide, and ibrutinib, you will be able to receive just obinutuzumab and ibrutinib.

      You will also receive the following drugs to lower the risk of side effects:

        -  You will take allopurinol by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-7 of Cycle 1.

        -  You will take valacyclovir by mouth every day while you are taking ibrutinib and for at
           least 3 months after your last dose.

      You will also be given other standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You
      may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      You will continue taking the study drugs after Cycle 3 on a schedule that is based on the
      status of the disease:

        -  If at the end of Cycle 3 the results of a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate show the disease
           has responded completely, you will receive obinutuzumab and ibrutinib on the same
           schedule described above during Cycles 4-6. If at the end of Cycle 6 there is still no
           evidence of disease, you will take ibrutinib alone for Cycles 7-12. If at the end of
           Cycle 6 there is evidence of the disease, you will receive both obinutuzumab and
           ibrutinib for Cycles 7-12. If at the end of Cycle 12 the disease appears to have
           responded completely, you will receive no further treatment. If at the end of Cycle 12
           there is still evidence of disease, you will receive ibrutinib alone for as long as the
           doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

        -  If at the end of Cycle 3 the results of a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate show evidence of
           the disease, you will receive obinutuzumab and ibrutinib on the same schedule described
           above during Cycles 4-12. If at the end of Cycle 12 there is still evidence of the
           disease, you will receive ibrutinib alone for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your
           best interest. If at the end of Cycle 12 the disease appears to have responded
           completely, you will receive no further treatment.

      If you have side effects to any of the study drugs, future doses may be delayed to allow you
      time to recover. If you are having side effects from obinutuzumab, future doses may be split
      and given over the course of several days.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue receiving ibrutinib for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse,
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      One (1) time each week during Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You may have additional
           blood draws during Cycle 1 if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      During Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least every 2 weeks.

      During Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests every 2 weeks.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a CT or PET scan with contrast of the neck (if needed), chest, abdomen,
           and pelvis to check the status of the disease.

      During Cycles 4-12:

        -  You will have a physical exam 1 time each cycle.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests at least 1 time every cycle.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to check the status of the disease every
           3 cycles.

        -  You will have a CT or PET scan with contrast of the neck (if needed), chest, abdomen,
           and pelvis every 3 cycles.

      During Cycles 13 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam every 3 months for one year, then every 6 months after
           that.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests every 3 months for 2 years,
           then every 6 months after that.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to
           check the status of the disease every 6 months for one year and then 1 time a year after
           that.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a CT or PET scan with contrast of the
           neck (if needed), chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 months for one year and then 1 time
           a year after that.

      Physical exams and blood draws may be done more often if the doctor thinks it is needed.

             enrolled, after consultation with the Principal Investigator, if the likelihood of
             requiring systemic therapy for this other malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%,
             as determined by an expert in that particular malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

             prolongation or familial history of QT prolongation, congestive heart failure, or
             myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, or any Class 3 or 4 cardiac
             disease as defined by the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.

          6. History of stroke or cerebral hemorrhage within 6 months.

          7. Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          8. Current or chronic hepatitis B or C infection, or known seropositivity for HIV.
             Subjects who are positive for hepatitis B or C core antibody or hepatitis B or C
             surface antigen must have a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result before
             enrollment. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. Note: Patients who are
             receiving intravenous immunoglobulins may become seropositive for hepatitis B
             antibodies. These patients are allowed on the study without additional testing.

             does not apply.

             abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator may increase the risk associated
             with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere
             with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate
             for enrollment into this study.

         16. Known bleeding disorders (e.g., von Willebrand's disease) or hemophilia.
