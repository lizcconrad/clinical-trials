  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center BCCA study that evaluates the impact of the Oncotype DX® assay
      on the decision making of the treating physician and the patient. The Oncotype DX® assay is a
      commercially available diagnostic test that aids in a physician's treatment recommendation to
      a breast cancer patient. The study also has a pharmacoeconomic component.

      This study is a multi-center BCCA study that evaluates the impact of the Oncotype DX® assay
      on the decision making of the treating physician and the patient. The study also has a
      pharmacoeconomic component. All eligible patients in which either physician and/or patient
      determine that results from the 21 gene recurrence score could provide additional information
      useful in the decision making process regarding adjuvant chemotherapy or not will be asked by
      the participating physicians to participate in the study. If interested, the patient will
      consent to the study. The physician will complete a baseline questionnaire to document
      recommended adjuvant systemic therapies (pre-Oncotype DX®). The Oncotype DX® assay will be
      ordered after receipt of the Physician and Patient Registration and assignment of patient
      study number. The physician will discuss the results of the Oncotype DX® assay with the
      patient once the result is available and upon receipt of the pre-test questionnaire. The
      physician will complete a follow-up questionnaire (to document recommended adjuvant systemic
      therapies post Oncotype DX®) after the result of the Oncotype DX® assay is known.

    <description>The Oncotype DX® assay is a multi-gene reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test that analyzes the expression of 21 genes, and quantifies the 10 year distant breast cancer recurrence risk in patients with stage I and II, lymph node negative, estrogen receptor positive disease who plan to be treated with tamoxifen for 5 years.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Operable breast cancer with the primary tumour (pT1-3)

          2. Pathological involvement (microscopic) of 1-3 lymph nodes. No minimum number of total
             lymph nodes need be resected. Extra-nodal extension of nodal deposit is allowed.

          3. Her2Neu negative by IHC (0 or 1+) or FISH by current ASCO/CAP guidelines

          4. Patient's tumor must undergo central review at GHI and there must be adequate material
             for the Oncotype DX® assay.

          5. Patient's tumor must contain estrogen receptors (ER+).

          6. Patient must be between the ages (inclusive) of 18-79.

          7. Patient must be able to give informed consent

          8. Patient has adequate performance status (PS ECOG 0,1 or Karnofsky ≥70) and be a
             medically fit candidate for treatment of their cancer with systemic chemotherapy in
             addition to hormonal therapy with no contra-indications to either systemic therapy
             maneuvers

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients have ER negative tumors (ER-) by local or central BCCA assessment

          2. Patients have HER2 positive tumors by local or central BCCA assessment

          3. Patients have four or more lymph node positive disease.

          4. Lymph node involvement by isolated tumor cells or cells by IHC only (less than 200
             cells and/or ≤0.2 mm)

          5. Patients have known metastatic breast cancer.

          6. Patients are unable to give consent or understand written language.

          7. Patients with poor performance status (ECOG 2-4) in whom consideration of adjuvant
             chemotherapy or adjuvant hormonal therapy would be contraindicated.

          8. Pregnant women in whom consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant hormonal
             therapy would be contraindicated.

          9. Patients with tumors that on GHI central pathological review appears inadequate for
             the Oncotype DX® assay.
