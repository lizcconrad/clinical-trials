    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in 275 males and non-pregnant
      females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility
      criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and
      immunogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine manufactured by
      bioCSL administered at different dosages (7.5 or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) given with or
      without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and Novartis
      Vaccines and Diagnostics, respectively.

      This is a Phase I randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in 275 males and non-pregnant
      females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all eligibility
      criteria which include screening hematology, chemistry and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
      (ESR) laboratory evaluations. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine
      manufactured by bioCSL administered at different dosages (7.5 or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose)
      given with or without AS03 or MF59 adjuvants manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and
      Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, respectively. The primary objectives of this study is to
      assess 1) the safety and reactogenicity of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus
      vaccine and 2) the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody
      responses to a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine following receipt of two
      doses administered intramuscularly at different dosages (7.5 or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose)
      given with or without AS03 or MF59 approximately 21 days apart. The secondary objectives of
      this study are to 1) assess study vaccine-related unsolicited non-serious adverse events
      following receipt of two doses of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine, 2)
      assess medically attended adverse events (MAAEs) including new-onset chronic medical
      conditions and immune-mediated or auto-inflammatory adverse events of special interest
      following receipt of two doses of a monovalent inactivated influenza A/H5N8 virus vaccine,
      and 3) assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses to a monovalent inactivated influenza
      A/H5N8 virus vaccine following receipt of one dose administered intramuscularly at different
      dosages (7.5 or 15 mcg of HA/0.5 mL dose) given with or without AS03 or MF59. This study will
      span approximately 24 months. Subject participation duration will span approximately 13
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. 2. Are
        able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study
        visits. 3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 19 to 64 years old, inclusive. 4. Are in good
        health. Note: As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute
        or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have
        been present for at least 90 days, that would affect the assessment of the safety of
        subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or
        conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This includes no change in chronic
        prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic
        medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any prescription change
        that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or that is done for
        financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered a
        deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to
        improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or
        appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion
        criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of
        the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional
        risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not
        indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes
        subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no
        deterioration in the subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication
        change, and there is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation
        of responses to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the
        exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria (see
        Section 5.1.2)), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted. 5. Oral temperature is
        less than 100.0°F. 6. Pulse is 50 to 115 bpm, inclusive. 7. Systolic blood pressure is 85
        to 150 mmHg, inclusive. 8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive. 9.
        Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is less than 30 mm per hour. 10. Alanine
        aminotransferase (ALT) is less than 44 IU/L for females or is less than 61 IU/L for males.
        11. Creatinine is less than 1.11 mg/dL for females or is less than 1.38 mg/dL for males.
        12. White blood cells (WBC) are greater than 3.9 x10^3/µL and less than 10.6 x10^3/µL. 13.
        Hemoglobin (Hgb) is greater than 11.4 g/dL for females or is greater than 12.4 g/dL for
        males. 14. Platelets are greater than 139 x10^3/µL and less than 416 x10^3/µL. 15. Total
        bilirubin is less than 1.3 mg/dL. 16. Women of childbearing potential* must use an
        acceptable contraception method** from 30 days before the first study vaccination until 60
        days after the last study vaccination. *Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral
        oophorectomy, hysterectomy or successful Essure® placement with documented radiological
        confirmation test at least 90 days after the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt;1 year
        of the last menses if menopausal. **Includes, but is not limited to, non-male sexual
        relationships, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous
        relationship with vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior
        to the subject receiving the first study vaccination, barrier methods such as condoms or
        diaphragms with spermicide or foam, effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing®, and licensed
        hormonal methods such as implants, injectables or oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;). 17.
        Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within
        24 hours prior to study vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Have an acute illness*, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
        sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination. *An acute illness which is
        nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining is allowable if, in the opinion
        of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, the residual symptoms
        will not interfere with the ability to assess safety parameters as required by the
        protocol. 2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site
        principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study
        participation**. **Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as
        persisting for at least 90 days, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of
        injury, render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may
        interfere with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this
        trial. 3. Have immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use
        of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within 3 years prior to study
