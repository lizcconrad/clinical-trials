    <description>Dose Escalation: RO6874281 will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The starting dose regimen of RO6874281 as a single agent will be 5 milligrams (mg) once weekly (QW). Different regimens may be explored based on the emerging safety, PK, and PD data of RO6874281 and may be tested in parallel. Participants will be treated with RO6874281 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Participants may continue treatment with RO6874281 for a maximum of 24 months.</description>

    <description>Dose Escalation: RO6874281 will be administered as an IV infusion. The starting dose regimen of RO6874281 in combination with trastuzumab will be 10 mg QW. The standard dose for trastuzumab will be a loading dose of 4 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) followed by a maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg from Cycle 2 in a QW regimen. Different regimens may be explored based on the emerging safety, PK, and PD data of RO6874281 and may be tested in parallel. Participants will be treated with RO6874281 in combination with trastuzumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. Participants may continue treatment with RO6874281 in combination with trastuzumab for a maximum of 24 months.
Extension Phase: When the MTD and/or the OBD and/or the recommended dose for further development of RO6874281 is defined, participants will receive the MTD and/or the OBD and/or the recommended dose for further development of RO6874281.</description>

Different regimens may be explored based on the emerging safety, PK, and PD data of RO6874281 and may be tested in parallel. Participants will be treated with RO6874281 in combination with cetuximab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent.
