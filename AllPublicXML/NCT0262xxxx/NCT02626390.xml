      This study examined the feasibility of using implicit and explicit learning approaches during
      gait rehabilitation in the early phase following stroke. It was a double blind trial
      (participants and assessors) using a matched pairs design. Participants were recruited from
      an acute stroke unit, and were randomised to receive gait rehabilitation over three
      consecutive days using either an implicit or explicit approach. Guidelines for each were
      developed empirically, including differences in the amount, timing, and attentional focus of
      therapists' verbal communication. Sessions were recorded and their content analysed to
      establish concordance with the guidance. Clinical measures were taken at baseline and 24
      hours post intervention using the Berg Balance Scale and the Step Test. Therapists were able
      to adhere to the guidance. Both approaches were found to be acceptable to both patients and
      therapists. The findings will be used to design an appropriately powered RCT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving rehabilitation for their first episode of stroke which resulted in
             hemiplegia

          -  Able to give informed consent to take part in the study.

          -  Currently receiving physiotherapy for the re-education of gait (at minimum is able to
             stand, weight bear and take one step with assistance of one person).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of:

               -  any other neurological conditions including previous stroke

               -  any pre-stroke musculoskeletal condition that either: i. limited walking to less
                  than 100 metres and/or ii. resulted in a noticeable gait abnormality and/or iii.
                  required use of a bilateral walking aid (e.g. 2 walking sticks or a walking
                  frame)

          -  Patients with marked receptive dysphasia (not able to follow 3-stage commands) -
             confirmed through liaison with multi-disciplinary team, including Speech and Language
             Therapists where necessary
