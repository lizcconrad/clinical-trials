      Background: In Chronic Kidney Disease patients, it is crucial to begin treatment as soon as
      possible in order to minimize the complication-related risks. Encouraging patients to adhere
      to their treatment plans is a great challenge for health care professionals. Objectives: The
      aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a nutrition educational programme on the
      hyperphosphatemia using the transtheoretical model of eating behavior. Subjects and Methods:
      A prospective Interventional study is being conducted in a dialysis centre with 180 stage 5D
      Chronic Kidney Disease patients who exhibit phosphate serum levels &gt; 5.5 mg/dL. The
      educational intervention consists of lectures and group dynamics sessions performed during
      dialysis sessions. Anthropometric, clinical, demographic and laboratory parameters (serum
      phosphorus concentration will be evaluated and the transtheoretical model of eating behavior
      (TMFB) will be applied pre- and post-intervention.

      educational intervention consists of lectures and group dynamics sessions performed during
      dialysis sessions. Anthropometric (weight, height, body mass index), clinical, demographic
      (sex, age, time on dialysis programme, literacy/schooling) and laboratory parameters
      (phosphate serum levels) will be evaluated and the transtheoretical model of eating behavior
      (TMFB) will be applied pre- and post-intervention. Reduction of phosphate serum levels and
      positive/negative behavioral changes will be the evaluated outcomes. Statistical Analyses
      will be carried out in order to compare the effect of educational programme on phosphate
      serum levels and on the behaviour changes.
