      The study will include 30 elderly patients age 60-85 with primary CNS DLBCL . Induction
      treatment will include Rituximab and high dose methotrexate protocol (containing at least
      methotrexate and one more chemotherapy agent).

      Patients with MRI documented response CR or PR will enter the study protocol maintenance
      phase which will include continous treatment with Ibrutinib 560 mg day until relapse or
      disease progression or occurrence of limiting toxicities

      30 elderly patients age 60-85 with primary CNS DLBCL who will achieve response CR or PR will
      enter the study protocol maintenance phase.

      Induction treatment will include Rituximab and high dose methotrexate protocol (containing at
      least methotrexate and one more chemotherapy agent).

      Patients with MRI documented response CR or PR will enter the study protocol maintenance
      phase.

      Maintenance: 28 day cycles of Ibrutinib 560 mg orally once daily until relapse or disease
      progression or occurrence of limiting toxicities

      Evaluation of response:

      Radiologic evaluation by MRI will be performed every 3 months. Neurologic status evaluation
      every 2 months Neurocognitive evaluation every 6 months

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed PCNSL patients whose age is &gt;60 years and achieved response (CR/PR)
             after first line immunochemotherapy treatment

          -  Tissue diagnosis is mandatory unless positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology or
             vitrectomy are diagnostic with no evidence for systemic disease

          -  No contraindication for high dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) (adequate renal function)

          -  KPS &gt; 40%, ECOG &lt; 3

          -  Hematology values must be within the following limits:

        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/µl independent of growth factor support Platelets
        ≥100,000/µl or ≥50,000/µl if bone marrow involvement independent of transfusion support in
        either situation • Biochemical values within the following limits: Alanine aminotransferase
        (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) Total
        bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless bilirubin rise is due to Gilbert's syndrome or of non-hepatic
        origin Serum creatinine ≤ 2 x ULN or estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (Cockroft Gault≥
        40 mL/min

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of randomization.

          -  History of stroke or intracranial hemorrhage within 6 months prior to randomization.

          -  Requires anticoagulation with warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists (eg,
             phenprocoumon).

          -  Requires treatment with strong CYP3A inhibitors.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic
             arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of
             Screening, or any Class 3 (moderate) or Class 4 (severe) cardiac disease as defined by
             the New York Heart Association Functional Classification.

          -  Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of randomization.

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active Hepatitis C Virus or

             requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

          -  Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in
             the investigator's opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the
             absorption or metabolism of ibrutinib capsules, or put the study outcomes at undue
             risk.
