      Patients will be followed from the time of completion of the SCGAM 01 trial until octanorm
      becomes commercially available in the USA, until the sponsor decides to terminate the trial,
      or until a patient's treatment duration of 2 years is reached (whichever occurs first).

             by the investigator).

          2. For adult patients: freely given written informed consent. For patients below the
             legal age of majority: freely given written informed consent from parents/legal

             test conducted at the Screening visit.

          4. Willingness to comply with all aspects of the protocol, including blood sampling, for
             the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject being without any IgG treatment for period greater than 5 weeks between the
             last infusion of octanorm in the SCGAM 01 study and the first infusion of octanorm in
             the SCGAM-03 study.

          2. Administration of any immunoglobulin infusion other than octanorm between conclusion
             of the SCGAM 01 study and the beginning of the present study. [Note: This exclusion
             criterion does not apply to patients who complete the SCGAM 01 study before treatment
