    <textblock>
      Substance abuse is a growing problem world wide, and treatment of substance abusers in the
      perioperative period, especially for emergency operation is challenging. The objectives of
      this study are to determine the proportions of substance abusers in the trauma patients
      undergoing emergency operation by preoperative screen, observe the differences of consumption
      of anesthetics and other medications during perioperative period between substance abusers
      and non-abusers, as well as postoperative complications, and explore an optimal scheme for
      substance abusers.
