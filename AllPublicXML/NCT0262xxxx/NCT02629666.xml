  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increase of the elderly population leads to increased prevalence of frailty, risk for
      poor health outcomes, and related health and social care costs. Lack of physical activity
      (PA) and established sedentary behaviours (SB) constitute an additional burden, as they are
      related to progression of chronic disease and disabling conditions. An existing initiative to
      battle SB and insufficient PA levels are exercise referral schemes (ERS) implemented in
      primary care, where insufficiently active individuals are referred to a third party service
      (sports centre or leisure facility) that prescribes and monitors an exercise programme
      tailored to the patients' needs. ERS had shown improvements in PA in the short-term, but may
      have limited power to change SB and produce long-term effects. Thus, ERS might be enhanced by
      self-management strategies (SMS) to promote behavioural change. Such strategies based on
      social cognitive theory have been shown to increase self-confidence, power to act, and
      involvement in exercise. In a first stage, a systematic review, focus groups and a
      feasibility study will be conducted. Then, a three-armed pragmatic randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) will assess the long-term effectiveness (18-month follow-up) of a complex
      intervention on sedentary behaviour (SB) in an elderly population, based on existing ERS
      enhanced by self-management strategies (SMS). It will be compared to ERS alone and to general
      recommendations plus two educational sessions. The RCT will include 1338 subjects and will
      have a follow up of 18 months. The effect on SB will be measured as sitting time and the
      number of minutes spent in activities requiring ≤ 1.5 Metabolic Equivalent Tasks, and PA as
      daily counts per minute and intensity of exercise, and daily step counts. Secondary outcomes
      will include: physical function, healthcare use and costs, anthropometry, bioimpedance, blood
      pressure, self-rated health and quality of life, activities of daily living, anxiety,
      depressive symptoms, social network, physical activity self-regulation, self-efficacy for
      exercise, disability, fear of falling, loneliness, executive function, and physical fatigue.
      In a subsample, the level of frailty-associated biomarkers and inflammation, and
      sarcopenia-associated markers of muscle quality will be analysed. A process evaluation will
      be performed throughout the trial. SITLESS will assess policy makers in deciding how or
      whether ERS should be further implemented or restructured in order to increase its adherence,
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness.

    <description>In the Exercise Referral Scheme (ERS) intervention participants will undergo a physical activity program of 16 weeks, with two sessions per week (60 minutes each session). Participants will be asked to perform the activity in a moderate to vigorous intensity (according to each individual's progression) during the central part of each session. Intensity will be estimated using the modified Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion (e.g. moderate intensity activity will be considered as a 4 to 6 and vigorous-intensity activity as a 7 to 9) or with training loads (i.e. ankle weights and dumbbells) corresponding to 70-80% of maximum, adjusted progressively during the training period. ERS programs will be based on a combination of aerobic, strength-based, balance and flexibility activities, with a specially trained PA specialist. These sessions will be always performed under the supervision of the same trainer. The PA intervention is adapted to the participants' functional status.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will undergo the aforementioned Physical Activity program plus 11 sessions of Self-Management Strategies (SMS).
SMS start with a face-to-face session in an indoor primary-care facility. The next 6 sessions are further implemented in a group format. SMS are aimed at increasing self-efficacy in reducing sedentary behaviour and at adopting/maintaining an active behaviour as complement to a standard physical activity program (ERS). SMS group sessions will be conducted during week 3 to 11 of the ERS, after the PA sessions (6 sessions: 3 once a week, 3 once every second week). There will be 4 telephone contacts during the adherence phase, at week 15, 20, 25 and 30.</description>

During the intervention, a health advice meeting with standardized topics about healthy lifestyle and feedback on some outcomes regarding their results will be held twice in the Primary Health Centre (at week 5, and at week 11). Researchers will send a letter or phone call prior to each follow up reminding the next assessment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Community-dwelling older persons aged 65 or above.

        Able to walk without help of another person during 2 minutes, and without major physical
        limitations, defined as a score on the Short Physical Performance Battery (Guralnik et al.,
        1995) of 4 or above. The use of an assistive device will be permitted.

        Insufficiently active and/or Self-report sitting too much during a usual day. Answer yes to
        the following question: 'Do you perform regular physical activity (PA) at least 30 minutes
        five or more days of the week (please only refer to physical activity that makes the
        participant run out of breath while doing it or it doesn't allow him/her to maintain a
        conversation while doing the activity (do not count regular walking)?'

        And/or answer yes to question: 'For most days, do you feel you sit for too long (6-8 hours
        or more a day)? Some examples might include when watching TV, working the computer / laptop
        or when doing sitting-based hobbies such as sewing'.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Dementia assessed with the six-Item Screener. Participants with three or more errors should
        be excluded.

        Unstable medical conditions (e.g. elevated blood pressure after medication) or with
        symptomatic cardiovascular disease.

        Any medical condition which may interfere with the study design (e.g. end-stage disease).

        Refuse to wear an accelerometer (primary outcome)

        Unable to attend during the study period (80% of the total sessions).

        Had participated in an ERS in the 6 months prior the study.
