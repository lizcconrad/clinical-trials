  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The incidence of atrial fibrillation(AF) increases substantially with age and it
      is estimated that more than one third of AF patients are octogenarians. Direct oral
      anticoagulants (DOACs) were found favorable compared to warfarin with respect to efficacy and
      safety ( bleeding) across wide range of ages.

      Nevertheless, the rates of bleeding among elderly patients were shown to increase
      substantially with all anticoagulants. Dose-adjustments of DOAC are not universally performed
      among patients older than 80 years old and currently there is paucity of data regarding the
      actual drugs level among these patients. Accordingly, the investigators sought to investigate
      the drug levels of the different DOACs among &quot;real world&quot; octogenarians who receiving
      guideline-recommended dosage.

      Methods: A cross sectional, prospective study of 120 hospitalized and ambulatory patients who
      are treated with DOACs for AF.

      DOACs blood levels with be compared between octogenarians (n=70) and younger patient group (
      age≤70 year-old; n=50).The cohort will include: 1)Sixty patients on APIXABAN: 40
      octogenarians and 20 younger than 70 years, 2)Forty patients on RIVAROXABAN: 20 octogenarians
      and 20 younger than 70 years, and 3) Twenty patients treated with DABIGATRAN: 10
      octogenarians and 10 younger than 70 years.

      DOACs Pharmacodynamic analysis will be performed using commercial kits for diluted thrombin
      time(DTT) and anti-factor Xa activity (AFXa). Drug level will be measured at steady state(
      through levels) and at Tmax after at least 4 days of complete adherence for DOAC consumption.

      Study End-Points:The study main objectives are: 1) DOACs levels in octogenarians in
      comparison to patients younger than 70 years and 2)percentage of patients, in each group, who
      have target DTT or AFXa ( predicted) at steady state.

      Potential significance of the study:

      The results of the study may provide new data on DOACs levels in octogenarians and thus would
      either support current recommendations or set the ground for further studies aim to optimize
      DOACs dosage in this vulnerable population.

      A cross sectional, prospective study of hospitalized and ambulatory patients, who are treated
      with DOACs for AF.

      Patient population Candidate for the study will be patients older than 80 years
      (octogenarians) and those ≤70 years who are 1) admitted to the Internal Medicine division in
      Rabin Medical Center or to Beit Rivka rehabilitation hospital who are on treatment of DOAC
      prior to their hospitalization \ rehabilitation , 2) hospitalized patients in whom DOAC will
      be initiated during hospitalization and 3) referred ambulatory patients on DOACs. Each
      potential patient will be screened for age and other risk factors for bleeding (specifically
      those that requires dose adjustment such as renal failure, weight, potentially interacting
      drugs) under DOAC treatment.

      Study cohorts

      The investigators plan to assess DOACS levels among 120 patients who will be treated by one
      of the three available agents:

      Group 1) sixty patients who will be treated with the direct Xa inhibitor Apixaban - 40
      octogenarians and 20 younger than 70 years.

      Group 2) forty patients who will be treated with direct Xa inhibitor Rivaroxaban - 20
      octogenarians and 20 younger than 70 years Group 3) twenty patients who will be treated with
      the direct Thrombin inhibitor Dabigatran - 10 octogenarian patients who will receive
      age-adjusted recommended reduced dosage (110 mg bid) and 10 patients younger than 70 years.

      Decision to continue and/or to initiate DOAC as well the dosage, will be on the discretion of
      the treating physician. Patients in whom the prescribed dosage will not be according to
      current recommendations will be excluded, unless appropriate adjustment will be made prior to
      enrolment.

      Informed consent will be obtained from all patients prior to study enrolment. Patient's
      demographic data will be documented at baseline and will include: age, sex, body weight and
      height, comorbidities, concurrent medications, blood test results (complete blood count, INR,
      aPTT, renal function tests, electrolytes and liver enzymes). CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED risk
      scores will be calculated for each enrolled patient. Actual body weight will be determined
      upon recruitment with a standardized, calibrated scale.

      DOACs pharmacodynamic analysis will be performed using commercial kits for DTT and AFXa. Drug
      levels will be measured at steady state (through levels) and at Tmax (the time at which
      maximum serum peak concentration is observed).

      DTT and AFXa will be sampled after at least 4 days of complete adherence for DOAC
      consumption. In the case of hospitalized patient, drug levels will be obtained prior to
      patients discharge. The steady state sample will be taken just before the morning dose
      (trough levels). Maximal DTT and AFXa (at Tmax) will be determined by blood sample taken 2
      hours after the morning dose with dabigatran and 3 hours with Apixaban/Rivaroxaban.

      All blood samples will be drawn when the patient clinical condition is stable and not differ
      from his/her baseline daily status (including stable kidney functions). In addition, an
      adherence to the prescribed dosage of the DOAC for at least 4 consecutive days will be
      assured prior to blood sampling. Accordingly, hospitalized patients may be discharged and
      invited later to the ward for drug level sampling based on the discretion of the enrolling
      physician (for example, in the case of questionable adherence in the last 4 days or to allow
      full recovery from significant change in medical condition).

      All blood samples for the study will be drawn by the attending physician. The blood samples
      (2 tubes of 3 ml each) will be coded and collected in 3.2% citrated tubes for measurement of
      the pharmacodynamic effects, which will be performed in Beilinson hospital coagulation lab.

      The coding system will be based on patients drug treatment. Dabigtran, Rivaroxaban and
      Apixaban samples will be coded with the first letter in the generic drug name and a running
      serial number (such as D-1,2,3…).

      Immediately after collection, each tube will be transferred to the coagulation lab, inverted
      to achieve complete mixing and then centrifuged for 10 min at 3000xg. Platelet-poor plasma
      will then be transferred to a labeled transfer tube and stored at -20°C. The samples will be
      kept in the coagulation lab freezer for two months after collection. Chromogenic anti Xa
      assay analysis will be performed on thawed samples using commercial assay (Liquid anti Xa,
      Instrumentation Laboratory, MA, USA). Diluted thrombin time assay will be performed on the
      samples using a commercial assay ( Hemoclot Thrombin Inhibitors, Hyphen Biomed, France).
