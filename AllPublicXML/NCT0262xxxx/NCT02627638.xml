  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For more than seven years an osteopath has been working in the palliative care unit (PCU) and
      in both palliative care mobile team (PCMT) as a member of the multidisciplinary team. The
      patients referred to the osteopath by the palliative care physicians present pains related to
      cancer, but also to the treatment, in particular to surgery or radiotherapy. The osteopath
      can help with other symptoms such as constipation or dyspnoea. As this approach is provided
      in complement of the medicinal approach, it is not considered as an alternative medicine but
      as a complementary medicine associated to a conventional care. It seemed relevant to the
      investigators to ask the cancer patients undergoing osteopathic sessions for pain how they
      saw this complementary therapy.

    <measure>Thoughs and emotions of patients undergoing the two osteopathic sessions as complementary therapy for pain, evaluated using semi-directed interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>around day 14 (after the second session)</time_frame>
    <description>Once clinical data were collected and symptoms were assessed, all the enrolled patients had an osteopathic session a week during two weeks. After those sessions, they had an interview (scheduled between J11 and J14) with a psychologist. The research assistant psychologist conducted the semi-directed interviews. The interview questions were geared toward eliciting open-ended responses to acquire specific information about the patient thoughts and emotions associated with osteopathic treatment. In our study, we conducted two preliminary interviews to test the quality of the questions we planned to use with the participants. The specific questions that were used during the interview are available on request from the authors.</description>
