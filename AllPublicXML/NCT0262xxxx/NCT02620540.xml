  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective single center study is to investigate if a developed
      algorithm is more accurate than the Broselow Tape (BT). For this study 500 patients are
      required to collect anonymized data (length, weight, age, anaesthesia material used during
      anaesthesia) for achieving a power of 80% during statistical analysis. The main hypothesis
      ist that the algorithm has a better accuracy than the BT.

      This prospective single center study is performed at the university children's hospital
      zurich. Patients planned for surgery in general anaesthesia with intubation, aged 0 to 16
      years and with a body length suitable for the emergency tapes can be included in this study.
      Patient and parental information is performed during the pre-anaesthetic visit.

      After written consent the patient will be included. Patient ÃÅs length and weight will be
      measures earliest one day before data collection. Data collection during anaesthesia has no
      influence on the daily anaesthesia routine and has no impact on patient safety and
      anaesthesia. Patient's data is made anonymous for further inspection. Data is documented in
      Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis calculated with SPSS.

      500 patients are needed for a power of 80%. Primary outcome parameter is length- based weight
      estimation, secondary outcome parameters are length-based age estimation and the correctness
      of recommended anaesthesia material (endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask, oropharyngeal mask
      and face mask). Both tools (algorithm and BT) will be compared with each other regarding
      primary and secondary outcome parameters.
