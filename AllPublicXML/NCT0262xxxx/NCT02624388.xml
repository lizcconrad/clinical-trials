  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toxicities related to pediatric cancer treatment can lead to significant illness, organ
      damage, treatment delays, increased health care cost, and decrease in quality of life. Such
      toxicities are largely due to tissue damage sustained by chemotherapy, and strategies
      designed to limit such cellular damage to normal tissues may reduce therapy-related morbidity
      and mortality. In addition to their in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer effects, naturally
      occurring soy isoflavones have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and have been
      shown to reduce side effects of therapy in adult oncology clinical trials. This study will
      examine the effect of genistein, the major isoflavone component in soybeans and the most
      extensively studied of the soy isoflavones, on short-term side effects of myelosuppressive
      chemotherapy in pediatric cancer patients. Subjects will be randomized to receive either: a)
      30 mg genistein daily throughout chemotherapy Cycles 1 and 2 and placebo during chemotherapy
      Cycles 3 and 4; or b) placebo daily during chemotherapy Cycles 1 and 2 and 30 mg genistein
      daily during chemotherapy Cycles 3 and 4. Investigators hypothesize that subjects will have
      fewer short-term therapy-related side effects during cycles of chemotherapy given in
      conjunction with genistein supplementation than cycles given with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to
      evaluate the effect of soy isoflavones on the short term untoward effects of myelosuppressive
      chemotherapy used to treat pediatric cancers. Newly diagnosed cancer patients aged 1-21 years
      will be registered to the study and informed consent will be obtained prior to any
      study-related procedures. Stratification will be based on length of chemotherapy cycles,
      between 14 day and 21 day cycles. Within strata registered subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      one of two schedules:

      Arm A: Subjects will receive genistein daily throughout chemotherapy cycles 1 and 2, and
      placebo during chemotherapy cycles 3 and 4

      Arm B: Subjects will receive placebo daily throughout chemotherapy cycles 1 and 2, and
      genistein during chemotherapy cycles 3 and 4

      Subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy during each cycle with clinical labs,
      cytokine panels, and physical exams. Drug compliance will be monitored by use of a patient
      diary as well as monitoring of serum genistein levels. Adverse events will be monitored
      starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 through 30 days following the last day of protocol therapy
      (genistein/placebo).

             receiving treatment may not be a malignancy related to prior cancer therapy

         15. Any condition which might be worsened by estrogen, such as breast cancer, uterine
             cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis or uterine fibroids

         16. Any condition, in the investigator's opinion, that would compromise patient safety or
             study outcomes

         17. Anyone who, in the investigator's discretion, would be unwilling or unable to comply
