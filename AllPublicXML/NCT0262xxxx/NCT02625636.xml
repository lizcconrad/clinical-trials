      Primary Objective:

      To assess the tolerability and safety of SAR438544 after single ascending subcutaneous (SC)
      doses in healthy subjects and in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the preliminary pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of
      SAR438544 after single ascending SC doses in healthy subjects and in T1DM patients.

      Healthy subjects:

      The total duration of study per subject is up to 4.5 weeks with 2 to 21 days screening
      period, 1 day for treatment, and 7 days (+/- 1 day) follow-up after IMP administration.

      T1DM patients:

      The total duration of study per patient is up to 5.5 weeks with 3 to 28 days screening
      period, 1 day for treatment, and 7 days (+/- 1 day) follow-up after IMP administration.

      One or more interim analyses may be performed to support decisions for the next steps of the
      study.
