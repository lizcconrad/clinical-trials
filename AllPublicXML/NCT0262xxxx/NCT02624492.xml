      Part 1 (Phase Ib)

      Primary objective:

      To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI 836826 in combination with GemOx.

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate pharmacokinetics of BI 836826 when given in combination with GemOx and to
      investigate preliminary efficacy in terms of the overall response rate based on
      investigator's assessment.

      Part 2 (Phase II randomized)

      Primary objective:

      To investigate the efficacy by means of the overall response rate (PR+ CR) based on central
      review assessment in patients with relapsed DLBCL treated with BI 836826-GemOx compared to
      R-GemOx.

      Secondary objective:

      To investigate the efficacy by means of the complete remission rate based on central review
      assessment in patients with relapsed DLBCL treated with BI 836826-GemOx compared to RGemOx.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed, relapsed/refractory, diffuse large B-cell
             lymphoma (including transformed follicular lymphoma) who have received an
             anti-CD20-supplemented, anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and are not eligible for
             high dose therapy followed by an autologous stem cell transplant, or have
             relapsed/progressed after autologous/allogenic stem cell transplant. Allogenic stem
             cell transplant performed at least 6 months prior to study entry is allowed if
             patients do not require immunosuppressive treatment and have no evidence of active
             graft-versus-host disease.

          -  Patient has not received anti-lymphoma treatment prior to the first dose of trial
             medication: within past 14 days or within time that is shorter or equal to 5
             half-lives of the drug if the last anti-lymphoma treatment contained an
             investigational agent

             lesion/node &gt;1.5 cm

          -  Screening [18F] flourodeoxyglucose (FDG)- positron emission tomography (PET) scans
             must demonstrate positive lesion compatible with computer tomography (CT) defined

             year when used consistently and correctly. Non-vasectomized male patients having a
             female sexual partner of childbearing potential must ensure their partner is using a
             highly effective method of birth control as described above, during the trial and for
             at least 12 months after the end of the trial.

          -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma or known Central nervous system (CNS)
             involvement

          -  Prior history of malignancy other than DLBCL except basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix or breast which has
             been treated with curative therapy. Other prior malignancies are allowed only if
             patient has been free of disease and without treatment other than hormones for at
             least past three years.

          -  Refractory to gemcitabine and/or oxaliplatin

             alopecia)

          -  Significant concurrent medical disease or condition which according to the
             investigators judgment would either compromise patient safety or interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety of the test drug. e.g. symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia requiring therapy with the exception of
             extra systoles of minor conduction abnormalities

          -  An infection requiring treatment at the start of the trial medication.

          -  Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C, or laboratory evidence for a chronic infection or
             HIV infection (test results done in routine diagnostics are acceptable if done within

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the
             trial.This includes the female sexual partners of a male participant
