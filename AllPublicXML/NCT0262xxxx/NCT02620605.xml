      Study the effect of early cabergoline administration in prevention of occurrence or
      decreasing the severity of OHSS in patients undergoing intra cytoplasmic sperm injection.And
      its effect on oocyte maturation,fertilization and pregnancy rate..

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients less than 35years undergoing Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection for infertility
      scheduled for gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist long protocol of ovarian stimulation.

      All patient will receive combined oral contraceptive pills (Gynera, Schering-plow: plough)
      starting from day 5 of cycle that precedes the stimulated cycle .On day 21 of that cycle all
      patients will start to receive Gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist in the form of
      (decapeptyl 0.1 sc daily and continued till the day of HCG administration).

      To ensure that all patients are completely down regulated and desensitized ,trans-vaginal
      ultrasound will be performed at day 2-3 of menses of stimulated cycle to ensure endometrial
      thickness less than 5 mm and no ovarian cysts.Also serum E2 level is less than 50 pg/ml.

      Then all patients will start to receive Gonadotrophin ( HMG) (Menogon, ferring
      pharmaceuticals, Germany) 225 IU (international unit) Intramuscular Injection daily,with
      continuous scheduled follow up of ovarian response by serial trans -vaginal US to assess
      follicular growth together will serial serum E2 starting from day 6 of cycle and onwards.With
      adjustments of gonadotropin dose and monitoring frequency based on patient response.

      During follow up once the recruited patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria (serum E2
      equal or more than 4000 pg/ml and /or 18 or more follicles of 11 mm diameter or more at any
      day of stimulation),they will be allocated randomly by computer generated cards and assigned
      by sealed envelopes by the treating doctor at the outpatient clinic.

      Group A : will receive cabergoline 0.5 mg/day for 8 days, starting in the day of HCG (human
      chorionic gonadotropin ) injection.

      Group B: will receive cabergoline 0.5 mg/day once the criteria of inclusion criteria is
      fulfilled and continued till the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG ) trigger and
      continued 8 days more from day of trigger .

(1992). Moderate OHSS in particular is characterized by abdominal distension and discomfort, nausea±vomiting±diarrhoea, enlarged ovaries 5-12 cm and ultrasonographic evidence of ascites. Severe OHSS is characterized by variable ovarian enlargement; massive ascites±hydrothorax; breathing difficulties; haematocrit &gt;45%; white blood cell count &gt;15 000; oligouria; creatinine 1.0-1.5;liver dysfunction; and anasarca oedema.)</description>
