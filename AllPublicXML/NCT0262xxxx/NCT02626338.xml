        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Confirmed diagnosis of AML, including treatment-related secondary AML (except prior
             MDS) according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification at treating
             institution

          2. Subjects who are refractory* or who have relapsed** following first line AML therapy
             with cytarabine/anthracycline based chemotherapy, with or without a tyrosine kinase
             inhibitor. *Refractory to induction therapy is defined as never achieving CR, CRi or
             CRp (according to International Working Group criteria) after one line of intensive
             regimen for AML (re-induction, consolidation and/or transplant allowed) including at
             least one cytarabine containing induction block with a total dose no less than
             700mg/m² per cycle and 3 days of an anthracycline with or without a TKI.

             or

             **First relapse is defined as untreated hematologic relapse (according to
             International Working Group criteria) after one line of intensive regimen for AML
             (re-induction, consolidation and/or transplant allowed) including at least one
             cytarabine containing induction block with a total dose no less than 700mg/m² per
             cycle and 3 days of an anthracycline with or without a TKI that induced a CR/CRi/CRp.
             Subjects are allowed to receive induction, consolidation, transplant and/or
             maintenance prior to achieving their first CR/CRi/CRp.

          3. Subjects considered eligible for intensive chemotherapy

          4. ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          5. Age ≥ 18 years

          6. Adequate liver function within 72 hours of enrollment, defined as:

               -  Normal total serum bilirubin

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.0 x ULN

          7. Adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL within 72 hours prior to enrollment &quot;Woman of
             childbearing potential&quot; is defined as any woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy
             and who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months

          9. Women of child-bearing potential must either commit to continued abstinence from
             heterosexual intercourse or begin one acceptable method of birth control (IUD, tubal
             ligation, or partner's vasectomy) while on crenolanib and for 3 months following the
             last dose of crenolanib. Hormonal contraception alone is not an acceptable method of
             birth control for the purpose of this trial.

         10. Men must use a latex condom during any sexual contact with women of childbearing
             potential, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy and must agree to avoid
             to father a child (while on therapy and for 3 month after the last dose of
             crenolanib).

         11. Willing to adhere to protocol specific requirements 12. Following receipt of verbal
             and written information about the study, the subject must provide signed informed
             consent before any study related activity is carried out. 13. Clinically significant
             toxic effects of prior therapy (expect hydroxyuria) resolved to Grade ≤ 1 before the
             start of study.

        Exclusion Criteria

             agents, and within 5x the half-life for other investigational agents

               -  Prior use of hydroxyurea or isolated doses of cytarabine for palliation (i.e.,
                  control of WBC) are allowed but should be discontinued at least 24 hrs prior to
                  enrollment.

               -  Other agents used strictly with palliative intent might be allowed during this

          9. &quot;Currently active&quot; second malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia within 1 year). Subjects
             are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed
             therapy and are considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse
             within 1 year.

         10. Concurrent participation in another therapeutic clinical trial.

         11. Pregnant or breastfeeding women

         12. Subjects of childbearing potential not willing to use adequate contraception during
             study and 3 months after last dose of crenolanib

         13. Subject with uncontrolled cardiac disease including congestive heart failure class III
             or IV by the NYHA, unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest) or new onset angina
             (began within the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months

         14. Subject with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical or psychiatric conditions
             that in the opinion of the investigator may impair the participation in the study or
