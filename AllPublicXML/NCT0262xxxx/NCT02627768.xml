  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate treatment retention in psoriatic arthritis
      participants with STELARA or tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (TNFi) therapies in
      relation to effectiveness, safety, benefit/risk and to examine clinical response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, cohort study to collect data on adult participants who
      have a confirmed diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and are starting either STELARA or a
      new TNFi as a new therapy in a first, second, or third line of biologic disease-modifying
      antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) therapy. Approximately 1,400 participants will be enrolled into
      this study, with 700 participants who are receiving STELARA at study entry and 700
      participants who are receiving a new TNFi therapy at study entry. Recruitment into the study
      will continue for approximately 2 years (with the possibility to extend this period if the
      patient enrollment target is not reached), with a 3-year follow-up period. For each
      participant, the follow-up period will continue for 3 years (36 months) after inclusion into
      the study. Participants will primarily be assessed for parameters of treatment retention,
      clinical response, effectiveness and safety over an observational period of 36 months.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) at Month 36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], participant's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0 = no disease activity to 100 = maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement. European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Good response: DAS28 less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 or a change from Baseline less than (&lt;) -1.2. EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;= 5.1 or a change from Baseline &lt; -0.6 to greater than or equal to (&gt;=) -1.2.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQoL Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical economic evaluation of health care. The EQ 5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Month 36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a participant completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis, consisting of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. There are 4 possible responses for each question: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do. The score for each of the domains is the highest (worst) score in each domain. A participant must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains to calculate a valid HAQ-DI score which is the sum of domain scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>
