    <description>There is a study drug dose increase once during the study. The dose increase will occur 6 months after entering into the study. A total of 6 children will be included at each dose (3 children will not have received insulin prior to entering the study and 3 children will have received a lower dose of insulin for 6 months). Further dose increases or more frequent dose increases in individual children will not be performed during Pre-POINT. Escalation will occur in both treatment and placebo group so that participants and study investigators will remain blinded to treatment throughout the study. First dose (2.5 mg oral insulin/day) Second dose (7.5 mg oral insulin/day) Third dose (22.5 mg oral insulin/day) Fourth dose (67.5 mg oral insulin/day)</description>
