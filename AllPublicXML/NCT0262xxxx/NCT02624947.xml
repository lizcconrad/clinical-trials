      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of maternal immunization with the RSV
      F vaccine against symptomatic RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with hypoxemia
      through the first 90 days of life in infants.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled group-sequential design trial
      enrolling third-trimester pregnant women in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, for up to
      four consecutive RSV seasons in each hemisphere. The trial is projected to enroll an
      estimated maximum of 8,618 third-trimester pregnant subjects, but numbers may be smaller
      based on the operation of the group-sequential design, the incidence rate of the primary
      clinical endpoint events, and the efficacy of the intervention. Women in the third trimester
      of a singleton uncomplicated pregnancy and 18 to 40 years of age (inclusive) will be enrolled
      and randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two treatment groups, active or placebo, over
      approximately the three months prior to peak RSV season. After the first global season of
      enrollment, the randomization scheme will be changes to a 2:1 (active/placebo) ratio to
      enable more efficient accrual of the safety database.

      All maternal subjects will receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection on Day 0 with the
      assigned test article, the RSV F vaccine or placebo. Study participation for maternal
      subjects will span approximately nine (9) months from the first dose, ending six (6) months
      post-delivery. Study follow-up for infant subjects who are consented will span approximately
      one (1) year post-delivery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ≥18 and ≤40 years-of-age

          2. Singleton pregnancy of 28 to 36 0/7 weeks gestation on the day of planned vaccination

               -  Documentation of gestational age will be based on one of the following composite
                  criteria. (Note: The Investigator should use the earliest ultrasound data
                  available to establish the study-specific gestational age dating):

                    1. Gestational Age Dating Based on First Trimester Data (data obtained ≤13 6/7
                       weeks): The date of the first day of the reported last menstrual period
                       (LMP) may be used to estable the gestational age if corroborated by a first
                       trimester ultrasound. If the gestational age estimation derived using the
                       LMP and the first trimester ultrasound are discrepant &gt;7 days, the
                       ultrasound will be used to establish gestational age. If LMP is uncertain or
                       unknown, the ultrasound-established gestational age estimation will be used
                       to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

                    2. Gestational Age Dating Based on Early Second Trimester Data (data obtained
                       14 0/7 to 21 6/7 weeks): The day of the first reported LMP may be used to
                       establish the gestational age if corroborated by an early second trimester
                       ultrasound (that estimates the gestational age between 14 0/7 and 21 6/7
                       weeks). If the gestational age estimation derived using the LMP and the
                       early second trimester ultrasound are discrepant &gt;10 days, the ultrasound
                       will be used to establish the gestational age. If LMP is uncertain or
                       unknown, the ultrasound-established gestational age estimation will be used
                       to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

                    3. Gestation Age Dating Based on Later Second Trimester Data (data obtained 22
                       0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks by LMP): The date of the first day of the reported LMP
                       may be used to establish the gestation age if corroborated by a later second
                       trimester ultrasound (that estimates the gestational age between 22 0/7 and
                       27 6/7 weeks). If the gestational age estimation derived using the LMP and
                       the later second trimester ultrasound are discrepant &gt;14 days, the
                       ultrasound will be used to establish the gestational age. If LMP is
                       uncertain or unknown, the ultrasound-established gestational age estimation
                       will be used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

                    4. Gestational Age Dating When the LMP is Uncertain or Unknown AND No Prior
                       First or Second Trimester Ultrasound Has Been Performed: An ultrasound
                       performed at screening within the second trimester (≤27 6/7 weeks) will be
                       used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

          3. Documentation of a second or third (between 18 0/7 weeks and prior to randomization)
             trimester ultrasound with no major fetal anomalies identified.

          4. Good general maternal health as demonstrated by:

               -  Medical history (including history of adverse reactions to prior vaccines and
                  allergies).

               -  Physical examination including at least vital signs (blood pressure, pulse,
                  respirations, and oral temperature); weight; height; examination of the HEENT,
                  cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (abdominal), musculoskeletal,
                  lymphatic, and dermatologic organ systems; and documentation of fetal heart
                  tones. Note that abnormal vital signs may be repeated at the investigator's
                  discretion since these measures may be labile. Vital signs should be assessed in
                  the context of normal values for the third trimester of pregnancy (see the Study
                  Operations Manual).

               -  Clinical laboratory parameters that include:

                    -  For the first year of study conduct in any country, normal/clinically
                       insignificant blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine
                       aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin,
                       alkaline phosphatase (ALP), hemoglobin, white blood count, and platelet
                       count. Note that normal ranges for clinical laboratory parameters will be
                       based on reference ranges appropriate for the subject population under study
                       (i.e., third trimester of pregnancy) and as defined in the toxicity grading
                       scale (TGS) (see the Study Operations Manual).

                    -  For all subjects, serologic exclusion of infection with hepatitis B (HBV)
                       and C (HCV) viruses, syphilis, and HIV as documented by testing (performed
                       at the central or local laboratory) at screening or by medical records
                       during the current pregnancy.

          5. Able to understand, and both willing and physically able to comply with study
             procedures. This includes anticipation of reasonable geographic proximity to the study
             clinic and adequate transportation to comply with scheduled and unscheduled study
