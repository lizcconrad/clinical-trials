      The purpose of the Valiant Evo International Clinical Trial is to demonstrate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Valiant Evo Thoracic Stent Graft System in subjects with a descending
      thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA) who are candidates for endovascular repair. The Valiant Evo
      International Clinical Trial is a first-in human experience with the objective to provide
      clinical data for supporting CE marking via case series and descriptive statistics.

             approved by the Sponsor and by the Ethics Committee for this study

          3. Subject presents a DTAA which is localized below the ostium of left subclavian artery
             (LSA) and above the ostium of celiac trunk

          4. Subject has a DTAA that is one of the following:

               1. A fusiform aneurysm with a maximum diameter that:

                    -  is ≥ 50 mm and/or:

                    -  is ≥ 2 times the diameter of the non-aneurysmal thoracic aorta and/or:

                    -  is &lt;50 mm and has grown ≥ 5 mm within previous 12 months

               2. A saccular aneurysm or a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer

          5. Subject's anatomy must meet all of the following anatomical criteria as demonstrated
             on contrast-enhanced CT and/or on contrast-enhanced MRI obtained within four (4)
             months prior to implant procedure:

               1. Proximal and distal non-aneurysmal aortic neck diameter measurements must be ≥ 16
                  mm and ≤ 42 mm

               2. Proximal non-aneurysmal aortic neck length must be ≥ 20 mm (for FreeFlo
                  configuration) and ≥ 25 mm (for Closed Web configuration)

               3. Distal non-aneurysmal aortic neck length must be ≥ 20 mm

          6. Subject has adequate arterial access site or can tolerate a conduit that allows
             endovascular access to the aneurysmal site with the delivery system of the appropriate
             sized device chosen for the treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 1 year

          2. Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device study which would
             interfere with the endpoints and follow-ups of this study

          3. Subject is pregnant

          4. Subject requires planned placement of the covered proximal end of the stent graft to
             occur in zones 0 or 1

          5. Subject has a thoracic aneurysm with a contained rupture or localized at the
             anastomosis of a previous graft (pseudo-/false aneurysm)

          6. Subject has a mycotic aneurysm

          7. Subject has a dissection (type A or B) or an intramural hematoma or an aortic rupture
             in addition to the thoracic aneurysm

         11. Subject has had previous surgical or endovascular treatment of an infra-renal aortic
             aneurysm

         12. Treatment with the Valiant Evo Thoracic Stent Graft would require intentional

             the celiac trunk

         13. Subject has had or plans to have a major surgical or interventional procedure within

             Stent Graft. This does not include planned procedures that are needed for the safe and
             effective placement of the stent graft (i.e., carotid/subclavian transposition,
             carotid/subclavian bypass procedure)

         14. Subject has a significant and/or circumferential aortic mural thrombus at either the
             proximal or distal attachment sites that could compromise fixation and seal of the
             implanted stent graft

         15. Subject has a connective tissue disease (e.g., Marfan's syndrome, aortic medial
             degeneration)

         16. Subject has a bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, or refuses blood transfusion.

         17. Subject has had a MI within 3 months of the procedure

         18. Subject has had a CVA within 3 months of the procedure

         19. Subject has a known allergy or intolerance to the device materials

         20. Subject has a known allergy to anesthetic drugs

         21. Subject has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants, or
             contrast media, which is not amenable to pretreatment

         22. Subject has active or systemic infection at the time of the index procedure
