      This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label controlled study that will assess the safety
      and performance of the Accucinch System to induce left ventricular reverse remodeling and
      reduce the severity of functional mitral regurgitation in symptomatic adult patients with
      mitral regurgitation and left ventricular remodeling due to dilated cardiomyopathy (ischemic
      or non-ischemic etiology), who are of high operative risk.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Long Term Safety: Incidence rate of the occurrence of the individual pre-specified safety events at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.</measure>

    <description>Pre-specified endpoints include the following:
Death, cardiac, non-cardiac
