      Compression of the abdomen during urography with either a patient-regulated compression
      device or conventional compression.

      Evaluation of radiation dose, image quality and patients' experiences

    <textblock>
      Patients are subjected to radiation from radiographical studies. The nurse can reduce the
      radiation dose for the individual by using dose-reducing measures. One of these is
      compression. It is known that compression in urography reduces the radiation dose because the
      radiation has less tissue to transverse when it is compressed. By reducing patient radiation
      doses, the risk of harmful radiation effects is reduced. This study aims to study if a
      patient-regulated compression device can reduce the radiation dose as effectively as the
      conventional compression, regulated by the nurse.

      Two compression devices are investigated in each patient, in randomized order.

      Aims of the study:

        1. Evaluate if the radiation doses are comparable with a patient-regulated compression
           device and conventional compression.

        2. Evaluate image quality with the two devices.

        3. Describe patients' experiences from using the two devices.
