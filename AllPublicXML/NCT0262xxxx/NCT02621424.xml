  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to is to study if repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves
      cognitive function in patients with neurodegenerative conditions which may manifest as mild
      to moderate cognitive impairment and, in late phase, dementia. This study also intends to
      investigate if the responses to rTMS intervention are either positively or negatively
      correlated with the initial severity of cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary hypothesis is that rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will lead
      to improved memory, language and executive function compared to patients who receive a sham,
      control treatment. The improvement is defined as having higher performance on the California
      Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). Secondary Hypotheses are that:

        -  1: rTMS- will lead to higher performance on secondary cognitive measures relating to
           executive function and naming compared to performance by participants in the sham
           treatment group at the termination of treatment; and that

        -  2: rTMS-induced memory improvement parallels changes in serum and cerebrospinal fluid
           (CSF) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels after treatment.
