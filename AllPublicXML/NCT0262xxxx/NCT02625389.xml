  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is multicenter (up to 10 sites in India) phase IV Post-Marketing Study. The study
      is designed to investigate the safety of Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid in association with surgical
      glues used according to each site medical practice of vascular embolization. Subjects will be
      enrolled with the main condition that a procedure of vascular embolization using Lipiodol®
      Ultra Fluid in association with surgical glues is part of their therapeutic/palliative
      strategy for their disease. The vascular embolization using Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid in
      association with surgical glue will be administered as study procedure. According to the
      patient need and health status a second vascular embolization using Lipiodol® Ultra Fluid in
      association with surgical glue may be considered by the investigator within the next 30 days
      after the first one. In this case, this procedure will be considered as a second study
      procedure. The per-procedure safety evaluation will be enabled by appropriate records of
      safety events during the time frame of the procedure of vascular embolization using Lipiodol®
      Ultra Fluid in association with surgical glues. Safety evaluation will be completed with
      safety records within 30 +/-3 days after the embolization procedure. Efficacy evaluation will
      rely on the level of lesion(s) obliteration after embolization compared to the pre-procedural
      target level of obliteration. Exploratory descriptive statistical methods will be used to
      evaluate safety and efficacy, using both the total population and subsets of subjects with
      similar clinical conditions.
