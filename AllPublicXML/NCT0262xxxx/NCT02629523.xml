      Treatment efficacy of afatinib will be assessed in patients with lung cancer harboring EGFR
      mutations which were detected from circulating tumor DNA.

      Obtaining Tumor tissue or cytology samples are not always available in some patients with
      lung cancer. Recently, studies showed that circulating tumor DNA can be used as a suitable
      substitute for mutation analysis. The sensitivity of EGFR mutation tests using circulating
      tumor DNA was reported in the range of 65.7% (10) to 75% (11), with high specificity and
      positive predictive value. In this trial, treatment efficacy of afatinib will be assessed in
      patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations which were detected from circulating tumor DNA.
