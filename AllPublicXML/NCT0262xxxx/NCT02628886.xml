    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for over 10 percent of death in children under five
      and many of these deaths occur in early infancy before the current pneumococcal schedule is
      effective and nearly half occur in sub Saharan Africa.

      The PROPEL trial will examine the effect of either a maternal or a neonatal dose of a
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on pneumococcal colonisation in the nose which can be used to
      measure the risk of disease in early life.

      600 Expectant mothers will be randomized at between 28 and 34 weeks to a maternal group, a
      neonatal group or a control group in equal number (200 per group). Their subsequent born
      offspring will be followed up until nine months of age. Infants born from expectant mothers
      in the maternal and control group will receive their subsequent pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccination according to the national Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) schedule in
      the Gambia at 8, 12 and 16 weeks while infants born to expectant mothers in the control group
      will receive the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine within 48 hours of birth and at 8 and 16
      weeks of life. Randomization will be undertaken by defined un-blinded members of the clinical
      trial team who will be delegated for this task and who will not be involved in any other
      trial related procedures Pregnant women who are willing and who are identified by the staff
      of the government antenatal clinic as being potentially eligible according to gestation
      (assessed initially according to the date of the last menstrual period (LMP) - if known, or
      the fundal height), will be referred to a member of the clinical trial team.

      Those who remain interested in participation having had the details of the study explained
      will have basic demographic, obstetric and contact details collected and will be invited, at
      a time of their convenience, to the Medical Research Council (MRC) clinical trial site for
      the formal informed consent process to be completed. Following informed consent, pregnancy
      will be confirmed with a urinary pregnancy test. Initial screening (e.g. for past-obstetric
      history and past-medical history etc) will be undertaken at this point along with screening
      bloods for serology (HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis) and haematology (haemoglobin and sickle
      test). A dating ultrasound scan (USS) will also be undertaken by designated clinical trial
      staff. On completion of screening, expectant mothers who are confirmed to be eligible
      according to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized in
      parallel into one of three equally sized groups mentioned above (maternal, neonatal,
      control).

      According to the group into which they have been randomized, mothers will receive a dose of
      PCV13 and tetanus toxoid [maternal group], placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) and tetanus toxoid
      [control group] or tetanus toxoid alone [neonatal group]. From this point on, the maternal
      and control groups (now 'Routine EPI Schedule') will be followed up in exactly the same way
      for the purposes of interventions and all endpoint assessments. Infants in the neonatal group
      ('Neonatal Schedule') will be followed up according to the schedule outlined.

      At the time of presentation to the delivery unit a blood sample for serology and malaria
      Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) and an nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) sample will be obtained prior to
      or shortly following delivery. Immediately following delivery a sample of cord blood will be
      obtained and as soon as possible an NPS sample will be taken from the newborn. Anthropometric
      measurements will be taken from the newborn and an examination conducted. Once there has not
      been any contraindication to vaccination identified, all newborns will be administered the
      routine EPI vaccines according to the schedule in The Gambia (BCG, Hepatitis B and OPV).
      Those newborns in the Neonatal group will additionally be administered a single intramuscular
      (IM) dose of PCV13. At two, three and four months, infants will be administered the routine
      EPI vaccines. Those infants in the Maternal and Control Groups (Routine EPI Schedule) will
      additionally receive PCV13 at eight, 12, and 16 weeks while those in the Neonatal group will
      receive the vaccine at eight and 16 weeks only having received the first dose at birth. All
      infants will additionally receive a single dose of the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV)
      at 16 weeks in line with the routine EPI schedule in The Gambia.

      Following the vaccines administered to expectant mothers and following the vaccines
      administered at birth, home visits will be undertaken on day 1 to 6 to collect solicited
      local and systemic adverse (for PCV only) reactions and any unsolicited. A day 7 safety
      clinic visit will be conducted following the vaccines administered to expectant mothers and
      following the vaccines administered at birth. Infant will attend the clinical trial site for
      NPS and blood samples to be taken at specific time points.

      Members of the clinical trial team will base themselves within the government run antenatal
      clinics at the clinical trial sites in order to identify potentially eligible pregnant women.
      Working closely alongside government midwifery and nursing staff they will aim to identify
      pregnant women who are yet to reach 34 weeks gestation and who are thus potentially eligible
      for enrolment. Assessment of gestation at this first contact point will be based on the date
      of the LMP or the assessment of fundal height as is local practice (gestational age will be
      confirmed by ultrasound scanning once informed consent has been obtained and ultrasound based
      assessment will be used to determine final eligibility).

      A member of the clinical trial team will discuss the study with potentially eligible
      expectant mothers who are provisionally interested and agree to receive this additional
      information. The discussion will be based on the contents of the informed consent document
      (ICD) and a copy of the ICD will be provided to the expectant mother at the end of the
      discussion.

      Potentially eligible women who are interested will be encouraged to discuss the study with
      their spouse and other family members as appropriate. Following individual sensitization of
      the mother, a member of the field team may provide information to other family members
      (particularly the spouse) either by telephone or through a visit to the subject's residence
      according to the preference of the mother.

      Expectant mothers who express an interest in participation will then be contacted to arrange
      a visit to the clinical trial site where informed consent will be undertaken.
      Written/thumb-printed informed consent will only be required from the expectant mother but in
      all cases it will be confirmed directly with the spouse (the father of the unborn baby) that
      they are aware of the study and have given their agreement. In the case of expectant mothers
      who are literate in English, they will be provided with a copy of the ICD but a member of the
      clinical trial team will nonetheless review the contents of the ICD line by line in English
      to ensure all details are covered and that the subject has the opportunity to ask questions
      regarding any aspect of the trial.

      In the case of potential participants who are not literate in English but only in one of the
      local languages, a member of the clinical trial team fluent in the local language (as well as
      being English literate) will review the ICD line by line translating directly from the
      English ICD to the appropriate local language. In this case an impartial witness must be
      present throughout all elements of the consent process and must attest that the information
      on the ICD has been given accurately and in full. The impartial witness will also be required
      to sign the ICD to confirm that this has been the case.

      Informed consent for study participation will be documented on the signature page of the ICD.
      The option to consent for the future use of any residual samples on study completion will
      also be given on the same page but the provision of such additional consent is not required
      for participation in the main trial.

      A certified copy of the ICD is provided to the participant unless it is refused for some
      reason in which case it will be filed at the trial site. Such refusal must be documented in
      the subject's file so it is clear that the subject has been offered a copy The study will
      randomize 600 pregnant women at between 28 and 34 weeks gestation. Mothers will not be
      replaced following randomization. Screening of potentially eligible women will continue until
      this number is reached unless the trial is stopped for some other reason.

      No further selection or assessment of eligibility will be undertaken on the newborn infants.
      All data will be included in the safety reporting irrespective of pregnancy outcome and
      safety follow-up should occur as planned for all infants. An infant may be excluded from the
      trial for the purposes of vaccination and/or clinical sampling if ongoing participation is
      considered to be against their best interests or if a contraindication to vaccination and/or
      to the obtaining of clinical samples is identified. An infant excluded in this way would not
      be replaced and hence this would not alter the target sample size of 600 pregnant women.
