    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if, in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction
      (MGD), treatment with the Lumenis M22 Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) system causes a reduction in
      dry eye symptoms post-treatment, compared to pre-treatment.

      The IPL module has FDA clearance (K142860) for a wide range of indications, including benign
      cavernous hemangiomas, benign venous malformations, telangiectasia, port-wine stains,
      pigmented lesions and erythema of rosacea. As shown by a retrospective study, in over 85% of
      the cases, using IPL in subjects with ocular rosacea also alleviated the symptoms of DED
      caused by MGD. No serious adverse events were recorded, suggesting that IPL therapy
      administered close to the ocular orbits is safe (provided that the eyes are shielded).
      However, the above mentioned study was retrospective. Therefore, additional evidence is
      needed in order to substantiate the hypothesis that alleviation of MGD symptom was
      facilitated by IPL treatments.

      The aim of the current study is to assess the safety and efficacy of IPL treatment for
      reducing the symptoms of dry eye disease (DED) in subjects with MGD. The study hypothesis is
      that in a study population of subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe MGD, 4 sessions of
      IPL therapy with the M22 system, followed by expression of the MGs, will cause a significant
      increase in tear break-up time post-treatment, compared to pre-treatment.

    <measure>Corneal fluorescein staining score, using the Baylor Scheme</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to 3 weeks after the 3rd treatment; 3 weeks after the fourth/final treatment; 6 weeks after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The cornea will be viewed and logically divided to 5 zones: central, superior, inferior, temporal and nasal. In each of the 5 zones, grading will be as follows: 0 dots = 0; 1-5 dots = 1; 16-30 dots = 3; &gt; 30 dots = 4; One point will be added to the score in case of 1 area of confluent staining. Two points will be added to the score in case of two or more areas of confluent staining. The total score is the sum of scores in the 5 zones</description>

    <measure>Meibomian gland score, using the &quot;Abbreviated MGD grading system for clinical trials&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to 3 weeks after the 3rd treatment; 3 weeks after the fourth/final treatment; 6 weeks after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Thickening of the upper lid margin (0-3, where 0 is normal and 3 is severe). A value of at least 1 (mild) is consistent with DED.
Vascularity of the upper lid margin (0-3, where 0 is normal and 3 is severe engorgement). A value of at least 1 (mild engorgement) is consistent with DED.
Number of telangiectasias (0-3, where 0 = none, 1 = single, 2 = two to four and 3 = above four). A value of at least 2 (2-4 telangiectasias) is consistent with DED.
Of the central 10 glands of the upper eyelid- number of plugged glands: a value of at least 2 is consistent with DED. The total score is computed by summing the scores of the 8 categories above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective symptoms, using the SPEED questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to 3 weeks after the 3rd treatment; 3 weeks after the fourth/final treatment; 6 weeks after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>SPEED is a validated questionnaire for quantifying the subjective symptoms of DED. The questionnaire will be filled by the study investigator (with questions answered by the subject). In 4 symptoms are evaluated: (1) dryness, grittiness or scratchiness; (2) Soreness or Irritation; (3) Burning or watering; and (4) Eye fatigue. Two types of questions are asked about these symptoms: frequency and severity.
In the Frequency questions, subjects evaluate the 4 symptoms above on a 0-3 scale: 0 = Never; 1 = Sometimes; 2 = Often; and 3 = All the time.
In the Severity questions, subjects evaluate the 4 symptoms above on a 0-4 scale: 0 = No problems; 1 = Tolerable (not perfect but not uncomfortable); 2 = Uncomfortable (irritating but does not interfere with my day); 3 = Bothersome (irritating and interferes with my day); and (4) Intolerable (unable to perform my daily tasks). The total score is the sum of the Frequency answers and the Severity answers.</description>

    <measure>Tear Osmolarity in milliosmol/liter, using a lab-on-a-chip system to simultaneously collect and analyze the electrical impedance of a tear sample</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to 3 weeks after the 3rd treatment; 3 weeks after the fourth/final treatment; 6 weeks after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>In this current study, tear osmolarity will be measured using a lab-on-a-chip system to simultaneously collect and analyze the electrical impedance of a tear sample (TearLab, San Diego, CA, USA). A small tear sample of 50 nL will be collected from the lower meniscus, using a disposable test chip by passive capillary action, and transferred to the device. Several seconds after the transfer, readings will be given in milliOsmol/L</description>

    <measure>Lipid Layer Thickness in nanometers, using an interferometer</measure>
    <time_frame>from Baseline to 3 weeks after the 3rd treatment; 3 weeks after the fourth/final treatment; 6 weeks after the final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>lipid layer thickness will be measured using an interferometer. In interferometry, when white light is projected over the cornea, a color interference pattern is produced due to specular reflection at the lipid-aqueous interface. The reflected colors from the tear film are captured on a high-resolution video. Each recorded pixel is analyzed, and compared with a color progression table. The output is expressed as interference color units (ICUS), which correlate with lipid layer thickness</description>
