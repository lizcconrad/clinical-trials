  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertigo, dizziness and imbalance are the main symptoms of vestibular dysfunction. They can
      lead to physical consequences, such as the reduction of postural control and falls,
      psychological and / or psychiatric consequences such as anxiety and depression, panic and
      cognitive changes, especially in the elderly. It is known that individuals affected by these
      disorders may improve with the completion of vestibular rehabilitation protocol.Treatment
      protocols can introduce variability of exercises to control the signs and symptoms related to
      vestibular diseases, in order to customize the treatment to affected individuals .

      The objective of this study will be to compare the effectiveness of a multisensory exercises
      protocol of vestibular rehabilitation versus conventional protocol of Cawthorne &amp; Cooksey
      exercises for the treatment of patients with vestibular disorders. Methods: There will be a
      Clinical Trial Random, blind, Hidden Allocation. The sample will consist of 54 subjects
      submitted to two different protocols of vestibular rehabilitation exercises (Intervention
      Group (IG) and Control Group (CG)), to be held with individual treatment once a week,
      totaling 12 attendences. All will be assessed before and after treatment and the main
      variables analyzed are general characteristics of the clinical signs and symptoms caused by
      vestibular diseases, perception of quality of life and functional capacity paras activities
      of daily life, body flexibility, range of motion in the region cervical, parameters of static
      and dynamic postural balance and the perception of the results promoted by the treatment of
      vestibular rehabilitation and will compare the results of the groups. Expected results: It is
      expected, clinically, that subjects who receive treatment through multisensory exercises
      Protocol for VR present reduction of clinical signs and symptoms of dizziness, complaints of
      pains and cervical joint limitations, parameters of improvement related to postural balance,
      aspects of functional capacity and quality of life.

    <measure>Functional Reach test (FRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the mobility test with emphasis on the assessment of the balance. It is performed by asking the individual to stand up, next to a wall with shoulder flexion 90° and upper limbs in extension. Then he asks the individual to conduct an anterior flexion of the trunk, without the heels lose contact with the ground. Performance is measured by the distance traveled by the body's displacement (in centimeters), with the mean of three test attempts.</description>
