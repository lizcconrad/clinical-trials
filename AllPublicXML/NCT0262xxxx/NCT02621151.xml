  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK3475) added to concurrent radiation
      and gemcitabine in the management of patients with muscle-invasive urothelial cancer who are
      not candidates for or decline radical cystectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibition with
      pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 inhibitor, to chemo-radiation therapy to the bladder may work to
      both increase eradication of local tumor as well as distant micrometastases through
      heightened immune surveillance.

      Due to the lack of a previous phase I trial establishing the safety of this combination
      (pembrolizumab, gemcitabine, and radiation therapy (RT)), an initial safety lead-in cohort of
      3 to 6 patients is enrolled for assessing dose-limiting toxicities. Similar to the Phase I
      3+3 design, if there is no or only one patient in that cohort experiencing a dose-limiting
      toxicity, the trial continues to the Phase II part to enroll additional 48 patients for
      efficacy evaluation.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Seasonal
             influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are
