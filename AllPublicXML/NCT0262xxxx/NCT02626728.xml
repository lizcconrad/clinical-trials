  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most recently, the Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS) approach combined with
      single-port technology has allowed that pelvic surgery can be laparoendocopically performed
      from both its abdominal and perineal aspects.Previously, a strong negative association
      between medium- and long-term survival and male gender with narrow pelvis have been reported.
      TAMIS has a significant potantial for improving the quality of the surgical resection of
      rectal tumors in men with visceral obesity and narrow pelvis. This group of patients have
      also a high rate of conversion to open surgery. Focusing on improvement in intraoperative
      conditions and surgical techniques rather than routine conventional procedures may be the way
      to go concerning favorable short- and long-term outcomes. The selection of adequate surgical
      approach to the high-risk patients with visceral obesity and a bulky mesentery may prevent or
      limit the risk for anastomotic leakage and improve oncologic margin clearence. This is a
      prospective observational feasability study of the TAMIS-procedure.
