  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the impact of contact precautions on the rate of VRE- the rate of
      colonization and infection aand hospital-acquired VRE transmissions.

      Hematological and oncological wards in hospitals with a non-outbreak setting for VRE and
      adhering to at least the following standard of care are eligible for study participation:

      Fecal screening for the presence of VRE of all patients within 72 hours of each admission by
      use of a rectal swab or stool sample Follow-up fecal screening once a week and within 72
      hours of discharge Implementation of clinical standards aimed at VRE decolonization is not
      allowed on wards participating in this study, including in the context of clinical studies.

      Sites will be grouped according to their approach regarding contact isolation (see group
      description).

      As a control for external factors a hand hygiene program, including training and adherence
      assessments, will be implemented.

      This observational study prospectively compares wards with different approaches to isolation.
      All screening and isolation measures are already in place on participating wards (i.e.
      constituted a site selection criterion) and are exclusively implemented as part of the
      standard of care. Sites are free to adjust their standard of care as they see fit. No
      intervention will be performed.

    <description>Centers isolating for VRE may only participate if complying with the following standards:
Contact precautions triggered by the initial detection of VRE
Patients discharged as a VRE-carrier must be placed in contact isolation upon readmission
Termination of contact precautions after at least two consecutive VRE-negative consecutive fecal screening cultures
Resumption of contact isolation on first subsequent VRE-positive culture
Contact precautions must encompass the following measures:
Patients: Placement in single rooms. Cohorting is only permitted, in case of unavailability of single rooms
Staff and visitors: Wearing of gloves and gowns when entering the room.
Patients: Wearing of gloves and gowns when leaving the room.</description>
