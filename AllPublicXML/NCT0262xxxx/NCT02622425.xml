    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled trial aims to determine the effects of daily
      administration of a carotenoid-producing Bacillus strain PD01 over a 6-week period on
      cardiovascular health biomarkers, microbiota composition and functioning and intestinal
      barrier function in overweight subjects.
