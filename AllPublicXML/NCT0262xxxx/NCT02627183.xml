  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this project is to determine the impact of atrial fibrillation
      interventions (catheter ablation and exercise training) on circulating BDNF concentrations in
      patients with atrial fibrillation. It also seeks to determine if there is a relation between
      circulating BDNF concentrations and mental health (depression severity, quality of life and
      symptoms) among those undergoing interventions for atrial fibrillation catheter ablation or
      exercise training.

      The main purpose of this project is to determine the impact of atrial fibrillation
      interventions (catheter ablation and exercise training) on circulating BDNF concentrations in
      patients with atrial fibrillation. It also seeks to determine if there is a relation between
      circulating BDNF concentrations and mental health (depression severity, quality of life and
      symptoms) among those undergoing interventions for atrial fibrillation catheter ablation or
      exercise training. Using a pre-post study design, the investigators will explore
      interventions in two subsets of patients at the opposite end of the atrial fibrillation
      clinical spectrum. Arm 1: patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will undergo catheter
      ablation (n=100). Arm 2: patients with permanent or persistent atrial fibrillation will
      perform exercise training 2 times weekly for 12 weeks (n=100). Total sample size will be 200
      participants. All measurements will be performed at baseline and follow-up.
