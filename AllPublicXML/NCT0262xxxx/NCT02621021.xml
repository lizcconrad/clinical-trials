  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Cell therapy is an experimental cancer therapy. It takes young tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
      (Young TIL) cells from a person s tumors and grows them in a lab. Then they are returned to
      the person. Researchers think adding the drug pembrolizumab might make the therapy more
      effective.

      Objective:

      To test if adding pembrolizumab to cell therapy is safe and effective to shrink melanoma
      tumors.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 70 years with metastatic melanoma

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Physical exam

      CT, MRI, or PET scans

      X-rays

      Heart and lung function tests

      Blood and urine tests

      Before treatment, participants will have:

      A piece of tumor taken from a biopsy or during surgery in order to grow TIL cells

      Leukapheresis: Blood flows through a needle in one arm and into a machine that removes white
      blood cells.

      The rest of the blood returns through a needle in the other arm.

      An IV catheter placed in the chest for getting TIL cells, aldesleukin, and pembrolizumab (if
      assigned)

      Participants will stay in the hospital for treatment. This includes:

      Daily chemotherapy for 1 week

      For some participants, pembrolizumab infusion 1 day after chemotherapy

      TIL cell infusion 2 4 days after chemotherapy, then aldesleukin infusion every 8 hours for up
      to 12 doses

      Possible filgrastim injection

      Recovery for 1 2 weeks

      After treatment, participants will:

      Take an antibiotic and antiviral for at least 6 months

      If assigned, have pembrolizumab treatment every 3 weeks for 3 more doses. They may have
      another round.

      Have 2-day follow-up visits every 1 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months

      Background:

      - Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can
      mediate the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with highdose
      aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy

      preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

      - Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 axis,
      facilitates the activity of anti-tumor lymphocytes in the tumor micro environment.
      Pembrolizumab administration can result in objective tumor responses in patients with

      metastatic melanoma and is approved for use by the FDA for the treatment of these patients.

        -  Administered TIL express low levels of PD-1, though PD-1 can be re-expressed on TIL in
           vivo following TIL administration

        -  In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD1 antibody enhances the
           anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine in a prospective randomized trial whether the addition of pembrolizumab to
           the standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, TIL and high dose IL-2 can improve
           complete response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma who have received prior
           anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (Cohort 1)

        -  To determine the complete response rate to the standard non-myeloablative conditioning
           regimen, TIL, high dose IL-2 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with
           metastatic melanoma who have not received prior therapy with anti PD-1/PD-L1 (Cohort 2)

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 16 and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma

        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL

        -  No allergies or sensitivities to high-dose aldesleukin administration

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

      Design:

        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected for TIL

        -  Patients will be assigned to 2 cohorts:

             -  Cohort 1 patients who are refractory to treatment with anti PD-1/PD-L1

             -  Cohort 2 patients who have not received treatment with PD-1/PD-L1

        -  After TIL growth is established:

             -  Patients who are assigned to Cohort 1 will be randomized to either receive or not
                receive pembrolizumab in combination with the standard Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT)
                with TIL (non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, TIL and high dose IL-2)

             -  Patients who are assigned to Cohort 2 will all receive the standard ACT with TIL in
                combination with pembrolizumab

        -  Pembrolizumab will be administered immediately prior to TIL administration and continue
           for 3 additional cycles.

        -  Up to 170 patients may be enrolled over 3-4 years.

             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

          6. All participants and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign
             a written informed consent. Assent will be obtained for all participants under the age
             of 18 years.

          7. All participants greater than or equal to 18 years of age or older must be willing to

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus are less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

         11. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the

             (Note: Patients may

             have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks, as long as all
             toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less)

         15. Patients must demonstrate progressive disease at the time of treatment. (Note:
             Patients who have received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. vemurafinib) may be

         16. Subjects must be co-enrolled in protocol 03-C-0277.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

          3. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          4. Active systemic infections (e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation
             disorders or any other active major medical illnesses.
