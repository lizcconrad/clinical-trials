      Preliminary data from the investigators' National Center for Complementary and Alternative
      Medicine (NCCAM)-funded R21 on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in HIV-infected
      youth suggest an association between mindfulness and improved self-regulation and medication
      adherence. This randomized, controlled trial will help the investigators to better understand
      the specific impact of MBSR on HIV medication and treatment adherence in HIV-infected youth,
      and the efficacy of MBSR in the amelioration of stress and improved self-regulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite remarkable advances in HIV medication effectiveness, adherence to HIV treatment
      recommendations is alarmingly poor, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. It is
      estimated that 26-72% of HIV-infected adolescents are non-adherent to their HIV medications
      and 22-33% are non-adherent with scheduled health care visits. HIV treatment non-adherence
      puts individuals at markedly increased risk for illness related to HIV itself and a variety
      of opportunistic infections, as well as at increased risk of spreading HIV.

      Preliminary data from the investigators' NCCAM-funded R21 on mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) in HIV-infected youth suggest an association between mindfulness and
      improved medication adherence, as well as enhanced self-regulatory processes (coping,
      psychological function, and cognitive function). This two-armed randomized, controlled trial
      will help the investigators to better understand the specific impact of MBSR on HIV
      medication and treatment adherence in HIV-infected youth, and the efficacy of MBSR in the
      amelioration of stress and improved self-regulation.

      The aims of the study are as follows:

      Primary Objective

      Investigators hypothesize that MBSR vs. active control program (HT) participation will be
      associated with:

      â€¢ (H1) Improved HIV medication adherence (self-report validated by HIV viral load) at 3
      months, 6 months, and 12 months

      Secondary Objectives

      Investigators also hypothesize that MBSR vs. active control program (HT) participation will
      be associated with:

        -  (H2) Improved coping at 3, 6, and 12 months

        -  (H3) Improved psychological functioning at 3, 6, and 12 months

        -  (H4) Improved cognitive functioning at 3, 6, and 12 months

      Investigators will also explore:

        -  associations (and potential mediation) among mindfulness, self-regulation, and HIV
           medication adherence and

        -  using qualitative methods, experience with MBSR, HIV treatment adherence, as well as
           reasons for non-participation in the study and non-attendance of program sessions to
           inform future implementation planning.

        -  gender differences in the effects of MBSR versus HT on emotion regulation and
           physiological responses to stressful stimuli.

    <description>MBSR Program:
The MBSR intervention is a nine-week program designed to cultivate mindfulness, a focused non-judgmental awareness of the present moment. It consists of eight 2-hour weekly sessions and one 3-hour retreat and the content includes three main components: 1) material related to mindfulness, meditation, yoga, and the mind-body connection; 2) experiential practice of mindful meditation (sitting, lying down, walking), gentle mindful yoga, and &quot;body scan&quot; during group meetings and encouragement of home practice; and 3) group discussion focused on problem-solving related to barriers to effective practice. HIV disease will not be discussed as a group topic, unless it is brought up by participants.</description>

    <description>Healthy Topics Program:
The health education program &quot;Healthy Topics&quot; (HT) will serve as an attention control group. The HT program is focused on providing age-appropriate health information and education. There is minimal content overlap in the MBSR and HT programs regarding self-care and healthy eating; however, the style, structure, and content of the MBSR and HT programs are distinct. HT participants will receive no training in MBSR or meditation. Topics covered include physical activity, nutrition, managing weight, building health, personal care, understanding adolescence, tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. HIV disease will not be discussed as a group topic, unless it is brought up by participants.</description>
