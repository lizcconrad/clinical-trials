    <textblock>
      Randomized Clinical Trial, the research will be composed of two parts in order to examine the
      research question: a combination of controlled randomized retrospective research and
      prospective cohort research

      Prospective Cohort Research:

      The research groups - families coming for treatment in &quot;Active Maccabi&quot; clinics in the
      Northern Region, Israel. Approximately 30 families.

      Retrospective Random Controlled Research

        1. The research group - families that have completed an intervention program of &quot;Active
           Maccabi&quot; Northern Region, Israel,within the past two to three years. The families will
           be requested to attend a follow-up meeting of all family members in which they will
           answer questionnaires. Approximately 66 families.

        2. The control groups - families who did not participate in the program who have a child
           between the age 7-14 who has suffered from obesity/weight (over the past 2-3 years), in
           correlation with the child in the intervention group. Approximately 66 families.

      Hypotheses of the research:

        1. Status of the weight of the child being treated and of his siblings will be higher than
           that at the end of the program.

        2. Indication of the obesogenic environment of families participating in the program will
           be lower in comparison with families not participating in the program.

        3. The rate of eating disorder symptoms among children who participated in the program will
           be lower in comparison with those of the obese/overweight child in families who were not
           the program.

        4. The rate of eating disorder symptoms among siblings who participated in the program will
           be lower than that of siblings in families not in the program.

      Duration of the Research -Prospective Cohort Research: 6 months of intervention. 8 months
      follow-up.

      Research Instruments

        1. Anthropometric measurements of all children in the family (height, weight and BMI). BMI
           per centile examinations according to age.

        2. An acquaintance questionnaire and demographic details - to be answered by parents

        3. A FEAQ_R questionnaire to be answered by the parents. The questionnaire will examine the
           obesogenic burden in the family. A column will be added for each sibling of relevant
           age. The questionnaire will be valid in English and Hebrew. The psychometric
           characteristics of the questionnaire: Alpha cronbach - validity 0.84; Reliability 0.78
           Trt

        4. Eat-26 (cheat) questionnaire to be answered by the children and their siblings. The
           questionnaire will examine the risk of developing an eating disorder.
