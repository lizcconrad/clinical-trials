    <textblock>
      V-CHANCE is a phase 2, trial exploring the feasibility and the activity of valproic acid
      (VPA) in combination with the standard cisplatin-cetuximab combination in patients with
      recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, never treated with
      first-line chemotherapy. The study includes an explorative analysis of the potential
      prognostic or predictive role of several biomarkers with the aim of improving the knowledge
      of the mechanisms by which VPA enhances chemotherapy effect and of identifying early
      predictors of treatment response/resistance.
