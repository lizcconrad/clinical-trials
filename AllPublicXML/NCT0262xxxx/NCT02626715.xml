  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare safety and efficacy of reduced-intensity conditioning
      and myeloablative conditioning regimens prior to HSCT in high-risk AML/MDS pediatric and
      young adult patients. This study investigates the use of two novel conditioning therapies for
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The primary focus of both the investigators'
      myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens is to reduce overall toxicity so
      that pediatric and young adult patients with high-risk AML/MDS with significant pretransplant
      comorbidities who would have been ineligible to proceed to HSCT previously can now receive
      potentially life-saving treatment.

             menstruating will be screened for HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) by either
             urinalysis or a blood sample in order to screen for pregnancy status.

          6. Patients with any inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (including, but not limited
             to, Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and dyskeratosis congenital) or Down
