  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of bone and joint infections remains difficult and variable according to centres
      and countries. Clindamycin given intravenously and followed by an oral route is recommended
      for the treatment of staphylococcal, streptococcal and anaerobes bone and joint infections by
      the French Society for Infectious Diseases. For staphylococcal bone and implant infections,
      rifampin is a major drug, as it remains active in bacterial biofilm and on quiescent
      staphylococci. For that reasons, clindamycin-rifampin combination therapy is frequently used
      in these infections.Clindamycin is metabolized by the P450 3A4 cytochrome, an enzyme strongly
      inducible by rifampin. A retrospective study published in 2010 on 70 patients treated for
      bone and joint infections showed that clindamycin serum concentrations were significantly
      lower when clindamycin was combined with rifampin (5.3 mg/liter vs 8.9 mg/liter; p&lt;0.02).
      This drug interaction could even be stronger with the oral route, because of hepatic
      first-past effect, ending up with very low clindamycin serum concentration, a risk of
      selecting resistant microorganisms and treatment failure. This latter point is an important
      issue, because clindamycin has an excellent oral bioavailability and is frequently used in
      oral regimens. In the above study, a wide variability of clindamycin serum concentration was
      observed in the group of patients treated with combination therapy (1-12mg/l) suggesting
      interindividual variability. Rifampin induction of CYP 450 3A4/A5 depends on different
      receptor (PXR, RXR, LXRalpha) submitted to genetic polymorphism. Hypothesis: Plasma clearance
      of clindamycin (CLclin) combined with rifampicin (CLclinrif) is higher when clindamycin is
      administered by the oral route (CLclinrif OR) compared with IV administration (CLclinrif IV).
