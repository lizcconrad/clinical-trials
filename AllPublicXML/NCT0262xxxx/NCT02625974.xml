    <textblock>
      This study was designed to develop a better understanding of the efficacy,
      safety/tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
      elimination) of nifurtimox in children with a diagnosis of Chagas' disease (Trypanosoma cruzi
      infection) using pediatric formulations.

          -  Subjects with contraindications/warnings to nifurtimox administration, or with

             or serious behavioral alteration

          -  Subjects who have had previous treatment with trypanocidal agents or an accepted
             indication for antiparasitic therapy (e.g., reactivation of Chagas' infection due to
             immunosuppression by several diseases or treatment with steroids)

          -  Subjects living in housing conditions where there is no active or effective vector
             control to T. cruzi reinfection as determined by Ministry of Health guidelines in each
