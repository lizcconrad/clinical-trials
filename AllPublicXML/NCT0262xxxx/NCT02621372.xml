  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portal hypertension is a common complication of liver cirrhosis that can lead to development
      of esophageal varices (EV). They are abnormally dilated veins within the wall of the
      esophagus that lead to haemorrhage (1). Majority of patients with cirrhosis will develop EV
      at some point, and about third of these patients will have at least one bleeding episode
      because of rupture of a varix . For this reason, screening endoscopy for detection of the
      presence of EV should be part of the diagnostic work-up in patients with cirrhosis. This is a
      very important preventive step for identification of those patients with variceal bleeding
      risk and furthermore, identification of patients in urgent need for prophylactic treatment.

      All guidelines stress on screening endoscopy for early detection of EV in cirrhotic patients
      with portal hypertension. However this approach is limited by its invasiveness and cost
      effectiveness issues of screening endoscopy .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has focused on the use of noninvasive methods to detect patients with the
      intention of avoiding endoscopy in low-risk cases . Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;
      150,000/Î¼l) is a common complication in patients of chronic liver disease (CLD) . So, the
      investigators in this research formulated this study to determine whether platelet count can
      predict the presence of EV or varices which need prophylactic therapy (medium or large size
      EV) in a cohort of Egyptian patients with liver cirrhosis and can identify patients with the
      intention of avoiding endoscopy in low-risk cases.
